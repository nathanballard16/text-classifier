CHANDIGARH: A day after CM Bhagwant Mann and leader of opposition Partap Singh Bajwa argued over the vigilance bureau functioning, the Congress Legislature Party decided to “boycott” Mann in the House for his alleged “threatening posture” against the opposition MLAs. The SAD, too, opposed the CM’s behaviour in the House and, in a memorandum to the governor, claimed that he was “not fit to sit on the chair of chief minister”. Bajwa told the speaker: “After Monday’s unfortunate incident... we thought the CM will have a larger heart and say, ‘I’m extremely sorry if I have hurt someone’s sentiments’, but there has been no word from him. The Congress will participate in the deliberations in his absence. We have come since the CM is not present right now.” The Congress MLAs walked in at the start of the zero hour. Later, when Mann arrived to join the resumed discussion on the motion of thanks on the governor’s address, barring Sukhpal Singh Khaira, they all left. Khaira wanted to rebut the charges of minister Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal but left in protest after being unable to speak. On Monday, Mann and Bajwa had sparred over the functioning of the vigilance bureau. Amid unruly scenes, the House had to be adjourned briefly and the Congress MLAs abstained from the rest of Monday’s session. SAD also demanded a detailed inquiry into the alleged threats received by the editor of a vernacular newspaper and highlighted how the state government was allegedly trying to suppress the freedom of press by denying advertisements to the print media and barring reporters from covering the assembly proceedings.
