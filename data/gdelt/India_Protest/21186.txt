New Delhi: As protests by students against the new citizenship law engulf various parts of India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the legislation does not affect any citizen of any religion in the country.

In a series of tweets, Modi said groups with vested interests cannot be allowed to divide and create disturbances in the country.

“No Indian has anything to worry regarding this Act. This Act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India,” he said.
