Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, while speaking at the 43rd Hindi Samman Samaroh in Lucknow, said that some writers try to divide Indian literature into different camps, eventually leading to misleading the youth of the country. He further said that it is the responsibility of all writers to curb such actions and ensure that such a situation does not arise.

He said that a particular section of the society uses literature to provoke the youth. He said, “There is a strange situation in the country right now. The situation is such that doubt is created in the minds of our youth. And when a situation of doubt arises, it is the responsibility of all our writers that we curb the situation by means of their expertise in the literature.”

He further said, "It is the responsibility of every citizen to give a direction to the society. We should serve the nation through literature.” Adityanath also said that literature is a mirror of the society and that there should be a sense of public welfare in it, while also adding that people are trying to destroy the literature and that strict action would be taken against such people.

His statement came after days of unrest in the state of Uttar Pradesh amid the ongoing protests against CAA. The situation has been very volatile in the state since a while now. To curb the situation, the government had also ordered Internet shutdown in 23 districts of the Adityanath-led state. Massive security arrangements have also been made for curbing of any untoward incident.

The DGP of the state has also said that people have been coming from outside the state and creating violence in the area. He also said that some miscreants were indulging in violence and were provoking the residents of the state.
