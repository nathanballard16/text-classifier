New Delhi: A college professor from Guwahati was suspended for posting a derogatory post on Facebook over Pulwama terror attack which took place on February 14 in Jammu and Kashmir that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF jawans. In her post on Thursday, Papri Z Banerjee, who works as an Assistant Professor of the English department at the city's Icon Academy Junior College, condemned the terrorist attack but also blamed the Indian Army for atrocities on civilians in Jammu and Kashmir, reported IANS.

After her post went viral, right-wing Twitter handles shared the screenshot and tagged her college forcing them to suspend the professor.

"You are put under suspension with immediate effect until the matter is resolved by a competent authority," a letter issued by the college authorities said on Saturday.

Later, Banerjee said that she received multiple death threats and intimidation over her post from different users on social media platforms.

"Continuous rape, lynch, and death threats in my inbox.. Assam Police should go back to the names in my previous FIR if any harm were to come over me.. They would be solely responsible," she posted on Facebook on Saturday.

Many students studying in different parts of the country faced the wrath of the mob after they posted insensitive comments on the terror attack. Reports of such incidents came from Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka.

Few Kashmiris working in private companies were also fired after their posts celebrating the terror attack went viral and were reported to the respective police stations on Twitter. The UP police registered an FIR against one Basim Hilal for tweeting “How’s the Jaish”. The college administration also suspended him later.
