Jalandhar, February 18

Launching a protest march against the recent Pulwama terror attack, around 100 ex-servicemen, under the banner of the Ex-Servicemen Welfare Association, today raised a slogan, ‘Blood for Blood’, in front of the District Administrative Complex.

They said: “We are ready to fight for the country even now. Defence agencies must launch war operations to avenge the killings of the CRPF soldiers.”

Submitting a memorandum to the Deputy Commissioner in this regard, president of the association Lt Col Balkar Singh (retd) demanded that the right time had come when the government should scrap the Article 370 and Article 35-A, which are also a route cause of terrorist activities in Kashmir.

“We don’t need sermons from politicians, we had enough of the same. We need action. The country is standing by the present government to teach an unforgettable lesson to Pakistan,” the memorandum stated.

“The government should break all ties with the Imran Khan-led Pakistan government as the world knows that he had the support of the ISI and terrorist groups, who are working against India and committing cowardly and barbarous attacks on our forces.”
