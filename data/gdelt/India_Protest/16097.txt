Locals protest outside Bihar Deputy CM Sushil Modi's house over waterlogging woes

Locals on Sunday protested outside the residence of Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi over waterlogging issue which has continued to plague Rajendra Nagar area of Patna, after two weeks of heavy rainfall in the region.

Residents of Rajendra Nagar took out a protest march against the Deputy Chief Minister starting from Road no. 11 to his residence which flooded with incessant rains.

At the protest site, people demanded action against officers responsible for showing laxity to end waterlogging in the capital city.

A few streets were completely filled with filth even after waterlogging was cleared, causing dengue, the people complained.

"Sushil Modi lives in this area and still several streets are waterlogged. The government is doing nothing to provide relief", said an angry local.

Rajendra Nagar was reportedly one of the worst affected localities of Patna in recent rains that led to flood-like situation in the capital.

Sushil Modi himself along with his family had to be rescued by the NDRF on the third day after the ground floor of the Rajendra Nagar area got completely submerged underwater, said media reports.
