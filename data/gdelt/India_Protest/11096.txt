Satya Pal Malik Says Terrorists Should “Kill Corrupt Politicians Who Have Looted” The Wealth Of Jammu And Kashmir

Satya Pal Malik, a governor in Jammu and Kashmir, said that Terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir should “Kill” all the corrupt politicians in the state who have looted the wealth of the state.

During a public meeting, Satya Pal Malik said, “These boys who have picked up guns are killing their own people, they are killing PSOs (personal security officer) and SPOs (special police officers). Why are you killing them? Kill those who have looted the wealth of Kashmir. Have you killed any of them?”

The comments that were made by Governor Malik created a huge outrage amongst government officials.

Earlier today, Governor Malik said that the comments he made were out of “anger” and “frustration”.

During an interview with ANI, he said, “As Governor, I should have not made such a comment, but my personal feeling is the same as I said. Many political leaders and big bureaucrats are steeped in corruption here.”

Governor Malik is known for naming people and governors for being corrupt in Jammu and Kashmir.

Malik says, “The big families who have ruled Kashmir have got unlimited wealth. They have one house in Srinagar, one in Delhi, Dubai, one in London and elsewhere. They are shareholders in big hotels. It is the common man of Kashmir who is suffering.”

Many supporters of Governor Malik said that he said the right thing and terrorists should target corrupt officials rather than innocent residents of the state.

The former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister, Omar Abdullah, reacted on the comments that were made by the governor.

He said, “Save this tweet – after today any mainstream politician or serving/retired bureaucrat killed in J&K has been murdered on the express orders of the Governor of J&K Satyapal Malik.”
