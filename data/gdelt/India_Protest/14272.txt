NEW DELHI: Amidst heavy cross-border firing along the Line of Control , the Pakistan Army was forced to raise the white flag to retrieve the bodies of two of its soldiers in the Hajipir sector on Friday.The Indian Army on Saturday released a video that showed Pakistan military personnel retrieving the bodies under the cover of the white flag. A Pakistani sepoy Ghulam Rasool of the Punjab Regiment, a “Punjabi Muslim who belonged to Bahawalnagar”, was first killed in the Hajipir sector in cross-border firing on September 10-11.“Initially, Pakistani soldiers belonging to Punjab Regiment tried to retrieve the body under the cover of intense firing at our forward posts but were unable to do so despite repeated attempts. Another Pak Army soldier was killed in the process,” said an officer.Then, on Friday, the Pakistan Army raised the white flag for temporary cessation of firing in the sector. “We respect the dead and permitted the Pakistanis to retrieve the two bodies,” said the officer.The Army said the Pakistan Army had earlier refused to take back the bodies of the five to seven intruders who were killed during an operation by a Pakistani Border Action Team (BAT) team on the intervening night of July 31-August 1.The 778-km long LoC has turned volatile ever since the Indian government decided to revoke the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 and split the state into two union territories on August 5. Over 350 ceasefire violations have been recorded in the last one and a half months.“The Pak Army is trying to internationalize the Kashmir issue, while also trying to push as many militants as possible across the LoC as well as stepping up ceasefire violations,” said the officer.The ceasefire violations, both north and south of the Pir Panjal mountain ranges have already crossed 2,020 this year, while the figure stood at 1,629 for the entire year in 2018. Moreover, the ceasefire violations have witnessed a caliber escalation, with artillery guns and heavy mortars coming into play, causing casualties on both sides in several cases.The use of heavy-caliber weapons had shown a discernible dip after a major spurt immediately after IAF fighter jets conducted the pre-dawn air strikes on the major Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot on February 26, which was followed by an aerial skirmish between rival fighters a day later. But they have registered a spike once again over the last two months.
