New Delhi: A shocking incident took place in the national capital when a financier was looted of Rs 6.5 lakh at gun point. The accused allegedly shot at the victim near the Azad Market underpass. The victim was identified as Parvinder Narula.

The victim owns an auto finance company in Sadar Bazar. The alleged incident took place around 7.45 pm. The victim was returning home in his car when the incident took place.

The victim was being accompanied by his employee. The two were carrying a bag which had Rs 6.5 lakh in it. At the Azad Market underpass, three men allegedly stopped their bike in front of them. The three accused picked up a fight with the victim and started alleging that he had bumped into their vehicle. Narula said that even though he told them that his car did not hit their bike, they were not ready to listen.

Followed by the heated argument, one of the accused allegedly asked the victim to roll down his window. When the victim did the same, one of them pointed a pistol at him. The accused then fired a round of shots and snatched the bag containing cash. The three then mounted their bike and ran away. The victim was unable to chase them down, owing to traffic.

The victim approached the police and informed them about the incident. According to the Times of India's report, the police seized the bullet fired and collected evidence from the area. The police are suspecting that a man well-acquainted with the accused might have a key-role to play in the incident. The CCTV camera footage of the nearby areas is also being scanned for more evidence.
