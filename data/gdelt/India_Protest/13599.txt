Hyderabad Sikhs protest over conversion of girl in Pakistan

By Express News ServiceHYDERABAD: The Sikhs in Telanagana staged a protest in Hyderabad on Sunday against the Pakistan government’s alleged inaction over the abduction of a Sikh girl, who was forcibly converted and then married to a Muslim man in Lahore a few days ago. They also appealed to the Ministry of External Affairs to build pressure on Pakistan to take action. When Sikhs worldwide are celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak, Pakistan’s hypocrisy has been exposed. The protest demonstration was held at Gowliguda Gurudwara under the aegis of Central Gurudwara Saheb, Gowliguda. All the Gurudwara heads of twin cities protested with placards raising slogans against the Pakistan government and demanded justice for the Sikh community in Pakistan.
