Maharashtra's farmers are all set to begin a 'Long March' to Mumbai later this month, nearly a year after several thousands of them walked to the country's financial capital demanding better prices for their produce.



The All India Kisan Sabha, which is organising the 'Long March', in a statement said farmers from 23 districts of the state will begin

marching from Nashik on February 20 to reach Mumbai on February 27. AIKS general secretary Ajit Navale said the farmers will protest the non-fulfilment of the assurances given by the Maharashtra government last year.



Apart from implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission regarding payment of 1.5 times the cost of production for agricultural commodities, the farmers are also demanding complete loan waivers by the Maharashtra Government, Navale told reporters in Nashik earlier this week.



"The Maharashtra Government did not keep up any of the assurances last year. The government has made a mockery of farmers by giving them Rs 500 per month instead of implementing the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission," Navale said.



According to Navale, the number of marchers would be double the 40,000 farmers who marched to Mumbai last year.



Some farmers' groups have already begun protests with daughters of cultivators in the village of Puntamba in Ahmednagar district holding a dharna demanding complete farm loan waiver in addition to remunerative prices. Farm protests in Puntamba two years ago resulted in Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis government announcing Rs 34,000 crore farm

loan waiver.
