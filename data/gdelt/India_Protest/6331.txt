Concern over non-payment to teachers

LAHORE: Awami Workers Party has expressed concern over the rough treatment being meted out by the federal ministry of education to the Basic Education Community School teachers who have not been paid for over a year now.

In a statement, AWP senior leaders Abida Chaudhry, Nusrat Bashir Zafar Advocates and Shazia Khan have demanded that the community teachers must be paid at least the minimum wage committed by the government in every year's budget speech, and the students must be provided with the books and stationery as agreed by the government in literacy-enhancing project started 25 years ago.

"It is highly deplorable that these community teachers who perform full functions of a teacher are only paid Rs8,000 as salary plus Rs1,000 for utility bills while they are sparing part of their home premises for the purpose of community teaching without any compensation for that. This is almost half that of the minimum wage announced by the government itself and that payments are also due for the last many months now," said the AWP leaders in the joint statement.
