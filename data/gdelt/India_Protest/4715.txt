Tibetan Uprising: Activists march from Teen Murti to the Chinese embassy

New Delhi: A three-day protest of Tibetan activists to mark 60th Tibetan Uprising Day, demanding freedom from the communist Chinese government, has entered its last day on Tuesday.

The activists marched from Teen Murti to the Chinese embassy. “We want freedom for Tibet. We have been facing brutalities by the Chinese government. We want the Government of India to support us in our movement,” they sloganed while marching.

On March 10 in 1959, thousands of Tibetans gathered in Lhasa to protect their leader Dalai Lama from perceived threats of the Chinese Army. The protest was brutally suppressed, causing death of thousands of people. Following this, the then 23-year-old Dalai Lama along with thousands of Tibetans secretly fled into exile in India. The demonstration was later named as the Tibetan Uprising.

Hundreds of Tibetans who participated in the march raised slogans against the Chinese government and demanded freedom for Tibet. Protesters were also holding placards stating, “Let his holiness the Dalai Lama return Tibet” and “Freedom and justice for Tibet”.

“60 years ago in 1959, we lost our country to Chinese. We are here to mark this day and to remember all those who lost their lives. We have also taken a pledge that we will continue to fight for the freedom of Tibet.

Protesters have come here from all across India and we will keep fighting until issue of Tibet gets resolved,” the president of Tibetan Youth Congress Tenzing Jigme had told ANI on Sunday while protestors were marching from Delhi’s Ramlila’s Maidan to Jantar Mantar.
