Madhyamik question paper out after exam starts for 5th day

Kolkata, Feb 18 (PTI) For the five consecutive days,

images of Madhyamik Examination question papers were

circulated via social media shortly after the commencing of

the tests.

As in the four previous days, images of Mathematics

question paper were found being circulated on WhatsApp Monday.

Madhyamik, the class 10 school leaving examination, is

conducted by the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education

(WBSEB).

West Bengal Education Minister Partha Chatterjee said

he has asked for a report about the ongoing investigation by

the WBSEB on the allegations of question paper leak.

Chatterjee was talking to reporters after holding a

high level meeting with education department officials and

president of WBBSE Kalyanmoy Ganguly here.

To a question if the meeting had anything to do with

reports of question paper 'leak', the minister said, "No. It

(meeting) was related to review the examinations which have

passed smoothly till this date."

Chatterjee had earlier said a question paper was

considered leaked when it comes out before the commencement of

the examination, and not after.

When asked if he has asked for any report about the

ongoing CID probe into the alleged question leak, he said, "I

have asked the Board to get the status of the probe."

Meanwhile, the Chhatra Parishad, students' wing of the

state Congress, demonstrated before the office of WBBSE in the

city to protest question paper 'leak' and handed over a

memorandum to the WBBSE president.

There were reports that the Bengali, English, History

and Geography question papers were 'leaked' on WhatsApp during

the last four days of the examination. PTI SUS
