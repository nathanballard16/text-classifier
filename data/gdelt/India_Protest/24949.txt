Citizenship Protests: Communications Lockdown, Alert in Several Regions of India's Uttar Pradesh

"We've deployed security personnel in different districts of the state and held talks with the people. Internet services have been suspended for a day, and we're also monitoring content on social media," the ANI news agency quoted P V Ramasastry, Uttar Pradesh's Additional Director General (Law and Order).

On Thursday, police and paramilitary personnel took out a flag march in sensitive areas of Gorakhpur district to ensure the maintenance of law and order. Drones equipped with cameras were also deployed in some areas.

Uttar Pradesh has witnessed several protests over the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) enacted by the federal government. The state recorded the highest number of casualties during violent protests with nineteen people killed, according to the state government.

Protests against the controversial law, which Muslims believe is discriminatory towards them, are slated to take place in several parts of the country. At the same time, the federal ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has organised a rally in western Mumbai in support of the law on Friday afternoon.

The CAA would grant citizenship to illegal immigrants from six religious minorities – Hindus, Parsis, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Sikhs from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, if they arrived in India before 1 January 2015. But it explicitly excludes this privilege to Muslims from these countries.
