CPI members accuse police of inactivity, stage protest

Ludhiana: Nearly 20 people, including members of Communist Party of India, staged a protest at PAU police station on Saturday evening accusing police of being inactive despite getting their complaint.

Assistant secretary (Urban) of CPI Gurnam Singh Sidhu said that the daughter of one of his party members Anu, 25, is married to Manjinder Singh of Choti Haibowal. The couple also has a five-year-old daughter. Manjinder allegedly has illicit relation with another woman following which he forced Anu to leave the house in August last year.

He added that on Saturday night when Anu forcefully entered the house, the accused allegedly thrashed her. It was added that when Anu informed police about the incident on Saturday, they refused to come to the spot. It was only on Sunday morning when a cop came and asked her to leave the house instead of taking any action against her husband and in-laws, it was alleged.

Following this, the woman and BCP members staged a protest at police station for almost an hour.

On the other side, ACP (west) Sameer Verma said the woman has been living separately for over a year now. The case has been taken under the woman cell now. The agitators were pacified after which they lifted the protest. s
