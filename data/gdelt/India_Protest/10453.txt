BJP leader Rajnath Singh says Rahul Gandhi started the resignation drive

New Delhi: The Lok Sabha this morning witnessed brief uproar over the political crisis in Karnataka. As soon as the Lok Sabha assembled for the day, the MPs of the Congress rose to protest alleged ploy by the ruling BJP to topple coalition Government in Karnataka. They waved papers with “Save Democracy” printed on them.

The leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Choudhury, and its Chief Whip, Kodikunnil Suresh, earlier in the morning submitted a notice to Speaker Om Birla seeking to move an adjournment motion in the House, in the wake of the political crisis in Karnataka.

As soon as the LS Speaker took his seat and started the proceedings of the House, the Congress MPs rose to insist on permission to move the adjournment motion. They also raised slogans blaming the BJP for the political crisis in the State. The MPs of the Congress’ ally All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam also rose to join the clamour. The Speaker did not allow Choudhury or Suresh to move the adjournment motion but assured them that he would allow them to speak on the issue later. The Congress and AIADMK MPs relented on the assurance of the Speaker and took seats. The Speaker then started the proceedings of the Question Hour.

Reacting to the allegation, Union Defence Minister and BJP leader Rajnath Singh said, “Our party has nothing to do with what is happening in Karnataka. We have never given any inducement to any MP or MLA ever. BJP has nothing to do with what is happening in Congress. Rahul Gandhi started the resignation drive. We’re committed to maintaining dignity of Parliamentary Democracy.”
