The Kolkata police on Monday detained state government primary teachers who were protesting outside the West Bengal Assembly demanding revision in their pay scale.



According to media reports, the teachers were earlier told that their demands would be heard soon after the conclusion of 2019 the Lok Sabha elections.



However, so far, no discussions have allegedly been held on the issue, media reports further said.

Their salaries have allegedly not been revised in the last eight years.

Similar protests were held in March 2019 as well.



The teachers' protest comes after West Bengal witnessed a seven-day doctors’ strike over an assault on junior doctor Paribaha Mukherjee by family members of a patient, who had died in Kolkata's NRS Hospital.
