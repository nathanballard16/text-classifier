Srinagar, February 20

Local and non-local businessmen staged a protest here on Wednesday demanding safety of Kashmiris living outside the Valley.

The protesters included traders from the Muslim, Hindu and Sikh communities. They gathered near the Hari Singh High Street and raised slogans.

“Our Kashmiri brothers are being harassed. This should not happen. This is a political game. Harassing students is a cowardly act. Some parents have sold land and gold for the education of their children. Steps should be taken to create a peaceful atmosphere. I was born here and so far, I have never faced any problem,” said Rajendra Kumar, a businessman.

Sushant, a businessman from Kolkata, said steps should be taken to ensure the security of Kashmiris. “I have been doing business here for the past many years but never faced any problem. Measures should be taken for the safety of Kashmiris living outside the state,” he said.

After raising slogans, the traders took out a procession and later dispersed peacefully.
