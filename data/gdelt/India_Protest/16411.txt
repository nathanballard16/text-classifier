Lockdown continues, life remains affected in IOJ&K on 75th day

In Occupied Kashmir, normal life continues to remain affected for the 75th straight day, today, in the Kashmir Valley and Muslim majority areas of Jammu region due to the Indian military lockdown and suspension of internet and prepaid cellular services.

Shops and business establishments continue to remain closed except for few hours in the morning and evening whereas public transport is absent from the roads adding to people’s woes.

The occupation authorities are likely to re-impose curfew-like restrictions, today, in the Kashmir Valley to prevent people from holding a march towards the UN office in Srinagar.

The restriction will also be intensified to prevent people from staging anti-India demonstrations after Friday prayers.
