Efforts, not agitations, will bring water: BJP

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu unit of the BJP has slammed the opposition DMK for staging agitations protesting against the State government over the acute water crisis gripping the State and sought to know if people's thirst could be quenched through agitations.

Contending that it has become the wont of the opposition parties to criticise the conduct of yagam for bounteous rains or yoga for sound health, she reminded them that mere agitations would not solve the water woes of the people.

“Sometimes, faith does. Conducting yagas in temples is a matter of faith. Not only Hindus, even Muslims and people of other faiths have offered prayers for bounteous rains,” Dr. Tamilisai said defending the ruling AIADMK's initiative to conduct yagams and special puja for rains throughout Tamil Nadu on Saturday.

The opposition parties should exercise restraint and should not ridicule the faith of the people, she said and added “they may have their own reasons to argue, but it did rain heavily on Saturday evening.” Also, she wanted to know the efforts the DMK took when it ruled the State to improving the drinking water supply schemes.

Varuna Japam and Annadhanam (mass feeding) were organised at various temples across the State and the Ministers who were party's secretaries, attended the events, zealously, on Saturday. The prayers were offered to appease the rain god to shower his mercy upon the people of the State who were facing acute scarcity for water.

Last month, the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HR&CE) Department had directed the temples under its control to conduct homams and special pujas for bounteous rains.

Reacting in similar vein, Revenue Minister R. B. Udayakumar said he ignored the opposition criticism, as religious, social or political activities were all aimed at improving the lot of the people.
