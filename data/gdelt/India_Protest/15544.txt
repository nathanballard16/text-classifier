Prohibitory orders imposed in Aarey Colony near the metro-rail project site

Over 100 Adivasi residents of Aarey Colony held a candlelight march on October 8 at Naushacha Pada to mourn the axing of over 2,000 trees for Metro-3 car shed. Several of them broke down while speaking of being jailed for saving the environment.

"We have lived here for generations. The face of Aarey has changed for the worst in the past five years," said one resident.
