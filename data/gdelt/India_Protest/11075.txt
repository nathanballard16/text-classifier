Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik to terrorists: Kill those who looted Kashmir

Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Sunday made a controversial statement by asking the terrorists to kill the corrupt and those who looted the country and their state, instead of killing the innocent people, including the security forces personnel.

Governor Satya Pal Malik made this statement while he was speaking to a public gathering in Kargil to inaugurate the Kargil Ladakh tourism festival 2019 at Khree Sultan Choo Stadium.

The J&K Governor further added that guns have never been the solution to problems and nobody can bend the government by using it. Our estimates are that at present there are 250 terrorists including 125 foreign terrorists. During encounters, the foreign terrorist takes two days to die and the local two hours. LTTE was once the most powerful terrorist organization in the world. Where is it today? said, Governor Malik.
