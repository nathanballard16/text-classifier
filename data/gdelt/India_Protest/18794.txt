Labour unions stage protest outside ACP office for release of members

Ludhiana: Members of different labour unions under the banner of ‘Hambran Katal Kand Habar Virodi Sangharsh Committee’ staged a protest outside office of Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP) (West) Sameer Verma for almost one-and-a-half hour on Tuesday. The agitators first gathered outside Verka milk plant on Ferozepur Road and then walked to the ACP office raising slogans against police with their demand to register a murder case and release of their fellow union members.

On November 14, a labourer, Lovekush, 15, had died in PGIMER. The autopsy report confirmed that he has died as a result of head injury. According to his kin, Lovekush was beaten up by labourer contractor Raghbir Paswan. The Ladhowal police had registered a case of culpable homicide in this matter against Paswan.

The kin and members of different labour unions staged a protest on November 18. That day the cops arrested nine members for blocking traffic and manhandling cops as the latter were trying to end the protest.

Lakhwinder, member of the union, said they staged a protest demanding release of their members and also register a murder case regarding the incident. ACP Sameer Verma managed to pacify the agitating union members by assuring fair investigation in the case. After that, the protest was lifted.

The ACP said kin of the dead child labourer are satisfied with police response. They have returned to Jharkhand and cremated the body. The members of labour unions have been creating pressure on police for releasing their nine members who were arrested by police for manhandling police personnel and stopping them from performing duty. The arrested accused have been sent to jail in judicial custody.
