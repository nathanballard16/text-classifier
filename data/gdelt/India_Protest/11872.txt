Protests in Pakistan as India revokes Kashmir’s special status

Pakistani activists burnt images of Narendra Modi and Indian flag after Delhi’s decision to abolish Kashmir’s special status

Protests broke out across Pakistan yesterday after India withdrew the special status of the disputed region of Kashmir representing the most radical shake-up of the border territory in seven decades.

Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, abolished part of the country’s constitution which has given semi-autonomy to Kashmir since 1954.

Demonstrations erupted in Islamabad, Karachi and Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir, as protesters held black flags and burnt car tyres, chanting “Down with India”.

“The abolition of the special status of Kashmir will not serve its purpose,” said Zahid Iqbal, 35, a migrant from India-administered Kashmir. “We will fight, and we will fight with more vigour.”

The declaration came after days of mounting tension in Kashmir and threatens to spark a violent backlash.
