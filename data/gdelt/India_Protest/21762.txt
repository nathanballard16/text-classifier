Ducsu VP comes under attack again

Vice-president of Dhaka University Central Students’ Union (Ducsu) Nurul Haque Nur came under an attack on the Dhaka University (DU) campus on Tuesday reportedly by Muktijoddha Mancha activists.

The attack was carried out while Nur along with activists of Bangladesh General Students’ Rights Protection Council (BGSRPC) was preparing to gather at the Raju Memorial Sculpture on the campus to register their protest against NRC and Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) of India.

BGSRPC Joint Convener Faruk Hossain claimed that Aminul Islam Bulbul, president of Muktijuddha Mancha, a platform of freedom fighters’ descendants, led the attack where 20 men took part. “They suddenly attacked us while preparing for a human chain protesting the recent CAB and NRC in India.”

At least eight leaders and activists, including Ducsu VP Nur and social welfare secretary Akhter Hossain, were injured in the attack around 4:39pm, he said, adding that the injured were taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital for treatment.

After the attack, Nur said people now have no right to raise their voices against India.
