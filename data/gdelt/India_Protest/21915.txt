Top court refuses one-stop inquiry into police action

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday refused to order any inquiry into the police action during the recent protests in Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University over the new citizenship law , and asked the petitioners to approach high courts for relief.It would be impractical to set up a single panel to examine the facts as sought by students, given the “spread” of the protests and the “diverse” facts behind those, a three-member bench led by Chief Justice SA Bobde said.The court is neither saying that the situation is not “serious” or that there is no “problem”, nor justifying the government stand on the issue, the chief justice said.“Each of these instances has happened in different places. You want us to examine facts? We cannot examine facts like a trial court … There is a different situation, different grievance in each place,” Justice Bobde said, even as the bench refused to pass any interim orders which lawyers of the students argued would help restore “peace”.The CJI eventually told the petitioners — mostly students of Jamia Millia in Delhi and Aligarh Muslim University in UP — to approach the respective high courts. He directed the HC chief justices to order inquiries if they deem fit after hearing the police version as well.In doing this, the bench rejected any parallels to the recent instances where it had directed fact-finding inquiries, such as the death of four rape accused in Telangana in a police encounter and the clash between the police and lawyers in Delhi.The prayers before the court were: lift the siege of universities, bar entry of police into the campuses, restrain police from arresting students and order an inquiry into the alleged police excesses. CJI Bobde at one point demanded to know how some buses got burnt when there was no violence during the agitations. The CJI also said he would not prevent police from acting against anybody who took the law into his own hands.
