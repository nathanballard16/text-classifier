Global 3D Cell Culture Market: Segmental Analysis

The global 3D cell culture market has been segmented on the basis of product, technique, end-user, and application.

By mode of technique, the global 3D cell culture market has been segmented into scaffold-free 3D cell culture and scaffolds-based 3D cell culture. Among these, the demand for scaffold-free 3D cell culture products is predicted to increase due to the challenges faced in using scaffolds. Such challenges involve the interference of scaffolds with cell-to-cellular interactions and assembly of cell produced extracellular matrices (ECM).

By mode of product, the global 3D cell culture market has been segmented into instruments and consumables.

By mode of application, the global 3D cell culture market has been segmented into stem cell research, cancer research, tissue screening & engineering, drug discovery, regenerative medicine, and others.

By mode of end-users, the global 3D cell culture market has been segmented into contract research organizations, pharmaceutical & biotechnology companies, research & academic laboratories, and others. Among these, the pharmaceutical & biotechnology companies are predicted to dominate the global market due to the rapid adoption of such systems for toxicity screening, drug discovery, and development of regenerative medicine.

Market Potential and Pitfalls

As 3D cell structure has the capability of tissue and organ regeneration and can also provide drug toxicology screening, the market is considered to flourish throughout the assessment period. Factors such as increasing approval from the government bodies, increasing awareness regarding the 3D cell structure, augmenting demand for organ transplantation, the rising prevalence of cancer, and widespread application of 3D cell structure in the pharmaceutical and biotech sector are stimulating the market growth to a large extent. Additional factors triggering the market growth are an advanced technique in tissue and organ regeneration, and drug toxicity screening.

The 3D cell culture market has been identified as one of the fastest growing markets due to the growing prevalence of cancer across the globe coupled with the growing demand for organ transplantation due to organ failure. Moreover, the emergence of kits, 3D optimized assays, and protocols, coupled with the development of several assay techniques is likely to influence the market growth. The increasing use of microchips in order to integrate culture with the help of micro-fabricated tissue component is anticipated to provide the market with potential avenues.

On the contrary, the cost associated with such technologies and systems are high and more preference is given to the 2D cell cultures. Moreover, the simple understanding of the 2D cell cultures and its ease in measurement and observation are some of the major concerns vitiating the market growth throughout the assessment period.
