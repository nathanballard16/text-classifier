We have repeatedly sent notice to the state government but they have forced us to strike during this festive season. Srinivas Reddy had on Sunday succumbed to his injuries at a Hyderabad hospital after receiving 80 per cent burns. He had immolated himself on Saturday during a strike of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC).

The TSRTC employees have been protesting since October 5 seeking the merger of the corporation with the government. Their protest intensified after the state government issued a statement with regards to sacking over 40,000 employees because of the protest. Srinivas' kin contended that he took his life as he was depressed over the government's attitude towards the TSRTC employees.
