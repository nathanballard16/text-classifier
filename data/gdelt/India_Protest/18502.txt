Sikh bodies object Punjabi varsity’s call to controversial scholar at international conference

PATIALA: Sikh bodies have raised objections to the Punjabi University , Patiala, for inviting a controversial Sikh scholar for the three-day international history conference commemorating 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev. The university’s department of history is organising 7th South Asian History Conference (SAHC) on ‘trade, trade routes and travels in South Asia ’ from Friday at the senate hall.The Sikh bodies claimed that the US-based Sikh scholar Pashaura Singh had landed into controversy after he questioned the authenticity of Guru Granth Sahib and travels of Guru Nanak. He was also declared ‘tankhaiya’ (guilty of religious misconduct) by the Akal Takht in 1994, they said.“We are surprised at the university authorities for calling a person who termed travels of Guru Nanak as fake and even challenged Guru Granth Sahib’s authenticity. Pashaura follows the McLeodean school of thoughts that have been ridiculed by the Sikh community. We will protest against the authorities if Pashaura is allowed to attend or speak at the conference,” Academic Forum of Sikh Students president Simarjit Singh said.Punjabi University vice-chancellor Prof B S Ghuman said he was not aware of the participants.Mohammad Idris, head of the history department and director SAHC, said Pashaura was not attending the event for some personal reasons. Idris said he was unaware of controversy surrounding Pashaura.
