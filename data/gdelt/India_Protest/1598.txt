CAB 2019: Assam Pradesh Congress Committee seeks President’s intervention

STAFF REPORTER

GUWAHATI: The APCC carried out five-hour hunger strikes in the district and sub-division HQs seeking the intervention of the President of India to scrap the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, (CAB) 2019.

APCC president Ripun Bora said, “Today, we staged a token hunger strike across the State. The President of India should intervene. The Bill is unconstitutional and undemocratic. After the Bill was passed in the Lok Sabha, the situation in Assam has become unstable. The Centre will now try to pass the Bill in the Rajya Sabha. If the Centre tries to introduce the Bill there in the forthcoming session, the Congress will oppose it.”

Bora pointed out, “The Opposition party has the majority in the Rajya Sabha, and the Opposition will unitedly fight against the attempt of the centre.”

Thursday’s hunger strike of the party in Guwahati was held at the Ganesh Mandir udyan where senior leaders of the party including Ripun Bora were present.
