Mamata Banerjee’s response to Amit Shah’s grand roadshow is a padyatra

Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress president Mamata Banerjee launched a six-km march in Kolkata on Wednesday to protest against the vandalism that took place in the city during BJP president Amit Shah’s roadshow on Tuesday ahead of the last phase of polling.

Banerjee took out the march from Beliaghata to Shyambazar in the heart of Kolkata. Thousands of supporters, some carrying party flags joined the TMC chief as she walked.

Tuesday’s vandalism in which a bust of 19th Century educationist Iswarchandra Vidyasagar was desecrated at the Vidyasagar College has become an emotive issue in Bengal. Vidyasagar was a reformer and a key figure of Bengal renaissance and had started widow remarriage and women’s education, opened schools and colleges and started the use of the Bengali language as a vehicle for literature.

The TMC had accused the BJP of orchestrating Tuesday’s violence as the war of words between the two parties continued.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi stepped up his party’s attacks on Mamata Banerjee at a rally in Basirhat, accusing TMC of letting its goons loose because the party was scared of its defeat in the national elections.

In Delhi, TMC’s Derek O’Brien said at a media briefing that there was video proof of BJP supporters desecrating the statue. He then headed to the Election Commission to lodge complaints against the BJP.

Police had arrested dozens of people for the violence. The Trinamool claims that most of them were not from Bengal and had been brought from outside by the BJP.
