Odisha: 5 dead, 30 ill after ‘consuming spurious’ liquor

BALASORE: At least five persons died and 30 others fell ill on Tuesday after allegedly consuming spurious liquor in Bhadrak district ’s Pirhat area under Tihidi block.The district administration had ordered closure of all liquor shops in the district ahead of the elections.Around 28 victims are undergoing treatment in the district headquarters hospital, while two have been shifted to Cuttack SCB Medical College and Hospital after their condition deteriorated. The deceased have been identified as Sadhu Charan Nayak, Sarbeswar Das, Rama Chandra Nayak, Sankarsan Parida and Krushna Chandra Nayak.Angry over the incident, villagers blocked the Tihidi-Chandbali road at Pirhat market by burning tyres, resulting in massive traffic congestion on the thoroughfare.Locals alleged that the victims bought the liquor with the money provided by political parties ahead of the fourth phase of polling in the state. They have demanded legal action against liquor traders and vendors, along with compensation for the kin of the deceased.Several persons reportedly consumed the liquor after polling ended in the area. Later, some of them complained of uneasiness and fell unconscious.“We have come to know that people in Daulatapur village under Tihidi police station area of the district had bought liquor from a local market for a post-election feast. They could not purchase liquor from any licensed shop as all liquor shops remained closed due to the elections,” Bhadrak collector Gyana Das said, adding it is suspected to be spurious liquor.“We have launched an investigation at the administrative level to ascertain the circumstances under which the liquor was consumed,” Das said. The victims were initially admitted to the Tihidi community healthcare centre and then shifted to Bhadrak district headquarters hospital.However, chief district medical officer of Bhadrak BK Dash said the ill villagers might have had stale mutton curry with the liquor. “It could be due to heat as well. The exact reason behind the deaths would be known after the viscera samples of the deceased are tested,” Dash added.“A joint investigation will be carried out by the Revenue and Health and the Police departments. As the incident took place on the polling day, which was a dry day, we are taking this matter seriously,” Excise department secretary Nikunja Dhal said.
