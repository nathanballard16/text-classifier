Candle light protest against merger of banks

The Joint Committee of Trade Unions (JCTU), the United Forum of Bank Unions (UFBC) and other organisations on Friday will hold candle light protest against the merger of public sector banks.

Talking to reporters here on Tuesday, UFBC convenor Vincent D’Souza said that the protest was to highlight people’s resentment against the Union government’s move to merge Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank; Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank; Union Bank of India, Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank; and Indian Bank and Allahabad Bank.

District leader of JCTU H.V. Rao said that on Friday, activists will take out a candle light rally from Town Hall at 6 p.m to Corporation Bank’s head office where they will have a meeting. Mr. Rao said that they intend to build pressure on the Union government and force it to withdraw its decision to merge the 10 banks.
