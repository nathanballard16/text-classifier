TMC begins protest over I-T notices to Durga Puja committees in Kolkata

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Tuesday began its eight-hour long dharna in central Kolkata in protest against the Central government's decision to serve income tax notices to Durga Puja committees.



Criticising the Narendra Modi-led government for issuing the notices to several Durga Puja committees, West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee had on Sunday announced that 'Banga Janani Brigade' (the women's wing of the party) would sit on a dharna at Subodh Mullick Square on Tuesday.



Claiming that festivals should be exempt from any levies, Mamata Banerjee had urged organisers, participants and all people "who love Bangla" to join the protest.



Mamata Banerjee's comment came after the BJP on Monday criticised TMC's decision to stage the demonstration.

The BJP accused a section of ruling TMC leaders of laundering money allegedly looted in chit fund scams through the Durga Puja committees. The TMC had termed the allegations as "baseless".
