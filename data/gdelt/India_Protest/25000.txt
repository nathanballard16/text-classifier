Guwahati, Dec 27: Amid the ongoing protests against the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Congress president Sonia Gandhi will unfurl the party flag at the AICC headquarters on Saturday, the 134th foundation day of the grand old party.

Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi will address a rally at Guwahati in Assam, where he will take on the Narendra Modi government on the issue of CAA, which is strongly being opposed by different groups and organisations in the north-eastern state. Violent anti-CAA protests have rocked Assam ever since the new law was passed by Parliament.
