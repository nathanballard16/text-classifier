CAA most beneficial for Dalits: Nadda

NEW DELHI: BJP working president J P Nadda on Sunday said most of the beneficiaries of the Citizenship Amendment Act will be Dalits and accused the opposition of working against the interests of the community by protesting against the new law.The Dalit leaders who are opposing the law should be exposed, he said, asserting that PM Modi is the “biggest protector” of the community.Nadda accused Congress of spearheading the campaign to “mislead” minorities over CAA and stressed that the new law is all about giving citizenship to minorities and not about taking away anyone’s citizenship.Naming many castes to which the expected beneficiaries of the amended law belong, he claimed 70 to 80% of them are Dalits. “Those who are opposing it are anti-Dalits,” he said.
