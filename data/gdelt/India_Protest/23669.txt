The situation is gradually returning to normal in violence-hit areas during the anti-CAA protests in Delhi, police said on Saturday. Heavy deployment of security personnel was made in Old Delhi and Seemapuri area. Delhi Police conducted a flag march in Northeast Delhi's Seelampur which saw violent protest against the CAA on Thursday. Paramilitary force personnel have also been present.

A ground report shows that the situation is turning normal in many areas. Market and shops in affected areas remained open on Saturday.

Senior leaders and influential people organised peace meetings in their localities. Police have also met the residents in a bid to tackle the issues. The secretary of Daryaganj Traders' Association, Manish Seth, said that all shops in the area opened on Saturday morning and there is no unrest.

He said police have been keeping a tight vigil. The area surrounding Jama Masjid, where a large number of protesters gathered on Friday evening, was also peaceful. A shopkeeper said, while he supported the cause, such incidents only harm business.

"There are no jobs, the economy is going down, and now people are scared over citizenship. Not a single thing is going right because of CAA," he said.

Meanwhile, a senior police officer from Shahdara district said the situation was under control in the area.

Delhi Police personnel have been conducting flag marches in the area since Friday evening, to ensure that no untoward incident is reported, he added. Jamia Millia Islamia, which has been seeing protests against the law, organised a public meeting lined up by activists on the CAA, and a protest-march on Saturday.
