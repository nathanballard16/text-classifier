Re-probe women suicide cases in Pollachi: Kanimozhi

Chennai, March 12 : DMK leader and Rajya Sabha member Kanimozhi on Tuesday was taken into custody by Pollachi police after she addressed a protest rally against inaction in the serial sexual assault, and released later.

Kanimozhi demanded reinvestigation of all suicides of women in Pollachi region in the last seven years.

Pollachi is about 535 km from the state capital.

The DMK held the protest despite the police disallowing such a protest. A large number of women, activists from DMK, its allies including MDMK and VCK participated in the protest.

Speaking at a protest rally held in Pollachi against inaction in the sexual assault case she said: "Many women were blackmailed. The crime has been going on for the past seven years. The should be a bigger network of criminals and not just the four arrested persons."

She demanded that all suicide deaths in the past seven years in Pollachi should be probed again.

She said the ruling party took action against its party official only after the issue got politicized with DMK President M.K. Stalin issuing a statement referring to the expulsion of A. Nagaraj, an AIADMK official, on Monday.
