Commercial vehicles can’t ply in parts of Old City from 5am to 11pm

Ludhiana: Come Monday, movement of commercial vehicles will be restricted in parts of Old City. Police said these vehicles would be allowed to ply between 11pm and 5am in areas falling under Jodhewal, Salem Tabri, Daresi, divisions 1, 2, 3 and 4 police stations. “And if commercial vehicles ply on these roads between 5am and 11pm, their drivers will face an FIR,” said assistant commissioner of police (traffic) Gurdev Singh.To ensure its implementation, checkpoints will be set up at the entry and exit points of these areas.The development comes in the wake of the December 4 fatal accident of 6-year-old Harshit Kaushal, a resident of Gulchaman Gali, on a congested Gokul Road.Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal issued the orders under Section 144 of the CrPC late on Thursday night. According to the directions, commercial vehicles, including heavy, medium and small ones, will not be allowed to enter these seven areas from 5am to 11pm and the violators will be booked under Section 188 (disobedience to the orders duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC.After Harisht’s accident, the area residents had staged a protest and not allowed transporters to open their shops for a few days. Residents alleged that commercial vehicles caused traffic chaos and accidents. A delegation, comprising residents, transporters, MLA (Central) Surinder Dawar and councillors, had met Agarwal on December 9, seeking time restriction on movement of commercial vehicles. After they submitted their suggestions, Agarwal had formed a committee to survey Old City roads. The panel included deputy commissioner of police (traffic) Sukhpal Singh Brar, additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Gupreet Singh Sikand, assistant commissioner of police (Central) Waryam Singh and ACP (traffic) Gurdev Singh.The ACP (traffic) said, “We will first create awareness and then begin the crackdown. The respective police stations will ensure the order’s compliance.”
