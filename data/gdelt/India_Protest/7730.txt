Arrest me if you have guts: Amit Shah dares Mamata Banerjee

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Monday attacked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and said she is “scared”.

“I was to visit three places today, but Mamata's ji's nephew is contesting from one of the seats so she is scared her nephew will lose, and that's why she cancelled the permission for our rally,” ANI quoted Amit Shah as saying in Joynagar, West Bengal.

“Mamata didi, I am chanting Jai Shri Ram here and leaving for Kolkata, arrest me if you have guts,” Amit Shah further said.

Earlier in the day, Amit Shah was denied permission to hold a rally in West Bengal’s Jadavpur. He was also denied permission to land the chopper.
