Shiv Sena party workers perform last rites of a helmet in Pune08 Jan 2019, 05:07PM ISTSource: TNNShiv Sena party workers performed last rites of a helmet, to protest against the compulsion of wearing helmet while riding in Pune. Relevantly the traffic branch of the Pune police seems unshakeable about the strict enforcement of the helmet mandate in the city. The last rites were performed at Vaikunth crematorium in Navi Peth. The team is using all means, including their own cellphones, to catch belligerent two-wheeler riders who shun the headgear.
