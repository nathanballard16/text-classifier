Congress women workers try to ‘honour’ Vaghani’s wife

RAJKOT: Congress is is no mood to spare Gujarat BJP president Jitu Vaghani for his ‘crass and insensitive’ remarks on the Gandhi family scions.Dozens of women workers of the Congress were detained when they went to Vaghani’s house in Bhavnagar to honour his wife. Parul Trivedi, a Congress councillor, leading the agitation, said, “We wanted to felicitate Vaghani’s wife for tolerating this kind of man for so many years.”Vaghani had courted controversy while addressing party workers on Sunday in Radahnpur town of Patan district . Vaghani had said the Gandhi scions were born amid security cover of commandos. “They can’t even differentiate between a brinjal and a potato . Those born with commandos around their cradle out of fear that they would be kidnapped or something untoward would happen.”Vaghani then went on to say: “I am not sure if the commandos were around when they were being fed milk. I am not a witness to it,” drawing cheers from the party workers.The women Congress workers held a protest in front of Vaghani’s house at Iskon Mega City. However police didn’t allow the women to enter the house and detained nearly 20 of them. They were taken to A division police station, from there they were released later in the day.In Rajkot, women Congress workers burnt Vaghani’s effigy outside collector office to register their protest. They also submitted a memorandum to the district collector demanding action against Vaghani for his statement.Vaghani on his part explained that he did not mean any disrespect to women. “I only talked in the reference of Gandhi family members born with a silver spoon and who are exploiting this country thinking its their ancestral property. BJP has emerged as a party by imbibing Indian values and we give utmost respect to women. Women leaders in our party have grown on their abilities and not because any family surname,” he had said.
