Terrorist attack on CRPF personnel condemned

Activists of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) took out a rally in the city under the leadership of G.D.V. Prasad, S. Srinivas, P. Raghava Raju and others protesting against the killing of CRPF jawans in Jammu & Kashmir, and said India should weed out the elements fomenting trouble from across the border. Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha State unit president N. Ramesh Naidu condemned the attack on CRPF jawans and said that it was time Pakistan was taught a lesson for allegedly sheltering anti-India forces and turning a blind eye to their acts of bloodshed.

In a press release, Mr. Naidu said the entire country should stand united in this hour of crisis and ensure that such dastardly acts did not recur. Activists of the BJP Mahila Morcha took out a rally from the BSNL office at Chuttugunta to the SRR College protesting against the attack. Mahila Morcha State president Thota Vijaya Lakshmi said India should crush the terrorists lest they resort to violence again.
