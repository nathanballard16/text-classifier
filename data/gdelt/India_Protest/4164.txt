India-Pakistan tensions spill over to meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation

NEW DELHI - India-Pakistan tensions rippled into the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) after Pakistan decided to boycott a meeting of its foreign ministers in Abu Dhabi on Friday (March 1).

Its foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi chose to stay away because of the presence of his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj. India was invited as a "guest of honour" to the meeting by the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

Pakistani newspaper Dawn said Mr Qureshi told his country's lawmakers on Friday that he had asked the UAE to "review" the decision but he was told "it would be hard to retract the invitation".

India, meanwhile, took the spotlight at the OIC and used the platform to launch a veiled attack on Pakistan.

"If we want to save humanity, we must tell the states who provide shelter and funding to terrorists to dismantle the infrastructure of the terrorist camps and stop providing funding and shelter to the terror organisations based in that country," Ms Swaraj said at the plenary session of the meeting.

Formed 50 years ago, the Jeddah-based OIC groups 57 member states and describes itself as the "collective voice of the Muslim world". India, which has the world's second largest Muslim population - after Indonesia - has been excluded from the OIC since its formation in 1969. Friday was the first time India had been represented officially at the body.

It is a remarkable turnaround for the OIC, which had invited India to be part of the inaugural conference in 1969 in Rabat, in Morocco, but subsequently did not allow any official delegation from New Delhi to participate in the meeting. This was because Pakistan, along with some its supporters, threatened to pull out of the opening summit if India was allowed to participate.
