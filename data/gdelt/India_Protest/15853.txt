From The Past Pages Of Dawn: 1969: Fifty Years Ago: Clash in Maharashtra

NEW DELHI: Police fired several rounds to disperse a 1,000 strong crowd of Sikhs at Nanded (Maharashtra state) last night [Oct 8], killing at least two persons. Three others were injured. A dusk-to-dawn curfew was clamped on the city.

Trouble started following a scuffle between a Policeman and a Sikh. The Sikh went to a nearby gurdwara and returned with a crowd of his fellow religionists armed with swords who began attacking a Police patrol. Many people were arrested after the clash in which one Police Sub-Inspector was injured.

Meanwhile, the East Punjab Sikh leader, Mr Darshan Singh Pheruman, who has been on a fast unto death for the past 39 days in Amritsar, has turned down another request from the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi, to abandon his fast.

Meanwhile, a Shillong report adds: The blanket curfew imposed in the northeastern Indian town of Namrup, Assam since Sunday was extended by another day yesterday as the death toll in last weekend’s clashed reached four. Though there have been no incidents since Monday, the situation is tense, officials say. Rioting, looting and arson broke out when a student at the fertiliser corporation of India plant was beaten to death after being involved in accident on his motorcycle.
