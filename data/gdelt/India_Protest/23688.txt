Old Port in Mangaluru wears a deserted look, trawlers unable to unload catch

MANGALURU: The ever-bustling Old Port area (Dakke) has also come to a standstill like the rest of Mangaluru since Thursday. Curfew was imposed in Mangaluru city police limits after violence broke out over protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act CAA ) and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).One of the sectors that has been the worst hit is fishing. Deep fish trawlers that go on a 10-day voyage are returning to the port and unfortunately they are not able to unload the catch.Mohan Bengre, president, Purse Seine Boat Fishermen Association, said the estimated loss per day is nearly Rs 2 crore for 200 boats. Fishing boats are returning from the deep sea, but because of the curfew being imposed in the city limits, unloading and sale of fish is not happening. “With police permission, we have managed to get ice and several layers of ice is laid on the catch for storage. We only wish that the peace and normalcy is restored, because fish is a perishable good and cannot be stored for a long duration. On an average, 150-200 boats are arriving for anchorage every day,” he said.Year 2019 had not been a pleasant year for the fishermen. The Arabian sea saw four cyclones this year—Vayu, Hikka, Kyarr and Maha. “Whenever there is a cyclone, we lose nearly two weeks and in that sense we have had a bad year. This being Christmas season, there is a huge demand for fish, especially seer fish. The current catch is mostly prawns and pink perch,” Bengre said.The marine fishing sector in Karnataka in the past decade has been the most turbulent and is haunted by several issues related to declining catch, imbalance in economic returns between the sectors and so on.Meanwhile, the ferry service between Old Port and Bengre has also been stopped, registering an average loss of Rs 3,000, per day.
