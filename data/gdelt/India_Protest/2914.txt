BJP sources have described the drive as a part of its mass mobilisation campaign for Lok Sabha elections, expected to be held in April-May.

On Monday, Amit Shah wrote an open letter to the people of Andhra Pradesh where he launched a blistering attack on Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and said that the TDP chief has destroyed the trust of the people. BJP president Amit Shah said the Andhra Pradesh chief minister knows that his political fortunes are declining rapidly and so he was back to theatrics in his desperation for grabbing headlines. Naidu’s “delusional politics” is about to end, he said, adding that the BJP has full faith in ‘Satyameva Jayate’ (truth prevails).
