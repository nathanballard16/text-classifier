Kolkata, July 21

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee Sunday alleged that central agencies are threatening TMC leaders and elected representatives with prison in chit fund scam cases if they don’t get in touch with the BJP.

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo, addressing the Martyrs’ Day rally here, also said the party will launch a state-wide protest on July 26, demanding return of black money “siphoned off” by the BJP.

“Central agencies are threatening our leaders and elected representatives over chit fund scams, asking them to get in touch with the BJP or face prison,” Banerjee said.

The Chief Minister accused the saffron party of luring TMC MLAs with money and other perks.

“The BJP is offering Rs 2 crore and a petrol pump to our MLAs to switch over... Just like in Karnataka, the BJP is indulging in horse-trading everywhere,” Banerjee alleged.

She said the BJP government at the Centre would not last for “more than two years”, considering the way it is functioning.

“Credit for the smooth conduct of Parliament goes to opposition parties, not those in power,” the TMC chief said.

While paying tribute to all the “martyrs” during 34 years of Left rule in the state, she urged people to fight for restoration of democracy in the country.

She also remembered 13 Youth Congress activists who were killed in police firing on this day in 1993. Banerjee was a leader of the Youth Congress at that time, when the Left Front was in power in West Bengal.

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) holds the Martyrs’ Day rally in the city every year on July 21 in the memory of the 13 Youth Congress activists. PTI
