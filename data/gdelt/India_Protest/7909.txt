Opposition wants to stop PM Modi as he works for the oppressed: Adityanath

Varanasi (Uttar Pradesh) [India], May 16 (ANI): Opposition parties want to stop Prime Minister Narendra Modi from coming to power as he works for the oppressed community, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said on Thursday.
