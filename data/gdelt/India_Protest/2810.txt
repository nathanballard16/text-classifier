SC refuses to entertain plea seeking court-monitored probe into Saradha chit-fund scam

New Delhi [India], Feb 11 (ANI): The Supreme Court on Monday refused to entertain a plea filed by investors seeking court-monitored probe into the Saradha chit-fund scam.

The Saradha Group financial scandal was a major scam caused by the collapse of a Ponzi scheme run by the conglomerate. The multi-crore-rupee chit fund scam allegedly involves several key leaders from the Trinamool Congress.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is presently questioning Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar and former TMC MP Kunal Ghosh in Shillong in connection with the case.

Kumar, who has been serving as Kolkata’s Police Commissioner since January 2016, is said to have not responded to the earlier summons by the CBI in connection with the probe. He is also accused of allegedly tampering evidence in the case.

On February 5, the Supreme Court had directed the 1989-batch IPS officer to appear before the CBI in connection with the scam. It had also said that no coercive step should be taken against Kumar.

The top court directive had come against the backdrop of a ‘dharna’ organised by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata in protest against the CBI’s attempt to arrest Kumar. (ANI)
