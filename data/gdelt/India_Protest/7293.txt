SFI, DYFI stage protest over summer classes

Vijayawada: The members of Students Federation of India (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) held a protest at a few corporate colleges "which are violating rules and conducting special classes during summer vacations" here on Thursday. They staged protest at Narayana Junior College, Chuttugunta and Sri Chaitanya Junior College, Maruthi Nagar.

The faculty members claimed that they were conducting classes for the slow learners preparing for supplementary exams. However, the student union leaders alleged that the colleges are conducting second year classes. They further alleged that the college security threatened them while they were talking to the college management.

Speaking on the occasion, SFI state secretary K Ramesh alleged that Narayana and Sri Chaitanya colleges are violating the orders of the Intermediate Board and conducting summer classes. He also alleged that the Intermediate Board had failed to take any action against these colleges and demanded that the Intermediate Board take immediate action against both the colleges.

DYFI district secretary T Praveen stated that Intermediate Board secretary B Udaya Lakshmi had released the orders not to conduct any classes during the summer vacations. But both the corporate colleges were conducting the classes.

They have not taken permission from the government. He further said that they were demanding that the managements show the permissions given by the government, if any. SFI district secretary M Someswara Rao, SFI state president Ashok, state joint secretaries Prasanna Kumar, Narasimha, Vijayawada central leaders Rakesh, Sumanth and others were present.
