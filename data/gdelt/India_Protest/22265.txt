Congress stages protests to demand waiver in civic taxes

Vadodara: The opposition Congress stage protests both outside the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) headquarters at Khanderao Market and in the general board hall of the civic body seeking waiver of civic taxes for areas that were supplied with turbid and contaminated water since the beginning of this year.

Members of the city unit of the Congress and its elected representatives in the VMC have raised the demand arguing that the VMC had no right to collect the taxes as it was not able to deliver services. The demand was particularly regarding the eastern and southern zones of the civic body that have been plagued by water supply issues.

Congress workers led by city unit president Prashant Patel and VMC opposition leader Chandrakant Shrivastava held protests at Khanderao Market. They then sat in the lobby of the electing wing of the civic body. The elected representatives of the party then sat on the floor of the general board to raise the demand. tnn
