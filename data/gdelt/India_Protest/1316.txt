AAP supporters protest against high electricity tariffs in Mumbai

THE AAM Aadmi Party (AAP) attacked the BJP government by holding a protest rally in Bandra on Saturday against the high electricity tariffs in Mumbai. AAP state executive committee member Dhananjay Shinde further said there was disparity in electricity rates between south Mumbai and suburbs. In December, Delhi Minister Satyendra Jain had visited Mumbai and stated that Maharashtra government “lacks intention” to reduce tariff. In Mumbai, it is four times more,” said Brigadier (retd) Sudhir Samant, state convener of AAP, adding that in the last three years, the Maharashtra government has increased taxes levied on electricity. AdvertisingDrawing comparisons between the Delhi and Maharashtra governments, the AAP leaders claimed that electricity tariff was brought down in Delhi after their party took over, by providing subsidy and by not increasing taxes.
