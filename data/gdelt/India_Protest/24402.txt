Three out of four convicts in the 2012 Nirbhaya gangrape case have said that they will use the legal remedies afforded to them by the law to seek relief from capital punishment.

In their reply to Tihar Jail Authority's notice, Akshay, Vinay and Pawan have said that they still had legal remedies given to them by the Constitution of India and will use both of them - curative plea in SC and mercy plea before President.

On December 18, Tihar Jail authorities had issued a notice to the Nirbhaya gangrape convicts if they want to file mercy petitions against the recent Supreme Court verdict that confirmed the death sentence to one of the four convicts in the 2012 gang rape and murder case. If they do not file the petition in the given time, the jail administration had said that it would approach the court concerned for further proceedings.

Justice in Nirbhaya case pushed further

Nirbhaya gangrape and murder case, which had shaken the nation due to sheer brutality during the crime, was revived in the country's conscious as a veterinarian in Telegana was raped and killed in November.

Even as her alleged rapists were killed in an encounter, the demands to hang the men convicted for heinous rape and murder of Nirbhaya in Delhi in 2012 started gaining momentum.

But the matter is once again caught in the legal course as a convict Akshay, who had earlier not participated in the curative petition against the SC order, filed an individual petition. His petition was rejected earlier in December.

Now, the three convicts, including Akshay, want to file another curative petition. If that is also rejected by the SC, they are also likely to file a fresh mercy petition before President Ram Nath Kovind.

Earlier, Vinay Sharma - the fourth accused had filed a mercy petition before the President, which he later withdrew.
