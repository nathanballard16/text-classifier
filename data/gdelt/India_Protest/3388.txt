London: Protests against Pakistan over the brutal Pulwama attack have spread across the world, with nearly 50 countries condemning the nefarious act carried out by banned Pakistani terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed in Jammu and Kashmir that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force jawans on February 14.

Indians living abroad have taken to streets, the latest development coming from the United Kingdom. Hundreds of non-resident Indians in Britain protested outside the Pakistan High Commission in London on Saturday.

With slogans of ‘Pakistan murdabad’ (to hell with Pakistan), the protesters blamed Islamabad for being a haven for terror groups that carry out dastardly acts in Jammu and Kashmir and other parts of India.

The sloganeering continued with ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Kashmir hamara hai’ (Kashmir is ours), while protesters also demanding the withdrawal of all military aid given to Pakistan by the UK.

JeM carried out a brutal attack that killed 40 CRPF jawans on February 14 in Awantipora area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The attack took place around 3:30 pm after a suicide bomber, identified as local boy Adil Ahmad Dar, in a Mahindra Scorpio car loaded with 350 kilograms of explosives rammed into a convoy of 78 vehicles carrying over 2500 CRPF personnel on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.

In retaliation, India withdrew the Most Favoured Nation status given to Pakistan.
