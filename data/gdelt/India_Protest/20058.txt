Landmark day for India, says PM Modi

NEW DELHI: Having ticked yet another box on its “core” agenda with the passage of the Citizenship Amendment Bill, BJP looks set to launch a public campaign to celebrate the decision to confer citizenship on refugees belonging to religious minorities from the neighbouring Islamic countries of Bangladesh Pakistan and Afghanistan The stage for what may turn out to be a big “awareness” programme was set by Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who asked BJP MPs to launch a campaign to explain the “historic” decision to people and expose the opposition for repeating Pakistan’s language on the issue.Addressing a BJP parliamentary party meeting before Rajya Sabha cleared the controversial legislation, Modi said the proposed law will be recorded in “golden letters”. Parliamentary affairs minister Pralhad Joshi quoted Modi as saying that the bill would end the uncertainty that refugees belonging to minority communities had to endure.Modi, according to Joshi, accused the opposition of endorsing Pakistan’s attack on CAB. Pakistani PM had on Tuesday called the legislation a product of RSS’s “expansionist Hindu rashtra vision” and Modi government’s fascist agenda.BJP, which had approached the vote in Rajya Sabha as a crucial show of strength against Congress which had worked hard to keep smaller parties in the “no” corner, was jubilant that it had, soon after its success over the decision to scrap J&K’s special status, worsted the opponent in yet another RS tussle over an ideological issue. The outcome once again demonstrated its new-found skill to work the numbers in the upper House where it lacks a majority of its own.The celebration found expression in the tweets of Modi, home minister Amit Shah , who skippered the moves, and their senior colleagues, BJP working president J P Nadda, petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan and others.Immediately after the bill was passed, Modi tweeted, “A landmark day for India and our nation’s ethos of compassion and brotherhood. Glad that CAB 2019 has been passed in Rajya Sabha. Gratitude to all the MPs who voted in favour of the bill. This bill will alleviate the suffering of many who faced persecution for years.”Shah tweeted, “As the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 passes in Parliament, the dreams of crores of deprived and victimised people have come true today. Grateful to PM Narendra Modiji for his resolve to ensure dignity and safety for these affected people. I thank everyone for their support.”Pradhan also tweeted to say that changes in the Citizenship Act would correct the “historic wrong” done to Hindu and other minority refugees from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said the bill would pave the way for India to open its doors to religious minorities facing persecution.Criticising those opposing the bill, he said, “The debates in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha have exposed the hypocrisy of parties whose loyalty is more towards a dynasty than towards India and has reaffirmed that it only the government led by PM Narendra Modi that is working for the minorities within the country and outside it.”
