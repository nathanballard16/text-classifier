Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were stopped outside Meerut when they were on their way to meet families of those killed in violence that broke out during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Uttar Pradesh last week. The brother-sister duo left for Meerut this morning to meet some of the family members of the deceased protesters, but they were stopped by Meerut Police outside the city. The police cited the law and order situation in the state in the wake of ongoing protests against the Citizenship law. The cops reportedly told them that they cannot enter the city as prohibitory orders under Section 144 are in place. Both the leaders are now returning to Delhi. In the violent protests which erupted in Meerut last week, two persons were killed and a police post was set on fire. In a bid to nab those who led the violence in the city during a protest against the newly-enacted citizenship law, Uttar Pradesh police on Monday issued posters with pictures of the rioters. The posters of "wanted rioters" also said that people who provide information that will lead to their arrests will be rewarded.
