Gujarat: Dwarka farmers protest against erratic power supply

RAJKOT: Farmers in Khambhalia town of Dwarka district on Wednesday morning protested against the state-run electricity distribution company due to erratic power supply.The farmers brought their electrical equipment at the office of Paschim Gujarata Vij Company Limited ( PGVCL ) saying they don’t need the equipment as they don’t get electricity.The farmers came with electric lamps, fans, tube-lights, electric motors and other equipment to express their anger.“Gujarat is an electricity surplus state and under Jyotigram the state government claims to provide 24-hour electricity in every village, but the ground reality is that we don’t get any electricity,” Gujarat Kisan Congress chief Pal Ambalia said.
