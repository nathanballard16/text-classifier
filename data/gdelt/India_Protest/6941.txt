AAP holds march, demands cleaning of Buddha Nullah

Ludhiana: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) Lok Sabha candidate on Wednesday held a march from Buddha Nullah to highlight the bad condition of the water body, along with other issues.

An AAP leader said the party candidate Tejpal Singh held the march in the north and east constituencies of Ludhiana to highlight “lack” of development and the total “disregard” of the residents’ needs. He added that the party candidate led a march on Wednesday morning starting from Buddha Nallah in the north constituency leading though Shivpuri Chowk and all the way to Noorwala village where he interacted with the local residents.

AAP candidate said local residents complained about the heavily polluted Nullah, which had made their lives miserable. He added that he has already decided that if elected by people, he will either put up a tent or try to get some accommodation near the water body to highlight the pollution in the water body and will not move from there till the issue is solved.

Tejpal Singh said in Shivpuri Chowk area, residents complained about traffic congestion, non-removal of garbage and bad condition of roads in the area. He added that in the Noorwala Road area, residents joined the march and showed him the pitiable condition of sewerage pipes which is mixing with drinking water causing serious health issues and diseases.

Tejpal Singh lamented that while people are suffering, MLA’s and state government is not paying heed to their needs.

AAP state spokesperson Ahbaab Singh Grewal said the state government is hand in glove with the builder, contractor lobby, which is busy making money at the cost of the people by providing substandard services in connivance with corrupt government officials and politicians.

Both AAP leaders said AAP would continue to fight for the people’s needs and highlight their issues.
