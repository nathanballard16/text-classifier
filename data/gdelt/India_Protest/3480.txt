Thousands of people across the nation took to streets and held candlelight marches to pay tribute to the CRPF personnel, who sacrificed their lives in Pulwama terror attack. They shouted anti-Pakistan slogans, displayed placards, banners and urged the government to take a firm action against Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. At some places, effigies of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan were also burnt by protesters. Janmeyjay Sharm, a resident of Delhi, said that the purpose of organising a candlelight march is to express condolences to the bereaved families of martyred CRPF personnel. "Our forces should be given a free hand to give a jaw-dropping response to perpetrators of the attack," he added. Another protester Qasim Khan said, "All communities should come together and condemn the cowardly Pulwama attack." Members of civil society urged people to maintain communal harmony and keep an eye on the miscreants, who are trying to expoite the current situation. Addressing a rally in Bihar, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that there is a 'fire in my heart' over the suicide bombing of the CRPF convoy. "I condole the bereaved families. And to the large number of people who have gathered here, I would like to say the fire that is raging in your bosoms, is in my heart as well," Modi said. Union Minister Arun Jaitley, too, tweeted that the terrorists "will be given unforgettable lesson for their heinous act". (BCCL)
