Shop-owner Murdered in Patna's Churi Bazaar; Angry Mob Blocks Thakurbari Road

Patna: Family members and businessmen in Kadam Kuan in Patna on Sunday morning blocked the road for hours in protest against the killing of the owner of a 'shringar' (beauty) shop who was stabbed multiple times and shot to death on Saturday evening.

As reported, Deepak Sahni, the owner of the beauty shop located in the Churi Bazaar in Kadam Kuan, was getting ready to go somewhere when five men arrived at his shop around 8:45 pm on Saturday and engaged in an altercation with him over some matter. Within minutes, they assaulted Deepak with knives as one of them pulled a pistol and shot him in his head from a close range.

The criminals then escaped by firing in the air to scare away the crowd.

Deepak, a resident of West Lohanipur, was rushed to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) where he was declared dead on arrival.

On Sunday morning, protestors blocked the Thakurbari Road by placing the dead-body on a slab of ice demanding immediate arrest of the criminals, Rs. 20 lakh in compensation and a government job to a family member of the deceased.

Police said it had identified the men and had already arrested one person in the case while it continues to search for Raju, the gunman, and his other associates.

It took more than four hours for the police to clear up the road but not without first summoning anti-riot gears and light use of force to counter the belligerent mob.

Kadam Kuan police station in-charge Nishikant said that the victim had a criminal history and was facing charges in a number of cases involving loot and robbery.
