Lok Sabha Election 2019, Assam profile: Dibrugarh, Gauhati, Tezpur key seats in state with BJP seeking to improve tally-Politics News , Firstpost

Assam, which became the BJP’s gateway to North East after the saffron party came to power for the very first time in 2016, is going to polls in the aftermath of the state-wide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill.

The most populated state in the North East, Assam, which has 14 Lok Sabha seats, goes to poll in three phases. While five constituencies each go to polls on 11 and 18 April, the remaining four constituencies will be voting on 23 April.

Assam, which became the BJP’s gateway to North East after the saffron party came to power for the very first time in 2016, is going to polls in the aftermath of the state-wide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill. While the BJP-led Centre withdrew tabling the Bill in the face of active resistance from the local population, the issue is expected to dominate the political discourse in the state.

Another issue which is likely to dominate the polls is the National Register of Citizens of India (NRC) drive undertaken by the government to determine the citizens of Assam. With lakhs of names missing from the list, the whole process is likely to dominate the elections in Assam.

This election, the fight is expected to be between the Congress and the ruling BJP, which won an unprecedented seven seats in the last Lok Sabha elections. The AIUDF led by perfume baron Badruddin Ajmal and the Asom Gana Parishad, which is expected to be in alliance with the BJP, are the other players.

Interestingly, Muslim voters play a crucial role in deciding the political fate of candidates in at least 10 Lok Sabha seats in Assam.
