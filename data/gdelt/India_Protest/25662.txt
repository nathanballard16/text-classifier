Join hands to isolate BJP: Mamata

Kolkata, Dec 30 : Slamming the ruling BJP at the Centre for labelling as "anti-nationals" those protesting against the new citizenship law, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday urged the people to rally together in isolating the Bharatiya Janata Party.

"BJP is conspiring to snatch away the citizenship of legal citizens. I urge all of you to join hands against the BJP and isolate them," Banerjee said in Purulia town of Purulia district where she spearheaded a 5-km protest march against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Asserting that she would continue her protests till the law was scrapped, the Trinamool chief assured the people that nobody would have to leave the country.

"I will continue my protest till the CAA is withdrawn. I will ask you all to ensure your names are there in voters' list, and leave the rest to us," said Banerjee.

"India belongs to all Indians... BJP doesn't have the right to drive anyone out from India. But now, those taking part in the peaceful protests are being called anti-nationals".

Refering to the BJP losing the assembly polls in Jharkhand, Banerjee said: "This party has now contracted to a few states where they are in power like Uttar Pradesh and Karnataka. That time is not far when people will have to use binoculars to find BJP," she said.
