Mumbai: Mahul residents staged protests after they did not receive the flats promised to them. The protest by the residents has now completed 114 days. The Housing development authority promised that flats would be given to the residents but no efforts have been made towards the same.

Left to struggle in the toxic hell of Mahul, residents were promised 300 flats as alternate residences but even after two years, not a single flat has been allotted to them. The Mumbai civic body and the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) will meet to find the reason behind the delay.

According to Mirror Now's report, the Bombay High Court had rapped the Maharashtra government for its failure in providing houses to the citizens. The court had reprimanded the state government in December 2018 for it failure in implementing the plan of allotting the flats.

With promises made by various civic bodies on paper, no action in reality has been taken. Various authorities and officials visited the area and promised that an alternate residence would be provided to the people in Mahul, only to disappoint them again. In response to this, the citizens have made the footpath their home as they have been protesting since the last 114 days.

While talking to Mirror Now, a resident stated that though the people have been losing their lives to slow poison, nothing is being done by the government or the concerned authorities. Houses have even been demolished in the area, leaving citizens without a roof over their heads. Though the MHADA officials had approved the allotment of the houses, the documents have been stuck with the Bombay Municipal Corporation.
