Kolkata: As the West Bengal doctors' strike enters day-6, the parents of the three-day-old baby who died on Midnapore district have staged a protest with the baby's dead body in front of the agitating doctors. The local police had to intervene to control the situation in the district.

Even though the West Bengal Chief Minister has agreed with all demands of the agitating doctors, the medicos have not yet called off the strike in the state. They have demanded that CM should visit the injured doctors in the NRS hospital. Mirror Now reported the infant paid the price of the tussle between the state and agitating doctors. The parents of the baby are demanding justice for their child and asked the doctors how their strike was justified if the patients are dying.

The doctors across the nation stood in solidarity with their agitating colleagues in Kolkata. As a part of the strike, elective surgeries, Out Patient Department (OPD) was completely shut in hospitals only the emergency ward was operational for patients.

Meanwhile, Members of the AIIMS Resident Doctors Association (RDA) had resumed working on Saturday and they claimed that if the demands of the West Bengal doctors are not met within 48 hours, they would be forced to resort to an indefinite strike.
