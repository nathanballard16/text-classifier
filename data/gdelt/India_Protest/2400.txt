Ex-minister says he may not contest the polls.Former Union Minister of State, who representedin the 15th, has publicly voiced his dissent over the City Congress affairs, and said he may reconsider his decision to fight the forthcoming polls.He admitted that there is a rift in theand has urged everyone in the party to join hands for the polls. “Rahul Gandhi is working very hard, and we must not let him down. We have to unite,’’ said Deora, while speaking to Mumbai Mirror.“Yes, there is a problem in Mumbai Congress. It can be ironed out. I believe that in a city like Mumbai, which is the economic and cultural capital of the country, we need to bring people together. Unfortunately, what I see in Mumbai Congress today… I don’t say that it is (City Congress chief)’s fault or someone else’s fault. Leaders of Mumbai Congress, not just the president of Mumbai Congress, have to bring people across communities, across economic strata together and that is something what has been missing.’’“I feel disappointed. One of the reasons why I may even reconsider whether it’s worth fighting elections or not is because of what’s happening in Mumbai Congress, and because of what’s happening between leaders. I have communicated this to Mr Gandhi. If we are unable to bring people together, then I may even not been wanting to be in politics or fight elections,” said Deora. “I have not seen the politics in Mumbai reach a level where many leaders feel left out. Many leaders are sitting at home.”
