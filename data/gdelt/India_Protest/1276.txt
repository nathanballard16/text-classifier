Activist Anna Hazare to sit on hunger strike from Jan 30 over Lokpal Act

Hyderabad, Jan 19 (ANI): Social activist Anna Hazare on Saturday informed that he will sit on a hunger strike from January 30 as the Union Government has failed to implement the Lokpal Bill. The activist who initiated the demand for Lokpal Bill in the Parliament back in 2011 said that he would go on a hunger strike as the government did not do anything about even after the bill was made before the government headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014. “Law (Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act) was made in 2013, then Modi govt came in power in 2014. We felt that the Modi government will adhere to the bill and corruption will come to an end. But they did nothing in last five years. So I have decided to go on a hunger strike from 30 January.” He will start the hunger strike from his village Ralegan Siddhi.
