Three booked for trying to extort Rs 20L from a man

Rajkot: Three persons including a woman were booked by Junagadh police on Tuesday for trying to extort Rs 20 lakh from a Ahmedabad-based sales executive of a private firm. The woman had befriended the executive over social media, said police.

Police booked Kajal Patel and two of her aides for looting Pankaj Vallabh Pansuriya (42) of Rs 1,200 and trying to extort Rs 20 lakh from him.

According to police, Patel had befriended Pansuriya over Facebook two months ago and had invited him to Junagadh. On September 16, Pansuriya came to Junagadh to meet Patel. The duo spent time together at Patel’s house in Sardarpara area.

While Pansuriya was in Patel’s bedroom, two men, who are yet to be identified, barged in and beat him up. They threatened to frame him in a rape case if he did not pay them Rs 20 lakh. The accused took Rs 1,200 cash from his pocket along with a bank debit card. But when they could not get enough money, the accused kept Pansuriya’s debit card and let him leave asking him to credit the amount in his bank account.

However, Pansuriya reached Junagadh police station with his cousin and lodged a complaint against Patel and her two aides.
