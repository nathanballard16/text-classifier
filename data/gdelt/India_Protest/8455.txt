Murder bid: DBA strikes work, seeking arrest of accused

Ludhiana: Members of District Bar Association (DBA) observed strike on Thursday seeking arrest of the accused in the case of “attack” on former president of Khanna Bar Association.

DBA president Ashok Mittal, also the chairman of Punjab Lawyers Association (PLA), said the strike was observed by lawyers across the state in protest against the “high-handedness” of Punjab Police.

Mittal, who along with other lawyers, sat on protest on Thursday said the police officials have arrested two accused Raj Shukla and Chirag and more arrests were likely to be made soon. He, however, cautioned that if other accused were not arrested within the given time, the lawyers would protest before the higher authorities in Chandigarh and in case of inaction, a nationwide protest would be launched.

On May 22, Khanna police had booked the president of local municipal council (MC) Vikas Mehta and others for an attempt to murder of former president of Khanna Bar Association Manish Khanna.

Mittal, who met Manish, said he has received several injuries and was still unable to go to work. Meanwhile, Khanna DSP Deepak Rai said after the arrest of two accused, raids were being conducted to nab the remaining 12 accused in the case.

The telephonic argument between two Congress leaders had allegedly resulted in clash between two groups, leaving Congress leader Ladi Mann and Manish Khanna injured.
