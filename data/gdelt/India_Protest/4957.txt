YAD chief gets notice for holding rally at marriage palace

Ludhiana: The Election Commission has issued a notice to Youth Akali Dal (YAD), Ludhiana unit, chief for violating the model code of conduct.

According to the notice, which was issued by the assistant returning officer (ARO) of Atam Nagar constituency to Meetpal Singh Dugri, president of YAD, the latter did not take any permission from the ARO for organising the rally of former cabinet minister Bikram Majithia at a marriage palace on March 11.

The notice says that by not taking permission, Dugri had violated the model code of conduct, and if he does not submit a written reply to the notice in the next two days, then action would be taken against him and YAD, and for which Dugri would himself be responsible. The notice also mentions that Dugri had applied and received permission for this rally at Dana Mandi on Gill Road, but he did not organise the rally at the said venue, but instead at a marriage palace on Dugri Road.

Meanwhile, speaking to TOI, Meetpal Dugri said: “The March 11 rally of our leader Bikram Majithia was scheduled to be held at Ludhiana, for which I was granted permission by the authorities to conduct it at Dana Mandi on Gill Road. But just a few hours before the rally was to start, heavy rains caused havoc, and the entire venue of Dana Mandi was flooded with water. As it was impossible to hold the rally at this venue, we were left with no other option but to change it, and at the last minute, we organised it at the marriage palace. I request the authorities to reconsider this notice, as nothing was done by me or our party intentionally. However, I will make sure I appear before the ARO to present my side of the story.”
