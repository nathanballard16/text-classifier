During the protest the employees raised slogans against the state government. The employees also took out rallies in different parts of the state and demanded the government to fulfill their demands.

‘Telangana Bandh’ planned

Notwithstanding the uncompromising stance adopted by Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao with regard to the strike, the workers have decided to call for a ‘statewide bandh’ and approach Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan.

Outlining the future course of action, TSRTC JAC leader Ashwathama Reddy said that the date for ‘Telangana Bandh’ would be decided late today. He urged all political parties, civil society organizations; those who champion social movements; and intellectuals to support its bandh call.

According to N Krishna, Division Secretary of Joint Action Committee leaders, the JAC has decided to approach the Governor.

“We are not protesting for selfish gains or salaries. The strike is to save TSRTC from sinking and disappearing completely,” he said.

“We are asking the Chief Minister to disburse Rs 2,400 crore which the government owes to TSRTC. It will help the corporation from still severe financial distress… the government has even used up the Provident Fund money of employees,” he alleged.
