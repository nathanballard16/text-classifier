Visitors return empty-handed from MC offices

Ludhiana: The visitors to MC offices were a harried lot on Thursday as most of the staff went on strike at zonal offices. Since there was no prior information about the strike, several residents were left unattended.

Even the employees working in MC suvidha centers were on strike and people could not deposit their dues or gather documents. The MC officials claimed that they did not want to trouble the public, but their strike was necessary as they were attacked in such a manner.

Senior citizen Krishna Sharma who had gone to zone A office rued, “On Thursday, I was supposed to get the copy of birth certificate of my grandson, but when I reached the suvidha centre at zone A office, there was no employee there.” She said if employees are going on a strike, they should at least make a system that public should not face harassment.

Kamaljit Singh, another resident who went to zone D office, said, “I wanted to pay my property tax, but on Thursday I had to return empty-handed due to the strike.” He said now he will have to come again.

An MC employee said, “We also do not want to cause any problem for the general public. So whenever we go on a strike or stage a protest, we ensure that at least suvidha centre staff are attending to people. But it was different this time as a person tried to kill our colleagues which is a serious matter.”

He said they have demanded immediate arrest of the person and in case police fails to do the same they will continue the strike and there will be no work in city.
