Goel BJP leaders protest outside Sisodia s residence carry paddy residue on bicycles

New Delhi: In his protest against stubble burning, BJP MP Vijay Goel on Thursday carried crop residue on a bicycle to Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia's residence and accused AAP MLAs in Punjab of encouraging the practice. Goel, along with Delhi BJP leaders, staged a protest outside Sisdoia's residence on Mathura road here. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and AAP leaders have been blaming stubble burning in Punjab for the rising pollution levels in the national capital. On one hand, they are blaming stubble burning being responsible for air pollution in Delhi and on the other hand, the party's MLAs in Punjab are instigating and encouraging stubble burning," Goel alleged. Earlier, Sisodia had asked Goel to check data on role of stubble burning in air pollution.
