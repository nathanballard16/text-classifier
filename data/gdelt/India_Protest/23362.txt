Street Dancer 3D Song Muqabla: Prabhudheva shows Varun Dhawan, Shraddha Kapoor how the ‘King of Dance’ does it

A highly awaited sequel to ABCD, Street Dancer 3D reunites Shraddha Kapoor, Varun Dhawan and Prabhudheva along with other dancers. The trailer of the Remo D’Souza’s directorial was launched in a fun fashion in Mumbai this week and now, the first song, Muqabla is out. The song is a reprised version of Prabhudheva’s old song and it features Varun and Shraddha along with India’s King of dance in the snazziest avatar. Fans of Prabhudheva are surely in for a treat with Street Dance 3D’s song, Muqabla.

The song features Prabhu, Varun and Shraddha styling up the old number and adding more charm to it with some cool moves and formations. However, it is Prabhudheva’s iconic dance that steals the show and is worth the wait. Shraddha can be seen taking the dance floor with Prabhudheva but at the actual competition, it is Varun aka Sahej who shakes a leg with Prabhudheva and the king of dance shows him how it's done. The song's main USP and show stealing point is the solo dancing of Prabhudheva towards the end.
