Students protest withdrawal offree meal scheme

“We have seen the condition of students hailing from low income families due the withdrawal of the mid-day meal scheme from the government colleges,” said C.H. Sumanth, State vice- president of the Students Federation of India.

Activists of the SFI along with the students of the SRR & CVR Government Degree College staged a protest outside the college gate and raised slogans such as “we want the mid-day meal scheme back. We want our food.” “Many of the students are now forced to depend on their parents, further increasing the burden on people from economically weaker sections,” said Mr. Sumanth.
