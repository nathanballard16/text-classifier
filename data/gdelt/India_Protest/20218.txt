Mamata convenes meeting of TMC MPs, MLAs to chalk out strategy for countering Citizenship Bill

KOLKATA: West Bengal chief minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee on Thursday convened a meeting of party MPs and MLAs on December 20 to devise a strategy to counter the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.Banerjee, who has been stridently opposing the implementation of both NRC and Citizenship Bill in Bengal, has asked all TMC leaders and lawmakers to attend the meeting without fail, party sources said."An emergency meeting has been convened by the TMC chief on December 20. All leaders, including district presidents, MPs and MLAs, have been asked to be present at the meeting without fail. A strategy will be chalked out to counter the citizenship bill," one of the sources said.Apart from working out a well-rounded strategy, there would also be deliberations over the legal route that could be taken in the matter, a senior party leader stated."We don't want to limit our fight to just Bengal, but plan to bring together parties from various parts of the country to oppose the bill. If needed, our party delegation will also visit Northeast states to join protest," he claimed.Assam, the hotbed of anti-citizenship bill protests, was on edge on Thursday as thousands of angry protesters came out on streets defying curfew, thumbing their nose at Army contingents staging flag marches, and clashing with police.According to party sources, poll strategist Prashant Kishor, whose services have been hired by the Trinamool Congress for 2021 assembly elections, will also be present at the December 20 meeting."So far, we have been opposing the legislation as it was just one of the proposals mentioned in BJP manifesto. Now that the bill has been passed by Parliament, we have to look for ways to counteract it."Under our federal structure, we can't just oppose a law that has been passed by Parliament," the TMC leader said.Besides finding out ways to defeat the purpose of the "draconian law", we will also prepare a plan of action for generating mass awareness on the issue, he added.According to sources, the TMC leadership is apprehensive that the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill will kick off a new wave of communal polarisation in the state, with the "BJP getting an upper hand as the messiah of refugees", ahead of the 2021 assembly elections.Banerjee, who has been at a forefront in opposing the legislation and the exercise to implement National Register of Citizens (NRC), had earlier termed her fight against the two issues as "Second War of Independence".State BJP leadership, which has been rejoicing the passage of the citizenship bill, slammed Banerjee for her opposition to the "historic" legislation, contending that she was afraid of "losing her minority vote bank".
