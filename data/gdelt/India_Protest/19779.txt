Students called for a day-long shutdown in four Assam's districts. The protests have led to the closing of shops, banks, universities and businesses, with public transport staying off the roads.

"We will fight and oppose the bill till the last drop of our blood", All Assam Students' Union advisor Samujjal Bhattacharya said in an interview with Reuters.

Hundreds of people marched against the proposed law in Gujarat and the city of Kolkata.
