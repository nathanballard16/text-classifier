Railwaymen hold protest against water shortage in colonies

Ludhiana: Due to no water supply in railway colonies and shortage of water at the station, members of the Northern Railway Men’s Union (NRMU) organised a protest at the railway station here on Tuesday.

Protesters first organised a two-wheeler rally in eight railway colonies (from colony number 5 to 12). Then, they staged a protest outside offices of the assistant divisional engineer and chief medical officer. Later, they gathered outside the office of the station director at platform 1. The protesters claimed that employees residing in colonies, besides facing a shortage of water, were also experiencing a tough time due to choked sewers and poor condition of quarters.

Gansham, leading the protesters, said water was being supplied in colonies only for one hour or just half-an-hour during the day. “We have to move to nearby areas with buckets to get water for bath and other purposes. We are buying drinking water bottles from shops,” he said. Gaurav, a member of NRMU, said due to the shortage of supply of Rail Neer bottles at the railway station, stall owners do not have Rail Neer to sell and passengers are also suffering.
