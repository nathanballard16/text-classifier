Lok Sabha election highlights: In Amethi, Priyanka Vadra accuses BJP of distributing money, saree to woo voters

Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has accused the BJP of distributing money and saree in Amethi to woo the voters. Priyanka’s brother and Congress president Rahul Gandhi is seeking re-election from Amethi for the fourth consecutive time.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Sunday lashed out at the BJP over the issue of nationalism and accused the saffron party of resorting to wrong means to woo the voters to win elections. Priyanka, who was in Amethi to campaign for her brother Rahul Gandhi, said that nationalism is about solving the problems of people. She also said that employment, education and health are the issues in this election.

“Nationalism is about to solve problems of people. Here they don’t listen to people, when they raise their issues they suppress them, it’s neither democracy nor nationalism,” she told reporters in Amethi.

The Congress leader also said that BJP is distributing money and saree to woo the voters in Amethi but people are wise here to decide who is right.

“The way they contest polls by distributing money, sarees and shoes in front of media is wrong….People of Amethi have never begged in front of anyone. I have been coming here since I was 12, people of Amethi and Raebareli have a lot of pride,” she added.

Meanwhile, preparations are in the place for the fourth phase of Lok Sabha on April 29. A total of 71 constituencies spread across nine states will go to polls in this phase. Polling in the remaining three phases will take place on May 6, May 12 and May 19. Results will be declared on may 13.
