Ravidas temple demolition: Activists plan protest march on September 21

NEW DELHI: Dalit activists have called for a second protest march on September 21, demanding the release of the youth arrested for allegedly indulging in rioting during the protest against the demolition of tRavidas temple.The protest march would start from Jantar Mantar and head to the Tughlakabad temple site. Last week, the activists headed by the Sants offered prayers at the temple site while also demanding the release of those held under judicial custody.At least 96 including including Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, were arrested in Delhi. A few others were arrested in Punjab for protesting on the same issue and they have been kept in judicial custody, dalit activist Ashok Bharti told the TOI. But if the government does not yield on releasing those being held, the other leaders will also court arrest, he said.The sants from Delhi, Punjab, Haryana will then campaign on the issue in poll-bound states.There are about 150 Ravidas temples in Delhi, according to Bharti.Condemning Azad’s arrest, at a press conference, the civil society organisations and student bodies dubbed the ruling BJP’s actions as “anti-dalit” and “anti-minority” and demanded his release. They also said that the Ravidas Temple in New Delhi’s Tughlaqabad should be reconstructed immediately.Senior advocate Prashant Bhushan said, “The agenda of the anti-dalit BJP government is to reconstruct the structures of dalit oppressions similar to what was practised by the worshippers of Manusmriti in ancient times.”The group also protested against the “unlawful” cases filed against over 750 people from the dalit community, including national general secretary of Bhim Army, Kamal Singh Walia, in Uttar Pradesh ’s Saharanpur on September 10, where the Bhim Army was ostensibly protesting against the vandalism of a statue of BR Ambedkar in Saharanpur district’s village, Ghunna.
