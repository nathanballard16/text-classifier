Sunday: The 12th Delhi Queer Pride Parade

NEW DELHI: Thousands took to the streets on Sunday, November 24, as part of the 12th Delhi Queer Pride Parade. With posters and flags, the parade marched on from Barakhamba Road to Jantar Mantar.



Central to the parade this year was opposition to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill 2019 - which was tabled in Rajya Sabha on November 20. The Lok Sabha passed this government bill on August 5 —without the debate and discussion it warrants. The arguments raised against the bill relate to its politics of identification, the certification process it proposes, its denial of affirmative action to the community, and the lenient penalties proposed for violent crimes against trans folk.



Several posters at the parade included the hashtag - #StopTransBill, in a show of solidarity for the trans community that remains opposed to the bill.
