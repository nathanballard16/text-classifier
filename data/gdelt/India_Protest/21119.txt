Protests over the amended Citizenship Act rocked parts of West Bengal for the third consecutive day on Sunday, prompting the state government to suspend internet services in six districts. Internet services were suspended in Malda, Uttar Dinajpur, Murshidabad, Howrah, North 24 Parganas and parts of South 24 Parganas districts to prevent rumour-mongering and circulation of fake news, especially on social media, a senior government official said. “Despite several requests by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, it was found that a few communal outfits have been carrying out violent protests and trying to spread false propaganda. “In view of the situation, the administration has decided to temporarily suspend internet services in six districts of the state,” the official said.

In South 24 Parganas district, internet services were suspended in Baruipur and Canning sub-divisions, he said. Incidents of violence, loot and arson were reported from Nadia, Birbhum, North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Howrah districts, police said. A state BJP delegation met Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Andal airport in West Burdwan district when he was proceeding to Dumka in Jharkhand to address an election rally. The delegation apprised him about the “worsening” law and order in West Bengal.
