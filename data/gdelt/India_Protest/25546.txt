MSU staff associations up the ante against admin

Vadodara: To press for their long pending demands, including implementation of seventh pay commission recommendations without further delay, MS University’s staff associations are gearing up to intensify their protests against the varsity administration.

Both the Baroda University Teachers Association (BUTA) and the Baroda University Staff Association (BUSA, comprising non-teaching staff) have declared that they will be staging dharna at MSU head office on January 1.

BUTA and BUSA had called a meeting on December 23 following which the associations decided to focus on three major demands which have been raised before the university administration in the past.

The three major demands include immediate implementation of seventh pay scale for all university employees in such a manner that the employees start getting benefit in the January 2020 salary which is paid in February 2020.

“We have also decided to seek 8 % annual interest on difference of salary if 7th pay scale benefits are not implemented from the month of January 2020,” said Nikul Patel, BUTA general secretary.

The associations are also demanding immediate release of pension for all retired teaching and non-teaching staff members.

“As per Supreme Court judgement, pension is right of an individual retiring from university services. We have demanded that ad hoc pension should be immediately started for all teaching and non-teaching employees who had retired from our university services till Gujarat government finalizes the same,” he said. The associations are also demanding that the fixed salary which is paid to teaching and non-teaching temporary staff should be revised.

BUTA has demanded that a panel be formed to revise payment of temporary staff. “We want representation of one member at least in committee from teaching and non-teaching association,” he said.
