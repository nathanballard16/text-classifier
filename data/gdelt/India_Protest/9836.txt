Chennai water crisis: Police denies NGO to protest against water scarcity

Chennai Police has denied permission to anti-corruption NGO Arappor Iyakkam to organise a protest the ongoing water crisis in several parts of Tamil Nadu, including the state capital, Chennai.

After being denied permission to protest at Valluvar Kottam, a designated protest venue on Sunday, the NGO has moved the Madras High Court.

The case will be heard on Tuesday even as the Tamil Nadu government continues to block protest against the severe water crisis.

Meanwhile, Opposition DMK has intensified its protests against the Palaniswami government.

Upping the ante against the AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu for "inefficient handling" of the water scarcity in the state, DMK president M K Stalin on Monday led a massive protest in Chennai and lambasted Chief Minister K Palaniswami for attempting to downplay the crisis.

'Yagams' (elaborate ritualistic worships) that AIADMK leaders are conducting are to save their positions in the government and not to please the rain gods, said Stalin, while also warning of a massive 'jail bharo' stir if the government failed to solve the state-wide water crisis.

AIADMK leader D Jayakumar, however, asserted that the protest would get no support from the people.

Joining the DMK workers at the protest, Stalin dramatically raised an empty pot and asked, "Kudam Inge Kudineer Enge?" (Pot is here, where is the drinking water)?"

"The government has scarcity of funds, schemes, jobs, industries, justice, law and order, now include water. But Chief Minister K Palaniswami, his deputy O Panneerselvam and Municipal Administration Minister S P Velumani are not bothered," the DMK chief said addressing a large group of his party cadres.

AIADMK, on the other hand, has repeatedly claimed that the water crisis is not as severe as it is being portrayed by the Opposition and the media.
