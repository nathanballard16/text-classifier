“But we have been using this name for the last 53 years. The owners are Hindus; the name is Karachi bakery. To satisfy them, we put up the Indian flag.”

The bakery staff have covered up the ‘Karachi’ part of the signboard. Despite the incident, the bakery continued to operate until its scheduled closing time of 11pm.

The bakery is part of a chain founded in 1952 by Sindhi man, Khanchand Ramnami, who immigrated to Indian Hyderabad at the time of Partition. The bakery is famous for its biscuits and other savoury items.
