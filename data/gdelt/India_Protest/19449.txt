Indian father applauds police for killing his daughter’s accused rapists

Police in India shot and killed four men accused of raping and killing a veterinarian in the country — and the victim’s father has praised the cops for the slayings.

Indian police officers took the four suspects to the scene of the crime in the outskirts of Hyderabad ostensibly so they could “reconstruct” what happened.

Authorities claim the suspects reached for the officers’ guns, sparking a shootout between the cops and the accused criminals.

All four suspects were killed in the shooting and two officers were wounded, according to Indian police.

The woman’s father praised the killings on Friday, Asian News International reported.

“It has been 10 days to the day my daughter died. I express my gratitude towards the police & govt for this. My daughter’s soul must be at peace now,” he said, according to the report.

Thousands of Indian citizens took to the streets in protest as news of the veterinarian’s rape and murder spread in the country.
