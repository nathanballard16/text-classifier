While Anuj held the post of Deputy Commissioner (drawback), Customs, Nhava Sheva, Raigad during March-April 2018, Singh held the position during March 2017 to September 2017, according to the CBI.The CBI initiated the probes against the Customs officers as part of its nationwide crackdown on Tuesday on individuals suspected of involvement in corruption, misconduct and serious crimes, like abduction, when it conducted searches at 110 locations in 19 states including Mumbai in Maharashtra, registering 30 cases.Among the searches carried out were those in Mumbai and Bharatpur as part of a probe ordered by a Rajasthan court in February 2019.
