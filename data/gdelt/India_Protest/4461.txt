Ex-Congress MLA Umesh Jadhav joins BJP in Karnataka

Kalaburagi: Two days after resigning from the Karnataka Assembly, ex-Congress legislator Umesh Jadhav on Wednesday joined the BJP here, a party leader said.

“I welcome #UmeshJadhav into BJP Karnataka. He is a hard working surgeon-turned-political leader who will do well in parliament in #Elections2019,” tweeted Karnataka BJP MP in Rajya Sabha Rajeev Chandrasekhar.

Jadhav joined the party in the presence of BJP’s state unit president B.S. Yeddyurappa in Kalaburagi, prior to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s public rally in the northern district, about 600km from Bengaluru.

A two-time MLA from Chincholi constituency in Kalaburagi district, Jadhav submitted his resignation to Assembly Speaker K.R. Ramesh Kumar on Monday without giving any explanation.
