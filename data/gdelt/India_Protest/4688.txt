Congress-AAP alliance door ajar

The Congress and the AAP are competing for the same space and Rahul cannot expect to win a single seat without weakening Kejriwal

Addressing booth workers of Delhi, the Congress president targeted only Prime Minister Narendra Modi and didn’t even mention the AAP government led by Arvind Kejriwal.

Rahul Gandhi on Monday said the Congress would win all the seven seats in Delhi but did not attack the Aam Aadmi Party, keeping the speculation about a possible tie-up alive.

The Congress and the AAP are competing for the same space and Rahul cannot expect to win a single seat without weakening Kejriwal.

Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit too said: “We will win all the seven seats.”

Even Dikshit did not attack Kejriwal although the AAP held a demonstration in front of the Congress office in protest against denial of full statehood to Delhi.

Even on Monday, the AAP formally ruled out any alliance talks with the Congress.

Ananth attacks Rahul

Union minister Ananth Kumar Hegde known for his obnoxious statements has once against courted controversy questioning the roots of the Congress president.

The BJP Lok Sabha member from Uttara Kannada described Rahul, as “a paradesi (foreigner) born to a Christian and Muslim.”

A video clip shows Hegde making the statements at what looked to be a party workers’ meeting at Bhatkal in Uttara Kannada on Friday.

The comment was made in reference to the Congress seeking evidence to prove that the airstrikes on Balakot in Pakistan had indeed hit the intended targets.
