Residents protest against static compactor across park

Ludhiana: Even before the site for installing the static compactor could be finalized in Model Town area, the residents have started raising objections by saying officials should not set up static compactors near Chatar Singh Park or the road passing through this park.The residents claimed they will meet the municipal corporation commissioner over the issue. Recently, the Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) officials have started the process to install the static compactors at nine locations and one in Model town.Earlier, there was planning to set up a static compactor at one corner of the Chattar Singh Park and preparation was done for the same. But people showed resentment and one activist Gurpal Grewal also staged protest near the site. It forced the officials to drop the idea for a while, but now they have decided to set up a static compactor at roadside opposite the park.Grewal, reacting to the issue said, he the park is meant for public activities like walking, jogging and other recreational activities, and the same will be hindered if static compactor will be installed there. He said the park is also in a dilapidated condition and once the static compactor will be installed near this park, people visiting the park on a daily basis will suffer.On the other hand, the executive engineer of LIT, Buta Ram, said the actual site for the static compactor has not even been decided yet and thus starting protest on the issue as of now is not logical. He said the static compactors will help in handling the solid waste in a proper manner and people will not face any problem due to the same.
