NEW DELHI, October. 23—About 200 Congressmen from Haryana, including Members of Parliament, MLAs and PCC members, led by Mr. Ram Saran Chand Mittal, Haryana Pradesh Congress Chief, will meet the Central Government leaders here today in support of the state’s demand for the implementation of the recommendations of the Shah Commission. The Commission, it may be recalled, had given Chandigarh, the disputed town, to Haryana. The Congress delegation will meet the Prime Minister. Mrs. Indira Gandhi, at 12.30 p.m. and the Union Home Minister, Mr. Y.B. Chavan, at 1.30 p.m. Earlier, the delegation will wait on the Union Food and Agriculture Minister, Mr. Jagjivan Ram, and the Industrial Development Minister, Mr. Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed. Meanwhile, Mr. Rizk Ram, Mr. Ram Kishen Gupta and Mr. Dalbir Singh, all MPs, in a joint statement, denied any proposal to stage a “dharna” in front of the residence of the Jan Sangh chief, Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, for his failure to support Haryana’s demand on Chandigarh. Mr. Randhir Singh, MP, who had announced the “dharna” proposal, said that he was misreported on the issue as there was no intention of staging any “dharna.” All that was actually intended was to protest against the “dual policy” of the Jan Sangh on the Chandigarh transfer issue. Mr. Randhir Singh said that the All-India Jan Sangh wanted a new boundary commission to go into the question while the Haryana Jan Sangh was supporting the demand for the implementation of the Shah Commission recommendations.
