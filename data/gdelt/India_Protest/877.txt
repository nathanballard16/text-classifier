Now, reelpolitik over Accidental Prime Minister

Seeking to cash in on the release of political movie The Accidental Prime Minister, months ahead of the country going for general elections, the youth workers of the ruling BJP flocked to theatres on its release day on Friday with much fanfare. Not to be left behind, the student-youth cadre of the Congress, took to the streets alleging the film smack of propaganda. Youth Congress activists also staged protests outside movie halls in Kolkata.

Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) activists created a ruckus outside a multiplex in Indore where they had arrived to watch its first show.

A BJYM leader said they watched the film with fanfare, because the Madhya Pradesh unit chief of the National Students Union of India (NSUI) had warned theatre owners against screening it.

Hundreds of BJYM workers reached the Malhar Mega Mall here, which houses the multiplex, with a band. Before entering the cinema hall, they shouted slogans against Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath, and got into fracas with the police who were put up there.

BJYM’s local unit’s president Manasvi Patidar said that NSUI had warned cinema halls against screening the film, so “in order to give a befitting reply, we watched the film in this manner”.

NSUI state president Vipin Wankhede had said in a Facebook post on December 28 that theatre owners will be responsible for the consequences if the film is screened.

The Congress termed the Anupam Kher-starrer, which revolves around Manmohan Singh’s tenure as prime minister, as BJP’s propaganda.

Madhya Pradesh PR Minister PC Sharma said, “Manmohan was not an accidental PM. He is a renowned economist who gave a new direction to the country’s economy.
