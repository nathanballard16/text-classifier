Lok Sabha elections: Dissent in Congress as party joins hands with RJP in UP

Kushwaha was in jail for many years and is being probed by CBI over NRHM scam. Even Congress president Rahul Gandhi had protested against him and he marched to CBI office in Lucknow in 2011.

There is a dissent in Congress after an alliance with Babu Singh Kushwaha’s party, who was a minister in BSP Chief Mayawati’s cabinet. The anger of Congress workers could also be seen in Lucknow, where party’s General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra visited on Sunday. Priyanka was cornered by party workers; who sought breaking alliance with RJP. The matter was somehow calmed by Priyanka’s security team.
