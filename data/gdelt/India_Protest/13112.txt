-

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan: The Journalists from Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and across the Country held a long march towards the Line of Control (LoC) on Saturday to express solidarity with oppressed Kashmiris under Indian Occupation and denounce Indian forces’ unprovoked firing targeting innocent civilians along the border.

The Kashmir Solidarity March was organized by the Journalists of Central Union of Journalists (CUOJ) led by the President CUOJ AJK Safeer Mir.

The Journalists from Islamabad and Murree were also among the participants.

Initially, the March was held from the Central Press Club Muzaffarabad to Burhan Wani Chowk. Later, the participants marched towards Chakothi, a town near the LoC, and then reached College Ground in the Chinari area of Hattian Bala district.

Holding AJK flags and anti-India banners in the hands, the participants raised slogans against illegal occupation of India in Jammu and Kashmir, and pledged to stand by Kashmiri brethren in all thick and thin.

The Indian Occupied Kashmir remains under a curfew and complete blackout since August 5 as all sources of communication have been snapped and the people are held hostage in their houses. The Kashmiris are facing acute shortage of essential commodities including baby food and life-saving medicines etc.

Even the Indian media haven’t been allowed by the New Delhi government to reach out to the Kashmiris, and highlight their agonies.

However the infuriated people in the Indian Occupied Kashmir have also themselves begun to resort to defy the curfew and are staging protest in the Valley against Indian government’s unlawful decision to repeal special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

Meanwhile, journalists in Islamabad along with Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qurashi lit candles to remind those who sacrificed their lives under Indian genocide in Indian occupied Kashmir.
