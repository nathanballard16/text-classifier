CAA protests: Gujarat govt imposes Sect 144 in Rajkot till Jan 1; internet restored in Bhopal

Outsiders instigated Delhi Gate protests, 40 detained, says Delhi Police

Today afternoon, a large crowd gathered in the area of Jama Masjid for prayers. After prayers, they wanted to proceed towards Jantar Mantar, but the senior officers present at the spot persuaded them not to march towards Jantar Mantar, as the capacity of Jantar Mantar is meant for gatherings below 1000 and also as no prior permission had been granted.

The protesters heeded to police advice and dispersed from Jama Masjid but assembled during dispersal at Delhi Gate. They were constantly persuaded to disperse from there and in spite of provocation from the crowd, the police maintained utmost restraint and used a persuasive approach. In the evening, suddenly some anti-social elements in the gathering started breaking the barricades and indulged in stone-pelting in a bid to march towards Jantar Mantar against the police advice. Police used water cannon and absolutely minimum force to push them back.

While the protesters were being pushed back, a private car parked at Subhash Marg, Darya Ganj was set ablaze. The police staff immediately doused the fire using water and handy fire extinguishers. Some police personnel including senior officers were injured in stone-pelting. Around 40 persons have been detained. Strict legal action will be taken against those who have been found involved in the violence and arson.

There were large gatherings also in the areas of Seelampur, Shastri Park, Jamia Nagar and Shaheen Bagh. Senior officers, with the help of respectables of the respective areas, constantly persuaded them and they were dispersed peacefully.

During today’s arrangements, in addition to officers and personnel of district police, a total of 58 companies of outside force had been deployed to bolster the strength of local police.
