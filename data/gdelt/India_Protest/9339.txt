West Bengal doctors' protest: Striking docs say CM free to choose venue, but meeting should be held in open

Talking to the media after a two-and-half-hour-long meeting of their governing body, a spokesperson of the joint forum of junior doctors said, "We are keen to end this impasse. We are ready to hold talks with the chief minister at a venue of her choice, provided it is held in the open, in the presence of media persons, and not behind closed doors."

The striking doctors in West Bengal softened their stand on Sunday and decided to hiold talks with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to immediately end the impasse, but stressed that the talks should be held in open and asserted that there should be media coverage of the deliberations. They said that the CM was free to decide the venue of the meeting with them. Banerjee had on Saturday invited the agitators for closed-door talks, but the offer was turned down by them.
