Burglars loot Amazon office, tie up guard; cops suspect sacked workers

Ludhiana: Some unidentified burglars barged into the office of Amazon in Shimlapuri, tied up the security guard, and escaped with a cash locker in the early hours of Sunday. While fleeing, they also took along with them the CCTV recording. Amazon officials said their office was shifted to Shimlapuri on June 18, and recently, they had replaced their staff. The police are suspecting the role of sacked workers behind the incident.

Assistant commissioner of police (Industrial Area B) Sandeep Vadhera said: “The workers closed the office on Saturday at 1am for the weekend. Thereafter, an elderly security guard, Amarjeet Singh remained in the office. At around 2.30am, the accused barged into the office by scaling the wall. Two of the accused thrashed the security guard, tied him up in a room, and escaped with the cash locker. Once the accused left the spot, the security guard somehow managed to set himself free and sounded the police. The manager is yet to inform police about the amount kept in the locker.

ACP Vadhera said: “The accused have also taken along the CCTV recording. They also knew the office is closed on Saturday and Sunday, and only one guard would be present. It seems they were quite familiar with the office and CCTVs etc. The workers who were fired recently are the prime suspects in this case, and the police have started tracing them.”

Meanwhile, an FIR has been registered against the unidentified accused by Shimlapuri police.
