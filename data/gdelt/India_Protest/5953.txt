Mumbai: 25 groups hold protest march against govt

Members of at least 25 groups on Thursday took out a protest march against several issues, including lynching, beef ban, casteism, curtailment of free speech and ‘saffronisation’ of education, among others. It is our responsibility to raise our voices if we feel equally concerned about hate, mob lynching and attacks on women’s rights. Acche din nahi aayenge, tum dekhte rahiyo” were mouthed by marchers, who included students, men, women and transgenders. Advertising“We have come to create a ripple in support of our rights that are being curtailed by the government. If women are not safe, if their issues are not given priority, society as a whole will never progress.
