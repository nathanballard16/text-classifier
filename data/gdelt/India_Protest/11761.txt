Hyderabad: Junior doctors in Hyderabad burnt the effigy of health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan and took out a funeral procession in government hospitals on Sunday to protest against the National Medical Commission Bill.

At Osmania Medical College, doctors took out the funeral procession demanding that the provision that creates a bridge course to allow non-medical professionals to practice medicine to be be removed as also the granting of licence to community health workers.

Dr Arjun Raj, Gandhi Hospital Junior Doctors Association president, explained, “Despite it being a Sunday, all junior doctors protested in the medical colleges and the protests across the state will continue. We will not relent till the Centre removes these clauses.” Three undergraduate doctors are on hunger strike and the junior doctors stated that they will not relent and get back to work. A delegation of junior doctors also met health minister Etala Rajendar and gave him a representation against the NMC Bill.
