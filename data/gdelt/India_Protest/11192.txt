24-hour Manipur bandh today against death of school student

IMPHAL: A Joint Action Committee (JAC), set up in protest against inaction over the death of a school girl, on Tuesday called a 24-hour state-wide bandh from Wednesday morning.Last Thursday, a 13-year-old from Thangmeiband Meisnam Leikai was found hanging - kneeling, her feet touching the floor and her leg smeared in mud - inside her hostel room at Standard Robarth Higher Secondary School at Canchipur in Imphal West. Police have registered a case and launched an investigation, but no arrest has been made so far.On Tuesday, a large number of locals and students - led by All Manipur Students' Union (AMSU) - blocked the busy Thangmeiband Road, near the western gate of DM College here, in protest. As a symbolic sign of protest, the family has not claimed her body, which lies at the mortuary of Regional Institute of Medical Sciences here. The town wore a deserted look as shops and business establishment remained closed. The streets also wear a desolate look as protesters stopped vehicular movement.AMSU president Peter Laishram, while demanding that the government arrest and punish the minor's killers, warned of launching different forms of agitation if the demand is not complied with.Medical personnel, patients, religious programmes and fire service will be exempted from the purview of the bandh, a press release from the JAC convenor Th Chitaranjan said. The JAC sought support and cooperation from local clubs, women folks bodies, civil society organisations, students' organisations in ensuring justice for the school girl.
