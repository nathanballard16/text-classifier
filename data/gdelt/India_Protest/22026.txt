Bangladesh to pull back its illegal migrant in India: Report

Dhaka : Any of the Bangladesh citizen (if proven) staying in India illegally will be taken back by the nation, an advisor to Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told PTI.

“We will take back any Bangladeshi citizen staying in India illegally. But India has to prove that,” PTI quoted Gauhar Rizvi, Advisor to Hasina on international affairs, as saying.

He also mentioned that the decision on Citizenship Amendment Bill is an internal matter of India and the neighbouring nation has no right to make a comment on it.

Denying any unfair treatment towards minorities living in Bangladesh, Rizvi said Muslims, Hindus, Christians and Buddhists co-exist peacefully in the country.

Rizvi's statement came days after two Bangladeshi ministers cancelled their visit to India amid ongoing protest against the passage of the Bill.

Bangladesh Foreign Minister A K Abdul Momen said the allegations of repression of minorities in Bangladesh were “untrue”. “Whoever gave them the information, it is not correct,” he said. “Many important decisions of our country are taken by persons belonging to different religions… we never judge anybody by their religion,” he said.
