A PIL was filed in the Bombay High Court on Wednesday by a 21-year-old engineering student seeking that operations at the Tarapur Atomic Power Station and BARC be stopped in the wake of tremors in Palghar. The PIL states that the government should intervene and check if a proper disaster management plan is in place.
