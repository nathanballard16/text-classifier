Missing toddler: Citizens hold rally

Mr Tiwari said, It has to be understood that a child cannot survive in water for more than six hours and its three days now.

Mumbai: The residents of Goregaon held a protest from Ambedkar chowk to the office of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Saturday afternoon demanding justice for Divyansh Singh, the 18-month-old who went missing on Wednesday. After three days, the body has not been found.

“The authorities stopped the search operation on Friday night, however, they re-started it on Saturday morning for two hours just to show their ‘seriousness’ in search operation,” said Shravan Tiwari the local activist who was protesting since Thursday morning agai-nst BMC’s ‘negligence’.

Divyansh’s family is demanding the resignation of the mayor of Mumbai and is also demanding for an FIR against the BMC officers for their negligence of leaving the drain open.

Suraj Singh, father of Divyansh, said, “None of the BMC officers have come and interacted with me. I want to meet the municipal commissioner and seek answers for the loss of my child.”

Mr Tiwari said, “We want to register FIR under IPC section 304 (A) — death due to negligence against the BMC. However, the police is not ready to accept our FIR since in their record the child is lost. It has to be understood that a child cannot survive in water for more than six hours and its three days now.”

Deputy commissioner of Police, Vinaykumar Rathod said, “We have recorded statements of BMC as well as the family. We are examining the CCTV footage before reaching any conclusion”.
