MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Wednesday stayed an auction scheduled for Thursday of a plot adjacent to the jinxed 56-floor under-construction tower Palais Royale at Worli Naka The city collector was to auction a 3,000-square-foot portion of an open plot at Shree Ram Mills to recover dues for a flat buyer under the real estate regulatory Act. The buyer had cancelled the agreement following inordinate delay in possession.The stay comes after an official liquidator (OL) appointed for developer Shree Ram Urban Infrastructure Ltd submitted a report objecting to the auction. The OL, a government officer, was appointed in 2016 to oversee distribution of dues to creditors of the developer.Prathamesh Kamat, counsel appearing for the OL, said the collector was seeking to auction the plot without consulting with the liquidator, as the high court had directed in an earlier December 2018 order.Kamat also said the plot being auctioned was different from the asset, a spacious flat with garages, under the Maharashtra Real Estate Regulatory Authority (MahaRera) order.The developer is in provisional liquidation and is the owner of Shree Ram Mills.Justice K R Shriram , who heard the matter on Wednesday, directed in an interim order that the auction not be held until further orders, and placed the matter for hearing after a month.A couple, Ajit Sanghavi and Malini Sanghavi, had filed a complaint in November 2017 before MahaRera against the developer.Sanghavis’ counsel Snehal Paranjpe pointed out that last December, the high court had permitted the auction after MahaRera held in favour of buyers in March 2018. She said the collector has heard the OL before proceeding with the recovery measures. The couple wanted the high court to direct the liquidator to pay them Rs 24 crore with 10% annual interest from July 1, 2018, till repayment of the amount as directed by MahaRera.On December 12, 2018, the HC had directed the city collector to sell assets of Shree Ram Mills in consultation with the OL and the amounts recovered will be deposited with the OL who would then invest it in a fixed deposit of a nationalized bank and not disburse any amount without the court’s prior permission. The OL said he had written to the collector on July 17 to stop the auction which it said was in complete violation of the HC order.Kalpataru Properties, through counsel Fredun DeVitre, also said the auction would affect their existing right of way as their projects are in the vicinity.
