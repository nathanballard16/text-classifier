‘CAA & NRC Have Nothing to Do With Indian Muslims,’ Says PM Modi

Speaking about the authorisation of unauthorised colonies, the prime minister took a dig at the Aam Aadmi Party government in Delhi, saying that the Kejriwal-led government politicised the issues of people.

“They had illegally given 2,000 lavish bungalows to their people. No one knows what was given to whom in lieu of that,” he said.
