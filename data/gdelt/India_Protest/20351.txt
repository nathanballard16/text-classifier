The plea further said that due to ongoing protests day-to-day working of administration stands affected. JNU students have been protesting for over two weeks over a recent hostel fee hike.

The plea said that Delhi Police has violated the order by refusing and failing to take action to maintain law and order in the university.

The Delhi Police had registered several FIRs against students in connection with the vandalism, damaging public property and others since they started their strike over five weeks ago against hostel fee hike. (ANI)
