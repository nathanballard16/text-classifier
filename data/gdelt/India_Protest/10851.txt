Under-trial prisoners on hunger strike to protest food quality

A few under-trial prisoners went on a hunger strike at the Central Jail here Wednesday to protest against the quality of food served to them, an official said.

According to the agitating prisoners, the food served to them is bland and flavourless, said sub-divisional magistrate J P Yadav.

The jail houses around 400 under-trial prisoners.

He visited the jail Wednesday after the jail authorities informed the district administration about the strike, and spoke to the prisoners, Yadav added.

The prisoners demanded that the earlier practice of allowing family members to bring home-food when they came to meet the inmates should be resumed.

The government had discontinued this practice after the 2016 jail break in Bhopal, he said.

He has informed higher authorities about the demands, Yadav said, adding that the jail administration is trying to end the strike.
