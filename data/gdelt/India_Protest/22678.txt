Rise up stronger: Jamia website hacked, intruders back students' anti-CAA protests

The official website of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) was on Thursday hacked by Dark Knight hackers. The message which was posted on the official Jamia Millia Islamia website said that it was hacked in support of the students of the university who have been protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The message on the website of Jamia Millia Islamia read: "Hacked by Dark Knight to support jamia students.. Jai Hind!"

The hacked website also said, "Brave students of Jamia keep fighting against the oppression. Don't let the movement die. Every time they hit you Rise up stronger! Rise up stronger! Rise up stronger! Rise up stronger!"

"Modi-Shah thinks we are dumb like their followers but we the students read. We know how the first people would be declared foreigners by NRC and then everyone will be absorbed back through CAA except our Muslims," the message read.

It said, "Every attack on us students is a blow to your grand empire of hatred. Students it's time to organize and unite! Rise our cause on the international stage and fight like Hong Kong students because it's time to save our democracy!"

Violent protests erupted near Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi on Sunday during the stir over the new citizenship law with incidents of arson and loot reported from the state and the northeast.

Soon after the violence, Jamia Millia Islamia Chief Proctor Waseem Ahmed Khan claimed that the Delhi Police entered the campus forcibly without any permission and beat up staff members and students who were forced to leave the campus.

Condemning the police action, university vice chancellor Najma Akhtar said students who were inside the library which was allegedly surrounded by the police have been taken out and are safe.

Police said they entered the university campus only to control the situation, after protesters indulged in violence.
