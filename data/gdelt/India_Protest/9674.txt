Sindhubaadh: Hyderabad HC puts a stay order on the film’s release after Baahubali makers file a case against the Producer

Sindhubhaadh starring Vijay Sethupathi was set to release today (June 21). But it didn’t because the film fell in a controversy due to non-payment of dues. The makers of Baahubali, Arka Media Works have filed a case against Sindhubaadh’s producer Rajarajan. Reportedly, the producer has not paid dues over the distribution rights of the film. The release of the film is stalled till the issue gets resolved.

Prasad Devineni and Shobu Yarlagadda of Arka Media Works gave the distribution rights in Tamil Nadu to Rajarajan headed K Productions. Even after the massive success of Baabhubali and the film making history, Rajarajan did not settle dues with Arka Media Works. According to the reports, K Productions have managed to pay only Rs 12.5 crore out of the Rs 28 crores at which the rights were bought. The rest of the amount was taken by Rajarajan as a loan. The makers of Baahubali have now filed a case against the K Production’s film Sindhubaadh and Enai Noki Paayum Thota. The Hyderabad Court as an immediate action has put a stay order on the film’s release till the dues are settled.

The producer tried to associate with other producer but the theatre owners denied from screening the film without a NOC from the Digital Service Providers but they too refused. Now, we can only wait and watch how this matter takes turn. Stay tuned to CineBlitz for more updates.
