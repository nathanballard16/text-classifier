Javed Akhtar says Sonchiraiya has a well-written script with amazing performances.

Akhtar interacted with media at the special screening of Sonchiraiya on Wednesday in Mumbai.

Talking about the film, the veteran lyricist and poet said, "Usually, when people ask how the movie was it isn't easy to answer but with Sonchiraiya, I don't have to face such a problem. Because it is an amazing film, it has great direction amazing performances and a very well written script. It is a really good film."

This, Abhishek Chaubey’s dacoit drama Sonchiriya had been presented with a legal notice by a Gwalior-based NGO which claimed the film, shows Chambal in a bad light. While the people of Chambal a small town in Madhya Pradesh have protested against the film too, when asked to comment on it Javed said, "Now that the film has been made, it was going to be released anyways. It is a good film and there should be no issues."

He also added that he has been quite impressed with the recent shows and films getting released.

"Honestly, in recent times the work that has been made is really good. I saw Zoya's film, I saw this one even the web series, Made in Heaven. These are different films and stories but one thing common between them is a level of realism which has increased in recent times. And we used to have theatrical dialogues but now we get to see a real conversation and not at the cost of dramatic effect. I am very impressed with this work." he said.

'Sonchiraiya’ revolves around Chambal dacoits and is set in the 1970s and in that film, Sushant, and Bhumi, both play a dacoit. Bhumi plays Sushant’s love interest.

The film shot in the Chambal ravines will release on 1st March.
