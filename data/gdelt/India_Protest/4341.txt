More than 200 BJP workers including BJP MP Anoop Mishra were rounded up during the two hours melee.Earlier on Monday, BJP MLA from Narela constituency ( Bhopal ) – Vishwas Sarang – was booked for ‘forceful’ inauguration of a park in his constituency. Congress wanted Jyotiraditya Scindia to inaugurate this medical facility and BJP opposed.Several BJP workers gathered at the site in the morning and shouted slogans against the rival party. Congress MLA Munnalal Goyal was stopped from going towards the venue of inaugural ceremony.When police tried to intervene and control the situation, BJP workers landed into heated argument forcing defensive action by the law enforcers. Congress workers claim that the BJP had only laid foundation stone for this hospital, the construction work started in a full swing only after Kamal Nath became chief minister. Inauguration of a railway overbridge by Scindia has also been postponed following BJP’s objections.
