China bigger strategic problem for India than Pakistan: Prof Pant

GORAKHPUR: China, not Pakistan, is India’s strategic problem as it has been creating hurdles for our country at international forums, Prof Harsh V Pant from King’s College, London, said.Addressing a seminar at DDU Gorakhpur University during the 38th convocation week on Wednesday, Prof Pant, who is also head of strategic studies at Observer Research Foundation, New Delhi, said: “India is going through the era of basic changes. India’s diplomatic camp has been able to get big success in isolating Pakistan internationally.”“China, not Pakistan, is our strategic problem. Today, Pakistan is standing in front of us because China is supporting it. On international stage, China is continuously creating hurdles for India. The situation has changed a lot after abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir but China as a third party is a big hurdle in the way of PoK,” he said.He said the Narendra Modi government had started giving importance to groups demanding freedom for PoK and Baluchistan and it would fetch far-reaching benefits for India.“India has given a clear message that it won’t bow in front of any threat. We stood against China on Doklam issue and protested against China’s ambitious BRI (Belt and Road Initiative) project,” Prof Pant said.“Earlier, India used to adopt the policy of restraint and moderation on Pakistan-sponsored terrorism which continuously harmed us. The Modi government has changed the policy which is dynamic and proactive,” he added.He said India’s relations with other countries had improved as the Modi government was keeping national interest on top while taking any decision.He said Rafale jets would enhance India’s military capability and make the country more powerful.
