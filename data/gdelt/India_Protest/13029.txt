VC announces change in syllabus, students shocked

SURAT: The 50th special convocation of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University VNSGU ) held on Thursday was marred in controversies, beginning with absence of the chief guest — BJP’s national general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP from Rajasthan, Bhupender Yadav.The second controversy was triggered with the surprise announcement by VNSGU vice chancellor Shivendra Gupta that the entire syllabus of under-graduate (UG) and post-graduate (PG) courses would be overhauled from next academic year. This sparked discussion within university academic circles about what kind of changes were being planned and who was monitoring the process. It even left several senior faculty members bewildered.“I assure all of you that the final draft of the new syllabi will be ready by October 2 — Mahatma Gandhi Jayanti. The university plans to change the entire syllabi of both UG and PG and implement it from 2020-21,” Gupta said during his address.He spoke about a recently held workshop at VNSGU on ‘New Syllabus for New India’ for 360 degree change in the existing syllabi.“There is a need for change in syllabus but so far I have not been informed about it,” said Rakesh Desai, head of English department.“I have been demanding change in syllabus and focus on employability. But concern is how many senior academicians are taken into confidence,” said Sanjay Desai, a syndicate member.In middle of the convocation function, a group of students staged protest and started shouting slogans against vice chancellor VC Shivendra Gupta. They demanded that students with ATKT (students who have failed in two subjects in any of the exam) be admitted in final semester. Police had to be called to remove the students from the hall. The students were showing placard with ‘VC Go Back’ written on it.A total of 3,710 students were awarded degrees and 62 researchers were granted PhD and MPhil.During the event, the electricity got disconnected twice — first for a few seconds when dean of a faculty was announcing award of degrees and then for a longer period few minutes later with audience booing at the organisers.
