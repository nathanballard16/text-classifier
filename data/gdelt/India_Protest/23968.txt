Modi Defends India Citizenship Law as Protests Continue

Protests against a controversial citizenship bill in India continued Sunday despite a government ban against demonstrations.

At least 23 people have been killed in nearly two weeks of demonstrations and violence after India's parliament passed the Citizenship Amendment Act which critics have deemed anti-Muslim.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a rally for his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in which he defended the law and called on citizens to respect the decision of the government.

The new law allows for Hindus, Christians and other religious minorities who are in India illegally to become citizens, if they can prove they were persecuted because of their religion in Muslim-majority Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The new law, however, does not apply to Muslims.

"People who are trying to spread lies and fear, look at my work. If you see any trace of divisiveness in my work, show it to the world," Modi told the rally. He said the opposition Congress party was trying to "push not only New Delhi but other parts of the country into a fear psychosis."
