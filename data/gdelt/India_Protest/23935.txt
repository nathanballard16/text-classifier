Pous Mela, the famed winter event on the Visva-Bharati campus in Santiniketan, is set to turn into a “political battleground” between the Trinamul Congress and the BJP over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens this year. The CPM, Congress and the RSP, besides Trinamul and the BJP, will put up stalls at the fair that will be held from December 24 to 27.

Sources said the CPM had become the first party in 1971 to open a stall at the annual four-day fair that was started in 1894 by Debendranath Tagore to promote rural arts and crafts. “But this year, a particular issue will be the focus of all parties at the stalls for the first time,” said an organiser. “They usually display their party literature at stalls, but this year, all of it will be about the CAA.” Roughly 1,500 stalls will come up at the fair this year. “Trinamul had set up its first tent here (fair) in 2007. The BJP opened its stall after the general election in 2014,” said the organiser. According to the organisers, Pous Mela’s status as a major event in the Bengali calendar made it an obvious choice for political parties to voice their opinions. “The timing of the CAA and the protests in Bengal make the Pous Mela an ideal venue for parties to campaign,” said a Visva-Bharati student. Varsity sources said the fair saw an average footfall of 1 lakh people a day and a steady stream of national and international visitors over the past few decades.
