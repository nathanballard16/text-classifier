Patnaik to join BJD's protest on Tuesday for minimum support price of paddy

Chief Minister is scheduled to join the BJD's day-long demonstration demanding a hike in MSP of paddy, at Talkatora Stadium in New on Tuesday.

"Our party and chief minister will join us at the demonstration," BJD MP Prasanna Acharya said over phone from New

He said Patnaik will also lead a party delegation and meet in the evening.

The party will submit a memorandum to the President, Acharya, who is also of the president of Biju Krushak Janata Dal, said.

The BJD has been demanding a hike in paddy MSP to Rs 2,930 per quintal and a resolution in this regard was passed in the assembly, supported by both the and the BJP.

However, the Centre did not accept the state's demand and even Prime Minister refused to meet the delegation of in this regard, Acharya said.

Apart from the chief minister, ministers, BJD MPs, MLAs, leaders, farmers and youth wings of the party will join the protest in New

The Opposition BJP, on the other hand, has said it would gherao the state secretariat and 'Naveen Niwas', on the farmers' issue.

"The BJD has failed to provide basic amenities like irrigation, power supply, storage facilities to the farmers in the state. The BJD leaders are holding a picnic at Delhi," said BJP spokesman Golak Mohapatra.

Describing the BJD's planned demonstration at Delhi as a farce, Odisha Pradesh Committee (OPCC) president Niranjan Patnaik in a statement said: "This is another gimmick of the BJD before the 2019 general election to woo farmers."



The OPCC chief added that prior to the 2014 elections, the BJD had taken its party members to Delhi by a special train to demand special-category status for Odisha, but the result was "a big zero".
