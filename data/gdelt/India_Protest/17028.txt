India ranks 13th for impunity for killers of journalists

India is one of the 13 worst countries when it comes to impunity for killings of journalists, according to Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), an international non-profit working on press freedom across the world.

In its latest Impunity Index published on Tuesday, CPJ stated that between September 1, 2009 and August 31, 2019 there were 17 cases of unsolved murders of journalists in the country. India however is at the bottom of the impunity table of the 13 countries, as only countries with more than 5 unsolved journalist killings in the last decade are mentioned in the index.

The other twelve nations that are mentioned in the index, starting from the country where journalist killings have maximum impunity are Somalia, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Philippines, Afghanistan, Mexico, Pakistan, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia and Nigeria.

According to the index, India did not see a single journalist being killed in 2019 till August 31. However, five journalists were killed in the country in 2018, of which four were murders with confirmed motives, and one was killed in crossfire. India had seen the same number of journalists being killed in 2016 and 2017, while four journalists were killed in 2015.

The bloodiest years for journalists in India since 1992, the year since CPJ data is available, have been 1997, with seven journalists being killed, followed by 2013 when six journalists were killed.

Kashmiri senior journalist and editor of Rising Kashmir Shujaat Bukhari, who was shot dead by unidentified gunmen last year is mentioned as being murdered for his work. Other journalists who are mentioned for being murdered in India in 2018 include Chandan Tiwari of Aj Newspaper, Sandeep Sharma of News World and Navin Nischal of Dainik Bhaskar. Doordarshan’s Achyutananda Sahu is mentioned under the category of killed in crossfire after he was shot dead in a Maoist attack in October 2018.
