UCSD seeks advice from Dalai Lama about creating an Institute for Empathy and Compassion

The Buddhist monk visited the University of California San Diego in 2012 during his "Compassion Without Border" tours. He returned in 2017 at the request of Chancellor Pradeep Khosla to give the commencement address. During both visits, he met with the university's leading scientists to talk about everything from how kindness and compassion can affect a person's physiology to the social impact of climate change.
