Not releasing 'Total Dhamaal' in Pakistan: Director

New Delhi, Feb 18 : The team of "Total Dhamaal" has decided to not release their film in Pakistan, said the film's director Indra Kumar.

On Monday, the cast of the film announced that the movie will not be released in Pakistan in the wake of the Pulwama attack.

Standing by the decision, Kumar told IANS: "Being a part of the Indian film industry, it's the team's way of showing protest against the heinous terror attack. It's our way of supporting our nation in hard times. Why should we release our movie in a country that is attacking our people?"

The whole team, including actors Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene, Ajay Devgn and Riteish Deshmukh, decided not to release the film in Pakistan, said kumar who has directed 16 Bollywood films and has produced one movies.

"People are angry and their anger is justified. I am with my countrymen and to support them, I am not releasing my film in Pakistan," he said. "Modiji is a great leader. I am sure he will find out some way," he added.

Apart from cancelling the release of the film in Pakistan, the team of "Total Dhamaal" has donated Rs 50 lakh to the families of the CRPF personnel who lost their lives in the attack.

In the worst terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir since militancy erupted in the state in 1989, a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) suicide bomber on February 14 rammed his vehicle packed with explosives into a CRPF bus on the Jammu-Srinagar highway in the Pulwama district.

The attack claimed the lives of 40 troopers.
