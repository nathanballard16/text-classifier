Kin of Srinagar Central Jail inmates hold protest for prisoners' rights

Relatives of Srinagar Central Jail inmates staged a protest here demanding the prisoners are not shifted out of Kashmir and that their rights are upheld.

The protestors alleged that they were not being allowed to meet their jailed relatives following a clash between inmates and prison staff last week.

PDP president Mehbooba Mufti expressed serious concern over the alleged violation of prisoner's rights in Central Jail and "use of brute force" against protesting inmates.

"It looks like the Government of India wants to turn Srinagar Central Jail into another Guantanamo," she told reporters in Budgam.
