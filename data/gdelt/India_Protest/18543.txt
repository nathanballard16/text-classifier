Prashant Kishore's Vehicle Attacked by BJYM Activists

Patna: Janata Dal – U leader and Nitish Kumar's personal advisor Prashant Kishore survived an attack on his vehicle when members of the youth wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at Patna University pelted stone on his car damaging its glasses while accusing him of trying to influence the result of the Patna University Students' Union (PUSU) elections in favor of the JD-U candidates.

It happened after Kishore arrived at the office of PU Vice Chancellor Ras Bihari Prasad Singh on Monday. The two, in presence of a few other PU officials, talked for nearly an hour the content of which was not made available to the press.

By then the news had leaked that Kishore was holding meeting with the Vice Chancellor. Enraged by what they described as the violation of the PU election code of conduct, members of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) gathered outside the VC's office chanting anti-JD-U slogans while accusing Kishore of interfering in the university election with intent to tilt the poll results in JD-U's favor.

When Kishore and his aides got back in the car to leave, they were attacked by the angry students. The driver of the vehicle managed to rush out of the campus and while no one was said to be hurt in the incident, the vehicle was damaged in the assault.

Police had to resort to lathi charge to disperse the belligerent students.

Later, a delegation of the BJYM met with the Governor and handed him a memo to complain about the JD-U's blatant attempt to influence the students' election.

Meanwhile, the VC said that he had no idea Prashant Kishore was coming to meet him. Kishore also denied the accusations saying he was there not to talk about the election but he just happened to be with his uncle Uday Kant who was there to discuss plans to make Patna University buildings earthquake-proof.

As reported before, PUSU elections are to be held on Tuesday.
