New Delhi:

IPS officer Anuj Sharma, currently posted as AGD & IGP Operation, has been reappointed as the Kolkata Police Commissioner. The development comes days after he was removed from the post by the Election Commission of India.

Dr Rajesh Kumar, Additional Director General of Police (ADG), Pollution Control Board, was made the new Kolkata top cop.

The poll body also named Avannu Ravindranath, DC (Airport Division) of Bidhannagar, as the new superintendent of police (SP) of Birbhum, appointed Srihari Pandey, DC KAP, 3rd Battalion, as the SP of Diamond Harbour and , Natarajan Ramesh Babu, ADG and IGP, Operations, as the Bidhannagar police commissioner.

Sharma was present with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee when she started her dharna to protest a CBI action against the then Kolkata police commissioner in connection with its probe in the Saradha scam.

Sharma had replaced Kumar in mid-February.
