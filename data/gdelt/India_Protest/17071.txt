Delhi: Contracts end, guest teachers face uncertain future yet again

On March 6, the Delhi Cabinet cleared a policy which enabled guest teachers to “function with the DoE till they attain the age of superannuation”. But this was passed on to the L-G, who has not approved it yet.

With their contracts having ended Thursday, thousands of guest teachers working in Delhi government schools find themselves in the same situation they were in eight months ago, when they protested in large numbers against expired contracts and the lack of job security.

When the contracts of 22,000 guest teachers had ended on February 28, they protested in massive numbers outside Education Minister Manish Sisodia’s residence.

On March 6, the Delhi Cabinet cleared a policy which enabled guest teachers to “function with the DoE till they attain the age of superannuation”. But this was passed on to the L-G, who has not approved it yet.

“We have no option but to go back and protest outside the education minister’s residence,” said a member of the All India Guest Teachers’ Association.

In the meantime, DSSSB has selected 11,056 candidates to join Delhi government and MCD schools as regular teachers. However, in an affidavit to the Delhi High Court, the Delhi government submitted than only a fraction of guest teachers qualified for regular positions.

On Thursday the court directed the DSSSB to file an affidavit in four weeks, laying out the schedule for recruitment of another 15,000 regular teachers.
