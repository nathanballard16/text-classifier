News of mass protests emerges from Kashmir amid lockdown

News of the first mass protests have emerged from the Kashmir valley, a week after the Indian government stripped the state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special autonomy and imposed political rule from the capital of Delhi.

Videos show the crowd shouting slogans and holding banners that say, "We want freedom". Indian security forces reportedly fired tear gas and shot live bullets in the air to disperse the protesters.
