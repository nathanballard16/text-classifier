Khalsa was suspended from the AAP in 2015. Before that, he was in the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) which is an ally of the BJP and an NDA constituent.

Khalsa is a 1974 batch IFS officer. He was posted in Oslo, Norway, during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots. He had quit the job in protest against the genocide of Sikhs.

In 1996, he was elected as MP from Bhatinda Lok Sabha seat on a SAD ticket.

After joining the BJP, Khalsa said that the BJP is the only party which can lead the country in the right direction.
