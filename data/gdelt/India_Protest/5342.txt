He also questioned that, in the educational institutions belongs to Mohan they announce 25 percent reservation to poor students, and on their name's you are applying of fees reimbursement, is it not you making the money?

Is it not you, who are collecting 5-6 lakhs from students in the name of the management seat? Kutumbarao has demanded an explanation from Mohan Babu.

From the students, you collect lakhs of rupees but for the college lecturers, you will pay lesser salaries. He commented that on the name of Vidya, Mohan Babu is doing business.
