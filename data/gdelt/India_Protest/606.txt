HC seeks response from Minister for riding bike sans helmet

Says safety applies to Health Minister too

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday took cognisance of photographs of Health Minister C. Vijaya Baskar riding a bike without helmet in a rally and observed that safety applied to Health Minister too.

A Division Bench of Justices K. K. Sasidharan and P. D. Audikesavalu made the observation after taking a look at the photographs presented before the court while continuing to hear the public interest litigation petition filed by activist ‘Traffic’ Ramasamy. The court directed the Minister to file his response.

Mr. Ramasamy had sought a direction to the police to act on his complaints against Mr. Vijaya Baskar and AIADMK MLA V. V. Rajan Chellappa for acting against the law in Pudukottai and Madurai respectively.

In his plea Mr. Ramasamy complained that Mr. Vijaya Baskar, as part of an awareness campaign in Pudukottai, rode a motorcycle without helmet with 100 other volunteers. Though a complaint was lodged against this act, no action was taken, he alleged.

He also sought a direction to the police to take action against Madurai North MLA Rajan Chellappa, who had staged a protest against the Vijay starrer Sarkar in front of a cinema theatre in the city. The party cadre had caused hindrance to the public, said Mr. Ramasamy. The court adjourned the case for further hearing till January 18.
