Silent protest to protect trees at All Saints Church

A silent protest to protect scores of old trees on the All Saints Church premises on Richmond Road saw the participation of over 100 citizens from across the city.

The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. (BMRCL) is taking over a portion of the church land for the construction of the underground station at Vellara Junction, as part of the Gottigere – Nagawara line. Though BMRCL has assured the church of returning the land after the construction of the underground station, protesters alleged that the existing children’s home and an old age home on campus would have to be demolished. They also claimed that the land would not be able to bear any more trees.

Prakash Belawadi, renowned theatre person, who also participated in the protest, said, “People’s sentiments and religious beliefs are being neglected.”

The protesters, who included members of the congregation of All Saints Church, also took out a rally from the church to St. Joseph’s College of Commerce. They have urged BMRCL to alter the plan and ensure that no trees, some of which are older than the church, are felled.

Meanwhile, an official from the church, on condition of anonymity, told The Hindu that BMRCL had approached them with the detailed project report (DPR), and sought a portion of the campus for a period of two years. They also claimed that no part of the church would be demolished or affected by the underground work.
