Books in local dialects ease communication in tribal schools

VADODARA: It was a pleasant surprise for students from Class I to III at the government school of Mogra village of Kawant taluka in Chhota Udepur district when the teacher recited words like 'gaveh', 'hugeh' 'huvnu', 'habvehe' from a textbook, and not Gujarati as usual.The ennui on their innocent faces disappeared with the growing excitement of hearing her speak in their dialect and soon curiosity took over. When they demanded to know how she could speak their language, the teacher showed them a book which has pictorial illustrations of girls and boys singing, smelling, sleeping and listening - all explained in Bareli dialect - along with translations in Gujarati and English languages!The book, a result of year-long research of Bareli and Tadvi dialects, has been prepared so that the students who have grown up listening to these dialects do not feel alienated and enjoy what is being taught in their school. Each of these books will have 1,250 words which are spoken in day-to day usage.The Adivasi Academy of Bhasha Research and Publication Centre (BRPC), along with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industries, has come up with two such books."Primary class students in the tribal belt are exposed to Gujarati language only when they enter the school premises as they speak in their local dialects at home and with friends," said Vasant Rathwa, project coordinator at the academy. He said that as Gujarati is almost a new language for these young kids, there is a huge communication gap between the teacher and the taught, as most of the teachers too are from other parts of the state.Rathwa explained that the basic aim of the books is to arrest the drop-out rate among tribal students, as many of them leave school not being able to communicate or learn in Gujarati.Last month, the Adivasi Academy had introduced the books for demonstrative purposes at schools in Mogra, Banjur, Kankuvasan and Jemalgadh. "It was highly successful as the students could relate to what was being taught," he said.The academy will soon have final copies of the books which they plan to introduce in the schools of Hanfeshwar region where Bareli is spoken and in Tadvi dialect Naswadi and Sankheda taluka. The teachers will also be oriented at the academy with the dialects to make their teaching from these books easier."This will be a model book as we will also approach the governments of our neighbouring states where different dialects are spoken, in case they want to replicate the idea," Rathwa added.
