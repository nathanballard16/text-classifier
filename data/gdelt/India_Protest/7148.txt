SC to hear today Congress' complaint on EC's 'inaction'

NEW DELHI: Having succeeded in stopping release of PM Narendra Modi’s biopic till the elections, Congress on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Election Commission to decide in 24 hours complaints of model code of conduct violations by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi agreed to hear the petition filed by Congress MP and women’s wing president Sushmita Dev on senior advocate A M Singhvi’s request but not before disapproving the reluctance of the counsel to tell the court directly that the petition was against Modi and Shah.The CJI told Singhvi, “We will hear your mentioning the last because you are not clear what is the issue and who are the persons against whom you are making the allegation. You mention that there are a number of complaints made before the EC and that no action is taken. Why this game of hide and seek?”Nudged to give details, Singhvi said as many as eight complaints of MCC violation by Modi and Shah are pending with the EC for nearly a month and the commission was unusually lethargic to deal with them. He cited the SC direction in Trinamool Congress leader Mahua Moitra’s petition leading to the EC handing out a ban on campaigning to the person who had made sexually coloured remarks against her in West Bengal Sushmita Dev, daughter of late Congress leader Santosh Mohan Dev, in her petition filed through advocate Sunil Fernandes said since March 10, when elections were notified and the MCC came into force, Modi and Shah had “indulged in delivering hate speeches and repeatedly used the armed forces for political propaganda, despite a clear prohibition by the EC”.“The PM, in blatant violation of the MCC, held a rally on the day of polling in Gujarat on April 23, the date of voting for the third phase of election. Such brazen violations are neither minor nor procedural,” she said and gave six instances of MCC violation by Modi and two instances relating to Shah.The Silchar MP said EC’s inaction for more than three weeks appeared to be a “tacit endorsement of the statements (by Modi and Shah) and clean chit to individuals whose statements and actions are ex-facie in violation of the provisions of the Representation of the People Act and the Election Rules 1961, including MCC”.Dev, 46, clarified that filing the petition was not intended to “call in question the ensuing elections or to seek to interrupt, obstruct or protract the said election but seeks appropriate directions to sub-serve the progress and conduct of the elections in accordance with law... Because there cannot be two sets of rules, one for the PM and the BJP president and another for the rest of the candidates contesting the elections”.
