The ministry order was quoted by IANS as saying "The above-said committee is requested to initiate dialogue with the students and the university administration immediately and submit recommendations on the action to be taken."

JNU students are protesting against the university administration from October 29, by boycotting classes and examinations. Today, they marched towards Parliament on its first day of the winter session.

The tussle between JNU students and Delhi police continues leading to blockage of roads and metro stations in the national capital.
