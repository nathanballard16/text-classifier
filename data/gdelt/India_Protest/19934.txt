‘Landmark day for India’: PM Modi after Rajya Sabha passes citizenship bill

"Muslims not included for giving citizenship because..." says Amit Shah

"During UPA govt, the then Rajasthan govt wrote to then HM Chidamabaram..." says Shah

Rohingyas not included in the Bill because they don't come to India directly, says Shah

India will never be Muslim-free nation, says Amit Shah

Neither CAB is anti-Muslim, nor abrogation of Article 370 is, says Amit Shah

Just like Article 370, Triple Talaq, CAB is not anti-Muslim, says Shah

After a debate that lasted over 6 hours, Rajya Sabha on Wednesday cleared the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill piloted by Home Minister Amit Shah.

Since 12 pm, 44 lawmakers from different parties shared their stand on Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the Rajya Sabha.

In the 245-member Rajya Sabha, 125 people voted in support of the bill, whereas 105 people voted against it.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2019 (CAB) was moved in the Rajya Sabha by the Union home minister Amit Shah.

As the debate concluded, Amit Shah addressed Rajya Sabha and answered to questions raised by the members in the house before the voting on the Bill began.

The bill had an easy passage in the Lok Sabha where the BJP-led NDA has majority. The Lower House passed the bill 334-106 after a fierce day-long debate on Monday.

There have been wide-spread protests against the bill in the northeast including Assam and Tripura.
