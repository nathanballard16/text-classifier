Kashmir continues to stay tense on the sixth day straight after the government of India decided to abrogate Article 370 in the state and divide it into two union territories.

On Friday, while the prayers at the Jama Masjid were not allowed people did pray in the local mosques. In Soura area of Srinagar, protests had broken out and people clashed with the security forces in which around six were injured. The government was seen trying to take stock of the situation.

"We are moving around to see if the stock was adequate. The hospitals are functioning. Eid is coming and we will celebrate it here", said SP Malik, Governor of J&K.

The restrictions continue to be in place on the ground. Movement of people is under check. The back lanes in the Srinagar city do see some movement.

"It is difficult to move around at ease. We are moving around and trying to find out what we can get in terms of groceries but it is hard", said Mushtaq Ahmad who had come out on his scooty to find provisions.

Communication is still off the grid. There are no phones and no internet. Due to this people in Kashmir hardly have any mode through which they may reach out to their families and relatives.

"I have been trying to find out about my son for the last six days. He was out of the state and had to return, but hasn't yet. We are all worried", said a woman.

The government has said that they will set up 300 phones around the valley so that people can use them and call. However, so far none has been set up. Eid is around the corner and many people plan to return home during this time.

But the communication gap is making it tough for people as they have no idea who is coming and who isn't. There is no festive mood in Kashmir. There are hardly any markets which are functional.
