Hyderabad: Amid nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday asked Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and YSRCP leader YS Jagan Mohan Reddy to "rethink" his "support" to the central government.

"I am requesting my friend Jagan Mohan Reddy. Rethink your support to the Centre. We have to save the country," Owaisi said while addressing a rally at Darussalam in Hyderabad.

At the rally, Owaisi urged people, who are against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), to fly the tricolour outside their houses to send a message to the BJP regarding the "black law".

"Whoever is against the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) should fly the tricolour outside their homes. This will send a message to BJP that they have made a wrong and 'black' law," Owaisi said.

People in huge numbers had gathered at Owaisi's rally at Darussalam in protest against the newly-enacted Citizenship law and NRC.

Owaisi along with the people present also read out the Preamble of the Constitution.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, grants citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists and Christians fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh and who came to India on or before December 31, 2014.
