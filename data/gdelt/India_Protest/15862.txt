Rice millers refuse to provide gunny bags

PATIALA: The statement by Punjab cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, calling the protest by the state’s rice millers as politically motivated has become a bone a contention between the millers and the government. Reacting to Ashu’s statement, the Punjab Rice Millers Association on Wednesday said it had been raising the issues concerning the millers since 1998 and held protests during the tenure of various governments. Upset, the millers are now refusing to provide ‘bardana’ ( jute gunny bags) to the government and execute agreement for milling paddy.The association president Tarsem Saini said they had held agitations in 1998, 2000 and 2001. “During 2004-05, when Congress was in power in Punjab, our association had to go on strike for the redressal of our grievances. Similarly, in 2007-08 and 2009-10, when again SAD came to power, the association had adopted the path of agitation for our legitimate demands,” he said.On Tuesday, the minister had called the ongoing strike by rice millers as politically motivated. He said some people with vested interests were playing into the hands of SAD leaders to vitiate the paddy procurement process in the state.Saini said there was no truth in the allegations even though many members of the association had cordial relations with the leaders of various political parties and as and when the need arose, they have extended their support for the betterment of the rice milling industry in Punjab, he said.Saini said the association had convened another meeting of their general house on October 15 in Kotkapura to chalk out their next action plan.
