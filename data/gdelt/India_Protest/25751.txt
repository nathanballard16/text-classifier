Kolkata: A prominent Muslim cleric in West Bengal has threatened to block Kolkata airport if the Citizenship (Amendment) Act is not revoked. He has urged Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to either move Supreme Court challenging the contentious citizenship law or bring a resolution against the Act in state Assembly.

While speaking to Times Now, Muslim cleric Abbas Siddiqui from Furfura Sharif, a holy place of Muslims in West Bengal, claimed that the citizenship law is unfair to the Muslim population of the country. He asked Mamata Banerjee to take immediate steps to stall the Act or else "she risks losing the support of Muslims in West Bengal."

He went on to add that all the protests that the West Bengal CM is leading in the state might be satisfactory for other people, but they are not enough to satisfy the Muslim population.

Last week, Mamata Banerjee had asserted that the peaceful protests against the citizenship law will continue in the state until the CAA is revoked by the central government. She also told the protesters to not fear anybody and warned the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to not play with fire.

The West Bengal CM has time and again reiterated that she will fight tooth and nail with the BJP over the CAA and will not let the Centre implement National Register of Citizens (NRC) or CAA in the state. "I will not let the implementation of NRC or CAA in West Bengal till I am alive," she said in one of the anti-CAA rallied in Kolkata.
