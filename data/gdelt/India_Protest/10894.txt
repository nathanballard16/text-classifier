Mid-day meal: studentscontinue protests

Students of the Radhanagar Government Junior College, under the aegis of Students Federation of India and Centre of Trade Unions (CITU), staged a protest against the withdrawal of the mid-day meal scheme from government colleges.

“We have seen the condition of college students hailing from low income families owing to withdrawal of the mid-day meal scheme from the government colleges,” said C.H. Sumanth, State vice-president, Students Federation of India.

“With the scheme being revoked, many students who relied on receiving food at the college have to now depend on their parents, further increasing the burden on people from lower income backgrounds,” he added.

The students also demanded that the government withdraw its agreement with the Akshaya Patra Foundation, where the latter had been given permission to cook mid-day meal for government schools.

“Such an agreement will drastically affect the employment of the government workers who have been preparing food for many years,” said T. Praveen, district secretary, Democratic Youth Federation of India.
