Delhi BJP launches voter outreach programme

Comes up with slogan: ‘Kejriwal Bhagao Delhi Bachao’

The Delhi BJP on Sunday launched a programme to reach out to voters with the slogan “Kejriwal Bhagao, Delhi Bachao [Remove Kejriwal, Save Delhi]”.

Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari and Union Minister Vijay Goel expressed their concern over Delhi’s “worsening situation” and said that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had “ruined” Delhi. “His [Mr. Kejriwal] government is the worst government ever formed in the history of Delhi,” said Mr. Goel.

‘Apathetic government’

Mr. Tiwari said the Capital had become the most polluted city in the world where PM2.5 and PM10 levels had crossed hazardous levels. He added that the Kejriwal government had not taken any steps to deal with the problems that affect Delhiites.

“In the last four years of Kejriwal’s government, no new development has taken place... the government has not built any new hospitals or colleges as promised by the CM... Hospitals are in very bad shape and patients are suffering due to the apathy and negligence of the Kejriwal government,” said Mr. Tiwari

He added that Delhites have been cheated in the name of mohalla clinics.

“Mr. Kejriwal had made false promises to Delhi citizens during the Assembly election giving them high hopes, but the truth is he has failed miserably to fulfil his promises. He is only good at protesting against the Lieutenant-Governor at his office premises or fighting with the Commissioner of Police and using unparliamentary language,” said Mr. Tiwari.
