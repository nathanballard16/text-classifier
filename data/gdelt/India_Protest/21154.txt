New Delhi: Congress and several opposition political parties on Monday condemned the police "brutality" against students of Jamia Millia Islamia University and demanded a judicial inquiry into the incidents.

Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad, CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury and CPI's D Raja at a press conference condemned the police action on Sunday against Jamia students who were protesting against the new Citizenship Amendment law.

"How could the police enter Jamia and unleash such brutality on the students when the university authorities did not allow the police to enter it?" Azad asked.
