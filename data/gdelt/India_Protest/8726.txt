SAD-BJP to stage protest outisde MC office

Ludhiana: The district leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) will stage a protest outside MC’s Zone A office on Monday condemning Congress government for its failure in fulfilling the demands of the general public.

They will raise the issues of unscheduled power cuts, scarcity of water supply, choked sewerage and lack of development in most of the wards of SAD and BJP leaders. SAD district president Ranjit Dhillon made the announcement about the protest while going live on Facebook.

Dhillon said, during summer season people are facing unscheduled power cuts and it is also affecting the water supply timings in the residential areas. He said apart from this, the Congress has not fulfilled even a single promise made at the time of assembly elections and now half of their tenure is almost over. He said they will protest outside A zone office.

Meanwhile, the leader of opposition in MC and senior Akali councillor Harbhajan Singh Dang alleged that pick and choose policy was being adopted by the Congress leaders as in the wards of SAD-BJP councillors development works were not being approved. He said they will protest against the Congress leaders so as to make them realize about the fact that people were merely being treated as vote banks.

However, mayor Balkar Sandhu refused from having biased attitude with any councillor and claimed that he gives approval to all works proposed by the councillors without caring about the party.
