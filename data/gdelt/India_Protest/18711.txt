Maharashtra: Hindu groups demand countrywide NRC

Dressed in shades of saffron and holding placards demanding “justice for Hindus”, the protesters gathered at the main junction.

Days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke in Parliament about having a nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC), various Hindu organisations including the local unit of Hindu Mahasabha, Hindu Janjagriti Sanstha and Agri Koli groups in Navi Mumbai have voiced support for the idea.

On Sunday evening, 60-odd people gathered at Koperkhairane and started shouting slogans demanding countrywide NRC. Dressed in shades of saffron and holding placards demanding “justice for Hindus”, the protesters gathered at the main junction. “Amit Shah sir had promised that the NRC will be applied across the country. There is not much awareness in people about it, as the media has been badmouthing it,” said Uday Dhuri, an organiser of the event.

The protesters said they had taken to the streets to spread their message. “Currently, several illegal Bangladeshi immigrants are living across India. In Assam, NRC has led to understanding how many illegal immigrants there are just in one state. In Maharashtra too there are illegal immigrants,” Dhuri said, adding that they were a “national security hazard”.
