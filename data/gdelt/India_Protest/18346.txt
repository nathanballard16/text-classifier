All-India NRC exercise is wrong, says Yechury

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Wednesday told journalists that extending the National Register of Citizens (NRC) beyond Assam is wrong and accused the BJP of trying to polarise people.

He was reacting to Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s remark in the Rajya Sabha that NRC process will be carried out across India and that there would be no discrimination on the basis of religion.

Mr. Yechury said NRC is specific to Assam and it was part of the Assam Accord. “It has nothing to do with the rest of the country. Though they (BJP) say it’s (NRC) not based on religion the whole point is polarisation,” he said.

Mr. Yechury, addressing a press conference here, said the shutdown in Kashmir, following the abrogation of Article 370, has crippled the valley's economy and constitutional rights of the people are being denied to them.

“It is more than 100 days for the lockdown of Kashmir. The economy of the state has been totally shattered. The apple crop has been worst affected. Apple growers have suffered a loss of more than 10,000 crores of rupees. The central government should declare the situation in Kashmir as 'National Calamity' and compensate for the loss to the people. Tourism industry has been badly hit. In absence of internet business and trade has been severely impacted. Normal life in Kashmir is paralysed. Government should immediately restore all communication,” he said.

Mr. Yechury said several political leaders, who have been ‘illegally’ confined and put under house arrest should be immediately released. “The constitutional rights of the people should be restored at the earliest. The thousands of political activists detained without any legal framework should be released,” he said.

The CPI(M) will hold a month-long agitation in December against the various “anti-people” policies of the BJP led government at the Centre, he announced.

“The month-long protest will culminate on January 8, 2020, with more than 20 crore workers going on a nationwide strike, following the call of as many as 10 central trade unions,” he said.

“We are passing through a period of recession as GDP growth has come down. Industrial growth has dipped and consumer expenditure has fallen to its lowest in 40 years. Unemployment is the highest in 45 years. There has been a cut down in production in auto industry to the tune of 30%, and it has resulted in retrenchment of 10 lakh workers in ancillary units. Overall 30 lakh workers have lost their jobs due to less production in industry. The government needs to immediately invest in a big way in infrastructure to create jobs and thereby increase the purchasing power of people to help increase production in industry,” said Mr. Yechury.

He accused the Centre of giving tax concessions to rich industrialists but not waiving the loans of distressed farmers.
