ANMs seek weightage marks for Village Secretariat posts

Govt. has reneged on its promise, they allege

A large number of ANMs staged a demonstration at the DM&HO’s Office here on Sunday against what they called the failure of the State government to give 10% weightage to the serving ANMs in the recruitment to the ANM Grade-3 posts in Village Secretariats.

The ANMs, owing allegiance to the United Medical and Health Employees Union (CITU), Visakhapatnam district committee, alleged that the government had reneged on its promise of giving 10 % weightage, even as the final list of successful candidates was being prepared and the result was ready for announcement.

CITU district secretary V.V. Srinivasa Rao and ANMs Union district president T. Lakshmi, United Medical and Health Employees Union general secretary K. Jaganmohan Rao and district president Chukkala Satyanarayana led the protest.

“The government has finalised the merit list without considering the allotment of the weightage marks, despite hundreds of applicants from the district uploading their service certificates, along with their application forms online. This has caused anguish among the service applicants,” Mr. Rao said.

The union leaders alleged that the indifference of the health authorities was responsible for the situation.

“They (health officials) refused to hear the pleas of the applicants who went to the DM&HO’s office seeking justice,” he added.

The ANMs said that they would launch an agitation at the Collectorate on Monday if their pleas were not considered by the government.
