New Delhi: India is grieving the deaths of the 37 CRPF jawans who were martyred in the dastardly terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama on Thursday. Families of the slain jawans have not yet been able to comprehend the huge void left behind with the loss of their sons/husbands/brothers who were part of the convoy that was attacked by a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber yesterday.

While one jawan belonged to Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri, some belonged from Moga and Gurdaspur in Punjab. Two of the martyrs also belonged to Uttar Pradesh’s Maharajganj and Bihar’s Bhagalpur.

“I have sacrificed a son in Mother India’s service, I will send my other son as well to fight, ready to give him up for Mother India, but Pakistan must be given a befitting reply,” father of slain jawan Ratan Thakur said, according to news agency ANI.

Banned Pakistani terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack in Pulwama’s Awantipora area. The attack took place after a suicide bomber in a Mahindra Scorpio car loaded with 350 kilograms of explosives rammed into a convoy carrying over 2500 CRPF troops on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.
