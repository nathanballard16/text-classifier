Alliance talks between CPM, Cong hit roadblock

editorial@tribune.com

New Delhi: The CPM is firm on not giving up its claim on the two sitting Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in favour of the Congress, which could create a major roadblock in the seat-sharing talks between the two parties, senior Left Front leaders said on Wednesday. The two sides have already held several rounds of talks but were unable to untangle the skein of Raiganj and Murshidabad, the only seats the CPM won in the last Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal. “No. We offered no contest in sitting seats. It’s now up to them,” a senior CPM leader said in Delhi. The comments come after Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra flew to Delhi and met Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday to discuss the issue. PTI

Rebel Congress MLA Umesh Jadhav joins BJP

Kalaburagi (K’taka): Congress rebel MLA Umesh Jadhav joined the BJP at a rally here on Wednesday, two days after he quit the Karnataka Assembly membership, and is tipped to take on Congress veteran Mallikarjun Kharge in the coming Lok Sabha elections. Jadhav joined the BJP before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address at the rally, in the presence of state BJP president BS Yeddyurappa, former Chief Minister Jagadish Shettar and a host of other party leaders. “I am happy and proud on joining the BJP,” Jadhav said before Modi arrived on the stage. He also sought blessings from the people of Kalaburagi to make Modi Prime Minister again. BJP sources said Jadhav is likely to be the party’s Lok Sabha candidate for the Gulbarga seat to challenge Kharge. PTI
