Doctors’ strike Today Highlights: Bengal Guv welcomes ‘amicable settlement’ between govt, protesters

Doctors’ strike Today India LIVE News Updates: Doctors across West Bengal on Monday announced to withdraw the ongoing protest after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee agreed to their demands during a meeting at Nabanna. The 31 representatives made the formal announcement at NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, where the death of a patient followed by an attack on two junior attacks triggered the week-long strike.

The Indian Medical Association (IMA), on the other hand, is observing a nationwide strike, with the withdrawal of non-essential medical services, including OPD services, for 24 hours starting 6 am today. Emergency, casualty and ICU services, will remain unaffected. Doctors at AIIMS in the national capital, who had earlier decided to stay away, joined the protests after a junior doctor was assaulted at its trauma centre earlier today.

Meanwhile, the Supreme Court today said it will hear on June 18 a plea seeking safety and security of doctors in government hospitals across the country. The plea was filed on Friday in the wake of protests by doctors in Bengal against the assault on their colleagues by the family of a patient, who died on Monday night. The petition has also sought directions to Union ministries of home affairs and health and West Bengal to depute government-appointed security personnel at all state-run hospitals across the country to ensure safety and security of doctors.
