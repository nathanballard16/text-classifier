Narendra Modi cannot wish 200 million Muslims away

Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi is likely to soon demand that Indians prove they are Indians as part of his planned National Register of Citizens.

The register is the latest example of the hatred felt for Muslims in Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party. It has been implemented in Assam state but a new Citizenship Amendment Act which allows illegal immigrants to obtain Indian citizenship, but excludes Muslims, ignited fears it will be extended nationally. The act passed last week and has sparked nation-wide protests. Last month Modi's home minister, Amit Shah, told Parliament the register would be extended to the whole country.

This mammoth and colossally expensive register exercise will require all Indians to furnish documents showing their Indian ancestry.

Apart from anything else, for all poor Indians regardless of faith, this will be a calamity. Many will not have the documents. Older Indians don’t have birth certificates as so many were born at home.
