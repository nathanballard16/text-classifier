Arizona Muslims Call On State's Elected Officials To Intervene In Kashmir

A group of Arizona Muslims on Friday held a rally at the state Capitol to protest an ongoing humanitarian crisis in Indian-occupied Kashmir.

Attendees called on Arizona elected officials to intervene on Kashimir’s behalf.

An Aug. 5 move by Indian President Ram Nath Kovind to repeal Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, effectively ended Kashmir’s autonomy.

Since that time, a communications blackout has made it difficult for those abroad to talk to their relatives amidst reports of rape, torture and ammunition being used on peaceful protestors.

One of the attendees at the rally who wished to remain anonymous said he hasn’t been able to communicate with his family in Kashmir for over 50 days.

“My aguish is miniscule compared to millions of Kashmiris who are living in abject fear and whose human rights are being trampled on day in and day out by the so-called largest democracy in the world,” he said.

Imraan Sidiqui, executive director of the Council of American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) which spearheaded the call-to-action, said the oppression has led to the rape and torture of Kashmiri citizens.

“We’re hearing just by second-hand reports that there are live ammunition that are being used on peaceful protestors. There’s curfews. There’s thousands of people who have been disappeared from Indian-occupied Kashmir right now.”

He added the inhumane conditions are widespread. “This is not happening in isolation brothers and sisters. This is happening in places throughout India where you’re seeing lynchings taking place when somebody’s accused of falsely eating beef,” Sidiqui said.

The rally was timed to coincide with Indian Prime Minister Modi’s address to the U.N. General Assembly.

The majority of Kashmiris are Sunni Muslim while 80 percent of the Indian population practices Hinduism.
