No place for caste, religion in politics, says Pawan

‘JSP aims at ushering in equal power to all sections’

Jana Sena Party president Pawan Kalyan on Saturday said the prime objective of the JSP was to usher in equal power to all sections of people. “There is no place for caste or religious politics,” he said.

Addressing a public gathering at the NTR Circle in Punganur, he said he looked forward to the cooperation of all sections of people to realise the goal of equal power to all. “My life is dedicated to your [people’s] future,” he said. Without naming the Opposition parties, Mr. Pawan said the political parties had so far looted thousands of crores of public money.

Behind schedule

“They have denied justice to people. They have brought in no progress in vital areas of education, health, employment and empowerment of women. My avowed goal is to liberate the people from the slavery.”

Earlier, Mr. Pawan arrived at Madanapalle town, 100 km from here, four hours behind the schedule. As the JSP chief entered the Chittoor district border from Bengaluru, hundreds of youth thronged the border at Chippili village of Madanapalle rural and greeted him. After having lunch at a party leader’s residence, he undertook a roadshow for an hour from the NTR circle to the Chittoor bus stand area, atop the SUV. Enthusiastic youth and party cadre rained flower petals on the actor-turned-politician, amid slogans hailing his leadership. However, Mr. Pawan did not address the gathering at Madanapalle, in spite of the sizeable presence of the cadre.

Later, he arrived at Punganur town, bastion of YSRCP MLA P. Ramachandra Reddy, where a large number of youth took out a motorcycle rally. The JSP cadre gathered in large number at the Chittoor district headquarters town, venue of Mr Pawan’s public meeting.
