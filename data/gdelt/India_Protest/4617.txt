Delhi: Tibetan Youth Congress activists hold peace march

New Delhi [India], Mar 10 (ANI): Tibetan Youth Congress activists on Sunday held a peace march from Delhi's Ramlila Maidan to Jantar Mantar to mark the 60th Tibetan Uprising Day, demanding freedom from the communist Chinese government.

On March 10 in 1959, thousands of Tibetans gathered in Lhasa to protect their leader Dalai Lama from perceived threats of the Chinese Army. The protest was brutally suppressed, causing death of thousands of people. Following this, the then 23-year-old Dalai Lama along with thousands of Tibetans secretly fled into exile in India. The demonstration was later named as the Tibetan Uprising.

"60 years ago in 1959, we lost our country to Chinese. We are here to mark this day and to remember all those who lost their lives. We have also taken a pledge that we will continue to fight for the freedom of Tibet. Protesters have come here from all across India and we will keep fighting until issue of Tibet gets resolved," said president of Tibetan Youth Congress Tenzing Jigme.

Elaborating about the protest, Jigme stated: "We will hold a three-day protest in Delhi, a peace march starting from Ramlila Maidan to Jantar Mantar. At Jantar Mantar, we will have a rally and candlelight vigil march. We will be marching to the United Nations from Khan Market tomorrow. And a day after tomorrow, we have another candlelight vigil March."

A group of hundreds of people who gathered at Ramlila Maidan on Sunday morning raised slogans against the Chinese government and demanded freedom for Tibet. Protesters were also holding placards stating, "Let his holiness the Dalai Lama return Tibet" and "Freedom and justice for Tibet".



"We are the people staying outside Tibet and suffering the brutal rule of the communist Chinese government. We are here to protest against the Chinese and illegal occupation of Tibet," one of the protesters said. (ANI)
