Enraged, Akshay punched the doctor, who sustained injuries on his nose. The accused fled from the hospital soon after the incident, he said.

A member of Resident Doctors Association (RDA) said the doctor on emergency duty tried to relieve the patient's but it did not subside.

"While the resident doctor on duty was filling up a form so that the patient could undergo an ultrasound, the latter started hurling abuses," a senior doctor said.

"The resident doctor is under observation. We have lodged an FIR in the case," he added.

Police said Head Constable Vijay and constable on duty, who was also present at the time of incident, have been transferred to District Lines.
