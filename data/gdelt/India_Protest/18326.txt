MHRD High Power Committee hears out JNU students in meeting

New Delhi [India], Nov 20 (ANI): The High Power Committee of the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD) on Wednesday met a delegation of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students and took stock of their views at Shastri Bhawan here.

The Ministry has agreed to meet the students again on Friday at the JNU campus to find solutions to the current issues, MHRD wrote in a tweet.



"The Committee appealed to the students to restore normalcy on the campus immediately for which the students responded positively," MHRD tweeted.

Interestingly, the JNU Vice-Chancellor did not attend the meeting.

The Ministry has appointed a high power committee for discussion with students and administration to restore the normal functioning and peaceful resolution of all issues in the University.

Former UGC Chairman VS Chauhan, AICTE Chairman Anil Sahasrabudhe, and UGC Secretary Rajnish Jain are members of the committee.

Yesterday, the JNUSU repeated its demand for rollback of the "illegally passed draft manual", and fee structure.

In a letter, the JNUSU had said, "The JNUSU would like to reiterate its demands of immediate rollback of the illegally passed draft manual, and fee structure, along with the declaration of the IHA meeting on October 28 as null and void, initiation of dialogue between the JNU Administration and the Student Community, represented by the elected student representatives, the JNUSU, and the Hostel Presidents."

"The MHRD and the HPEC should take serious cognizance of the illegalities in the JNU, perpetuated under the aegis of the JNU VC, Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, and recommend his removal from the post of JNU VC," the JNUSU had said.

In a recent development, JNU students today protested against the Delhi Police at their headquarters in ITO here. The protest was on the alleged beating of visually impaired students during their agitation on fee hike. (ANI)
