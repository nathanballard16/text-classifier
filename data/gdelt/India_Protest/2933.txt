Kargiliites take out protest rally in Jammu

JAMMU, Feb 11: On the call of “Coordination Committee for Civil Disobedience” comprising all Kargil political parties, social and religious groups against creation of a separate administrative division for Ladakh with its permanent headquarters at Leh, a protest rally was taken out in Jammu.

The rally was part of protests planned at Jammu, Kargil, New Delhi and other places against SRO 110.

In the rally, which started from Karbala Complex Residency Road Jammu and concluded at Press Club Jammu, more than 5000 men, women and children participated along with all the political leaders including Chairman J&K Legislative Council Haji Anayat Ali and CEC LAHDC Kargil Feroz Ahmad Khan.

They were protesting against the order creating a separate administrative division for Ladakh with its permanent headquarters at Leh and seeking its review.

According to the order, the administration has sanctioned the creation of a separate administrative and revenue division comprising Leh and Kargil districts with its headquarters at Leh. Ladakh was part of Kashmir division until now. The people from Kargil cutting across party, social and religious affiliations, refused to be part of the newly created division unless there is six-month rotation of offices between Leh and Kargil.

On the same issue, the whole Kargil district also observed Bandh on Monday and all the offices, business establishments and transport union supporting the call given by Coordination Committee for Civil Disobedience against SRO 110.
