Gujarat CEO S Murali Krishna tells parties to not cause hassle to public

The chief electoral officer(CEO) in Gujarat Dr S Murali Krishna has issued the guidelines to all the district election officers(collectors) and concerned police authorities to ensure that no political activity during polls should cause inconvenience to common public in day to day life.

The issue came to the attention of the CEO's office when people filed a complaint against BJP for holding a poll rally of Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath in Ghatlodia area of Ahmedabad city on Monday. The dais for the rally was set on a busy road and people faced great harassment as all the sides were closed for vehicles and many commercial establishments were forced to remain shut during the whole day.

The CEO said, "We received the complaints from different citizens and asked the BJP leaders to shift the dais in a corner but some issues remained thereafter too. We are here to ensure that no inconvenience should be caused to the common public due to political activities. We have also issued guidelines to the DEOs and police to see that the common public is not facing any issue."

The CEO also said that they would see and pass on necessary instruction to Ahmedabad collector and police commissioner to see that traffic remained smooth on March 30 when the BJP chief Amit Shah is going to file nomination and roadshow are to be held where thousands of people are anticipated to flood in on roads. "We will ask the concerned authorities to see that minimum inconvenience is caused to the public during the road shows," the CEO added.
