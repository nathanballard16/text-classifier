`Bisaria called back to Delhi’

NEW DELHI, Feb 15: Ajay Bisaria, India's High Commissioner to Pakistan, has been called back to Delhi for consultations after a Pakistan-based terror group killed over 45 CRPF soldiers in a massive car bombing in Pulwama district of J&K on Thursday.

“Ajay Bisaria has been called to Delhi for consultations in the wake of Pulwama attack," a source said.

In the meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale Thursday also summoned Pakistan's High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood, and a very strong demarche or diplomatic protest was lodged over the Pulwama terror attack, sources said.

The soldiers were killed when their convoy was hit by the powerful car bomb, fitted with 60 kg of explosives, on the Srinagar-Jammu highway in Pulwama district.

Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed responsibility for the attack, the deadliest in Jammu and Kashmir since the start of the century.

India said it had "incontrovertible evidence" of Pakistan's involvement in the Pulwama attack. The Pakistan government responded with a stiff denial, while calling the attack a matter of "grave concern."

India has already decided to remove "Most Favoured Nation" privileges given to Pakistan, and said it will work to ensure the country's isolation globally. Most Favoured Nation status is given to a trade partner to ensure non-discriminatory trade between two nations.

The foreign ministry in its latest push to isolate Pakistan has appealed to all members of the UN Security Council to list Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. China has kept its stand on Masood Azhar unchanged; it has repeatedly blocked efforts by India and other UN Security Council members to list Masood Azhar as a UN-designated terrorist.

The US has asked Pakistan "to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil."
