Pollachi/Coimbatore : , March 15 (IANS) A court in Coimbatore on Friday permitted the Crime Branch-Crime Investigation Department (CB-CID) to take into custody for four days Thirunavukkarasu, the prime accused in the Pollachi sexual abuse and blackmail case.

With a huge crowd gathered outside the court, Thirunavukkarasu attended the hearing via video conference. The Tamil Nadu government has already transferred the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

Four persons -- Thirunavukkarasu, Sathish, Sabarirajan, Vasanthakumar -- all in their 20s, have been accused of sexually assaulting women in Pollachi and filming the act to blackmail them for money or for physical submission for over seven years.

Protests are being held across Tamil Nadu demanding punishment for the culprits.

In Pollachi, about 2,000 people including members of different social organisations formed a human chain asking for a court-monitored probe by the CBI in the case.

The protesting organisations included the All India Democratic Women's Association (AIDWA) and the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) as well as political parties like the Congress, MDMK, MNM and TMMK.
