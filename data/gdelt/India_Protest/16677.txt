New Delhi, Oct 23 : The RSS' student wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Wednesday staged a protest against an under-construction 39-storey building, claimed to be the tallest building in Delhi when completed.

The students alleged that once completed, the occupants of this building would have a clear view of the girls' hostels in North Campus and thus it must not be allowed to be constructed.

The building is slated to come up on Chhatra Marg, which is the main road that leads to North Campus of Delhi University from Vishwa Vidyalaya Metro Station.

"ABVP demands to build new hostels at the proposed site instead of the proposed building which will take away the privacy of our girl students residing in six nearby girls' hostels," a senior member of ABVP said.

Akshit Dahiya, President, DUSU said, "Every member of the DU family, including the students, alumni and faculty should stand united in this fight against the corrupt elements of the society. DUSU will create a large movement to stop this construction as soon as possible."
