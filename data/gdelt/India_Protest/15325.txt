Rs 30L looted from SBI ATM

Jajpur: Unidentified miscreants looted cash worth over Rs 30 lakh from an ATM of State Bank of India (SBI) near Trimurti Cinema in Jajpur Town late Monday.

The matter came to light Tuesday after locals found the ATM machine cut open. Senior police officials including SP Charan Singh Meena visited the spot.

Police said that preliminary investigation revealed that cash worth over Rs 30 lakh was deposited in the ATM Monday afternoon. “We suspect that the miscreants took the help of a gas cutter to cut open the machine. Though the ATM kiosk is located in the market area, locals did not get any clue about the crime,” said a police official.

Police said that they will soon convene a meeting with the officials of banks to deploy security guards at the ATM kiosks.
