Southern Fried Funeral is family drama, made funny

Article content

For a play based in the American South, Southern Fried Funeral sure looks remarkably like rural Ontario.

The comedic tale, which is directed by Maureen Matchett and opens tonight at the Lucknow Townhall Theatre, focuses on the Frye family shortly after the death of patriarch Dewey Frye Sr. as his widow Dorothy, played by Vicki McKague, is left to captain the ship, navigating through a funeral, familial drama and a threat to her house.

While the bullet points of the play written by Osborne and Eppler may seem darker than your typical family-centred comedy, it’s the extremes of the characters that both make Southern Fried Funeral funny and curiously familiar on the stage in Lucknow.

Ozella Meeks, a town know-it-all played by a charismatic Andrea Feeley, is a character that the actress acknowledges is a bit of “nosey Parker.” Ozella beams at overhearing information she hasn’t been invited to know.

“Ozella is disliked,” Feeley said. “They’d rather eat a bag of hair than talk to me. Every town has one of these.”

But Meeks, who is certainly not meek, is not all bad. As Feeley said, Ozella is a bit of a softy.

“She means well and she wants this funeral to go off well,” she said. “And Ozela knew Dewey and so she thinks she’s part of the family.”
