In an official statement, Hyderabad city police chief said,

The cases could be related to obstructing officials from working or assaulting any driver working for RTC. Such cases will be put to trial in fast track court.” Anjani Kumar, chief city police

V C Sajjanar, Commissioner of Police Cyberabad said, “Any obstruction created for the drivers who have been hired by the government on temporary basis will be booked for obstructing the Government servants from discharging their duty. Firm action will be taken for any such offence. As such no one would be allowed to perform dharna or stage protest, without any prior permission from the police. This is only to make sure that the harmony in the local areas is maintained.”
