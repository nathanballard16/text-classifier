New Delhi, December 2

BJP members today protested in the Lok Sabha against Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury for calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah “ghuspaityhiye”—“infiltrators”.

Parliamentary Affairs Minister Pralhad Joshi attacked Chowdhury, the Leader of the Congress in the House, taking a swipe at his party over its president Sonia Gandhi’s foreign origins, seeking his apology.

Dubbing her an “infiltrator”, the BJP members said they will not tolerate such “insults” against PM Modi and Shah.

The matter was raised again when the House re-convened after the lunch with the Treasury Benches again insisting on the apology.

Chowdhury sought to explain his remarks and said he would apologise if the BJP was not satisfied. Using the opportunity to underline his opposition against the NRC, he said his own family had come from Bangladesh. “We do not have many documents so if somebody calls (us) an infiltrator, we cannot do much,” he said.

However, BJP members continued with their protests, forcing Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to adjourn the House amid ruckus. When the House resumed again, the BJP members were again up on their feet with Joshi calling the remarks an “insult” to people who had given Prime Minister Modi an overwhelming mandate in the recent Lok Sabha elections.
