'Come home and I am going to kill you': Twinkle Khanna's reaction on seeing Akshay Kumar setting himself on FIRE is EPIC

Trust Akshay Kumar to go a notch higher in everything that he does and this time, as he announced his digital debut on Tuesday, with the web series tentatively titled The End, he surpassed everyone's anticipation. Khilaadi Kumar, as he's fondly called by his fans, performed a daredevil stunt as he set himself on fire at the launch event in Mumbai. Much like others, looks like even his wife Twinkle Khanna had no clue about the stunt that he's going to perform at the packed event.

It was only after Akshay Kumar tweeted a few pictures of himself walking on stage all fired up, did Twinkle get to know about what he's been up to. Twinkle took to her Twitter page and replied to Akshay writing, "Crap! This is how I find out that you decided to set yourself on fire ! Come home and I am going to kill you-in case you do survive this! #GodHelpMe"

On reading Twinkle's warning, Akshay Kumar, who's clearly not afraid of performing dangerous stunts, ended up writing, "Now that’s something I’d actually be afraid of"

Check out the pictures and videos from the event:
