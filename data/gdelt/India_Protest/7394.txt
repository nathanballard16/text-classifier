What gave this Jhunjhunwala portfolio stock a big jump from 5-year low?

NEW DELHI: This smallcap cement maker has been seeing delays in capacity expansion due to poor cash generation and slow environmental clearances.But cement demand in its key markets, especially southern region, has been solid of late, which along with cost control helped the company log a four-fold jump in March quarter profit.Analysts expect realisations to remain strong for the cement maker in June quarter as well. And this is one of the reasons behind the 73 per cent jump in the stock from a five-year low of Rs 61.90 hit on February 6 this year.The company is CK Birla Group firm Orient Cement. On Monday, in a depressed market, the stock traded around Rs 107.Big Bull Rakesh Jhunjhunwala has been holding a 1.22 per cent stake in this company at least since March quarter of 2016.Analysts have upped price targets for the stock sharply post strong Q4 numbers, yet most targets suggest only a limited upside potential from here on.Kotak Institutional Equities has revised the target from Rs 80 to Rs 106, which is where the stock traded on Monday. Motilal Oswal Securities and Antique Stock Broking have set price targets of Rs 119 and 115, respectively, suggesting 7-11 per cent upside potential.ICICI Securities has upped its price target to Rs 135 from Rs 77 earlier, giving a ‘buy’ recommendation on the stock from ‘add’ earlier. This is 26 per cent above the prevailing price.Elara Capital seems most bullish among all, having raised its price target from Rs 80 to Rs 150, nearly 40 per cent from prevailing price.The company seems to be in no hurry to go in for capex, even though capacity utilisation touched 80 per cent during FY19.Analysts say low margin profile and financial leverage make this company’s earnings sensitive to cement prices. They believe any capex rollout will depend on sustainable improvement in profitability, which itself will hinge on cement prices in core markets.The Maharashtra market alone accounts for 45 per cent of Orient Cement’s revenue. That market saw a 2 per cent sequential rise in cement prices in March quarter. Prices rose 3 per cent sequentially in Andhra and 7 per cent QoQ in Karnataka.At its prevailing price, Orient Cement trades at a 40-50 per cent discount to its replacement cost.Kotak Institutional Equities believes the delay in capex would help it deleverage from 4 times net debt/Ebitda in FY2019 to 2 times FY2021. The stock trades at an EV per tonne of $60 due to weak profitability against the replacement cost of $80-100 per tonnes, it said.The cement maker reported a 21.14 per cent YoY jump in total income at Rs 754.89 crore on a 9 per cent increase in volume to 1.83 million tonnes. Profit climbed four-folds to Rs 61.98 crore from Rs 12.82 crore in the year-ago quarter.This is against a loss of Rs 13.7 crore reported for December quarter and Rs 16.7 crore loss in September quarter, data available with corporate database AceEquity showed.Realisations for March quarter rose 11 per cent YoY to Rs 4,101 per tonne, thanks to healthy prices in underlying markets. Ebitda jumped 104 per cent YoY to a record Rs 153 crore, with margins expanding 834 basis points YoY to 20.4 per cent. Ebitda per tonne was at sixteen quarters high at Rs 835.Antique Stock Broking said even though March quarter was strong, performance in past five years suggests such strong quarterly Ebitda has rarely stayed with the company.Antique Stock Broking said the recent price increases in southern and western markets should help June quarter performance. This brokerage has upped its fair value for the stock to Rs 115, based on 7 times FY21 EV/Ebitda.Kotak Securities expects a 2-3 per cent rise in realisations in FY2020-21.Earnings, it said, are highly sensitive to prices due to low margins, financial leverage and this could drive 15-18 per cent increase in FY2020-21 Ebitda estimates.Reliance Securities said the company is in Catch-22 situation, considering the urgency of capacity expansion and financial constraints, which could be similar to the situation in India Cements “Sustainability of recent price hikes in its key markets may improve its unitary Ebitda from Rs 251 to Rs 750-850 in ensuing quarters, which bodes well for higher cash flow,” it said.The brokerage said debt-to-equity for Orient Cement at 1.2 times seems to be on the higher side and considering its aggregate interest-adjusted cash flow from operations at Rs 480 crore in last three years (FY16-FY18), it would be a daunting task for the company to expand capacity without further straining the balance sheet.“Though the stock has witnessed a decent rebound after price hikes in key markets, valuations appear to be comfortable. However, ambiguity over capacity expansion will remain an overhang in the medium term," the brokerage said.The company was targeting capex at Devapur in two phases; the first for 1 million tonne through debottlenecking, followed by 3 million tonnes of brownfield expansion.Split GU, which was originally planned at the Orissa facility, may not be feasible now, owing to high slag prices, which makes split GU untenable, Antique said.“Even though there is already a delay in expansion, outlook for capex rollout going forward hinges on the environmental clearances as well as the sustainable improvement in prices/profitability,” Antique said.As of May 6, the scrip had 5 ‘buy’, 4 ‘outperform’ and 3 ‘hold’ ratings on the publicly available Reuters database.
