KGF actor Yash on his fan who committed suicide: I do not want fans like this, this is not fandom or love

KGF actor Yash has a crazy fan following down South and his recently released film has only managed to keep him more in the limelight. But little did anyone know that a fan of the actor would commit suicide. Yes, you read it right. A fan crossed all the lines and gave up his life for his favourite Kannada star Yash. The actor recently turned 33 and he decided not to celebrate this year as a tribute to the passing away of veteran Kannada actor Ambreesh. But like every year, one of his fans reached the actor's house to meet and click a selfie with him.

However, his 26-year-old fan Ravi Raghuram did not get any chance to meet Yash, and due to this, he set himself on fire right outside the actor's house in Bengaluru. According to media reports, the fan suffered 70 % burn and was taken to Victoria hospital by the securities, but unfortunately, he succumbed to his injuries. Ravi's father who was shocked by this, told the reporters, "Ravi goes every year to meet Yash. Last year he had taken us to his house as well. This year, we had told him not to go, but he persisted. Do not know where Ravi got the petrol from."

As per a report in Times now, Yash visited the hospital and said, "I do not want fans like this, this is not fandom or love, this does not bring me happiness. I will not come to see anybody else like this again, it will give the wrong message to fans who think that I will come and meet them (if they take drastic steps like this)."

According to a report in The News Minute, Dr KT Ramesh, revealed that even while on the support of equipment, the fan was only talking about actor Yash. The doctor revealed that his last words were, "When we were dressing his wounds, Ravi asked the doctors whether Yash would come to see him, now that he was struggling between life and death."
