As the Assembly elections are drawing nearer in Maharashtra and Haryana, political parties have intensified their campaigns to woo the voters. Political bigwigs from BJP, Congress, Shiv Sena, NCP and other regional parties are organising rallies, road shows and meetings in several parts of these two states. Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has also addressed five rallies in Maharashtra and one in Haryana. However, his mother and interim party president Sonia Gandhi is yet to address her first rally. Addressing a rally in Wardha, Gandhi scion blamed Modi government for prevailing economic situation in the country. "When Modi came in 2014, every scheme which gave money to the poor, he finished them one by one. Be it MGNREGA or weakening legislations like food security act and land acquisition. And then he brought demonetisation," said Rahul Gandhi. Attacking PM Modi on demonetisation, he said, "He lied to you that it was a fight against black money. Did you see Vijay Mallya or Nirav Modi in lines outside banks? Instead, the aim was to take money out of your pocket and give it to 15 richest people of India." "It is quite straightforward. If you want to run the economy, you need to put money in the pockets of the poor. Until farmers, laborers, and youth do not have money to spend, the economy cannot be run," he added. The two states will go to the polls on October 21 and the counting of votes will take place on October 24. (BCCL)
