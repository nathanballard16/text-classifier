Congress President Rahul Gandhi held 150 rallies during Lok Sabha polls

Gandhi visited the state seven times since February 3 rally, which in a way, marked start of his Lok Sabha campaign.

In the elections considered crucial for the Congres which was decimated to 44 Lok Sabha seats in the last elections, Gandhi sought to keep the focus on issues concerning the common man as he attempted to seize the narrative from the BJP which made nationalism a key election plank. Gandhi campaigned all over the country but his average visit per seat was among the highest in Bihar even though the Congress is contesting only nine of the 40 seats in the state as part of the 'grand alliance'.
