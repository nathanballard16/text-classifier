Occupied Kashmir: Average 20 protests being held daily despite curfew & restrictions

The Occupied Kashmir has seen an average of nearly 20 protests per day against Indian occupation over the past six weeks despite the military siege to quell unrest.

An international news agency said quoting a government official that despite curfew, movement restrictions and the severe curtailment of internet and mobile phone services, public demonstrations against India are constantly being held mostly in the largest city Srinagar.

The official said altogether there have been 722 protests since August 5, with Baramulla district in the northwest and Pulwama in the south the biggest hotspots after Srinagar.

Since that date, nearly 200 civilians and 415 forces’ personnel have been hurt, it added. Ninety-five of the civilians were injured in the last two weeks.
