Mamata pens poem against CAA NRC

Kolkata: Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee has composed a poem protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC). She condemned the divisive forces, asking them why somebody should snatch her rights and asserts that she would remain in the country enjoying all her rights. The poem also takes a dig at those trying to spread hatred and poison the minds of the people and expresses the resolve that all citizens would stay united and ensure that all their rights are intact. Describing those promoting CAA and NRC as 'selfish giants', the poem regrets that the divisive forces only try to hoodwink the poor and affirms that no division of the country would be allowed. The poem concludes with a call for a united India sans the divisive forces and says: "Amra sabai Nagorik/CAA, NRC manbo Na (We are all citizens/We won't accept CAA, NRC)."
