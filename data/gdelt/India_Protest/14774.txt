The Delhi High Court in Review: August 2019 [Part II]

In G. S. Agarwal v. State[42], the Court expounded on important principles in relation to a will. It was noted that inasmuch as the entire purpose of making a will is to distribute a share in a manner thought fit by the testator, the mere fact that a will is entirely in favor of one of the heirs would not by itself impugn upon the validity of the will. Further, it was held that there was no such requirement to specify the details of the entire estate in a will, and a general bequeathing of the entire estate is sufficient and discloses definite intention. Lastly, it was noted that merely because the entire property that is the subject matter of the will was not included in the petition for grant of Letters of Administration, would not totally take away the jurisdiction of the court to grant the requisite relief.
