INX Media Case: Custodial interrogation is sometimes fruitful, says CBI court

CBI expands probe against P Chidambaram; FDI clearances to other companies also under scanner

The CBI has expanded the probe against former finance minister P Chidambaram, bringing under its ambit foreign investment clearances given to companies other than INX media during his tenure, officials said Thursday.

The CBI suspects that Chidamabaram and his son Karti also received kickbacks from other companies to facilitate foreign investment clearances through the FIPB route which necessitates the former minister's custodial interrogation, they said.
