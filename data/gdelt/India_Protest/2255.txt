TMC activists vandalized BJP office in Kolkata: Dilip Ghosh

Kolkata, Feb 4 (PTI) The BJP has charged the Trinamool

Congress (TMC) with vandalization of one of its offices in

south Kolkata, an allegation denied by the state's ruling

party.

According to state BJP president Dilip Ghosh, the TMC

activists, who were out on a rally as part of their statewide

protest against CBI's attempt to grill Kolkata police chief,

pelted stones at the saffron party's office in Bhawanipore

area, while passing by it.

"A scuffle broke out between the members of the two

parties, following which the TMC workers overpowered the BJP

men and vandalized the party office," Ghosh said, adding that

the party has lodged a police complaint in the case.

A local TMC leader, however, termed the allegation as

"baseless".

"It was the BJP workers who beat up the TMC

activists," he said.

TMC activists on Monday took out protest rallies,

blocked highways and rail tracks and burnt effigies of Prime

Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah in various

parts of West Bengal.

They criticised the Centre over Sunday's CBI episode

and vowed to "continue their fight" till the Narendra Modi

government is defeated in the next Lok Sabha polls.

A CBI team had gone to Kolkata Police Commissioner

Rajeev Kumar's residence in the city Sunday to question him in

connection with multi-crore ponzi scams, but was denied

permission, bundled into jeeps and whisked to a police

station.

The chief minister, who is on a dharna since 8.30pm

Sunday, accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president

Amit Shah of trying to organise a "coup" in the state.

She alleged that National Security Advisor Ajit Doval

was directing the CBI to harass political opponents on the

orders of the prime minister. PTI PNT
