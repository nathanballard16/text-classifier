Gangster, aides fire at tavern owner in Daresi

LUDHIANA: Local gangster Shiva Bhatti, along with his three accomplices, opened fire at a tavern owner in bustling Daresi on Sunday afternoon.The four accused came on a bike and a scooter and fired four rounds, of which one hit Mohit Kumar Goru, 25, on his thigh outside the tavern.The incident was captured in a CCTV installed near the spot. Its footage showed the gangster firing a shot from a moving bike. He then took a U-turn and fired three more shots. As the accused fled the spot, the injured was taken to Christian Medical College and Hospital.Mohit and his father Pawan Kumar, 58, run the tavern.Pawan said an old rivalry was the reason behind the attack, which took place around 2.45pm when he and his son were at the tavern. Pawan, who is also an eyewitness, said, “I was at my shop and my son was standing outside when four men came. I identify one of them… he was Shiva Bhatti. Shiva, who was riding pillion on the bike, opened four shots and fled. I raised the alarm and took Mohit to hospital, where his condition is stated to be critical. Four months ago, Shiva had a fight with my son. A case was then registered against my son for ‘attempt to murder’. Later, the matter ended with a compromise. But Shiva nursed an enmity and now attacked Mohit.”Shiva, a local gangster of Killa Mohalla, was arrested by Ludhiana police with illegal weapons in 2018. He was lodged in jail and had come out on bail a week ago.Assistant commissioner of police (central) Waryam Singh said, “The police have registered a case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC and the Arms Act against Shiva and his three unidentified accomplices. The police have also found four shells from the spot.”
