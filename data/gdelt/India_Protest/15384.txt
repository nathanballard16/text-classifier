Salman Khan refuses to work with Priyanka Chopra, will he return with Katrina Kaif for Eid 2020?

Salman Khan currently has three new releases scheduled till 2020. Apart from Dabangg 3, the actor will also be seen in Kick 2 with Jacqueline Fernandez. Earlier the actor had scheduled Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Inshallah with Alia Bhatt for Eid 2020 since the project was shelved, he announced a new film titled, 'Radhe'. The film is reportedly a remake of Korean film The Outlaws released in 2017.



According to a report in Bollywood Hungama, the makers are currently looking for Salman's leading lady but wish to keep it fresh. It also stated, Radhe will see Salman playing a cop once again. A source was quoted by the portal saying, “Bhai plays a cop again in the Eid 2020 release. This would be two back-to-back releases Dabangg 3 followed by the Eid release, where Salman plays a cop. To avoid a sense of sameness his team members suggested Priyanka Chopra since she has no films on hand after The Sky Is Pink releases in October.”



However, Salman Khan refused to work with Priyanka. "At such short notice the choice was between Jacqueline Fernandez and Katrina Kaif. With Jacqueline, Salman is already doing Kick 2. He might as well give Katrina the Eid gift,” says the source.



After Priyanka quit his previous release Bharat, the actor went on to slam her during several interviews. Priyanka did open up about his comments during the promotions of The Sky is Pink and said, "The only thing I would say that is if there was a reaction required, you'd have had it by now." With Priyanka Chopra working on several Hollywood projects it's unlikely she will return to screen with Salman Khan.

Salman, on the other hand, is said to have recommended Katrina Kaif for Radhe's Eid 2020 release. Radhe is also helmed by Prabhu Dheva. Salman and Katrina collaborated on previous Eid releases like Ek Tha Tiger, Tiger Zinda Hai and Bharat, which proved to be blockbusters.
