Journalists hold protest march towards LoC against Indian actions in occupied Kashmir

Journalists from all over Pakistan and Azad Kashmir have started a protest march towards the Line of Control to condemn the ban on freedom of expression by Indian authorities in occupied Kashmir and express solidarity with the stranded Kashmiri people in the Valley.

Call for the march has been given by Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists.

More than four hundred journalists from different parts of Pakistan and Azad Kashmir had arrived in Muzaffarabad to take part in the march.

The march started from Central Press Club Muzaffarabad with the participants carrying two truckloads of medicines and dry ration to pass them on to the Indian forces for aid of people in occupied Kashmir.

Speaking to Radio Pakistan this morning, the journalists said India has usurped the fundamental rights of Kashmiris including the right to speak.

They said their march is aimed drawing attention of the international community and world human rights bodies to take note of Indian nefarious designs against the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Mubashar/Abid
