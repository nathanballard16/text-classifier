BBM Or Blackberry Messenger Is Shutting Down On May 31, And We All Feel Sad To See It Go

Kids remember birthdays. Adults remember anniversaries. But legends... Legends remember their BBM pin, even if they haven't shared it with anyone for a few years.

Time to dig out those old Blackberries or reinstall BBM on your Android phone, as the long forgotten king of messaging services will finally stop working in just over a month.

Yeah, it's sad news alright, as BBM or Blackberry Messenger is shutting down on May 31. Even if we all stopped using it some years ago, adopting WhatsApp, Line, Hike, Facebook Messenger or Telegram in its place.

In a blog post, Emtek (the company that's been keeping BBM alive since 2016) made the fateful announcement, blaming increasingly few users spending time on it at all.

"Though we are sad to say goodbye, the time has come to sunset the BBM consumer service, and for us to move on," the company wrote on its official blog.

Only the freely available BBM consumer service is being shut down on May 31, 2019. The paid, enterprise version of the service -- called BBMe -- will continue operating as normal. So if you still want to keep using Blackberry Messenger in some form or the other, you'll have to pay $2.50 for every six months of use. But for others, who don't suffer from separation anxiety, it's time to say goodbye to BBM once and for all.

I remember people bought Blackberry phones just to use BBM, because it was that cool at one point of time. When texting didn't exist, and intense "thumbing" was a way of life. And sharing your BBM pin -- an alphanumeric combination unique to every BBM user -- with someone to add you in their contacts was considered woke.

So long BBM, you were fun for the brief time I experienced you on a borrowed Blackberry Curve, and later when you arrive on Android and iPhone in October 2013.
