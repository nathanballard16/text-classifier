Holding March pattern: Five domestic, International flights delayed

AHMEDABAD: Passengers who travelled to Chennai, Patna, Dubai, Bangkok, and Bengaluru on SpiceJet flights on Tuesday had a harrowing experience as all these flights were delayed significantly. SpiceJet flight SG-501 to Chennai and SG-15 to Dubai were delayed by nearly three hours and that to Patna (SG-954) was delayed by over two hours. Sources confirmed that the airline had also announced a scheduled delay for two other flights, SG-85 to Bangkok and SG-928 to Bengaluru.Delays have become commonplace since March this year, say industry sources. On Time Performance (OTP) data of airlines for March 2019 suggests that the delay in operations of several flights, especially international ones, from the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad has spiked since March. Industry sources said this is primarily due to airlines battling fleet shortage and the closure of Karachi airspace.According to OTP data, operations of flights to Gulf countries are the worst affected, with SpiceJet and Fly Dubai reporting delays in more than 20% of their flight operations. “After tensions escalated along the India-Pakistan border following the Balakot airstrike by the Indian Air Force on February 26, Karachi airspace has been closed for international flights,” said a well-placed source. “Since Gulf-bound flights from Ahmedabad as well as other parts of India were forced to take a longer route, operations of several flights were delayed.”As for domestic operations, flights operated by SpiceJet reported maximum incidents of delay in March — 10.9% delay in March 2019, according to OTP data. The airline’s domestic operations were also delayed.The grounding of Boeing 737 Max aircraft on March 12 by the aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), is said to have hit SpiceJet adversely as 13 of its aircraft were put out of commission.“The worldwide grounding of Boeing 737 MAX aircraft had a direct impact on SpiceJet,” a SpiceJet spokesperson said. “Overnight, our fleet was reduced by 13 planes as our entire MAX fleet was grounded.”
