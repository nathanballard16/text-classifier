Mumbai: Fake cops loot senior citizen at Andheri

A 72-year-old man was robbed off valuables worth Rs 1.25 lakhs by two men who posed as cops on election duty. The victim Kundanlal Shah alleged that the accused duo first approached him and asked him to handover the valuables he was carrying as part of the routine check-up before elections. Shah realised after reaching home that his gold chain, diamond ring and other jewellery were missing.

According to the police, Shah, a resident of Andheri east is a retired professional. Last week, while he was returning home from a private bank, one of the accused who was standing across the road approached him and said that he is a police officer working on election duty.

"While one of the accused managed to engage Shah into a conversation, the other one switched the paper and took away the jewellery. A case has been registered under section 170, 420 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code. We are scrutinising the CCTV footages of the nearby shop and we hope to get a lead soon," said a police officer.
