Fact Check: Are policemen protesting against CAA too?

Amid protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens in parts of the country, a picture is going viral on social media of policemen holding posters against the government decisions.

Facebook post

India Today Anti-Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the viral picture is photoshopped. The original picture is of policemen protesting outside the Delhi Police headquarters after a clash with lawyers recently.

Facebook user "Moizuddin Khaja" posted the picture along with a caption in Hindi which translates to, "A little more... it's just a step away... Inshallah... revolution will come."

The viral post shows policemen holding posters saying, "No NRC, No CAA."

Till the filing of this story, the post was shared more than 2,700 times. The archived version of the post can be seen here.

To verify the claim, we reverse-searched the viral photo and found an article published by "The Week" on November 5 this year.

The article carries the picture of policemen protesting as seen in the viral post. However, here, one poster reads "Policemen are also humans" and another demands the arrest of one Kapil Tanwar.

Fake and real photos

According to the article, on November 2, 2019, there was a dispute between police and lawyers at Delhi's Tis Hazari court over parking, which later turned violent. Two days later, a group of lawyers assaulted a policeman outside Saket court.
