Fall to death from flyover

The victim was taken to the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital where he was declared dead

Kamalesh Singh, a resident of Karl Marx Sarani, was speeding and fell from the flyover, cops said. He landed near Topsia police station, not far from the Park Circus seven-point crossing.

A two-wheeler rider in his 30s died after falling from Parama flyover on Saturday evening.

He was taken to the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, where he was declared dead. Police are yet to ascertain if he was wearing a helmet.

The two-wheeler was seized for mechanical testing.

In July, a scooter-borne delivery boy for an online food delivery portal died in an accident on the Parama flyover when he and his friend had sneaked into the overbridge by dodging guardrails. Neither had been wearing a helmet.

Sanjay Rana, 23, a resident of Pulin Khatick Road in Tangra and his friend Chottu Das, 20, also from the same neighbourhood, were returning home when they broke through the police cordon and sped along the EM Bypass-bound flank of the Parama flyover.

The two-wheeler, which belonged to Rana, apparently skidded throwing the duo to the ground on the flyover stretch above Boat Club.

Rana had died at the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

Das, who was riding pillion, had also received serious head injuries.
