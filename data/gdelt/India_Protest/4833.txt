New Delhi: In a bizarre incident, a Keralite was looted at gun point at broad daylight on Tuesday at Inderpuri road here. Pathanamthitta native Chandy Thomas who is a businessman in Delhi was robbed by a three-member gang.

Chandy Thomas was on the way to Connaught Place from his office when he was looted. A young man in a bike asked him to stop the car when he was crossing Inderpuri road. Chandy Thomas stopped his car thinking the man needs help from him. But the man forcefully entered the car and asked Chandy to take all valuable items by keeping him at gun point. Two other partners of the man also reached the spot.

With fear, Chandy took Rs 10,000 from his pocket and handed it over to the robber. But the robber demanded him to give his gold ring too.

Chandy screamed to get attention of two guards near CSIR office. When the guards looked towards the car, the robbers managed to flee from the spot.

Chandy Thomas has filed a petition with the police.
