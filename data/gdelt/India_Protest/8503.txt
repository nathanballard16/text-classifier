#TNAgainstHindiImposition trends on social media as draft education plan reignites Hindi debate

A campaign protesting "imposition of Hindi as a mandatory language in schools in non-Hindi speaking states" erupted on Twitter on Saturday.



The draft education policy 2019, proposed by Ministry of Human Resources and Development, suggests teaching of Hindi in non-Hindi speaking states.



The proposal by the HRD Ministry witnessed protest on Twitter after #StopHindiImposition and #TNAgainstHindiImposition started trending.

Here are a few reactions by people on Twitter.

We respect other languages but we wont accept imposing it on us...We have done it long back and we are still strong with our own language and will fight for our culture and identity.#StopHindiImposition #TNAgainstHindiImposition #Tamilanda pic.twitter.com/VjWfpbbQaR Antony Raiden (@RaidenAntony) June 1, 2019





Tamil Nadu will resist any form of imposition from Delhi.

The history will repeat itself. Well said. Tamil Nadu won't accept any alien language like Hindi. We have our unique identity! #StopHindiImposition #TNAgainstHindiImposition pic.twitter.com/7oVQOIYHKv George Vijay Addict (@VijayIsMyLife) June 1, 2019





DMK President MK Stalin also tweeted saying, "There is no space for Hindi in the blood of Tamilians. If attempted to force it on the people of the state, DMK will be ready for a war to stop that Hindi forced enforcement. The newly MPs will voice against this suggested policy in the Lok Sabha."



The school education minister of Tamil Nadu took the lead in criticising the Hindi-related proposal in the new policy.



The Opposition parties in Tamil Nadu conquered with anti-Hindi sentiments of the government.



AMMK leader TTV Dhinakaran said, "Imposing Hindi on non-Hindi speaking states will destroy pluralism. This would make non-Hindi speakers second class citizens."



Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan also warned of consequence if Hindi was forced on the people of Tamil Nadu.



Tamil Nadu has been consistently protesting against Hindi since the pre-independence era.

There will be no imposition: Former HRD minister

Reacting to the developments, former HRD minister and current Information & Broadcast Minister Prakash Javadekar said that there will be no imposition.

"There is no intention of imposing any language on anybody, we want to promote all Indian languages. It's a draft prepared by the committee, which will be decided by the government after getting public feedback," the minister told news agency ANI.
