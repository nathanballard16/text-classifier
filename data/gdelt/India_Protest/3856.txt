Srinagar, February 23

National Conference leaders on Saturday staged a demonstration here to protest against the attacks against Kashmiri students and traders outside the Valley.

Senior National Conference leaders and members were led by the party’s general secretary Ali Mohammad Sagar as they held a protest rally from the party headquarters. Later, they held a sit-in against the attacks on Kashmiri students and traders.

“Our leadership has made it clear that despite being citizens of India, Kashmiris are being targeted across the country. It has happened repeatedly but Kashmiri people cannot be suppressed,” Sagar said while addressing the rally.

Nasir Aslam Wani, the party’s provincial president who also took part in the protest, said an “atmosphere of fear and insecurity” had been created against Kashmiri students and traders.

“We ask this question to everyone. In a Maoist attack, there were more casualties but we never saw such anger against them. We never heard people say that they should be thrown out of the country,” Wani said.

Those who attended the rally also included former ministers and former legislators. The protesters also held a banner which demanded an end to “oppression” against Kashmiris.
