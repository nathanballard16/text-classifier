Railwaymen take out protest march, stage demonstration

As part of a call given by the All India Railwaymen’s Federation (AIRF), New Delhi, to observe “Warning Week” from September 16 to 19, members of the South Western Railway Mazdoor Union (SWRMU) took out a protest march and staged a demonstration in Hubballi on Thursday.

Led by office-bearers of the SWRMU, including Zonal President R.R. Naik and General Secretary A.M. D’Cruz, and others, the railway employees took out the protest march from the Railway Workshop to the office of the General Manager of South Western Railway, Rail Soudha, and staged the demonstration in front of it.

During the demonstration, they urged the Union government to immediately stop any efforts towards privatisation and corporatisation of Indian Railways and also demanded steps to fulfil the charter of demands of the railway personnel.

Addressing the protestors, the office-bearers urged the Union government to immediately withdraw the order on allowing private companies to run a few trains on certain routes and cancel the order on closing printing press units.

They also urged the Union government to cancel the new pension scheme and revert to the old pension scheme in the interest of the railway employees.

The protestors then submitted a memorandum on their charter of demands to the railway authorities that included appointment for children of railwaymen, dress allowance to all categories, increasing bonus limits, and others.
