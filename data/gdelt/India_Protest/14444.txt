Students of Hyderabad's St Francis College staged a protest against the dress code dictated by the college administration. They chanted slogans and displayed placards that read "Remove the Dress Code," "The Only Issue is Your Mentality," and "Protesting to Educate You about Equality." The girls alleged they were asked to wear "knee-length kurtis" from August 1 and not "short-length kurtis", which triggered outrage among students. However, the college management said the dress code was already in place, and the students had given an undertaking that they will not wear shorts, sleeveless or cold shoulder tops failing which they would face disciplinary action. The issue came into limelight when a video went viral on social media purportedly showing security guards at the main gate screening female students, and allowing only those who are following the 'knee-length kurtis' rule. According to reports, following massive protests, the management of St Francis College for Women on Monday withdrew the directive. (BCCL)
