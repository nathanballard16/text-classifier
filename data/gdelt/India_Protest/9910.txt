MUMBAI: Rating agencyon Wednesday cut Edelweiss Financial’s long-term NCD rating to AA- from AA with a negative outlook. It also cut Piramal Capital & Housing Finance’s NCD, Tier 2 bonds and bank facilities to AA from AA+, citing rising funding problems.ICRA cited higher vulnerability for Edelweiss in the financial firm’s wholesale lending book, with heightened risk profile of assets from real estate and structured debt.“The rating downgrade reflects the increased vulnerability in the Edelweiss Group’s wholesale lending book with the heightened risk profile of the underlying assets, comprising real estate and structured debt transactions across sectors, and the consequent rise in stressed exposures,” the firm said in its rationale.It pointed out outlook of non-banking finance companies is likely to be constrained in the near to medium term due to investors’ risk averse sentiment and their inability to mobilise resources their outlook is expected to remain constrained over the near to medium term.Credit disbursals by nonbanking finance companies dropped by a third in the year to March after they were gripped by the liquidity squeeze that followed the unexpected default by Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (IL&FS) in September last year. Given that NBFCs contribute almost 20 per cent of the total credit in India, the numbers reflect the threat posed to the government’s plan to revive the economy.ICRA’s rating action on Piramal Capital factored in the rise of the company’s cost of borrowings and its relatively high exposure to short-term borrowings (~16 per cent of borrowings as on March 31, 2019).“While PCHFL has demonstrated its ability to maintain adequate asset quality, a prolonged slowdown in the real estate industry, coupled with the liquidity crunch in the overall market, could have an adverse impact on the same,” ICRA noted.The NBFC sector, safe for a handful of well-managed companies, has been under pressure since the IL&FS default. Repayment worries over Dewan Housing Finance and the Essel Group have pushed funding costs at NBFCs to multi-year highs. Spreads on top-rated five-year bonds of Indian NBFCs have risen 70 basis points, or 0.7 percentage points, in the past year.“This move is largely a reflection of an unstable and volatile external milieu and stems out of the credit rating agency’s apprehension of a worsening economic climate and its impact on asset quality,” Edelweiss said in a statement. “We will ensure that this does not affect our plans materially. We will work with the credit rating agency to get the rating restored as soon as possible.”
