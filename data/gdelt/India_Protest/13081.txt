SFI takes to streets to protest caning of students

Activists of the Students Federation of India staged a protest here on Friday to criticise the lathi-charge on their activists by the police on Thursday.

A. Ashok, State President, SFI, said the “attacks” on the students and activists were unjustified as they were demanding what they deserved — reimbursement of fees and the disbursement of scholarships that had been pending for long.

The SFI on Thursday took to the streets demanding fulfilling of long pending demands of the students and to fill the numerous vacancies in public universities and colleges across the State. It demanded that the government revoke the withdrawal of the mid-day meal scheme from Junior colleges and expressed its disapproval of the State's decision to hand over the scheme's responsibility to the Akshaya Patra Foundation.
