On Sunday, 24 film bodies including FWICE (Federation of Western India Cine Employees) and IFTDA (Indian Film & Television Directors’ Association) staged a protest against the attack on CRPF jawans in Pulwama. Following this, the All Indian Cine Workers Association (AICWA) took the stand of banning all artistes from Pakistan.

The notice issued yesterday by AICWA stated, “All India Cine Workers Association strongly condemns the brutal terrorist attack on our soldiers in Pulwama, Jammu & Kashmir. Our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims. AICWA stands with the nation in confronting such terror and humanity. We’re officially announcing a total ban on Pakistani actors and artistes working in the film industry. Still, if any organisation insists on working with Pakistani artistes, they will be banned and strong action will be taken against them. Nation comes first, we stand with our nation.”
