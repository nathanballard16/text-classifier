Congress MLA Aditi Singh defies boycott directive, gets show cause notice

Congress MLA Aditi Singh from Raebareli on Friday was issued a show cause notice for attending a special session of UP Assembly on October 2. The session had been boycotted by the Congress party.

Aditi Singh has been asked to reply within two days.

Earlier, party workers also staged a protest outside her house and demanded her resignation.

The 36-hour special session, convened on the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, was called to discuss sustainable development goals, which the Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress decided to boycott claiming the state government was just out to set a record.

While speaking to India Today TV, Aditi Singh said, "I haven't received the show cause notice. They have circulated to the media and not bothered to contact me."

She also said, "UP Congress chief Ajay Lallu is not even answering my phone."



"What about Rajesh Singh and Dinesh Singh [Congress leaders)? Where is there show cause notice?" Aditi Singh said.
