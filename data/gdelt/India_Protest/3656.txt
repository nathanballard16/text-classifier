Drivers demand regularisation of Class 4 employees

LUDHIANA: Raising the demand for regularisation, the drivers and sanitation staff of MC protested for almost three hours outside MC zone-D office on Wednesday. The drivers claimed there are only 35 regular drivers against 300 vehicles of MC, and Class 4 employees were deployed to fill the gap.They demanded MC should promote Class 4 employees as drivers since they have been working from the past 10 years (and more in some cases). To continue pressurizing the authorities, a group of seven drivers have also gone on a hunger strike which they plan to continue till their demands are met.The employees through their protest also supported the ministerial union strike at Punjab level. The employees gathered at zone-D office and started their protest in front of MC premises. The drivers claimed MC will not suffer financially even if they regularise Class 4 employees appointed as drivers who were about to retire. The MC, as claimed, will not be liable to pay them extra benefits, but only their legit salary of a driver.Requesting anonymity, one of the officials claimed that there are only 35 regular drivers and MC has around 300 vehicles. To fulfil the vacant positions, the MC should have hired drivers instead of Class 4 employees. He added that more than 10 years have passed since they have working as drivers.To avoid any problem to public, Suvidha Centre employees were appointed near the site where protesters were agitating. The officials threatened that of their demands are not met, they will not refrain from organising a complete ‘ bandh ’.The protesters have called for a pen down strike tomorrow.
