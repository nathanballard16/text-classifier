Protests erupt in northeast over ‘reintroduction’ of citizenship bill

GUWAHATI: The opening day of Parliament’s winter session on Monday saw the intensification of protests in the northeast against the Centre’s decision to re-introduce the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB). Anger and resentment were building up in the region ever since Union home minister Amit Shah made public his government’s decision last month.The proposed amendment offers to grant Indian citizenship to non-Muslims from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on grounds of religious persecution.In Assam’s Brahmaputra valley, activists of All Assam Students’ Union, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti and Left parties held demonstrations across the state. They chanted slogans such as “CAB is a shield for illegal Bangladeshi migrants” while leading a massive rally towards Raj Bhavan.In stark contrast, Assam’s Bengali-dominated Barak Valley was quiet all through the day. Local organisations such as Citizens’ Rights Preservation Committee and Bengali Joint Coordination Committee said they are hopeful that the Centre would be able to settle the citizenship issue.Opposition Congress leaders led by Rakibul Hussain met All India Congress Committee (AICC) general secretary KC Venugopal in New Delhi to press for the withdrawal of the CAB.In neighbouring Meghalaya, which recently introduced registration of outsiders coming to the state for more than 24 hours, protesters led by the Confederation of Meghalaya Social Organizations and the North East Forum of Indigenous People launched a night road blockade in two phases — from 7 pm on Monday to 6 am on Tuesday and from 7 pm on Tuesday to 6 am on Wednesday.In the Meghalaya capital, activists from Khasi Students Union, Garo Students Union and other bodies affiliated to the North East Students’ Organization (Neso) staged a sit-in-demonstration in front of the additional secretariat here.In Itanagar, activists from All Arunachal Pradesh Students’ Union, a Neso constituent, and other student organisations held a protest march in front of Raj Bhawan. They submitted a memorandum addressed to the Centre through the governor.
