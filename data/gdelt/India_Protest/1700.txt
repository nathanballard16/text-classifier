Kolhapur: The Other Backward Class (OBC) community is going to hold a protest march at Vidhan Bhavan in Mumbai on February 25.Hundreds of OBC and nomadic tribe (NT) protesters marched from Dasara Chowk to Mahavir College on Sunday morning. We are going to march from Azad Maidan to Vidhan Bhavan on February 25.”MLA Haribhau Rathod said, “The population of OBC’s is around 52% and yet they get only 27% quota. Several petitions have been filed against the reservation in the HC and the hearings are ongoing. We want a population-based quota for which the government should initiate a caste-based census as early as possible. All parties supported the government’s move, which shows that all the parties have an anti-OBC agenda.
