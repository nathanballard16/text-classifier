Advocates stage demo demanding activist Mugilan’s release

‘He could be in illegal custody’

A group of advocates and human rights activists staged a demonstration in front of the Madurai District Court, demanding the release of environment activist R.S. Mugilan, who allegedly disappeared hours after releasing a video documentary at Chennai Press Club on February 15.

Advocate S. Vanchinathan, addressing media persons, said it was 13 days now since Mr. Mugilan was last seen. The activist had gathered evidence to prove that highly placed police and Sterlite officials were behind the Thoothukudi incidents.

After the video documentary was released at the press club, he disappeared. He might have had more such evidence to prove his point. He would have been taken into illegal custody, he said.

Demanding an answer from the State, Mr. Vanchinathan sought an inquiry on the disappearance and against police and Sterlite officials behind the Thoothukudi incidents. If an inquiry was not initiated within a week, the ruling party would be questioned during their election campaign, he said.
