After students, BHU profs begin signature campaign

Varanasi: After students registered their protest against the new citizenship law during the 101st convocation of BHU on Monday and Tuesday, professors at the university and its affiliated colleges on Wednesday started a signature campaign against the Act and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).Talking to TOI, dean, faculty of social sciences, BHU, Prof RP Pathak confirmed that he, along with other professors, had signed a petition against CAA and NRC on the initiative of a professor, NK Mishra.At least 51 professors of BHU and affiliated colleges and academicians have signed the petition so far.The petition, which has also gone viral on social media, says: “We, the teachers of BHU, IIT-BHU and affiliated colleges, are pained and aghast at the CAA and the declared follow up by implementation of NRC. It is completely against the spirit of freedom struggle and the idea of pluralistic democracy and is unacceptable in the land of Gandhi and Tagore.”The petition says the move is an attempt to divide the society on communal lines so that real issues relegate to background. “This is unacceptable that a modern nation, which claims to be the torch-bearer of progressive values and aims to be ‘Vishwa Guru’ (world leader), resorts to such a regressive and ill-informed policy which is devoid of historical and social understanding. This is against the Indian tradition of inclusiveness,” it adds. “It is shameful to note that politics has brought such a glorious tradition to a point that our own brethren are “de-citizenised” in their own country. We request the government to rethink about long-term implications of the Act and hope national interest would prevail over divisive politics,” the petition says and urges protesters not to resort to violence and express disagreement through peaceful means.The petition also condemns police brutalities on students of various universities.During BHU convocation, Rajat, a student of MA (history of arts) had refused to accept his degree in protest against CAA and arrest of 19 BHU students.On Tuesday, a group of students from faculty of Arts protested against the arrest of students, who were sent to jail on December 19 while they were marching towards Beniabagh ground to hold anti-CAA meeting.
