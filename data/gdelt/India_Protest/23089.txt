Kerala: Buses belonging to ISRO – India’s pride – blocked by anti-CAA protesters

Protesters blocking an ISRO bus

Thiruvananthapuram: As anti-citizenship law protests raged across the country, protesters in Kerala’s capital Thiruvananthapuram stopped vehicles of the Indian Space Research Organisation or the ISRO. Pictures available showed protesters blocking a bus of the ISRO on which Central government was clearly marked.

It may be noted that the Indian space agency is recognised not just in India but across the world for launching space missions and satellites at a fraction of the cost which its foreign counterparts like the NASA incur. ISRO is the first space agency to have put an orbiter in Mars’ orbit in the very attempt. It has also launched two missions to the Moon – one of which confirmed the presence of water on the Earth’s only natural satellite.

Meanwhile, Kerala Police today maintained high vigil in northern districts of the state following the killing of two people in police firing in Mangaluru yesterday, in neighbouring Karnataka.

Kerala DGP D Loknath Behera last night asked the state police to maintain high alert, especially in Wayanad, Kozhikode, Kasaragod and Kannur districts.

Despite high alert and police deployment across the state, a number of protest marches were held across several districts. Trains and buses were blocked, as per reports.

Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and Kerala Students Union (KSU) activists held protest at railway stations in Palakkad and Thiruvananthapuram, respectively, and blocked trains.

Those protesting against CAA also blocked Karnataka RTC buses in some parts of Kozhikode. The Kerala Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), meanwhile, suspended bus services to Mangaluru.

Kerala Transport Minister A K Saseendran said service would resume only when the situation returns to normal.
