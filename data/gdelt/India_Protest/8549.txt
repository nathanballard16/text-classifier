India lodges strong protest to Pak for intimidating guests at Iftar party

STAFF REPORTER /NEW DELHI

India today has lodged a strong protest to Pakistan for intimidation of Pakistani guests by security forces at an Iftar party in Indian High Commission in Islamabad yesterday.

The Iftar, traditionally held in the month of Ramzan, was hosted by the High Commissioner of India at Hotel Serena. In a press release, High Commission of India said that India has requested Pakistan to urgently investigate the matter.

New Delhi has also emphasised to Pakistan government the need to ensure that diplomats and officials of the High Commission of India are allowed to discharge their diplomatic functions without fear of coercion or harassment. The High Commission said, guests faced unprecedented harassment and intimidation at the hands of security agencies.

It said, a concerted campaign was launched by Pakistan’s security agencies in the days preceding the Iftar function to reach out to invitees to actively dissuade them from attending the event. In some cases, cars used by invitees were lifted and removed using forklifts.

The High Commission said, more than 300 Pakistani guests who were turned away included parliamentarians, government officials, media representatives and retired diplomats in addition to citizen from all walks of life.

India said, stopping diplomats and officials of the High Commission of India in Pakistan from discharging their diplomatic functions by intimidation and coercion is entirely counter-productive for the bilateral ties.
