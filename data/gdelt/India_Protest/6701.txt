JKLF to hold two-day hunger strike camp outside NPC

Rawalpindi, April 19, 2019 (PPI-OT): The Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) has said that a two-day hunger strike camp will be organized outside the National Press Club, Islamabad, on Thursday and Friday against the stepped up Indian state terrorism in occupied Kashmir.

The JKLF Azad Jammu and Kashmir chapter in a statement issued after a meeting in Rawalpindi, today, said the hunger strike camp is aimed at drawing the world’s attention towards banning of JKLF by Indian government in occupied Kashmir, booking of its Chairman, Muhammad Yasin Malik, under draconian law Public Safety Act and shifting him to New Delhi by India’s infamous National Investigation Agency and the farcical elections being held in the occupied territory. The statement said that a function would also be held to pay tributes to the JKLF founding leader, Amanullah Khan, on his third death anniversary on 26th April.
