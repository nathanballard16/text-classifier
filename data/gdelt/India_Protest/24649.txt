Aftersaw protests againstand CAA, a section of students marched in support ofon Tuesday evening. They called for an end to politics in education institutes.“We welcome the persecuted religious minorities in, Afghanistan and,” their banner read.“We are in support of CAA. It is a constitutional and cultural responsibility ofthat persecuted minorities of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh are accepted in India,” a student who did not wish to be named, told Mirror.The march started in the campus around 5.30 pm and was attended by over a hundred students.“We wholeheartedly welcome the religious persecuted minorities. We stand against the violence and politicisation of campuses in India. And we stand against misinformation in the country against CAA. We request protesters to go through the Act and then form an opinion,” Narayana Eeti, a student said.Asked if they meant non-Muslims by “persecuted minorities” Eeti clarified that the Act had a logic and was not framed on the basis of feelings as only three Islamic neighbouring countries were taken into account. As for other countries, there was no stop to migration of people from any religion, including Muslims. “The Act is not discriminatory and does not go against the India ethos,” he said.The students said the support march was limited to CAA as they had not studied the issue of NRC in depth.“There is so much agitation against CCA. When I spoke to students who were protesting against the laws, I realised they did not have solid points. They said India Muslims will lose citizenship. When I read the Act, I felt it was not so. I came out against some of these myths,” a PhD research scholar said on condition of anonymity.
