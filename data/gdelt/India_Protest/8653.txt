One-time toll-tax be imposed at time of purchase of new vehicles like system exists for one-time road-tax

Dear Editor,

New highways and expressways are being regularly developed in different parts of the country. But multiple number of toll-plazas at all these expressways and highways cause unnecessary hindrance in otherwise smooth fast traffic. Many unauthorised toll-plazas have also been set up in connivance with local politicians and police for unauthorizedly looting unaware public. There are reports that even authorized toll-plazas have to pay regularly to corrupt ones in the system.

Best is to replace toll-system by charging one-time toll-tax on purchase of new vehicles like system exists for charging one-time road-tax on purchase of new vehicles. All concerned including vehicle-users and transport-authorities welcomed system of one-time payment of road-tax avoiding cumbersome procedure of paying and collecting road-tax.

Amount collected through one-time toll-tax on purchase of new vehicles can then be utilised for developing and maintaining highways without necessitating toll-plazas as big hurdles causing queues at toll-plazas. One-time toll-tax can be fixed according to ex-showroom price of new vehicles so that people having costly cars may have to contribute more than those purchasing economy cars. People paying extra clubbed with cost of new vehicle will never mind because of facility of toll-free movement in future.
