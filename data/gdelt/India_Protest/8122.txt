Delhi government on Monday released around Rs 206 crore to the cash-strapped North Delhi Municipal Corporation, even as doctors of the civic body-run Hindu Rao hospital went on strike demanding payment of pending salaries.

Officials said Delhi government has released around Rs 459 crore as basic tax assignment, which is 25 per cent of 2019-20 budget estimates, to the five civic bodies in the city.

The doctors of Hindu Rao hospital went on strike on Monday, demanding payment of their salaries due for three months.

NDMC officials have said the salaries could not be paid due to delay in release of funds from Delhi government.

The share of NDMC in Rs 459 crore released by Delhi government to the civic bodies is approximately Rs 206 crore, said NDMC officials.

NDMC commissioner Varsha Joshi thanked Delhi government for release of the funds in a tweet.

"Grateful to Delhi Govt for finally having released the first quarter Basic Tax Allocation for the current financial year, which was due in April, over a month and a half after the file was processed within the concerned Del Gov department. Hope other dues are also released soon," Joshi tweeted.

Officials said the doctors are likely to end their strike on Tuesday since their pending salaries will be disbursed soon as funds are available now.
