Police nabs five gangsters who looted petrol pump in Rajasthan

Police nabbed five people fleeing away in a car after looting a petrol pump and seized a pistol with live cartridges and cash worth Rs 2.10 lakhs in Rajasthan's Sirohi district, police said Monday.

All the five accused are suspected to be associated with Jitendra Gogi, a Delhi-based gangster.

Sirohi Superintendent of Police (SP) Jai Yadav said police received information on Sunday that five people have robbed a petrol pump in Bhimana area and fled in a car with Delhi's registration number.

"With this information, police traced the car and started chasing it. Seeing the police following them, the car-borne men started firing at the police team and the police then responded with counter firing," Yadav said.

Police succeeded in intercepting the car and arrested all the five men.

Three of the accused identified as Ravindra Rajput, Vikas Jat alias Vicky and Jatin Jat alias Indrajeet are from Delhi and and the other two Amit Jat alias Meeta and Jaideep Jat alias Mogli belong to Haryana.

Among the arrested, Vikas has five cases registered against him in Delhi, including those of murder, loot and dacoity.

Yadav said "Vikas had come in contact with gangster Gogi during his judicial custody in Tihar Jail, in a case related to murder, and all these accused belong to areas near Gogi's village."



Police have started investigating the matter to ascertain their link with the gangster, the gang's network in and around Delhi, and their link with various past incidents of loot, dacoity, murder and firing on police in the states of Haryana, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand.
