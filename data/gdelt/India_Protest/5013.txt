"The school management cadre system isn't only depriving teachers of their right to get the promotions, but the interloper will end up losing whatever gains have been attained so far in the standard of education".The Sindh government notified the Education Management Cadre consisting of School Executive Service, School Management Service and School Finance Service in October 2014.Under the school management service policy, the headmasters of all the government schools will be appointed through Sindh Public Service Commission while the school teachers will no longer be allowed to get the headmaster position through promotion.He argued that the management cadre will lead to the financial massacre of the teachers and administrative officers of the education department.He claimed that the provincial government has still not addressed the matters of timescale and long pending promotions of the teachers.The teachers in their slogans said they will not accept the handover of administrative control of the schools and education department to bureaucrats who lack experience and skill required for this profession.
