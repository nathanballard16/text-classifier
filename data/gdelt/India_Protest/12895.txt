Rayakottai farmers stage protest

Farmers from over 23 villages in Rayakottai staged a protest at the Collectorate here on Wednesday against the issuance of land acquisition notice to them for Irugur-Devanagondhi Petroleum pipeline project.

The Irugur-Devanagondhi Petroleum and Petroleum Products Pipeline of Bharat Petroleum Corporation of India, according to the websites of the Petroleum and Gas Regulatory Board and that of BPCL, claims that the project envisions laying, building and operating pipeline from Irugur (BPCL’s existing pumping station in Coimbatore district) to Devanagonthi in Karnataka. The proposed pipeline spans a length of 294 km and is conceived to meet the market demand of BPCL-fed areas in Karnataka.

According to Tamizhaga Uzhavar Munnani, which is spearheading the protest, lands were acquired from farmers for GAIL gas pipeline project. Further, farmlands were acquired to over 240 feet for the proposed six-lane project from Dharmapuri to Hosur via Rayakottai.

In this backdrop, BPCL has notified lands for acquisition to carry petroleum and petroleum products. Pipelines should be laid above the ground like in Kerala, the farmers said.

Earlier, DMK MLAs of Thally and Vepanapalli, Y. Prakash and Murugan, submitted a petition to District Collector S.Prabhakar opposing the project and urged him to intervene to protect the farmlands.
