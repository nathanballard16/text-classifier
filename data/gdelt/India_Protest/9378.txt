All India doctor’s strike: OPD shut at Victoria hospital, Bengaluru

At Victoria hospital, Bengaluru, resident doctors under the banner of BMCRI (Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute) Resident Doctors Association stood in protest outside the OPD building of the hospital.

Many patients were seen sitting along footpaths and the road.

"I came here to visit a psychiatrist and I wasn't aware that the hospital would be closed today. The doctors have said they will not be attending to patients today, but I'm still waiting to see if anything can turn my way", said Pradeep, a resident from Kengeri.

Another woman on the condition of anonymity said, "My mother has been having problems since last 15 days and her surgery was fixed for today. But now everything is closed."

Another woman also addressed similar concerns of her husband having stomach pain and not being aware of the hospital OPD being shut today. She said, "I have no option but to get him back here tomorrow."

The hospital OPD had a help desk facility to cater to the numerous patients who were left clueless about today's protest.
