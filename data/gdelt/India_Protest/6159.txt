MP I-T searches: BJP asks EC to transfer Indore SSP Mishra

The Madhya Pradesh BJP Tuesday asked the Election Commission to transfer Indore police official Ruchi Vardhan Mishra for arriving at the house of an aide of MP CM Kamal Nath while an Income-Tax search was underway.

Senior Superintendent of Police Ruchi Vardhan Mishra Sunday reached the house of Pravin Kakkad, ex-Officer on Special Duty of Nath, in the city's Vijay Nagar area while an I-T operation was underway there.

The BJP complaint, submitted to district returning officer Lokesh Kumar Jatav, stated that Mishra reached Kakkad's residence despite the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), which was deployed as security cover for the I-T raids, had not sought help from MP police.

"Mishra reached the house at the behest of the state Congress government and tried to hinder the I-T investigation against Kakkad. The SSP should be transferred immediately," MP BJP spokesperson Umesh Sharma told reporters.

The party's complaint to the returning officer stated that Mishra be transferred to ensure free and fair elections for the Indore Lok Sabha seat.

A video of Mishra arriving at Kakkad's house had gone viral on social media.

Speaking to PTI on Sunday, Mishra had said, "Since workers of a political party staged a protest without permission in Rajwada area after Income Tax raids, I took stock in Vijay Nagar area as a precautionary measure."



The I-T raids on Kakkad's house were completed late Monday night, sources said.
