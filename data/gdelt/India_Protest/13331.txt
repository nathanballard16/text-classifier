Congress Leaders’ Padayatra foiled

Hyderabad: The attempt of the Congress Leaders to protest against irregular water supply in RR District was foiled by the police and the Congress Leaders were taken in custody as a precautionary measure.

It may be mentioned that former MP, Konda Vishveshwara Reddy and ex-Minster, Prasad Kumar were taking out the Padayatra. They were released later in their areas.

Talking to the media persons, Mr Reddy condemned the arrest of the leaders and told that no permission is being given for raising voice on public issues.

One Lakh for 1 Acre:

He appealed to the CM of TS to release water. He criticized the CM that he is spending Re. one lakh to irrigate one acre of land in his area. He demanded the CM to complete Laxmidevi Water Reservoir since farmers are facing inconvenience for not getting water for their fields.

He opposed the efforts of the CM to supply water to Rayalaseema but he forgets Telangana. He also stressed the need to implement the Rythu Bandhu Scheme.

Leaders Padayatra:

Former minister, Mr Prasad Kumar told that Congress Party had planned to organize Padayatra to raise the issue of providing irrigation facilities from Polamoor Reservoir but Govt. did not permit it to do so.

He pointed out that during Congress regime, opposition parties were given permission to protest but these days, Mr KCR is supplying water to Rayalaseema to please YS Jaganmohan Reddy. He advised the CM to take care of this state instead of helping the neighbouring state.
