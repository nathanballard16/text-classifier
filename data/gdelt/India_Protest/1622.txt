Villagers’ joy short-lived: ZP school gets teachers, but only for a month

Villagers of Ganeshpuri, Targhar, Ulwe and Kombadbhuje were happy on Thursday that their protest had forced the State government to send teachers to the zilla parishad (ZP) school. But they were shocked on Friday when the government letter they received said that the arrangement is only for a month.

Prashant Bhoir, president of the committee of the four villages, said, “The letter said the order was passed as per our demand for the extension of the service of ZP teachers for a month, which is not true. We have been asking for teachers for this complete academic year. On Monday, we will again meet the ZP officer regarding the matter.”

After a protest by the villagers on Thursday from 11 a.m. outside the block development office, the government, by around 2.30 p.m., made the decision to send teachers. “We were conveyed orally by the block development officer that teachers would come on Friday, and that a written order would be given to us. We thought our protest was successful, but the problem seems to be nowhere near ending. On Friday, the teachers came and along with children, made preparations for Republic Day,” said Kirti Madhavi, one of the seven women from Ulwe, who have been teaching in the ZP school ever since the teachers were asked to stop taking classes by the State.

ZP CEO Abhay Yawalkar said, “As per my knowledge, the demand was for one-month extension and hence the order was issued by the government. Extension of another month depends on the State.”

Close to 155 children from the four villages have been suffering since the Deepavali vacation after the government decided to shut the old ZP school and asked the teachers to shift to the new school constructed by the CIDCO in Sector 24, Ulwe. The State cited the reason that the villagers would have to shift from the villages in view of the Navi Mumbai International Airport project.
