Union govt responsible for protests, says Pawar

Pune: NCP chief Sharad Pawar on Saturday held the Union government responsible for protests across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC). He said the Union government’s move was an attempt to divert attention from a much deeper challenge of an economic crisis.Addressing a news conference, Pawar said the government had not maintained clarity on CAA and NRC. He said it should clarify why only migrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan would be given citizenship under the amended law and not other countries like Sri Lankan Tamils. There is fear among people that the Act would destabilise the country’s social and religious harmony, said Pawar.“The Union government should hold talks to control the situation, but no such attempt is in sight. Its stand has created a huge challenge before the state governments. Eight states, including Bihar, ruled by an NDA ally, have refused to implement the law. My party voted against the bill in Parliament. We hope Maharashtra’s chief minister will take a similar stand,” he said.
