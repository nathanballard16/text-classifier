PICS: Christopher Nolan, Dimple Kapadia & David Washington spotted on Mumbai's Tenet set sans Robert Pattinson

The award-winning director Christopher Nolan has officially taken to the streets of Mumbai to shoot his upcoming film Tenet. Nolan, who is currently shooting in Mumbai's Colaba area in South Mumbai, kick-started the shooting earlier this week. Starring in the film are Robert Pattinson, Dimple Kapadia and David John Washington. Today, the cast and crew of Tenet were snapped while shooting the film in Colaba. Pinkvilla had exclusively revealed that after wrapping up in Colaba the team will be headed to Grant Road for a three-night shoot schedule.

Today, Dimple Kapadia was spotted chatting with Nolan before her scene. Whereas, Nolan was busy and focused as the film's cast and crew were undeterred by the media and paparazzi that had gathered to get a glimpse of the shoot. However, Twilight star Robert Pattinson was not to be seen anywhere.

Actor David John Washington was suited up for his scene as he was snapped in the midst of it. While he walked towards the camera, Dimple Kapadia who was dressed in a salwar kameez with a shawl wrapped around was spotted reading the newspaper. Check out photos of Tenet's on set pictures:

We hear that the team is done with its outdoor shoot and will be filming a few scenes in an almost deserted building in Grant Road. One floor of the 23-story building will double up as a filming spot and the terrace will also be used. A team of 300-400 people is expected to make their way to the location and shoot a few crucial scenes.
