Azad was later questioned in the night about the clashes that left many among the police and the protesters injured.

DCP South East, Chinmoy Biswal said that Azad along with his supporters will be produced before the Saket Court in connection with the incident.

They had been charged with rioting, resorting to violence and damaging public property.

It may be recalled that the Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had on August 10 demolished the centuries-old Guru Ravidas temple in Delhi's Tughlaqabad following a Supreme Court order.

However, the demolition of the Ravidas temple triggered a bitter political war of words between the Centre and Delhi's ruling Aam Admi Party.
