"We have arrested 62 people from all over the state, including from places such as Meerut, Aligarh, Mau, Varanasi, Prayagraj and Aligarh. Three people arrested from Meerut were held for distributing inflammatory pamphlets," Singh told ANI here.

"Various organisations had called for public agitation programs at various locations in Uttar Pradesh. Keeping that in mind Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) has been imposed throughout the state, therefore, no assembly of more than four people is allowed. We urge people to desist from taking part in protests," he said.

"We have also deployed extra battalions of police, Rapid Action Force (RAF), and increased the frequency of patrolling vehicles in the entire state," Singh added.

Meanwhile, the city police team in Lucknow, under the guidance of Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), nabbed three people accused of rumour-mongering on social media.
