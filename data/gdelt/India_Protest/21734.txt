Centre ready to discuss provisions of Citizenship act with concerned parties: Amit Shah

As protests continue unabated in most parts of the country against the Citizenship Act Home Minister Amit Shah assured the minorities of India that there is nothing to worry and the act will not impinge on any of their rights. The violence witnessed in parts of India is politically motivated and provoked by a few political outfits, said Shah.In an interview to ET NOW, Shah categorically laid down the rationale behind the act and assured the northeastern states that the centre was ready to discuss the various contentious provisions of the act. We understand the complexities in the northeast and therefore the government is willing to iron out the various aspects arising from the act, mentioned Shah.Commenting on National Register of Citizens, Shah unequivocally said the provisions of NRC was brought by Congress in 1985 by Rajiv Gandhi. Clause 4 was further added by the Congress. NRC is nothing, but a register which has record of all the citizens.Earlier today, the opposition parties continued their protests over the passage of the Citizenship Act . In West Bengal, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee held another march from 8B bus stand in Kolkata to Howrah.The Citizenship Act makes it easier for the non-Muslim immigrants from India's neighbours - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan - to become citizens of India. Though the Bill doesn't spell it out clearly, but the fact that it entitles Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians facing religious persecution in the three nations, to seek Indian citizenship, highlights the exclusion of Muslims. The Act says the refugees of the six communities will be given Indian citizenship after residing in India for five years, instead of 11 years earlier.
