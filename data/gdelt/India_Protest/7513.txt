This 79-Year-Old Retired Professor From Pune Still Lives Without Electricity At Home

For most of us, living without electricity is something that we cannot even imagine. But a 79-year-old woman in Pune has demonstrated through her life that even in the 21st century, one can live without electricity.

But Hema Sane has never used electricity at her small house in Pune’s Budhwar Peth locality.

Now, if you thought she is some poor woman who could not afford a power connection, you are wrong.

Dr. Hema Shane is a Ph.D. holder in Botany from Savitribai Phule Pune University and she was even a professor at Garware College Pune for several years. She lives in a small house, which is surrounded by different types of trees and birds.

She said she never felt the need for electricity “in my whole life.”

“People often ask me how you live without electricity and I ask them how do you live with electricity?" she told ANI.

"These birds are my friends and whenever I do my housework they come. People often ask me why don't you sell this house, you will get so much money! I always say who will look after these trees and birds? I don't want to go out. I want to stay with them," she said.

Dr. Shane who is the author of a number of books on Botany and environment said "Food, shelter, and clothing are the basic needs. Once upon a time, there was no electricity, it came much later, I can manage without it."

Dr. Sane who keeps herself busy even now writing new books said, "I don't give any message or lesson to anyone, rather I echo the famous quote of Lord Buddha who says that you have to find your own path in life."
