NEW DELHI, May 17 (PTI)—Members from all sections of the Rajya Sabha today voiced concern over the death of a youth while in custody in the Lajpat Nagar police station in Delhi yesterday. They said his alleged suicide had created suspicions about the way the police handled him. Mr. Vidya Charan Shukla, Minister of State for Home Affairs, agreed with the members that the suspicion was “not invalid” and said the matter needed to be inquired into. He added that the demand for judicial inquiry, made by one of the members, would be “duly considered”. The Deputy Chairman, Mrs. Violet Alva, suggested that the Government should make a detailed investigation in view of the “lurking suspicion” in the minds of members. The discussion arose out of yesterday’s incident in Lajpat Nagar, in which people demonstrated before a police station following the death of the youth in custody. The youth, held on a theft charge, was reported to have jumped from the second floor of the police station.
