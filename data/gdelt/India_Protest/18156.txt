“Will protest against relief to Rajoana,” Bittu

Days after the Union Home Ministry commuted the death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana, main accused in the Beant Singh assassination case, Ludhiana Member of Parliament Ravneet Singh Bittu has stated that he along with families affected by terrorism would stage a dharna outside Parliament.

The session is set to begin on November 18. Bittu said he along with the families of the victims in the Beant Singh assassination case would seek an answer from the BJP-led NDA government as to why they were rubbing salt on the wounds of the terror-hit families? The Ludhiana MP said he would talk to the BJP and RSS workers regarding their stand on the issue of commuting the death sentence of Rajoana to life term.
