Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], Nov 12 (ANI): Few activists of Darsgah-Jihad-O-Shahadat (DJS) were detained by police here for organising a press conference against Supreme Court's verdict in the Ayodhya land dispute case.



According to South Zone Police, today the Islamic organisation organised a press conference at 1 pm against the Supreme Court verdict on Ayodhya case.
