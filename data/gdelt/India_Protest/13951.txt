Two reporters have been booked for allegedly spreading rumours about Dalits threatening to leave Basipur village under Mandawar police station as some men prevented them from drawing water from a nearby handpump, reported the Times of India.

Speaking to the publication, SP (city) Lakshmi Nivas Mishra said the reports published in a newspaper and digital media outlet on Dalit families planning to leave the village is false. He claimed that the news was being manipulated by the two reporters.

Police also claimed that the reporters coaxed the Dalit residents of the village to write "house-on-sale".

A case was immediately registered against the two reported after a senior sub-inspector Pramod Kumar filed a complaint.

While local journalists later met the district magistrate to protest against the harassment of reporters, no clarity has been given on the status of the cases.

Just a few days ago, a reporter from UP was booked by the Uttar Pradesh government after he allegedly exposed that students in a government-run school in Mirzapur were being fed bread and salt as part of midday meal.

Many people have come backed the journalist and village head, who were booked by the government in connection with the case. In fact, the students of the Mirzapur school did not attend classes on Thursday to protest against the development.

Even the villagers said that filing a case against the journalist for exposing such a major anomaly in midday meals was disappointing.
