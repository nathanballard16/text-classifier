This came after thousands of protesters on Tuesday clashed with security personnel and resulted in mayhem in the capital.

Police resorted to lathicharge and fired tear gas shell in order to disperse the crowd.

Several states across the country - West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra - remain on edge as massive protests erupted against the Citizenship Amendment Act, that aims to expedite non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

It all happened after students of Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) staged peaceful demonstrations against the newly-amended act in Delhi on Sunday.

Situation escalated on December 15 when the Delhi Police used force to dispel the protesters from the university and surrounding areas like Jamia Nagar.
