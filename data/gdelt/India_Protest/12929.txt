VoA protests chopping of 100-yr-old tree at Mall Road

Members and volunteers of Voice of Amritsar (VoA) staged a protest at Mall Road, where a 100–year-old ‘peepal’ tree had been sold off at an amount of Rs20,000 to a private contractor for chopping. The tree is currently standing tall amidst the growing concrete structures at the Mall Road’s commercial lane. “The logic behind chopping the tree which is a green heritage of the city is beyond our understanding. City-based environment activists had earlier raised their voices defiantly against the carnage on Mall Road when trees were chopped in abundance for the BRTS corridor. Earlier, the administration and the Forest Department had auctioned off heritage trees that were over 100-year-old at various spots, including old jail road, amid protests from activists.
