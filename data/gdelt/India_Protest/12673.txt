Watch: Pak protesters raising anti-India slogans in Seoul confronted by BJP leader Shazia Ilmi

A group of Pakistani protesters raising anti-India slogans were taken head-on by Shazia Ilmi in Seoul.

BJP leader Shazia Ilmi, who was earlier on Friday in South Korea to attend a conference, challenged an angry mob of Pakistani protesters, ranting against India on the streets of Seoul.

The protesters, said to be at least a hundred, were raising anti-India slogans when they were spotted by Ilmi and two others. Ms Ilmi asked them to be respectful to India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

They, however, got aggressive and started shouting her. Not one to back off, she started raising 'India-Zindabad' slogans, a video tweeted by ANI showed.
