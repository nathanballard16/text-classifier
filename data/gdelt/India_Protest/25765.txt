The Samajwadi's want to save the Constitution. On the other hand, the BJP wants to abolish the Constitution. Much of this pretence is being done to divert attention. Do young people want employment or NPR?" Yadav asked while addressing a gathering of the party`s student wing leaders."No one from the BJP can decide whether we are citizens or not. If the need arises, I will be the first one who will not fill any form, but the question is will you support it or not. We will not fill the NPR form. What will you do? NRC and NPR are against the poor and minorities," he said.
