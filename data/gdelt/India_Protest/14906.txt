The students evaluated their own answers, based on the answer key released released by the institute."They found that many of their correct answers had been marked as wrong and this way, many students flunked the papers. In some cases, even 12 marks have been deducted," CA Neeraj Arora, ICAI member told PTI.The exam was conducted in May. Students accessed their answer copies via RTI (Right To Information) enquiries. Until 2018, the CA Act did not allow students to show the answer copies to any other person, which was scrapped after massive protests during that year.The students even want the institute to penalise examiners for the errors.In response to the student outrage, the institute had put out a notification clarifying that "It has been brought to our notice that certain adverse reports relating to the system of evaluation of answer books of CA exams are doing the rounds on social media."Given that, the institute has introduced changes in the evaluation process for the examinations scheduled for November 2019 and May 2020. The examination papers will now undergo digital evaluation to maintain transparency. It will also eliminate manual errors like totalling, variation in marks according to the examiner.In fact, the institute will also roll out OMR-based evaluation for MCQs of Elective Papers. This will keep the examination objective type, eliminating variations in the subjective answers.
