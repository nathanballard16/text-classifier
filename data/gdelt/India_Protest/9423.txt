West Bengal: Protesting doctors call off strike after Mamata assures new security measures

The Junior doctors of NRS Medical College & Hospital, Kolkata said: "We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the CM. After an enormous movement, the meeting and discussions with our CM met a logical end. Considering everything we expect the govt to solve the issues as discussed in due time."

The protesting doctors in West Bengal today called off their week-long strike after meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, where they were assured of scaled-up security measures. CM Banerjee today met with the striking doctors of the state and accepted their proposal to set up grievance redressal cell in all government hospitals, in a bid to stop the week-long impasse of the medicos, which garnered nationwide attention. Banerjee also directed Kolkata Police commissioner Anuj Sharma to deploy a nodal police officer in every hospital, during the meeting with representatives of doctors.
