Tansa water pipeline Relocation: On 158th day of protest, Bombay High Court tells govt to pay Rs 15,000 monthly rent to Mahul residents

“But the court directed the government to provide rent, not alternative housing. On Wednesday, the Bombay High Court directed the state government to pay Rs 15,000 as monthly rent for a year to eligible project-affected persons (PAP), living in Mahul and along the Tansa water pipeline. The court said the state government should have formed a policy of providing proper accommodation to PAPs or provide compensation. The court had earlier held that PAPs living in Tansa were a threat to the pipeline. She left her job as a manager in a private firm to lead the protest, forgoing a salary of Rs 20,000 per month.
