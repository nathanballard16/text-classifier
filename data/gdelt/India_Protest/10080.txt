Ahmedabad: Wielding rainbow flags, umbrellas and placards in a push for equality, hundreds joined the annual pride parade in Vadodara district of Gujarat on Sunday.

The march was organised by the Foram Foundation of the city. The members of the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgenders and Queer (LGBTQ) community participated in the parade. Dressed in colours of the rainbow, participants were dancing on the beats of drums and singing music to celebrate the comfort of their identity.

They came forward in solidarity to support the community's rights and this time did not have to shout 'take down Section 377'. In a landmark judgement, the Supreme Court in 2018 decriminalised homosexuality.

Post this judgement, members of the LGBTQ community walk with utter confidence and comfort. The march also celebrated the inclusion of human beings of all genders and all sexual orientations in society. It concentrates on accepting and expressing self, being happy and satisfied with your identity.

Mumbai celebrated its first Pride Parade after the Supreme Court decriminalised homosexuality in February this year. Hundreds of people marched with a wave of colours from August Kranti Marg, which also holds a significant position in the country's independence movement.
