Traders protest at Jantar Mantar over sealing issue

A group of traders Thursday held a protest at Jantar Mantar seeking halt on the process of sealing of shops in the city.

The sealing of shops in Delhi, allegedly violating norms, has been undertaken by civic bodies on the instruction of a Supreme Court-appointed monitoring committee.

"The traders of Delhi feel disturbed and perturbed as the ongoing sealing in Delhi has affected their businesses," said CAIT's national Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal.

The protest was held under the umbrella of Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), during which traders raised slogans and also burnt an effigy of the 'monitoring committee'.

The CAIT has demanded the government take firm steps to protect Delhi traders from the sealing drive.

It reiterated that a bill should be brought in the current session of Parliament or an ordinance be promulgated soon after the session is over with a cut-off date.
