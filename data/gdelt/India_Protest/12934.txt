Chander Nagar residents threaten to protest over water contamination

Ludhiana: Irked over no solution to the problem of water contamination in Chander Nagar, the residents met the civic officials on Wednesday and gave them 24-hour ultimatum to resolve the issue.They also threatened to stage a protest on Friday in the locality if the problem of water contamination is not resolved.It has been around six months and residents of the area are complaining about water contamination. They are forced to drink either contaminated water or purchase water from the market.Officials concerned have however claimed that the staff was deputed in the area to resolve the issue.On Tuesday, blue-coloured water started coming from taps which again enraged the residents and they blamed the officials for the existing condition of the area.Residents said the authorities were least bothered and did not give any satisfactory reply to their woes and therefore they were forced to stage a protest.Prince Singla, a resident of the area, said there must be a dyeing unit in the locality and due to leakage in the underground pipelines, blue-coloured water was being supplied through taps.He said children were getting sick and in case some epidemic spread in the area, the officials concerned would be blamed.Shashi Sharma, another resident, said: “The officials have not been able to detect the fault and they should change the pipelines as they are old and decayed, but they do not want to work.”He said people were buying packed drinking water bottles from the past six months and there were others who couldnot afford it and were forced to drink contaminated water.Meanwhile, the superintending engineer of the operation and maintenance cell, Ravinder Garg, said: “We have deputed the staff in the locality to fix the problem and it will be done shortly. Earlier also, the fault was detected in the water supply lines and it was rectified. But the problem has occurred again in the rainy season.”He said they would have to check source of coloured-water as there was no dyeing unit in the area.
