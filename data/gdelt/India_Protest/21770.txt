BSY govt eager to implement CAA in Karnataka

Bengaluru, Dec 17: Amidst nationwide protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), south Indian state of Karnataka is likely to be one of the first states to implement the contentions Act.

Speaking to reporters, Basavaraj Bommai, the Home Minister of Karnataka, today said that Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa-led BJP government would take necessary steps to implement the Act in the state.

"It is included in the Concurrent List. Therefore, it will be mandatory to implement the Act in all the States," the minister said.

On demonstrations in different parts of the country against CAA, he said that few States were opposing the legislation due to 'political reasons'.

"We are confident that there won't be any violent protests as witnessed in Delhi, Assam and Uttar Pradesh. We have taken precautionary measures to prevent any such incidents," he said.

The statement came even as protests continued in different parts of the State against the implementation of the controversial Act. Various organisations have staged protests in Bengaluru, Shivamogga, Mangaluru, Kalaburagi, and others. On Tuesday, few students were detained in Bengaluru ahead of a protest against CAA.

It can be recalled that Bommai, in October, had said that the State government was collecting information on immigrants in the State and would hold discussions with the Centre to compile a National Register of Citizens, like the one in Assam.
