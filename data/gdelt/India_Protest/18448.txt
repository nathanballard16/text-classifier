SVDV faculty reopens, stir on against Khan’s appointment

VARANASI: After a 14-day agitation by students over appointment of a Muslim scholar as assistant professor in its ‘Sahitya’ (literature) section, the faculty of Sanskrit Vidya Dharm Vigyan ( SVDV ) of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) finally reopened on Thursday. However, the students continued their dharna in support of their demands and submitted a memorandum to the dean seeking clarification on the selection process for the appointment of Dr Firoz Khan. They said the dharna would continue till their demands are met.After locking the faculty, the SVDV students had been staging a dharna near the vice-chancellor’s residence since November 7 in protest against Dr Khan’s appointment in the faculty.BHU spokesperson Rajesh Singh said, “The faculty of SVDV reopened on Thursday and has started functioning. Vice chancellor (VC) Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar has appealed to the students to call off their dharna as prolonged closure of the faculty has made students suffer.”“The semester examinations are about to begin and students should cooperate in ensuring smooth conduct of classes,” he said, adding, “The university administration hopes that the students would call off their protest and contribute positively and constructively in maintaining the academic atmosphere on the campus.”Dean Prof Vindhyeswari Prasad Mishra said, “The students’ memorandum has been received. We will take a sympathetic view of it to resolve the issue.”Despite the opening of the faculty and VC’s appeal, the students continued their dharna. “We would end our dharna only after our demands are met,” said an agitating student, Shashikant Mishra. He added that the university administration has assured them of a reply regarding their memorandum in 10 days.The students in their memorandum have sought information about the process of shortlisting of candidates and whether the process in the Sahitya department was similar to that of other departments of SVDV faculty, whether the shortlisting was done in view of the traditional (Sanatan Dharm) rules, which rule of UGC was adopted in shortlisting process and whether the appointment was done in accordance with the BHU Act or not.
