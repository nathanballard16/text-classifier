Rafale deal no exception, ant-corruption clause didn't exist in earlier contracts also: Air Marshal SBP Sinha

New Delhi (India), Feb 11 (ANI): Amidst allegations that Prime Minister Narendra Modi led government had removed the anti-corruption clause in the Rafale deal, Air Marshal SBP Sinha who headed Rafale negotiations on behalf of India, said that such a clause was not there in the earlier government to government contracts signed with America and Russia.

"Till now, we had 'government to government' contract with America and Russia. It is the third 'government to government' contract, which is with France. Such clause was not there in any of them," said SBP Sinha while speaking to ANI.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday asserted that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has facilitated loot in the Rafale deal as according to a media report he had removed the anti-corruption clause from the controversial fighter jet deal.

"Every Defence deal has an anti-corruption clause. The Hindu has reported that the Prime Minister removed the anti-corruption clause. It is clear that the Prime Minister facilitated loot," said Rahul earlier on Monday.

However, the UPA government in 2013 had come up with a new policy which allowed the Defence Ministry not to follow the laid down rules and sign inter-governmental agreements with friendly foreign countries as per mutually agreed provisions between both sides. (ANI)
