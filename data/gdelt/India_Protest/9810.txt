Kolkata: BJP holds protest against TMC government

BJP on Monday held a protest here against the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government for its alleged failure in discharging of its constitutional duties.

"The main reason for our agitation and demonstration in West Bengal is the failure of the elected government in the state to discharge its duties," Mohan Rao, South Kolkata district president of BJP said.

"Today, BJP workers are under attack from the ruling dispensation. They are entering our homes and attacking us. They are also misbehaving with women," Rao added.

The South Kolkata district president also contended that BJP is under oath to establish "a democratic set up" in the state.

"Our protest is part of an oath to establish a democratic setup in West Bengal. The people of West Bengal have given the answer in the first instalment to Mamata Banerjee in the Lok Sabha polls by defeating the TMC in many place."

In the polls marred by violence in West Bengal, BJP made deep inroads into the Trinamool Congress territory winning 18 Lok Sabha seats and limited the TMC to 22 seats as against 34 it had won in the 2014 general elections.
