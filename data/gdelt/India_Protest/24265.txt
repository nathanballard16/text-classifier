Protest against three capitals at Velampalli’s residence

Slogans raised against the government

Activists of the Amaravati Parirakshana Samiti (APS) laid siege to the Minister Velampalli Srinivasa Rao’s residence here on Monday in protest against the government’s plan to develop three capital cities in Amaravati, Visakhapatnam and Kurnool. The Minister was away from home at that time. As the large number of protesters shouted anti-government slogans and were in a mood to grill the Minister on his arrival, the police first tried to pacify and then took them into custody.
