Indian Military Can Prove Attack on Alleged Terrorist Camp in Pakistan - Reports

The Indian defence establishment said on Friday it had synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images to prop up its claim of having successfully hit an alleged training facility of the Jaish-e Mohammad terror group at Balakot in the Pakistani province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa during a 26 February airstrike, The Times of India reported.

"The SAR films clearly show before and after pictures of the intended targets being hit. It's up to the government whether it wants to release them or not. Pakistan, of course, has also worked swiftly to repair the damage to the site", an unnamed defence official was cited as saying.

The sources have reportedly refused to provide further details on the platform used to take those images.
