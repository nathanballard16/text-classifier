Students at the premier institute got together to show solidarity with protests at other“Students at IIT Delhi, Kanpur and Varanasi are protesting together today to mount pressure on the government to roll-back the,” a student told Mirror. In the evening, a group gathered outside hostels 12, 13 and 14 that are meant for senior students.In September, the IIT Council, the apex decision-making body of all IITs, had announced an increase in the annual fee to Rs 2 lakh from the current fee of Rs 25,000-Rs 50,000. The Council said the hike was aimed at preventing ‘uninterested’ students from taking admission in MTech courses and reducing the number of dropouts.In their statement, the students questioned the policy of creating ‘world class institutions’ through commercialisation of higher education and pushing the majority out of higher education by calling them non-meritorious and underperforming.“Although loan disbursals have been talked about to pay this mammoth fee for the needy students, this argument is highly problematic. Students from poor backgrounds avail loans during theirwhich creates a mental pressure throughout their four-year curriculum.Now, if the same students need to avail loans for their MTech degree, their motivation to go for higher education will greatly diminish. Not everyone who enrols in MTech comes from a high economic or social background. It is impossible for a lot of students of our country to pursue higher education at the cost of two lakhs per year which includes only the academic expenses,” the statement said.Students pointed out that the revised fees were higher than the tuition fee in some self-financing institutions.In addition, the Council also discontinued the basic stipend of Rs 12,400 per month for those qualifying for MTech based on their GATE (graduate aptitude test in engineering) score. Students said the scrapping of the stipend will hit MTech students who forgo job opportunities to pursue a masters’ degree.“Overall, it could be said that research and public education in India are going to suffer at an unprecedented level. The government is clearly rolling back from public education altogether,” the statement said.There was no response to Mirror’s query toon whether there would be any rethink on the MTech fee hike after the students’ protests.
