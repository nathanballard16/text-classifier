Zondo inquiry: Department head admits choosing Vrede partner on Google

Thabethe appeared before the commission on Wednesday.

He has been fingered as one of the key figures who drove the failed project.

Thabethe told the commission he is an agricultural expert, but when he joined the department there was no clear plan on how to develop farming in the Free State.

As part of a strategic framework called 'Mohuma Mobung', he set about introducing a plan to develop struggling small scale, dairy farmers.

Thabethe said his research led him to a company called Paras Dairy in India, which later partnered with an IT company Estina, and entered into a contract to develop the Vrede dairy farm alongside the department.

"The reason we chose Paras was because of the type of model they used. They had been collecting milk from small producers and take it to their facility for processing. That model is the one we envisaged because we wanted to develop smallholder farmers who were closing down in the country."
