Non-teaching staff stage protest at PAU

Ludhiana: The employees’ and Class IV unions of Punjab Agricultural University staged a protest near the vice-chancellor’s office on Thursday.

Non-teaching employees in large numbers joined the protest to push for the implementation of their various demands.

PAU Employees’ Union president Baldev Singh Walia said the university authorities have been ignoring the demands of their employees, including reverting the decision to review posts of non-teaching staff, reducing the experience period for promotion of technical staff, increasing number of posts of car/jeep driver supervisors, regularizing employees working on contractual basis without any written test, settling the pending promotion cases, managing the problems being faced by local audit employees, restoring promotions of eligible employees which have been stopped by the authorities without any valid reason and promoting agricultural field officers etc.

He condemned the appointments of teachers on the key non-teaching posts such as comptroller, estate officer, security officer, SDO maintenance, XEN electrical, workshop superintendent and the latest appointment of SPO. He demanded to revoke all these appointments and recruit non-teachers on these posts.

He added that PAU gate no. 4 which had been closed by the university a few days ago is causing much inconvenience to the employees, particularly those residing at the Hathi Complex. After protest by employees, this gate has now been opened for 5 hours a day on different times; employees are demanding to open this gate permanently as per old practice. Apart from this, he said the university has not paid salaries to the staff for the month of April, 2015 till date and demanded the arrears to be released immediately.
