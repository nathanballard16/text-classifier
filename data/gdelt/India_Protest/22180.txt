Fresh violence hits India over citizenship law

NEW DELHI: Fresh violence was reported from parts of Delhi on Tuesday against the new Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) which was passed by the country’s parliament last week, TV media reports said.

The Delhi Police personnel used teargas shells to disperse the protesters in East Delhi, particularly in the Seelampur area.

Business establishments and shops were shut and Delhi Metro services closed at various places due to the ongoing violence.

According to TV reports, hundreds of enraged protesters resorted to stone-pelting on the police personnel who faced a tough time in controlling the mobs. Several vehicles, including buses, bikes and others were damaged or set ablaze by the protesters.

This was the second occasion when violence was reported against the CAA from Delhi alone. Two days ago, on Sunday several protesters and cops were injured in southeast Delhi, particularly near the Jamia Millia Islamia University, when thousands of protesters clashed with the policemen.
