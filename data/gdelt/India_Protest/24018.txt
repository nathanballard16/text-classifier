Modi defends 'anti-Muslim' citizenship law

Indian leader Narendra Modi let loose a fiery speech Sunday blasting critics who call a new law anti-Muslim.

Addressing a crowd of Hindu nationalist supporters in New Delhi dressed in red and green, holding the national flag, Modi took the stage after days of violent and deadly protests that have rocked India.

(SOUNDBITE) (Hindi) INDIAN PRIME MINISTER, NARENDRA MODI, SAYING:

"The Muslims who were born on Indian soil or whose ancestors are children of Mother India, brothers and sisters, they have nothing to do with Citizenship law or the NRC (National Register of Citizens). Neither the Muslims are being sent to any detention centres nor are there any detention centres. Brothers and sisters, this is a white lie."

The bill paves the way to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants.

Those from Afghanistan Bangladesh and Pakistan that entered India before 2015 are covered - but not Muslims.

Critics call that discrimination.

The protests against the law have seen nearly two dozen people killed in clashes with police.

Internet services have been suspended.

And more than 1,500 protesters have been arrested in the past 10 days.

Fresh rallies in New Delhi and northern Uttar Pradesh -- where the largest number of deaths has occurred -- also thronged the streets on Sunday.

Protesters called the new law an attack on India's secular constitution by making religion a test for citizenship.

(SOUNDBITE) (English) AN UNIDENTIFIED PROTESTER, SAYING:

"This is not individual fight for anybody, this is fight for India, this is fight for democracy, basically, we are fighting for democracy, yeah."

The protests mark the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership since he first swept to power in 2014.
