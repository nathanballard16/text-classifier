Muslim Student Claims She Was Barred From India University Graduation Over 'Support of CAA Protests'

Rabeeha Abdurehim rejected her gold medal to show support for countrywide protesters against the new controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) that grants citizenship to illegal immigrants from six religious minorities – Hindus, Parsis, Jains, Christians, Buddhists, and Sikhs, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan but excludes Muslims.

Abdurehim claims she was only allowed into the convocation hall after the President left the ceremony and students were presented with certificates and medals.

“As I was on the radar of authorities (for participation in the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests), I was asked to leave the hall and was allowed only after the President left. Later, I received my degree and refused to accept my gold medal,” she told media.

Abdurehim has received huge support from social media activists for her decision.
