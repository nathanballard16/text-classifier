Human Capital: India on par with Afghanistan, Sudan and Namibia

Our ‘Human Capital’ is poor

While India is on paper going through a phase of ‘demographic dividend’, when a large section of the population are young and of productive age (only 6% of the population in 2019 are above the age of 65), in terms of ‘Human Capital’ and productivity, India figures a little ahead of Afghanistan and stands on a par with Sudan and Namibia. Productivity depends on both the quantity and quality of human capital. Human capital measures the education and health levels of the population, estimates of life expectancy, years of schooling and the quality of education.

Globally, Finland has the highest period of peak human capital for its working population. It is estimated at 27 years. China’s peak productivity is 20 years. In Sri Lanka it is 13 years. India has an embarrassing 6.5 years of peak productivity, ranking a low 158 out of 195 nations.

Within South Asia, India’s score on educational quality (out of a maximum of 100) is 66, just ahead of the score of 64 of Afghanistan. In scores on functional health, India stands at 43 out of a possible 100, even behind the 45 attained by Afghanistan.
