Rajya Sabha fails to take up Contentious Citizenship Bill

On a day when the Upper House debated and discussed the Constitutional Amendment Bill into the night, the contentious Citizenship Amendment Bill was not introduced in the Rajya Sabha.

In the Northeast, where protests over the Bill continued, there was widespread anxiety that the Modi government could bring the Bill to the Upper House even when it was not listed for business.

PM Modi tried to soothe matters when speaking at Solapur and said no genuine Assamese citizen will be affected if the Bill is passed. Speaking in the Rajya Sabha, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that the Centre was committed to preserving the identity and culture of the people of the Northeast. "We want a peaceful situation in the Northeast and are in constant touch with the state governments. We will strive to protect the identity and culture of the Northeast and will take steps to address all concerns," Singh said.

Congress MPs Bhubaneshwar Kalita and Assam Congress president Ripun Bora protested by holding 'Save Assam, Save India' banners.

In Assam, speaker Hirendra Nath Goswami opposed the Bill, and said the BJP government in the state should have asked for a consensus from the people in the state. Former chief minister Tarun Gogoi said December 8, the day the Lok Sabha passed the Bill, was a "black day" for the state of Assam.

"By passing the Bill, the BJP government has polarised the citizens of the state as Hindus and Muslims and accepted Jinnah's politics of dividing the country. The Bill has endangered Assam's culture, heritage, existence...," Gogoi said in Guwahati.

Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who faced severe flak in the state, called the passing of the Bill a 'historic decision'. "We are grateful to PM Modi for the Bill and saving 18 assembly seats in Assam from going into the hands of Jinnah," he said leading to a huge uproar.
