Anna University teaching fellows stage protest demanding regularisation of service

CHENNAI: Teaching fellows in Anna University staged a protest on the campus after class hours on Tuesday demanding regularisation of their service. Over 250 teaching fellows (TFs) were recruited by the varsity on contract years ago to handle engineering subjects and humanities for undergraduate and postgraduate students.A group of TFs moved the Madras high court recently seeking regularisation of their service and re-designation of their posts as assistant professors (on contract) as they were appointed only in sanctioned posts."Though we are qualified and do the same work which assistant professors do, we are paid less and are not entitled to any terminal benefits which full-time teaching staff enjoy," said P Shanmugha Perumal, one of the protesting teaching fellows.While an assistant professor earns Rs 60,000 or more per month, the TFs are paid Rs 25,000.The court has directed the varsity not to terminate TFs until the tenure ends.The university had earlier said that it was unlikely that their demands would be met as it is contravention to the existing norms. However, the teaching fellows pointed out that the university had earlier absorbed several teachers on contract as permanent faculty members.Against this backdrop, the TFs protested on Tuesday evening reiterating their demands. In response, the university agreed to look into the issue.
