West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, along with thousands of party workers, took to the streets of Kolkata on Monday, vowing not to allow the proposed country-wide National Register of Citizens (NRC) exercise and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the state. The protest march started from Red Road in heart of the city, and it is set to culminate at Jorasakho Thakur Bari, the residence of Nobel laureate Rabindranath Tagore in north Kolkata, about 4km away.

'We will never allow NRC and CAA in Bengal,' Banerjee said as she read out an 'oath' to her party workers. State governor Jagdeep Dhankhar hit out at the Trinamul chief over the rally and urged her to desist from 'unconstitutional and inflammatory' actions. 'I am extremely anguished that CM and Ministers are to spearhead rally against CAA, law of the land. This is unconstitutional. I call upon CM to desist from this unconstitutional and inflammatory act at this juncture and devote to retrieve the grim situation,' Dhankhar tweeted.
