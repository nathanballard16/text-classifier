‘Mamata Banerjee Is Doing Everything To Obstruct BJP’: After Shah, Yogi, Chouhan Not Allowed To Land In WB

After denying Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s chopper to land in West Bengal, the Mamata Banerjee led state government has refused permission to land former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s helicopter.

“(West Bengal Chief Minister) Mamata Banerjee is doing everything other than running the administration. All she is doing is obstructing public rallies of the BJP, not allowing the helicopter of Amit Shah to land, trying to pose challenges to the rally of Narendra Modi, not allowing Yogi Adityanath’s rally to be held and preventing my helicopter from landing,” said Chouhan, reports The Hindu.

Furthermore, Chouhan targeted Banerjee for the three-day dharna which she did at Kolkata’s Metro Channel and said that he himself has been a Chief Minister for 15 years, but hasn’t seen an incidence where a Chief Minister sat on a protest to save a police officer.

Along parallel lines, former Jharkhand CM and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Arjun Munda were also denied permission by the incumbent administration to hold a public rally in Bishnupur in Bankura district.

In the light of the West Bengal state vs the Centre government conflict, union leaders are not expected to attend the Bengal Global Business Summit (BGBS).
