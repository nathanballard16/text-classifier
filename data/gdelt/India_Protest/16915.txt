A woman bus conductor of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), whose employees are on strike since October 5 over various demands, allegedly committed suicide by hanging at her residence in Khammam district on Monday.

The victim was identified as K Neeraja. “We got the information that she committed suicide. The reasons for her doing so are yet to be established,” Police Commissioner Tafseer Iqbal told PTI. Her family members said that she was worried about losing her job and was also not paid last month’s salary.
