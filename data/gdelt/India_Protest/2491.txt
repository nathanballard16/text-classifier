Our Correspondent

KOKRAJHAR: The All Adivasi Students’ Association of Assam (AASAA) on Wednesday staged a three-hour protest dharna at Children Park near the Kokrajhar Deputy Commissioner’s office to demand Scheduled Tribe (ST) status for the Adivasis of Assam. Over a hundred people belonging to the tea tribe community joined the dharna with placards and banners and shouted slogans. A memorandum was submitted to Prime Minister Narendra Modi through the Deputy Commissioner, Kokrajhar demanding inclusion of Adivasis of Assam in the list of Scheduled Tribes.

Rejen Hoho, vice-president of AASAA, said the demand for inclusion of Oraons, Mundas, Santhals, Kharias, Gonds, Sawras and other communities into the list of Scheduled Tribes of Assam was not a new thing, rather the time had come for recognition of these tribes as Scheduled Tribes because their blood brothers living in other States of India had been recognized as ST. They also threatened of intensifying agitation if the tea tribes were not granted ST status.
