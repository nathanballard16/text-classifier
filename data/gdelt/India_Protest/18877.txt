Vaiko, supporters detained in Delhi for protesting Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa’s visit to India

CHENNAI: The Delhi police on Thursday detained MDMK leader Vaiko and his supporters when they staged a black flag protest at Jantar Mantar to condemn the visit of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Gotabaya is arriving in Delhi today for a three-day visit.In statement issued by the party, Vaiko demanded that Sri Lanka government be tried in the International Court of Criminal Justice for the genocide of Eelam Tamils.Citing a UN report that 1.37 lakh Tamils were massacred in 2009, he wondered what had happened to the thousands of Tamils in Sri Lanka who had disappeared.He urged the United Nations and the Human Rights Council to adopt a resolution to conduct a referendum among the Tamils to create a sovereign Tamil Eelam. Tamil diaspora living across the world should be allowed to take part in the referendum, Vaiko said.He said Gotabaya had passed a presidential order that gun-trotting soldiers should patrol day and night in areas where Tamils live.More than 580 Tamil fishermen had been killed in the last three decades and their boats had been seized, he said.Several fishermen were lodged in prisons in the island nation. However, the Narendra Modi government was hobnobbing with the government in the island country, he said, adding, “This is nothing but a terrible betrayal of Tamils.”
