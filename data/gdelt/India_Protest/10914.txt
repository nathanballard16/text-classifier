Foodies in a limbo as delivery chain staff’s strike enters third day

Ludhiana: The strike started by the delivery staff of a reputed online food delivery chain entered its third day on Thursday leaving city’s food lovers in a limbo.

The protesting employees gathered at Dana Mandi, Gill Road, on Thursday morning and shouted slogans against the company. Anguished over the company officials refusing to accept their demands, many of them gathered at several roundabouts of the city holding posters against the delivery chain.

One of the agitators, Dharmesh Kumar, said, “We were left with no options except going on strike. The company has reduced our commission from Rs 40 to Rs 25 per order. Today, some representatives of the company came to meet us, but instead of assuring us of accepting our demand for rolling back the move, they gave us false hopes of looking into this matter, asking us to return to work, which we refused.”

Another delivery staffer, Inder Singh, said, “We are going to continue our strike indefinitely until the company accepts our demand of increasing our commission. Rs 25 per order is simply nothing at a time when the rate of petrol has crossed Rs 75 per litre. Moreover, when we got enrolled with the company, we were assured a commission of Rs 65-70 per order, but gradually, the commission was brought down by three times to Rs 25 per order, which is completely unjustified.”

“From the past three days, we have been protesting at Dana Mandi and waiting for our demands to be accepted. But now we have lost patience and from Friday onwards, we will hit the roads and protest against the company outside the deputy commissioner’s office. We will keep sitting there until our demands are met,” said Amrik Singh, another employee of the delivery chain.
