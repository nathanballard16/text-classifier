Used water cannons and absolutely minimum force on protesters: Delhi Police

Delhi police issued a statement on today's protests : "Today afternoon, a large crowd gathered in the area of Jama Masjid for prayers. After prayers, they wanted to proceed towards Jantar Mantar, but the senior officers present at the spot persuaded them not to march towards Jantar Mantar.

In the evening, suddenly some anti-social elements in the gathering started breaking the barricades and indulged in stone-pelting in a bid to march towards Jantar Mantar against the police advice. Police used water cannon and absolutely minimum force to push them back.

While protesters were being pushed back, a private car parked at Subhash Marg, Darya Ganj was set ablaze. The police staff immediately doused the fire.\Some police personnel incl senior officers were injured in stone-pelting. Around 40 persons have been detained." : ANI
