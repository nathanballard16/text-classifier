The blockade was lifted after Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar assured to send the file to the governor for remission by Monday. Earlier, hundreds of activists had staged protests at Mahmadpur near Patiala from September 20 to 26, demanding remission of Dhaner’s life sentence.“Dhaner’s innocence can be gauged from the fact that thousands of activists assembled here to accompany him on his way to jail. We will not sit back till the government decides to pardon him. Many activists have decided to continue a sit-in near the jail.
