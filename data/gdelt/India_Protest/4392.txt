Car, phone ban: PAU students start chain hunger strike

Ludhiana: As their protest entered Day 14, Punjab Agricultural University students started a chain hunger strike on the campus on Tuesday.

Five students, Harshdeep Singh, who is pursuing MBA, Gurpinder Singh, an MSc student, Tejinder Singh, Gurjot Singh and Lovepreet Singh, all three from College of Agriculture, went on hunger strike from 9am to 5pm.

Hundreds of students, who are up in arms against car and phone ban, gathered outside Thapar Hall around 4.30pm to press for their demands. Half-an-hour later, Damanjeet Singh Mohie, officer on special duty to chief minister, held talks with the youngsters, who handed him over a memorandum of their demands.

Karanvir Singh Sandhu, a student representative, said, “Students are not allowed to bring their cars to campus, but outsiders are. The authorities are giving entry passes to VIPs. More than 100 passes have been given. Earlier, the authorities had said phones will be allowed in classrooms. But in a circular issued on February 28, they took a U-turn.”

“We do not want any meeting with the authorities as they fail to understanding our problems. Justifying entry passes to outsiders, they say the university is dependent on them and cannot live in isolation,” said Lovepreet Singh, a student of College of Agriculture.

Students said car parking for students has still not been made near gate 2 even as it was promised eight months ago.

Gurinder Singh, another representative of students said, “We will call off our chain hunger strike after authorities meet our demands.”

Despite repeated attempts, Surinder Singh Kukal, dean, College of Agriculture and estate officer, PAU, Vishvajit Hans could not be contacted.
