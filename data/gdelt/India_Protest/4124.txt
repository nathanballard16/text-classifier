AirAsia Opens Technology Centre In Bangalore, India

As part of its digital focus, the AirAsia group is increasing its investment in developing new digital technology for the group. To that end, the carrier opened up its first technology centre for the AirAsia Group in Bangalore, India. The opening of the technology centre includes full in-house development for current and future services for AirAsia customers.

Referred to as the AirAsia Software Engineering and Technology (AASET), engineers at the Bangalore centre will work closely with counterparts in Malaysia and Singapore. To streamline the airline’s digital assets (website and app), while developing new solutions and products in parallel.

The new technology centre will supplement the digital team currently located in RedQ, AirAsia’s HQ in Sepang. With over 35 employees, the staff will focus initially on backend services development for AirAsia – including both the website and the mobile app. This also includes the recently launched AVA virtual assistant which is currently live on the brand’s official page.

During its opening, AirAsia India CEO Sunil Bhaskaran said “The opening of AirAsia’s new technology centre demonstrates the airline’s commitment to build world-class technology right here in India”.

The AirAsia group is also looking to expand its footprint in both Bangalore and other excellence centre in Malaysia and Singapore. With the goal of doubling the number of its engineers by 2020. This is alongside expansion of AirAsia services offering outside flights, including fintech via BigPay, and travel with AirAsiaGo.
