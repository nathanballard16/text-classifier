Lok Sabha Election 2019, Gujarat profile: Gandhinagar, Surat key constituencies with BJP aiming to retain all 26 seats-Politics News , Firstpost

The Banaskantha constituency is located in the Banaskantha district, which has a population of 31,20,506 people as per Census 2011.

Located in the western region of the country, Gujarat is composed of 26 parliamentary and 182 Assembly constituencies. At present, the Bharatiya Janata Party holds all the 26 Lok Sabha seats in the state.

The BJP formed the state government following the Vidhan Sabha election in 2017, where the saffron party won 99 seats, Congress 77, NCP one, Bharatiya Tribal Party two and Independent one seat(s). The BJP will seek to ensure their Assembly win-streak continues in the upcoming Lok Sabha election as well.

Polling to all Lok Sabha seats in Gujarat will be held on 23 April.

In a significant development on 21 March, BJP chief Amit Shah replaced veteran leader LK Advani as the Gandhinagar candidate.

Some of the major issues plaguing the state are farm distress and reservation for non-reserved caste categories. According to the Pocketbook of Agriculture Statistics 2017, published by the Union agriculture ministry, nearly 43 percent of the 39.31 lakh agricultural households in Gujarat are under debt. As per the report, 34.94 lakh households took crop loans and term loans, amounting to Rs 54,277 crore.

Among the backward communities in the state, Adivasis, who constitute 8.6 percent of Gujarat’s population are up in arms against the Narendra Modi government. Bharatmala, a highway project launched by Modi in October 2017, was suspended for now following protests by Adivasis and farmers from south to northeastern Gujarat.

Caste is also likely to play a crucial role in the upcoming election in the state. The Patidar agitation since 2015 and violence against Dalits has spurred the younger leaders from these communities to speak up make their demands heard.
