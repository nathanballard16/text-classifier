Abrogation of Article 370, Ayodhya verdict, citizenship act, NRC all steps leading India to Hindu Rashtra: Dal Khalsa

JALANDHAR: Amid raging debate on CAB and NRC, Sikh group Dal Khalsa has alleged that Narendra Modi government was clearly riding anti-Muslim plank while hurriedly working on its agenda to transform India into a Hindu Rashtra.Condemning the recently amended Citizenship Act, the organization said that targeting one minority and appeasing another is an old and time-tested tactic of the Indian state.“First, it was the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir. Then came a much debated verdict on Babri Masjid in Ayodhya . This has been followed by an amendment to the citizenship act and the national register for citizenship (NRC) is next on the cards. All these are clear signs of the BJP’s march towards a Hindu Rashtra,” said Dal Khalsa spokesperson Kanwarpal Singh.“Just because Sikhs are protected under citizenship act does not mean that we do not understand the malafide intentions of the Union government led by RSS/BJP”, he said.He argued that the series of events in the recent past point towards the plight of religious minorities in India. The need of the hour is the working unity among oppressed people from Kashmir to all the northeastern states, he added.“The CAB has disturbed all the minorities and has instilled insecurity among them. Is there any place in the developed world where asylum seekers are excluded on the basis of their religion?” Dal Khalsa leader asked.He said that the Sikhs had spoken in the past for Kashmiris and would continue to speak out for the Muslims who were being targeted. He said that his organization was supporting the countrywide protests against policies of the Narendra Modi government.Deriding the leadership of Shiromani Akali Dal that has celebrated 99th foundation day of the party last day, Kanwar Pal Singh said Badals took two decisions in 2019 and both were against the spirit and constitution of the party. Akalis sided with BJP to deprive Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood and special status and exclude Muslims from the Citizenship Amendment Act.“Badals have deviated from the core values and objectives of the Akali Dal and in the process, they have lost the moral right to demand and struggle for political autonomy for Punjab,” he added.
