India’s worrying move

People in India, including university students, are strongly protesting against the controversial Citizen Amendment Act (CAA). The CAA amends the Citizenship Act of 1955 to provide citizenship to non-Muslim illegal immigrants—Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians—from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who had entered India on or before December 31, 2014. The act does not offer the same eligibility benefits to the Muslim migrants and is in conflict with the Indian constitution, which does not differentiate between citizens on the basis of their religion.

I am astonished by such an unusual step taken by the Indian government. I am thankful to the people of India for resisting this unconstitutional move. I hope the Indian government will take immediate steps to correct its course.
