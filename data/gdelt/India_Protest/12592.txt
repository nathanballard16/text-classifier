Even from seven thousand miles away it’s clear that what’s happening in Kashmir is an atrocity. Not much to celebrate this August 15th. — Salman Rushdie (@SalmanRushdie) August 15, 2019

Rushdie's works have been known to create controversies, for instance, in 1988, The Satanic Verses received an extremely violent reaction.

India revoked Jammu and Kashmir's special status on 5 August and announced the bifurcation of the State into two Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. Pakistan observed a 'Black Day' on the occasion of India's Independence Day to protest New Delhi's move to revoke the special status to Jammu and Kashmir. China has also formally asked for "closed consultations" in the UN Security Council to discuss the decision.

Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, however, witnessed a low-key Independence Day celebration as various restrictions and security arrangements were made in the city.
