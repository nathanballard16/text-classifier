New Delhi: AAP MLAs will hold a protest at Jantar Mantar here on Wednesday against the DDA allegedly demolishing a temple in the Tughlakabad area, Delhi Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said on Tuesday. He added that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers from Haryana and Punjab will also participate in the protest. "The Constitution gives us the right to protest peacefully, but this government is trying to suppress our voice. It is still following the methods of the British by trying to suppress our voice," Gautam told reporters. He said all the AAP MLAs will take part in the protest and also raise the issue in the Delhi Assembly session starting Thursday.
