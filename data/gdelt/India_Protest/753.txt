Will move Supreme Court if bill is passed: Lawyers' body

GUWAHATI: The All Assam Lawyers' Association (AALA) on Wednesday said it would move the Supreme Court if the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is passed in Parliament. The lawyers' body also announced that they would stage a statewide protest against the bill on January 11.AALA general secretary Dipak Kumar Das said, "If the bill is passed in the Parliament, we are going to move the Supreme Court immediately. We will support the movement against the bill in all possible ways."He also launched a stinging attack on chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal , comparing him to Dhritarashtra, for allegedly turning a blind eye to the ongoing crisis. "In Kauravas's court, when Duryodhana stripped Panchali naked, king Dhritarashtra did nothing. Similarly, Sonowal is turning a blind eye to the crisis. The Centre has forced the people of the state to strip in public and the state government is still staying silent on the matter," Das said, referring to the activists of the KMSS who stripped naked while protesting against the bill in New Delhi.
