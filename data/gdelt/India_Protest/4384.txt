Ludhiana, March 5

Five AAP MLAs, including Leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema and Deputy Leader of Opposition Sarvjit Kaur Manuke, and a number of party workers were detained for staging a protest against Cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu here today. They were demanding the minister’s dismissal for his alleged role in the CLU scam and for allegedly threatening government officials.

The AAP leaders had planned to gherao Ashu’s residence at Model Gram, but their march was halted by the police around 400 m short of the minister’s house, where the protesters sat on a dharna for over two hours.

The police detained Cheema, Manuke, MLAs Budh Ram, Kultar Singh Sandhwan and Manjit Singh Bilaspur and a number of volunteers. They were later released.

Cheema said, “The CLU case is a big scam. The Congress government should immediately sack the tainted minister. We will force the Congress to sack minister who is threatening officials for exposing him.”

He said, “Why MLAs Simarjit Singh Bains and Balwinder Singh Bains are silent on the matter. It seems they are protecting Ashu.”

Manuke said, “If no action is taken, we will gherao Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh. Ashu’s role in the scam is clear from the audio clips wherein he can be heard threatening the investigating officers.”

Meanwhile, Mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu and some Congress leaders also reached the protest site. Sandhu said, “The CM has already announced that a high-powered committee would investigate the entire issue. AAP leaders should wait for the report before jumping to their own conclusion.”

“Besides, if they have any genuine proof, we will request the minister to resign immediately. But no evidence has been produced so far,” the Mayor said.
