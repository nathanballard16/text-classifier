British Diplomat Summoned over Kashmir Protest at Indian Mission in London - Sources

The diplomatic meeting took place a day after the Indian High Commission was allegedly damaged by protestors in London on 3 September.

Sources said the Indian External Affairs Ministry expressed serious concern to the British Deputy High commissioner in New Delhi over an "unruly demonstration by Pakistan incited elements” and “consequent organised vandalism of the property of the High Commission of India in London."

The Indian High Commissioner in London Ruchi Ghanashyam also met the Director General of the British Foreign office and shared evidence of vandalism at the commission’s property. India says that this is the second time in less than a month that such an incident has taken place.
