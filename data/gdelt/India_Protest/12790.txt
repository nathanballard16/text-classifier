Kashmir: 30 people detained in Srinagar as protests continue

Thirty people have been detained in Kashmir as authorities attempt to keep control over protests sparked by the Indian government's decision to remove the region's autonomy.

It comes two weeks after India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government revoked Article 370 of the Indian constitution, which gave the people of Jammu and Kashmir special status and privileges.

The move sparked demonstrations in Kashmir, as severe restrictions on the internet, mobile services and land line phones continue.

The detention of 30 people in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar follows the arrest of hundreds of political leaders and independence campaigners in the region.

Kashmiri youths have thrown stones at the paramilitary police currently deployed in Srinagar, according to a police source.

"These arrests have been made in the areas where there has been intensifying stone pelting in the last few days," the officer said.

Kashmir, a historical region centred around the Kashmir Valley, is claimed by both India and Pakistan, while many Kashmiris want to live in an independent country.

India has recently taken direct control, overturning a rule that outlawed Indians outside the state from permanently settling, buying land, holding local government jobs and winning education scholarships.

As well as sparking anger in Kashmir, it has greatly increased tensions with Pakistan.

On Monday, US President Donald Trump tweeted that he had spoken to Mr Modi and Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan urging them to reduce tensions over Kashmir.

"A tough situation, but good conversations!" Mr Trump posted.
