AAP minister faces flak over Capital healthcare

PWD Minister Satyendra Jain on Sunday reached Matiala constituency to lay the foundation stone for construction of three bridges on the Nazafgarh drain.

Before laying the foundation, the AAP minister also faced protests from people who surrounded his car and demand better health services in the area. Protesters alleged poor health care facilities in the government hospitals and raised slogans against him.

"Since the AAP government came to power in Delhi, health facilities have worsened. We have staged protests in various hospitals but neither the administration nor any minister addressed our grievances," alleged one of the protester.

Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain rubbished the allegations made by protesters. Jain also claimed that protesters were BJP workers who only want to do politics.

"When I came here some people surrounded my car. These were members of a political party. They were shouting slogans against me as I am working for the public," the Health Minister added.

After laying the foundation of bridges on Najafgarh drain the AAP minister told media persons that three bridges will be ready in six months at a cost of Rs 67 crore.
