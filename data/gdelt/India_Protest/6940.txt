Re-Evaluation Not Enough: Students Seek Action Against BIE Over Inter Results

Hyderabad: A massive uproar has surfaced in Telangana with Intermediate students and their parents protesting over the alleged blunders committed by the Telangana State Board of Intermediate Education (TSBIE). The protest has garnered an overwhelming amount of support from several quarters across the state.

A huge gathering assembled near the Board premises in Hyderabad demanding justice for those declared “failed” in the Intermediate exams.

The students also continued their agitation over the Intermediate Results Fiasco by staging a Dharna outside the official residence and camp office of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Wednesday. The students demanded action against the Board of Intermediate Education and the officials responsible for the faux pas.

While the Chief Minister announced free re-evaluation for the failed Intermediate exams, the protesters stated that it was not enough to bring relief to the parents and the students, further demanding the suspension of TSBIE Secretary A Ashok over the publication of error-ridden results.

Pointing out that the Chief Minister's response came in after a week, in the time period which witnessed 19 students ending their lives owing to the discrepancies from the Board, they questioned as to why no probe has been initiated against the BIE.
