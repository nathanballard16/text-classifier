Assam bandh: Assam protest against Citizenship bill turns into perfect storm

GUWAHATI: Anger over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill boiled over in Assam on Monday, with protesters reaching the gates to the residences of the chief minister and the state BJP president and universities cancelling exams scheduled for Tuesday in anticipation of more trouble during a dawn-to-dusk northeast bandh.Barring the state capital, the Barak Valley and the two autonomous hill districts of Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, normal life was paralysed in Assam on Monday, too, as at least three student organisations enforced a bandh in protest against the bill.Members of the All Assam Students' Union (Aasu) burnt effigies and copies of the bill in Guwahati even as two other groups assembled outside the residences of CM Sarbananda Sonowal and state BJP chief Ranjeet Kumar Dass in Dibrugarh and Barpeta Road respectively.Students of Gauhati University wrote a message in blood against the citizenship bill and invoked the Battle of Saraighat, in which the Ahom army led by Lachit Barphukan had fought the invading Mughals.Several protesters of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chhatra Parishad, including its general secretary Palash Changmai, were detained by police while staging a demonstration at the Assam secretariat with black flags.Torchlight processions were taken out by Aasu in Diphu , Hajo, Jamuguri and several other parts of the state dominated by indigenous communities.In Dibrugarh, the police lathicharged a group of protesters trying to stop traffic. Several foreign and domestic tourists were stranded at Kaziranga National Park in Golaghat district. Flights and trains were, however, on schedule.In contrast, people in Manipur erupted in joy after Union home minister Amit Shah announced in Parliament that the Inner-Line Permit (ILP) system would be implemented to protect the indigenous people.The ILP restricts the entry of outsiders to a state without permission. The system is currently in force in Nagaland , Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh
