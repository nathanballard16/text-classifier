Worrying levels of digital ad fraud demand solutions

GroupM's Deepak Tahilani, the practice lead for brand safety, kick-started the discussion with some insight on adex spending. "We've seen digital adex increasing in the last five years from 8 per cent of the media mix to almost 20 per cent. A majority of the traffic for content is through mobile and there is a sudden increase in the interest from fraudsters too," he pointed out. Tahilani also mentioned that he's largely seen it on the programmatic advertising side of the business and emphasised on the need for brands to step up their game in terms of staying ahead of those who might commit ad fraud.
