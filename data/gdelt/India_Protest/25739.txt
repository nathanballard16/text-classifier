A man from Barasat carried a poster that read “C-Communalism, A-Alienation, A-Annihilation; say no to CAA”. “The act seeks to stoke communalism, alienate and annihilate the Muslim community. The poster reflects this evil design,” said the man who did not want to be named. He said he was overjoyed to see students across campuses raising their voice against the acts. “As I came to the march, one of the students handed me this poster that aptly depicts the gravity of the situation,” he added.

Brothers in arms Touseef Ahmed Khan, an advocate at Calcutta High Court, wanted to make the government and the court realise that students have launched a civil disobedience against “black acts”. “We want to show the court and the administration that students are opposing the black acts. No negotiations on that. Simply repeal CAA and NRC,” said Touseef, who completed master’s in law from the University of Sheffield, England. “As many as 65 petitions have been filed in court against the black acts. I hope the court will give a favourable judgment on these issues.” With him was his brother Tafwwej, a student of BTech at the Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore.
