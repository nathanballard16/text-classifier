Gujarat councillors spend session to argue over political matters

It all started after one of the Congress member's mike was turned off abruptly. Congress members staged a protest for not being given six-and-a-half hours for discussion and and also announced a protest against the mayor on Monday. After he was denied time to speak, his party members started throwing files and documents. After the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation's (AMC) budget session on Sunday, it would seem that councillors are more interested in raking up political issues during important meetings instead of discussing the issues that affect citizens. On Sunday evening, the second-day for discussing AMC's main budget of Rs 8,051 crore, the session was conducted amid ruckus.
