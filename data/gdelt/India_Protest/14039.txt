New Delhi: The Gujarat government has reduced fines charged for violation of traffic rules by up to 90%. Addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said fine for riding without helmet cut to Rs 500 from Rs 1,000 while the fine for driving without a licence has been slashed from Rs 5,000 to Rs 3,000.

After the implementation of the amended Motor Vehicle Act 2019 from September 1, traffic police throughout the country are coming down heavily on violators and imposing a hefty fine on them. These hefty fines led to anger among citizens and protest against the government. Union Road and Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari had said stringent rules were "much needed" as people had taken traffic laws very lightly and there was neither fear nor respect for law. However, some state governments have gone slow in implementing the revised traffic rules. The Gujarat government today announced a reduction in the fines under the new Motor Vehicles Act. Here are the revised traffic rule violation fines applicable in Gujarat

- The penalty for not wearing a helmet is changed to Rs 500 as against Rs 1000 under the new MV Act

- For not wearing seat belts Rs 500 will be charged, as against Rs 1000

- Driving a vehicle without driving license will attract a fine of Rs 2000 for the two-wheelers and Rs 3000 for the rest, as against Rs 5000 under the new rule

- If the license, insurance, PUC, RC book is not there, the fine will be as per the new Motor Vehicles Act. For the first time, Rs 500 will be fined and second time penalty is Rs 1000.

- For triple riding, the fine will be Rs 100 as against Rs 1000 in the MV Act

-Under the new MC Act, driving a polluting vehicle attracts a fine of Rs 10,000. But in Gujarat, it will be Rs 1000 for small vehicles and Rs 3000 for large vehicles.
