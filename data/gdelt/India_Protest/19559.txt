While various organisations of Assam have intensified their protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill across the state, few ministers of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its ally party Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) faced protests from the anti-CAB protesters in the state.



On Saturday, Union Minister of State for Food Processing Rameswar Teli was heckled by some activists of All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and locals at Naharkatia area in Assam's Dibrugarh district. Rameswar Teli faced protest when he was in Assam to take stock of the preparations of the Jaipur Rain Forest festival.



The anti-CAB protesters along with locals had surrounded the minister and shouted 'go back' slogans. The protesters had also waved black flags at Rameswar Teli.

Later, the minister left from the spot with the help of security personnel.

On the other hand, Assam Food and Civil Supplies minister and AGP leader Phani Bhushan Choudhury had also faced protests from the anti-CAB protesters on Saturday evening.

According to the reports, Phani Bhushan Choudhury went to Manikpur area to attend a meeting.

When Phani Bhushan Choudhury was delivering his speech, some activists of the AASU shouted slogans against the Citizenship bill.

Anticipating physical attack, Phani Bhushan Choudhury immediately stopped his speech and left from the spot while the meeting was in progress.

Meanwhile, the protesters put up 'missing person posters' against the AGP Rajya Sabha MP Birendra Prasad Baishya in Guwahati.

The BJP-led government at the Centre is all set to pass the the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the ongoing winter session of the parliament.
