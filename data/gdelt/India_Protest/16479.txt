Digapahandi: Unknown bike-borne miscreants ran away with Rs 2 lakh from a farmer’s motorcycle dicky near State Bank of India (SBI) office at Digapahandi main road in Ganjam district Monday afternoon.

The victim has been identified as Satyanarayan Adhikari of Guhalpur village that comes under Kaithuda panchayat in Digapahandi block.

According to Satyanarayan, the incident took place at about 1:30pm when he had gone to Andhra Bank to deposit Rs 2 lakh after selling his grains. He was unable to deposit the cash without quoting the PAN card. He kept the cash inside the motorcycle dicky and went to SBI. The burglars had already fled with the money by the time he came back to his motorcycle.

Later, he lodged a complaint with Digapahandi police who have started an investigation into the incident. The police officials have held two miscreants in connection with this and further interrogation is on, said by Digapahandi IIC Basant Kumar Sethi.
