Guwahati: Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived in Assam on Friday evening amid protests against the proposed Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. As the PM's convoy passed from Lokapriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport to Raj Bhavan in Guwahati, various agitating organisations waved black flags.

Some of the people also shouted 'Go Back, Go Back' slogans. Earlier today, the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) and Krishak Mukri Sangram Samiti (KMSS) mentioned that their members will wave black flags in different parts of Assam on Saturday when PM Modi is scheduled to address a public rally at Changsari.

A 12-hour bandh has been called by Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad, Assam (TAYPA) to protest against the government's move to pass the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 in the Lok Sabha.

"Today our members waved black flags to the Prime Minister in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016. This will continue tomorrow (Saturday) also. It is clear that Modi is a protector of illegal Bangladeshi foreigners. He is going ahead with the bill against the will of indigenous people but we will not tolerate this," said AASU Adviser Samujjal Bhattacharya.

Meanwhile, KMSS leader Akhil Gogoi urged "people of Assam to come out wearing black clothes so that a strong message can be sent to the government."

In the meantime, a candle light procession was taken out by the Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) against the Bill. The party also opposed Modi's visit to Guwahati.

"We warn the BJP-led governments at Delhi and Dispur to take a decision considering the voice of dissent of the people against the Bill," said AGP president Atul Bora.
