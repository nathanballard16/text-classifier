Protest Erupts in Patna over Gujarat Rape Incident

Patna: Opposition parties in Patna on Wednesday took out a number of marches and burnt effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani to protest against attacks on migrant labors from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh in the aftermath of a rape of a 14-month-old girl in Sabarkantha district in Gujarat on September 28.

Demanding resignation of Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Gujarat CM Rupani, and PM Modi, activists representing Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) burnt an effigy of the Prime Minister while Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) workers did the same at the Income Tax Roundabout.

Supporters of Pappu Yadav, the leader of the Jan Adhikar Party (JAP), also burnt effigies of the Gujarat CM and PM Modi at the Kargil Chowk demanding protection for Biharis in Gujarat.

"Biharis all over India are being harassed, beaten up, and ordered to leave but neither the Home Minister nor the Prime Minister is showing any concern for their welfare. Attacks on Biharis and UP'ites are being carried out at the behest of Modi and Amit Shah who are actively involved in creating communal and regional rift in the run-up of the next year's Lok Sabha elections," said an RJD worker.

Meanwhile, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) activists took out a rally against Congress President Rahul Gandhi and Gujarat Congress MLC Alpesh Thakor accusing them of inciting violence against Bihari and UP migrant workers in Gujarat.

"Congress has become desperate to gain power by any means. It's leaders like Alpesh Thakor and Hardik Patel who have ordered violence against Biharis in an attempt to prevent them from voting in next year's Lok Sabha elections. They know Biharis and UP'ites are largely BJP supporters so they want to get rid of them in the hope of gaining some electoral advantage," LJP workers said.
