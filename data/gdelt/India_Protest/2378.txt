DYFI to protest against Modi’s State visit

‘PM can’t step into State without keeping promises’

The Communist Party of India (Marxist)-led Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) is going to protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the State on February 10, according to DYFI State secretary M. Surya Rao.

Addressing reporters here on Tuesday after attending the DYFI district committee meeting, he said the youth, under the banner of the Students and Youth Joint Action Committee, would swarm the venue in Guntur in an attempt to stall the meeting. Simultaneously, State-wide agitations would be organised against Mr.Modi for not keeping promises made to the State.

Mr. Modi did not have the moral right to step into the State without conferring a special category status on it. He had to keep promises made in Parliament at the time of bifurcation and had to act on assurances made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014, he said.

Funds crunch

Students at 11 central institutions in the State were in an unenvious position as the institutions were starved of funds from the Centre, he alleged, adding that the interim Union Budget was silent on job creation.

The unemployment problem had accentuated because of neo-liberal economic policies pursued by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government in the State.

None of the 359 families allegedly displaced because of the Kia Motors plant in Anantapur had been provided jobs, he claimed.
