After Padmaavat, Karni Sena Is Now Protesting Against The Release Of Kangana Ranaut’s 'Manikarnika'

Exactly around the same time last year, Rajput Karni Sena had gone violent in its protest against the release of the Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmaavat. From assaulting the filmmaker to burning down his sets, Karni Sena went on to another level in its massive protests against the release of the movie, which they felt “distorted history”.

Now, that Kangana Ranaut is gearing up for the release of Manikarnika: The Queen Of Jhansi, the Maharashtra Karni Sena has once again created a ruckus. Launching another threat, the Maharashtra Karni Sena has said that if the shooting of Manikarnika isn’t stopped, the makers will face dire consequences.

They have written a letter to the director, producers and the writers of the movie threatening them that if the image of Rani Laxmi Bai is maligned in the movie or if she is shown to be the lover of some Britisher, the makers will have to bear the repercussions. They have also claimed that the movie shows the Queen of Jhansi dancing on a special number, which is against their tradition.

Meanwhile, before the official release of the movie on Jan 25, a special screening of Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi will be hosted for President Ram Nath Kovind at Rashtrapati Bhavan in New Delhi on Friday.

Based on the life and struggles of Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi and her war against the East India Company, period drama Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, also stars Ankita Lokhande, Atul Kulkarni, Suresh Oberoi, Danny Demzongpa and Jisshu Sengupta in pivotal roles.
