MHA advisory to states, UTs amid raging protests against CAA

An advisory has been issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs to all the states and the Union Territories in the wake of the violent protests against the amended Citizenship Act.

“MHA has issued an advisory to states and UTs, in view of incidences of violence and damage to public property being reported from some parts of the country. It’s imperative all required measures be taken to contain violence, ensure protection of life and safety of citizens,” the sources said.

“State governments and UT administrations are requested to take requisite precautionary measures to maintain law and order, peace and public tranquillity. They have also been requested to take action against circulation of fake news and rumours on the social media having potential to incite violence,” they added.

Meanwhile the Ministry has said that despite the CAA, the refugees will have to provide required documents to be given Indian citizenship. They would not be given the citizenship automatically.
