SP MLA suffers brain haemorrhage in assembly

A Samajwadi Party MLA from Ghazipur district suffered brain haemorrhage while staging protest against the Yogi Adityanath government during the Governor’s address to the joint sitting of both Houses of the state legislature on Tuesday morning.

SP legislator Subhash Pasi was immediately rushed to Syama Prasad Mukherjee (Civil) Hospital from where he was referred to the Trauma Centre of King George’s Medical College in Lucknow.

His condition continued to be critical and he was under constant medical observation.

Governor Ram Naik went to the Trauma Centre in the evening to enquire about the well-being of the legislator.

A group of SP MLAs, along with legislators of Bahujan Samaj Party and Congress, were protesting against deteriorating law and order situation, prevailing unemployment and agrarian crisis in the state during the Governor’s address when the SP MLA suddenly collapsed.

Fellow MLAs immediately took Pasi to the Assembly lobby and a doctor was called. Later, the legislator was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance.

Pasi, a Dalit leader, had won the Assembly election from Saidpur constituency in Ghazipur district in 2012 and 2017.
