Story India: Zomato suspends accounts of delivery executives protesting over changes in pay structure; Includes comments from Zomato

In September 2019, thousands of delivery executives working for Zomato in Mumbai and Bengaluru logged out of the Zomato app, in protest over changes in the company's pay structure. Delivery executives claim Zomato has reduced earnings per delivery, increased the number of orders they need to complete to earn incentives, and increased the kilometres they need to travel to earn a bonus.

A few days later, some of the protesting workers reported they were unable to access the app, and Zomato later confirmed that some accounts had been momentarily suspended.

In response to the protests, Zomato stated that they had increased system efficiency, to enable delivery partners to complete more deliveries in the same amount of time, and apologised for any inconveniences caused to their users. Further comments can be found below.
