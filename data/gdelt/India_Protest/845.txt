The Accidental Prime Minister's screening stopped in Kolkata after the Youth Congress activists protest

The Accidental Prime Minister which released today faced a protest from the Youth Congress activists today in Kolkata. As per reports, the activists protested outside the Hind Inox cinema hall as they are against the screening of the movie which is based on the tenure of former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The protests led to the cancellation of the screening in that hall.

Right from the morning, Youth Congress activists were protesting outside the theatre and as soon as screening started reportedly the situation became tense. As per the same report, Youth Congress workers started burning posters of the film and were raising slogans against the actors and the producer of the film. As per the report, hall authorities were not instructed to stop the screening, but they took the call to stop as the protest posed a lot of risks and there was local public inside the hall.

As per the DNA report, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said: “Ahead of elections, they have come up with a movie, Accidental Prime Minister. I do not endorse the kind of politics Congress does hence we parted ways several years back But, I will say that it is not in a good taste."
