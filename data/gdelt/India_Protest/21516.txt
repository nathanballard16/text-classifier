We have no problem with university students... Our only interest is to push the mob back, so law and order can be restored in the area

We had to push them back... they started pelting stones and bottles filled with oil...

New Delhi police have released all those unfairly detained in a raid on Jamia Millia Islamia campus, where officers had rounded up a violent mob that had torched vehicles and pelted stones at a march over a new citizenship law.An agitated crowd of protesters gathered outside a police station in the capital New Delhi on Sunday night, demanding that authorities immediately release students of the Muslim university, who had been detained earlier in the day. By roughly 3:30am local time, the crowd had gradually dispersed after police said they had released everyone who wasn't charged.The university accused riot police of raiding its campus illegally, using tear gas, and brutally abusing students and staff. More than two dozen people, including several policemen, were injured in clashes.. Videos shared on social media show chaos in the university's buildings, as the sound of smashing glass and what seem to be riot control weapon shots can be heard.Earlier in the day, a march that started on the university grounds almost immediately turned violent, with a mob pelting stones at police and torching at least three buses and dozens of bikes.Authorities admit that they can't definitively say if it was a mob of students or locals who started the violence. "They were being very, very aggressive and violent and they have been pushed to the Jamia Nagar area from where they originated," explained Biswal, whose officers are now being accused of using excessive force as activists online are rallying in solidarity with the 'peaceful protesters.'The unrest in India was triggered by a bill that fast-tracks citizenship for migrants belonging to religious minorities that fled Muslim-majority Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan for India before 2015.
