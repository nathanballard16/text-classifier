Highlights: Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 passed in Rajya Sabha, 125 vote in favour, 105 against

The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2019 will be tabled by Union Home Minister Amit Shah in Rajya Sabha, two days after it was passed in Lok Sabha following a 12-hour long debate.

Unlike Lok Sabha, the BJP does not have the majority in Rajya Sabha, therefore it will be a tough task for the BJP, however, the Modi-led government is confident of passing the bill in the Upper House.

Home Minister Amit Shah introduced CAB today.

The opposition is of the opinion that the Citizenship Amendment Bill is against minorities and unconstitutional. However, Amit Shah has repeatedly said that the bill is not a political move by the government and is not even 0.001% against the minorities.
