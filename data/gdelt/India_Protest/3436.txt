Kejriwal likely to attend Puducherry CM’s dharna

Narayanasamy staging sit-in since Feb 13

Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) national convener Arvind Kejriwal is likely to visit Puducherry on Monday to extend his support to Puducherry Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy, who has been staging a sit-in outside the Lieutenant-Governor’s house there since February 13.

Delhi government sources said that Mr. Kejriwal and Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia will meet the Congress Chief Minister of Puducherry at the dharna on Monday afternoon.

The Puducherry Chief Minister has been protesting against what he has termed “autocratic” behaviour by Lieutenant-Governor Kiran Bedi.

Mr. Narayanasamy had said in a tweet on February 16, “Thank you @ArvindKejriwal ji for calling me and giving solid support for my fight against @thekiranbedi for her illegal unconstitutional act. I along with my Cabinet colleagues are sitting #Dharna for her recall since she is blocking welfare scheme for the people. #BediGoback [sic].”

Mr. Kejriwal, replying to Mr. Narayanasamy’s tweet, wrote on Twitter: “The people of Delhi are in complete solidarity wid the people of Puducherry. Why r the people of Delhi and Puducherry being denied democracy even 70 yrs after independence? [sic].”
