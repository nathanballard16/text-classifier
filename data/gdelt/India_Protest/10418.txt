“Disproportionate and shocking”, Calcutta HC imposes Rs 1 Lakh costs on itself for wrongly punishing Magistrate

The Calcutta High Court recently imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on itself, after it found itself to blame for having erroneously confirmed a penalty of compulsory retirement on a Railway Magistrate cum Judicial Magistrate. The Magistrate had been suspended in 2007 on allegations that he had overstepped his jurisdiction.
