All irrespective of religion must raise voice against hate: Umar

A+ A-New Delhi: Activists of various organisations staged a protest at Jharkhand Bhawan in the national capital demanding justice to mob lynching victim Tabrez Ansari. It must be noted that it could be seen clearly in the video which went viral, how the innocent Tabrez was tied to a pole and was mercilessly beaten though he was pleading mercy. The protestors under the banner of United Against Hate expressed concerned and anger over changing the nature of the case. JNU leader Umar Khalid also addressed on the occasion. Dalits are aslo being targeted hence all need to unitedly raise voice against the hate.
