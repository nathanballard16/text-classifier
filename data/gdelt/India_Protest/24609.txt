'Ranga Billa, Kung Fu Kutta': Arundhati asks Indians to give 'fake names' to NPR

As scores of people have come out on the streets in huge numbers to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019, writer and activist Arundhati Roy has joined the protests at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi.

A day after the NPR announcement, Arundhati Roy has asked people to mislead the authorities and give wrong names in the National Population Register (NPR). " Give wrong names in the NPR," Arundhati Roy said.

"When the NPR authorities will come to your place for your details, fudge your name. We will decide on five names, such as Ranga Billa, Kung Fu kutta...give your address as 7, Race Course Road," Roy told the gathering.

In a move that hints at burial of the controversial pan India National Register of Citizens, the Union Cabinet has instead resurrected the National Population Register, a relic of the UPA regime.

The population register seeks to create a comprehensive identity database of every "usual resident" of the country. It defines “usual resident” as a person who has resided in a place for six months or more, and intends to reside there for another six months or more.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said that there was no link between the National Population Register (NPR) exercise and the National Register of Citizen (NRC).
