Chennai is reeling under a water crisis like never before. A BBC report said that four water reservoirs of Chennai are completely dry. The acute shortage has hit the IT companies, hotels and other institutions. An Indian Express report said that locals are paying anything between Rs 3,000 to Rs 4,000 for a single water tanker. In fact, some other reports had said that major IT companies have instructed their staff to work from home. The BBC report quoted Vinoth Kaligai, the general secretary of an IT workers' association, saying that some firms had told employees to stay at home. "But homes are also running out of water, so what are we supposed to do?" he added.

"Water supply has become erratic now, earlier it was regular. We're suffering. This locality doesn't have piped water supply," a Chennai local was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

In a statement from the party on Saturday, cadres and leaders were urged to participate in the protest in large numbers. On Saturday too, the DMK had held protests at district headquarters across the state to press the state government for necessary action to mitigate the people's suffering.
