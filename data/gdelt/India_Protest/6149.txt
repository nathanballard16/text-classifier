AYWO warns BJP against turning NE into warlike zone for CAB

TURA: The A’chik Youth Welfare Organisation (AYWO) in Tura has warned the BJP against turning NE into a warlike zone by declaring in its manifesto that it would pass the CAB if voted to power.

“The manifesto is nothing but the expression of the ‘dictatorial mindset’ of the BJP. The CAB 2016 is Communal in nature and the Content of the Bill is divisive which can possibly transpire into serious Law and Order problem in whole of North East India. Despite of massive protest against the bill in whole of NE in the recent past, BJP under the leadership of Amit Shah wish to go against the sentiments and genuine concern of indigenous tribals of NE,” the organization said.

The organization added that the survival of Identity. Demographic imbalance is inevitable, once the Bill becomes an Act as the Bill favoured the refugees in granting them citizenship at the expense of national security, which in turn will also pave the way for the region that is already plagued by influx of illegal immigrants, to become a safe haven for foreigners.

“The BJP is trying to impose the rule of the Hindu Aryan race across India under the Akhand Bharat ideology under the leadership of RSS. CAB is just one of their hate program against the Mongoloid Race of the Northeast

and we need to keep them in abeyance from gaining ground in the region,” it said.

The organization warned that the people of the NE would not hesitate to fight tooth and nail and assured of a ‘showdown’ if the saffron party dares to test the people’s patience. The organization also sought clarification from the State BJP leadership if they endorse the idea and supported the manifesto.

“It is high time that the State BJP leadership show some guts to question the veracity of the idea and show the electorates that the Cause of Motherland is greater than any Party affiliations. Don’t they should be ready to face the music,” it warned.
