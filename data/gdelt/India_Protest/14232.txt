AIADMK cadre protest govt. decision to rename road

Decision purely to satisfy the ruling party’s ally: ex-MLA

The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam cadre on Friday staged a protest against the government’s decision to rename a stretch on 100-feet road from Bharat Ratna M.G.R. Salai to M. Karunanidhi Salai.

Under the leadership of former party legislator Om Sakthi Segar, workers staged a protest at Saram against the government’s decision to rename the junction from Marappalam to Indira Gandhi statue.

Addressing the cadre, Mr. Segar said when V. Vaithilingam was the Chief Minister, the road was named after former Tamil Nadu chief minister M.G. Ramachandran, also the founder of the AIADMK.

The present Congress government has decided to rename the stretch in the name of former DMK president and another former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Karunanidhi. The decision, he said, was purely to satisfy the ruling party’s ally, the DMK, he charged.
