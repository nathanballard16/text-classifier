Parliament: Critical thinking not just in liberal education, but all schools here, says Faishal

SINGAPORE - Critical thinking is an essential skill that Singapore wants its young people to learn, and it is not confined to just liberal arts education, said Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Education Faishal Ibrahim in Parliament on Monday (Oct 7).

"All of our educational institutions nurture students to conduct critical thinking, with maturity of thought and a sense of responsibility towards society," he added.

He was replying to Nominated MP Walter Theseira, who had called on the Government to extend liberal education beyond institutions like Yale-NUS College, a liberal arts institution.

Dr Faishal said universities have core curriculum components that develop critical thinking skills. "We will work with the Autonomous Universities (AUs) to see how this can be further enhanced but the AUs have their constraints like limited curriculum time."

Critical thinking skills are also taught in subjects like social studies at the secondary and pre-university levels, he added.

Dr Faishal also touched on the importance of academic freedom in the context of Singapore's norms, a topic Education Minister Ong Ye Kung had dwelt on at length earlier in the House.

Mr Ong explained it when addressing MPs' questions on the recent cancellation of a Yale-NUS module on dissent and resistance.

Dr Faishal, who is also Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development, said academics should not be overly concerned about academic freedom and urged them to exercise sensible judgment.

"Even in the most liberal societies, academic freedom needs to exist within the norms and culture of the community," he pointed out.
