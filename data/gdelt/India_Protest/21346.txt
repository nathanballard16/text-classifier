India endures fifth day of violent protests as Modi doubles down on religious citizenship law

Narendra Modi, the Indian prime minister, appealed for calm today as violent nationwide student-led protests against "anti-Muslim" citizenship legislation continued for a fifth day.

Students from Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi took to the streets again despite police firing tear gas and baton charging protesters yesterday, accusing the government of introducing the legislation to suppress Muslims.

Approximately 100 people were hospitalised and a group of 50 students was arrested overnight, and have since been released.

The chancellor of the university has said she will press charges against the police after videos circulated on social media of officers brutally attacking peaceful protesters.

In one video circulated on social media, a group of female students stopped a male student from being beaten up by forming a human shield.
