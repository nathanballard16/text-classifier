Two youth martyred by Indian forces in occupied Kashmir

Indian occupation forces on Monday martyred two Kashmiri youth in the occupied valley as state-sponsored brutality continued in the region, Express News reported.Scores of Kashmiris took to streets to protest against the ongoing brutality by Indian troops.In the occupied valley, a complete shutdown is being observed to mark the anniversary of the Gaw Kadal massacre, Radio Pakistan reported.The call for the shutdown has been given by Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik.Over 50 innocent people were killed in Gaw Kadal area of Srinagar on January 21, 1990, when Indian troops resorted to indiscriminate firing on peaceful demonstrators who were protesting against molestation of women by troops.The JRL, in a statement, termed the massacres carried out by Indian troops at Gaw Kadal, Handwara and Kupwara in the 1990s as a reminder of Indian illegal occupation and oppression in the occupied territory.Islamabad has repeatedly urged New Delhi to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement, investigate the incidents of ceasefire violations, instruct Indian forces to respect the agreement in letter and spirit and maintain peace along the Line of Control. However, the violation of the truce has been continuing.Earlier in 2018, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report revealing “impunity for human rights violations and lack of access to justice” to be among human rights challenges in the occupied valley.
