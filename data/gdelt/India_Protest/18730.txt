Opposition parties on Tuesday boycotted the joint sitting of Parliament on Constitution Day and held a protest outside at the BR Ambedkar statue to protest against the “murder of democracy” in Maharashtra.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi led the protest and read out the Preamble of the Constitution to pledge and reiterate the party’s conviction in its values.

Congress leaders in the protest included former PM Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi and Anand Sharma. DMK, Shiv Sena, NCP, RJD, TMC, SP and Left parties participated in the protest.

Opposition leaders held a joint meeting in the morning to finalise the protest and decided to go ahead with the boycott of the session despite the government appealing to them to reconsider their move.

When asked if the Congress was confident of the Maharashtra floor test ordered by the Supreme Court for Wednesday, Sonia said, “Bilkul.”
