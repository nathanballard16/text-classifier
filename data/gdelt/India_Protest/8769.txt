BENGALURU/HUBBALLI: Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will review the coalition government’s decision to sell 3,667 acres of land to JSW Steel and take a final call on Sunday. This follows stiff opposition to the deal.

Congress leader HK Patil, who has been opposing the sale, and industries minister KJ George will meet the CM on Sunday. “Based on the outcome, the CM will decide whether to go ahead with the decision,” George said after meeting Patil in the presence of KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao on Saturday.

Gundu Rao summoned them to the KPCC office after they’d been at loggerheads for the past three days. George dismissed Patil’s allegation that JSW Steel owed the government Rs 2,000 crore. Replying to George through a letter which was also posted on social media, Patil released documents to substantiate his claim. Earlier, Patil had written to the CM against the decision.

BJP has announced a three-day protest against the government from June 11.
