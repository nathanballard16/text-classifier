Nagpur DCCB employees on war path

Nagpur District Central Co-operative Bank’s (NDCCB) employees have threatened to stop their daily work if they are not paid their long overdue annual increment and arrears, reports Hitavada.

The workers are set to protest under the banner of Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank Employees Union.

As per the agreement reached earlier, between the management and the union , arrears and DA from April 2014 to March 2018 will be given in the form of fixed deposit receipt (FDR), and April 2018 to August 2018 i.e. the five-month increased amount was to be given with the salary.

Sources say the workers’ demand is justified and reasonable but the bank seems bent on denying them their due. NDCCB operates with 72 branches with a strong network in rural areas.
