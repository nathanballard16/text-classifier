Diaspora, Bengali protesters add to anti-CAA chorus

GUWAHATI/ DIBRUGARH : From the Assamese diaspora in Dallas to the Bengali community of Tinsukia, the anticitizenship act agitation grew in span on Sunday.Thousands of people from the Bengali community took to the streets of Tinsukia town in Upper Assam to demand that the amended citizenship law be withdrawn even as Assamese people living in the US gathered around a statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Dallas, holding placards and gamosas to show solidarity with the campaign led by the All Assam Students Union (Aasu).“We are here to say that we stand in solidarity with our Assamese brothers and sisters and people protesting across India against CAA,” said Ankur Bora, a member of the Assamese diaspora. “In the Eighties, we fought for our language, our heritage and our roots. Hundreds of Assamese died for this cause and today, this law has been imposed upon us. We have to act and fight, otherwise our identity is in danger. The Assam Agitation was a non-violent and peaceful one, and today we are standing beside a Gandhi statue in the spirit of peace and solidarity.”In Tinsukia, the protesters came from various parts of the district under the banner of Asomiya Bengali Samaj. They marched through the streets from Sripuria to the Swahid Piyali Phukan playground, where they staged a protest.Apart from indigenous groups, the Bengali, Marwari, Bihari and Gorkha communities have rallied behind Aasu, which has been spearheading the agitation against the CAA for more than two weeks. On Saturday, the Bengali community of Dibrugarh had protested against the Act near the Netaji statue at Santipara.
