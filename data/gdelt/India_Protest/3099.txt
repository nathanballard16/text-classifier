CPI (Maoist) top leader, wife surrender

Hyderabad: The CPI (Maoist) has suffered a major setback with the surrender of its Central Committee member Sathwaji alias Sudhakar along with his wife Vydugula Aruna alias Neelima before Director General of Police M Mahendar Reddy on Wednesday. Sudhakar and his wife decided to give themselves up as they were frustrated with the 'wrong trends' emerging in the outfit and also due to their health problems, Mahendar Reddy told reporters.

Sudhakar carries a reward Rs 25 lakh in the State, while his wife carries a reward of Rs 10 lakh on her head. Sudhakar disclosed that there were internal differences among top leaders and also between leaders of local tribes and Telangana leaders.

He made a startling revelation that Maoists had been ill-treating women cadre and putting them under all sorts of pressure. The women cadre were mentally exploited. Some women were committing suicide also unable to bear the pressure, he said. Ramakka alias Sarada, wife of Nambala Keshava Rao, alia Baswaraj, CPI (Maoist) chief, had also committed suicide in 2010. He revealed that four women, Chandana, Chukki, G Bhagyalakshmi and Munni were among those women who committed suicide, DGP quoted Sudhakar as saying.

Sudhakar also said the functioning of the CPI (Maoist) leadership in Bihar and Jharkhand was autocratic and ill-disposed towards revolutionary ideology and not at all people centric. The party functioning had deteriorated and was more on the lines of criminal gangs who loot people and amass wealth for their development.

Due to deteriorating standards in the functioning of the CPI (Maoist) and lumpenisation trends, the couple were willing to give up extremism, Mahendar Reddy said. The party was unable to conduct or implement any programmes based on Marxist- Leninist-Maoist ideology in their Eastern Regional Bureau area.
