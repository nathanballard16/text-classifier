NEW DELHI: A high-pitched election battle spread over two summer months saw India’s top politicians BJP’s Narendra Modi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi travel the length and breadth of the country wooing voters.A seasoned campaigner, Modi travelled 1,33,329kms this election season addressing 142 rallies across 140 constituencies in the country. A majority of Modi’s rallies were centered in the Hindi heartland and east India where he held 73 and 25 rallies respectively.Modi addressed the maximum number of rallies in Uttar Pradesh - 31 in all, followed by 17 in West Bengal - the state where the BJP was hoping to make headway. He addressed 9 rallies each in Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Maharashtra, 8 in Rajasthan and 7 each in Odisha and Karnataka -- states where the party wanted to establish a stronger presence.PM Modi's efforts paid off. The BJP is leading in 106 of the 140 constituencies that Modi campaigned in 2019 which makes it a strike rate of close to 76%.He worked hardest in, Uttar Pradesh, and the BJP is leading in 60 of the total 80 seats. In 2014 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP had won 71 seats in the state.In West Bengal, where Modi addressed 17 campaign rallies in 2019. The saffron party made substantial progress. It is leading in 18 of the total 42 seats in the state as compared to the two seats it won in the state in 2014.Congress president Rahul Gandhi travelled 1,23,466kms across the country, addressing 115 rallies in 105 constituencies. Of these, 20 were held in constituencies, which the Congress had won in 2014, 64 rallies were held in those which the BJP won and the 21 were held in seats held by other parties in the previous elections.The effort though did not pay off as expected. The party is leading in just 15 of the 105 seats that the Congress President campaigned in.Gandhi focused on Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan, two states, the party managed to wrest from the BJP in the recent assembly elections. He held 17 rallies in Madhya Pradesh and 12 in Rajasthan. However, in MP, trends show that the Congress is leading in just 1 of the 29 Lok Sabha seats, while in Rajasthan, it failed to make any headway in 2019.In UP, compared to Modi’s 31 rallies, Gandhi just held 12 rallies and the results reflect the insignificance of the grand old party in the state where it is leading in just 1 of the 80 states.Gandhi, spend considerable time in Karnataka, where the party is an alliance partner and Kerala, from where he is contesting. He addressed 8 rallies in both these states. In Kerala, the leads indicate a better performance with UPA leading in 12 of the states’ 20 seats, a huge improvement over the 8 it won in 2014. But the same does not hold true for Karnataka, where the UPA leads in just 3 of the total 28 seats, far lower than the 9 constituencies it won in the state in 2014.
