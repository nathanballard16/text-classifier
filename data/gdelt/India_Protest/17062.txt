Normal life remains crippled in IOJ&K on 88th day

Normal life remained crippled in Kashmir Valley and Muslim majority areas of Jammu region owing to the unprecedented military clampdown on the 88th straight day, today.

All shops and business establishments remained closed while public transport was off the roads.

Indian Administrative Service Officers, Girish Chandra Murmu and Radha Krishna Mathur, took oath as new Lieutenant Governors for Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.

Complete shutdown was observed in Kargil district on the second consecutive day, today, in protest against the Indian authorities’ decision of bifurcating Jammu and Kashmir.

Reacting to the Indian move, people in the Kashmir Valley said New Delhi’s decision has robbed them of their identity and special status, terming it as illegal, immoral and unconstitutional as well as against the interests of the residents of the territory.

They said the Kashmir dispute is in the UN, which has passed several resolutions for its settlement.

Hurriyat leader, Muhammad Shafi Lone, in a statement in Srinagar said it is India’s misconception that it could suppress the Kashmiris’ sentiment for freedom through killings and other brutal tactics.
