Jamia students clash with Delhi Police over Citizenship Act

New Delhi: Protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act spread to Delhi on Friday, with the students of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University indulging in clashes with the police. Clashes erupted when the Delhi Police personnel stopped the JMI students march being held to oppose the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

JMI students had given a call for a march to Parliament House from the varsity campus in South Delhi in order to protest against the controversial legislation, that has caused violent protests in the Northeast.

However, the students were stopped by the police near the university, triggering clashes. The students alleged that the police used force against them.

Meanwhile, in view of the JMI students’ protest, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation closed entry and exit at two stations near Parliament in Central Delhi, on the advice of the Delhi Police. “As advised by the Delhi Police, entry and exit at Patel Chowk and Janpath metro stations have been closed. Trains will not be halting at these stations,” the DMRC said in a tweet.

However, at around 5:30 pm, the DMRC said both the Patel Chowk and Janpath metro stations were fully operational. "Entry & exit gates at all stations have been opened. Normal services have resumed in all stations," the DMRC tweeted.
