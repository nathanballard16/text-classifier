Motor workers want new MV Act scrapped

Jeypore: The movement of vehicles on NH-26 was disrupted Tuesday after a joint forum of motor vehicle workers and auto-rickshaw drivers blocked the highway demanding withdrawal of the heavy penalties in the amended Motor Vehicles Act.

Hundreds of vehicles were stranded for over one-and-a-half hours on both lanes of the highway as the protesters blocked the main traffic square.

The stiff penalties prescribed by the MV Act amendment have dealt a heavy blow to thousands of motor vehicle workers and their owners. This has robbed them off their livelihood and they have been forced to protest.

The workers led by convener Yudhistir Roul said the CM had announced a relaxation of three months regarding the levying of heavy fines under the amended Motor Vehicles Act. However, this will not serve any purpose and they demanded withdrawal of the amended Act. The protesters said they will intensify their stir if their demands are not accepted.

Police tried to pacify the protesters, but they continued the blockade. The blockade was finally withdrawn after SDPO Harekrushna Majhi and town police IIC Balaswar Gidhi removed the protesters. Police arrested 23 persons and freed them later.
