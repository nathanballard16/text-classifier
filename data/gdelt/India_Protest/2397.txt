Anganwadi workers hold stir, demand 50% DA

Ludhiana: The members of Anganwadi Mulazam Union Punjab held a protest at Chatar Singh Park on Tuesday against the government for not providing 50% dearness allowance to the workers as announced in September last year. The district committee also slammed the central government for providing “step-motherly treatment to the workers”.

District union president Subhash Rani said, “We have decided to protest at Delhi against the central government’s policies. We are working for the past many years, but still stand deprived of pension and other such benefits.”

On September 11 last year, the government had announced 50% dearness allowance to anganwadi workers, but the same has not been implemented as yet, Rani added.

Other members of the union alleged that for the smooth functioning of the services, the government must allocate more budget for children and pregnant women at anganwadi centres, but now the central government is cutting down on the allocated budget every year.

A union member said the Punjab government was paying the anganwadi workers Rs 5,000 each and Rs 2,500 to the helpers. “With such a meagre salary, it is difficult to run the house,” the member added. In Ludhiana district, there are 2,401 anganwadi centres where 4,802 helpers and workers are serving.
