Pakistan lodges strong protest with India over Pakistani prisoner’s death in Indian jail

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan has lodged strong protest with India over the Pakistani prisoner beaten to death in Indian jail.



Statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry says “Subsequent to media reports regarding the death of a Pakistani prisoner, Shakir Ullah in Jaipur Jail India, our High Commission sought clarity in this regard from the Indian authorities on 20th February 2019 and have been informed now that Shakir Ullah sustained injuries following a "scuffle" between fellow inmates in the television room in the jail, which proved fatal.”

According to some Indian media reports he was lynched. It is incomprehensible how a "scuffle" between prisoners in an established government set up was allowed to escalate to the extent that Shakir Ullah sustained fatal injuries, the statement reads and added security and safety of Pakistani inmates/prisoners in Indian jails is the responsibility of the Government of India which should have taken enhanced measures to prevent this.

The government of India must provide enhanced security to ensure safety of all Pakistanis, especially Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails to ensure prevention of recurrence of such tragic and reprehensible incidents.
