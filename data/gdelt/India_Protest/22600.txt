CAA protests: Man dies of firearm injury in Lucknow; buses burnt in Sambhal

Lucknow, December 19

One person died of a firearm injury in Lucknow as violence erupted during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act on Thursday afternoon in various cities of Uttar Pradesh, including the state capital.

"Mohammad Wakeel (25) died of firearm injury here," King George's Medical University (KGMU) Trauma Centre in-charge Sandeep Tiwari told PTI.

"Two other patients are undergoing treatment in the trauma centre and one of them has firearm injury," he said.

It is not yet clear from where the firing took place.

Roadways buses were set on fire by protesters in Sambhal district and some private vehicles were also set ablaze. Internet services have been suspended in the western UP district.

In Kushinagar, protesters pelted stones at the cops who then carried out a baton charge to disperse them.

In Lucknow, even as the police focused on protests by Samajwadi Party workers, people came out on large numbers in old city areas like Khadra and pelted police with stones.

District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash rushed to the affected areas.

A huge turnout of common people was seen at Koneshwar crossing and Hussainganj and led to fracas with the cops.

The mob vandalised the Madehganj police chowki and set several police vehicles on fire. The police fired several rounds in the air and lobbed teargas shells to disperse the mob.

Clashes with the police were also reported from Hussainabad, Daliganj and Teele Wali Masjid and protestors pelted stones at the Chhota Imambara.

Tension prevails in the other old city areas.

Police carried out a baton charge at the Parivartan Chowk also where a large number of Congress workers were taken into custody.

With mobs collecting in different parts of the state capital, traffic management was thrown out of gear, leading to severe jams in almost all parts of the city. — Agencies
