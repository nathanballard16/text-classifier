Sporadic violence reported in Bengal

The fate of political parties and their candidates for the 542 Lok Sabha seats was sealed on Sunday, with the conclusion of the last phase of polling in 59 constituencies across seven States and one Union Territory, which recorded a tentative turnout of 64.23%, compared with 64.63% in 2014.

An almost 9 percentage points jump, from the previous figure of 66.87%, was registered in the eight constituencies of Madhya Pradesh. In Himachal Pradesh too, it went up from 65.06% to 71.24%. However, there was a significant decrease in West Bengal’s nine constituencies, from 79.15% to 73.51%. Yet again, the State witnessed sporadic incidents of violence.

The vehicle of Nilanjan Ray, BJP candidate in Diamond Harbour, was attacked at Budge Budge. Fuad Halim, CPI(M) candidate from the same seat, alleged that his agents were driven out of several booths. Anupam Hazra, BJP candidate from Jadavpur, and a party leader accompanying him, were attacked.

There was tension in north Kolkata, where a few crude bombs were hurled. At Bhatapara, the situation turned volatile as BJP supporters clashed with TMC activists. A similar situation was witnessed at Islampur where there were reports of bombings and violence.

Fearing more violence, the BJP said central paramilitary forces should remain deployed in the State till the model code of conduct was in force.

In Punjab, there was a steep decline in voter participation, from 71.28% to 63.14%. The figure for Chandigarh, where 73.84% of the voters had exercised their franchise last time, dipped to 63.57%. While in Jharkhand, the turnout went up from 68.87% to 71.16%, the same trend was noticed in Uttar Pradesh, with 57.93% compared with 54.96% in 2014. In Bihar, the figure jumped from 51.49% to 53.36%.

The first six phases saw an overall increase in the turnout of 7.26 crore voters, which included 4.10 crore women. According to the Election Commission, the gap between the participation of male and female voters shrunk from 1.4% in 2014 to 0.4% this time. In 2009, it was 9%. The overall polling in six phases rose from 66.4% in the previous election to 67.37%.

Thanking the electorate and the poll machinery, Chief Election Commission Sunil Arora said barring some odd incidents, the election was largely peaceful and was conducted in a free, fair, robust and ethical manner. The Election Commission is now gearing up for the counting of votes on May 23.

The Election Commission is yet to announce the schedule for the election from Vellore, Tamil Nadu. The election in the Lok Sabha constituency was rescinded following reports of large-scale use of money to influence voters.
