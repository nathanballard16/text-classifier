Congress adds removal of SPG cover to slowdown protests

NEW DELHI: Congress has directed its state units to add the removal of SPG security cover to Gandhi family to the agenda of the ongoing nationwide protests against Modi government on economic issues.The interesting AICC directive, while reiterating the economic agenda of protest, underlined “in the meanwhile, we have also seen the vindictive action of the BJP government in the withdrawal of SPG cover to our top leaders.” The AICC has also extended by 10 days the “November 5-15 agitation”.The protests last week when the announcement of SPG removal was made, triggered criticism on social media that it dilutes the focus on “people’s issues” and blunts the sharpness of attack on BJP. The SPG row had erupted amid day-long demonstrations on economic slowdown on November 8.AICC’s formal directive to state units pointing out the Centre’s “vendetta” on SPG cover means it would be part of dharnas and press conferences being held from state to block level on economic slowdown.
