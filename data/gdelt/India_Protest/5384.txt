PM Modi appeals professionals to join 'Mai Bhi Chowkidar' campaign

New Delhi [India], Mar 24 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday invited working professionals including doctors, engineers, teachers, IT professionals and bankers to join “Mai Bhi Chowkidar” campaign.

“Dear Doctors, Lawyers, Engineers, Teachers, IT professionals and Bankers, each of you play a vital role in making our nation a better place. Your efforts ensure India is healthier, prosperous, advanced and educated, especially inviting you to join #MainBhiChowkidar programme,” said PM Modi in a tweet.
