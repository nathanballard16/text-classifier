Lawyers at all district courts boycott work

They took dates for their cases through proxy counsels

Lawyers in the Delhi High Court and all district courts in the Capital boycotted judicial work in protest against the clash between lawyers and the police in the Tis Hazari court complex on November 2.

The lawyers at six district courts here — Tis Hazari, Karkardooma, Saket, Dwarka, Rohini and Patiala House — did not participate in court proceedings, but took dates for their cases through proxy counsels.

Meanwhile, the Bar Council of India (BCI) on Monday appealed to the members of the legal fraternity to maintain peace and harmony in the courts and resume their work from Tuesday.

As per the demand of all the Bar Associations, a judicial enquiry has already been ordered by the High Court and the enquiry has to be positively concluded within a period of six weeks.

“We should not forget that six weeks time is not very long, rather for a judicial enquiry, it is quite short,” the BCI said.

The council further asked lawyers to be cautious of leaked CCTVs footage and clips that are doing the rounds on TV channels and on the socials media.

“We know that all these are being made in order to malign the image of the Bar. Overwhelming majority of members of the Bar are peace loving and law abiding citizens,” the BCI said.

It also urged lawyers “not to resort to any action that would tarnish our image and which could ultimately lead to losing the sympathy of the courts and the common people”.
