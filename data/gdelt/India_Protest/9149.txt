Balanced Supreme Court verdict on Right to Freedom and expression

Balanced Supreme Court verdict on Right to Freedom and expression

Dear Editor,

It refers to balanced Supreme Court verdict ordering release of Delhi-based journalist Prashant Kanojia from jails as Right-To-Liberty, but disapproving his highly objectionable series of tweets in name of Right-To-Freedom of Expression.

It is time that some guidelines may be framed so that defamatory and objectionable postings either on social-media or Whatsapp group may not be possible. Same may be not only for such postings regarding those on ruling side but also for those in opposition parties.

Politicians should avoid opposing those who are not followers of Mohandass Karamchand Gandhi. There is a sizable section in society including even in ruling BJP who think freedom of nation did not come from so-thought non-violent move, rather according to them British rulers left India because of tough resistance created by Azad Hind Fauz established by Subhash Chandra Bose. It is time that central government exposes those officially who did not help Shaheed Bhagatsingh, Rajguru, Sukhdev and other pre-independence martyrs in court-cases or otherwise who were hanged to death for their protest against British rulers.
