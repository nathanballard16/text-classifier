Petrol pump heist new challenge to K’jhar cops

The number of loot and dacoity cases is increasing in the mining area of Joda and Barbil in last few weeks. Criminals seem to have targeted mainly banks, ATMs and petrol pumps.

While the police are still looking for the looters involved in the Allahabad Bank loot on February 15, in yet another challenge to them, four miscreants looted Rs 38,000 cash from a Reliance Petrol Pump at Serenda on last Monday midnight.

The incident recorded on the CCTV footage shows how the miscreants entered the petrol pump at midnight barefoot and with faces covered.

First three of them entered the sales room where the sales staff and the security guards were dozing. They were taken over at gunpoint and the looters walked away with the Rs 38,000 cash from the drawer after locking the staffers in the office. They also took away their cell phones.

The Barbil police reached the spot after being informed but no one has been arrested so far. The security guard was beaten by the miscreants as he tried to oppose them.

On February 25, some dacoits broke into the Bank of India, Kandara branch under Joda police limits and attempted to break the locker but failed. The incident had happened just after some miscreants broke into a SBI ATM in Joda town and took away Rs 27,000 cash from the machine the previous night i.e on February 24. After investigations, the Joda police held four accused in the SBI ATM loot.
