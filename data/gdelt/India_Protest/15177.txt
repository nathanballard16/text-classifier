Dharamsala, September 28

The suspense over the BJP candidate from Dharamsala continued today also. Most leaders, whose names are being considered, are preparing their papers for nomination as they will have just Monday to file the papers.

Sources in the BJP said the acting president of the party JP Nadda would return to Delhi late this evening and the parliamentary board would meet tomorrow to finalise the candidate.

The sources said the party high command was likely to go with the choice of Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur.

The state election committee, on the other hand, has left it to the party high command. It has sent six or seven names. They include Rajiv Bharadwaj, KCC bank president, Sanjay Sharma, HPCA spokesperson, Rakesh Sharma, BJP media in-charge for Kangra, Sachin Sharma and Vishal Nehria, party workers.

BJP MP from Kangra Kishan Kapoor, who vacated the Dharamsala assembly seat after his election to Parliament, was also consulted by the party. Sources said he had asked the party to prefer a local candidate.

The delay in the decision has left most of the hopefuls nervous. The selected candidate will just have about 20 days to campaign and get along all splinter groups of the party along.

Though the Dharamsala bypoll is being considered tough by the BJP, the party is hopeful after AICC secretary Sudhir Sharma exit the fray. Meanwhile, the Schedule Tribe wing of the BJP held a rally in Dharamsala to galvanise the party workers. The party has been worried about the support of the Gaddis in Dharamsala if a leader from their community is not selected as candidate.

Decision today likely
