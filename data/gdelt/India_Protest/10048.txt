Madurai: In yet another case of criminal practice of untouchability, Dalits residents of a village in Madurai were barred from drawing water from a public well amidst severe drinking shortage in Tamil Nadu.

The incident happened in Kodikulam village, 10 km from Otthakadai Yanamalai.

According to a report in ANI, local residents justified restricting Dalit villagers from well arguing that the well is 'sacred' and over 150 people use it for drinking purposes.

"We worship this well and water from the well is used only for drinking purposes and not for any other purpose. We are clean when it comes to the well. Other people (Dalits) are not allowed to visit the well because they are not clean" the report quoted a local as saying.

A number of districts including state capital Chennai are facing water scarcity and the government has struggled to supply drinking water to all these areas.

Kathiravan, an official working for an NGO that works against untouchability in the state, has demanded action against the villagers.

"Untouchability is prevalent in the village of Kodikulam,10 km from Madurai. To prevent this, the Madurai District Collector should go to the Kodikulam area and inspect it immediately and take action. People who practice untouchability must be proceeded against under the SC/ST Act," Kathiravan said.

The water crisis deepened this week in Chennai after residents of Villivakkam locality in the city complained of getting sewage water in their taps. The protesting residents took to the streets demanding accountability from authorities over the issue.

The water released by hand pumps and taps was dark and muddy which looked completely unsuitable for drinking or for any other daily use.
