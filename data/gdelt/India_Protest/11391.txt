Mysuru: Nomadic families demand allotment of houses

MYSURU: Members of the Dalit Sangharsha Samiti and hundreds of nomadic families on Monday staged a protest near the DC’s office urging to allot them houses built at Ekalavya Nagar.The nomads claimed that their names have been removed from the allotment list and those houses have been allotted to families posing to be nomadic. The houses built at Ekalavya Nagar are of poor quality and action must be taken against the Karnataka Slum Development Board, the activists and protesters demanded.Speaking on how the houses were allotted to nomadic families, protesters stated that the nomadic tribes like Dombidasa, Sillekyata, Kole Basava and Hakki Pikki used to live in tents near Hebbal Lake 15 years ago, but the district administration vacated them. “The Dalit Sangharsha Samiti then protested against the administration and made sure the nomadic tribes were allotted homes. With funds of Rs 62 crore, houses were constructed at Ekalavya Nagar and a list of 354 beneficiaries was prepared. But those families which were wandering in other places were not listed. This way, deserving families have been deprived of the houses,” an activist lamented.The families demanded for allotment of houses and also to maintain cleanliness around the locality. The slum development board has lobbied with the construction of houses, necessary steps have to be taken against the board, the protesters claimed.
