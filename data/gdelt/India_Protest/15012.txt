Neutrino trends top on Twitter

THENI

In a surprise development, #SaveTheniFromNeutrino turned to be one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter on Thursday.

In the audio launch of the movie Bigil at a private college auditorium in Chennai a couple of days ago, actor Vijay had appealed to his fans to take up social causes like opposition to the neutrino project in Theni and make them trend on social media.

Hence, the actor’s fans picked up the hashtag and the social media was abuzz with it. However, at the hotspot –Pottipuram in Theni district – there is no new development about the issue currently.

Last month, Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko had announced a mega rally in Theni against the project. However, he fell sick and it was called off. A resolution was passed against the India-based Neutrino Observatory project in the gram sabha meeting at Pottipuram in July.

“The online twitter campaign against neutrino project by actor Vijay’s fans is welcome but it may just become a one-day show. Instead, we would like to see them take part in real protest on the ground as well with an in-depth knowledge about the subject,” said S.S. Ponmudi, MDMK deputy district secretary.
