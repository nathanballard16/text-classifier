OPDs To Remain Shut In India on July 31

New Delhi: OPDs in government hospitals across the country will be shut on Wednesday as part of protests against the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill which doctors say will encourage quacks.

As a mark of protest against the Bill which was passed in the Lok Sabha on Monday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has called for a nationwide 24-hour withdrawal of non-essential services. Demonstrations and hunger strikes will be held in all states. The IMA has asked medical students to boycott classes in solidarity. The Federation of Resident Doctors Association (FORDA) and the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), AIIMS, have asked members to wear black badges. “The Bill if not amended will only lead to a deterioration in the standards in medical education but will also lead to degradation of healthcare services,” an RDA statement said.
