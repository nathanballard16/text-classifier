Cordite Factory workers continue strike

Production lines at the armaments factory in Aravankadu, Coonoor, were halted, as the complete shutdown of the factory due to workers’ strike continued for the fourth consecutive day on Friday. More than 2,000 workers at the Cordite Factory struck work on Friday, protesting plans by the Central government to “corporatise” armaments factories across India.

A member of the Joint Action Committee at the factory said that the factory had been completely shut down since August 20, and that production had been scaled back to zero, due to the strike. “Thousands of employees will lose their jobs, and also the benefits to which they are entitled to if the government’s plans come to fruition,” said the member.

Starting from Friday, a relay hunger strike has also begun, with nine workers protesting outside the gates.

The protesters said that at present, there were 2,000 permanent employees and 300 contract workers employed at the factory, many of whom had been employed for decades. The strike was part of a nationwide strike initiated at more than 40 armaments factories. Factory officials were unavailable for comment.
