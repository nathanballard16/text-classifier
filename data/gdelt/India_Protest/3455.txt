Hema Malini on Pulwama attack: I'm sure PM will take firm decision

Veteran actress and BJP MP Hema Malini has condemned the terror attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir. She says she is confident that Prime Minister Narendra Modi will take a firm decision to curb anti-national activities in the Kashmir valley. Hema spoke on the sidelines of a screening of her daughter Esha's short film "Cakewalk" here. Asked about the measures she expects from the Modi-led government after the terror attack, Hema said: "I am sure that he will take a very firm decision. I am very happy that I am a Member of Parliament from Mathura under his regime as a Prime Minister. I know that he will be taking a very wonderful decision with respect to how to face these terror attacks." The Maharashtra police on Saturday baton-charged a group of people who were protesting against the Pulwama terror attack at Nalasopara station in Palghar district of Maharashtra. Police had to resort to the lathi-charge in order to evacuate the rail tracks as attempts to talk to the protesting group had failed.
