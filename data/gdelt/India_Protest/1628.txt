Anand Sharma’s threat to officers shows ‘mentality of Congress’, says Sambit Patra

New Delhi, Jan 25 (ANI): Speaking on CBI raids on BS Hooda’s residence, Congress leader Anand Sharma in a press conference alerted the authorities that “governments are not permanent” and agency officials will be taken to task after government changes. Countering his statement, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said that the way Anand Sharma has “threatened” the officers showed the “mentality” of Congress party. “The way Anand Sharma has threatened that officers should stop working against corruption shows the mentality of Congress party. This shows that Congress wants to save corruption. Whenever they don’t get satisfactory verdict from SC they say they’ll impeach CJI,” Patra told ANI.
