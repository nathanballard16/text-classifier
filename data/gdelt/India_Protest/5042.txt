BJP in danger, not India, says Farooq Abdullah

‘Party practising politics of hate, mistrust’

National Conference president Farooq Abdullah on Sunday said the BJP was creating a fear psychosis across the country “by crying hoarse over the nation being in danger”.

“India is not in danger, it is the BJP that is in danger due to rug slipping from under the feet of the Prime Minister ahead of general election,” said Dr. Abdullah in his public address in Jammu.

He said the politics of hate and mistrust was being perpetrated and practised by the BJP. “This is against the very idea of India. Instead of dividing the people in the name of religion, caste and region, everyone should be treated as a compatriot, which alone can lead the country to progress and harmony,” he added.

Referring to air strikes, Dr. Abdullah said: “It was a selective outrage. Similar concern and anguish should have been demonstrated over the killing of security forces in Maoist violence in Chhattisgarh and elsewhere. Nobody from the Centre even visited those martyrs.”

He said Mr. Modi used to censure the Centre as the Chief Minister of Gujarat on the rising prices and growing unemployment, “but now he has no answers or explanations to offer to the people”.
