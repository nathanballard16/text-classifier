Karni Sena Denies Involvement In Manikarnika Protests After Kangana Threatens To 'Destroy' Them

After the Padmaavat fiasco last year, it was reported that Karni Sena was protesting against the release of Kangana Ranaut starrer Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi.

According to a report in ANI, the Maharashtra Karni Sena wrote a letter to the director, producers and writers of Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and warned them that if the movie distorts history or shows Rani Laxmi Bai as the lover of a Britisher, they will have to bear the dire consequences.

Reacting to the same and revealing how the Karni Sena has been harassing her, Kangana Ranaut said that she is a Rajput too, and if the Karni Sena will continue to harass her, she will “destroy each one of them”.

In a shocking development, now Karni Sena has refuted the claims made by Kangana Ranaut that the group is opposing the release of the biopic on the freedom fighter. Dr Himanshu, Karni Sena’s national spokesperson and ex-major rubbished the reports and said that group’s name is being used for personal vested interests.

“We are not opposing 'Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi' till we don't have anything substantial from the family, region or the community. These people, I believe, are using the name of Karni Sena for their own vested interests and they are bringing disrepute to Karni Sena and to the historical characters,” Himanshu was quoted as saying by IANS.

“We disown and completely dissociate ourselves" from all such claims, he said adding, “Supposedly, the family has a problem. They can come to us and if they seek support from us and have a valid reason (we will take it in consideration)... I was in Jhansi recently and nobody said anything of this nature.”

"First and foremost, we should be clear which Karni Sena (has protested). Anybody who pops up and says 'I am Karni Sena', cannot be Karni Sena," said the Karni Sena spokesperson.
