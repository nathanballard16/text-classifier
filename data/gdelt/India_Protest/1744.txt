Students protest against AU’s exam regulations

Coimbatore: About 100 members of Students’ Federation of India (SFI) from 12 city-based technical institutions on Monday staged a protest in front of the regional campus of Anna University at Navavoor near the city seeking that the exam regulations of 2017 be withdrawn. “If a student fails in a paper in a particular semester, he can’t write the arrear exam in the next semester, but have to wait for a year to write it. This is putting immense stress on the students,” SFI district president M Dhinesh Raja said.TNN
