Teacher fired for WhatsApp status

JORHAT/DIBRUGARH: An assistant teacher of Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya in Jorhat has been fired for using a slogan against the new citizenship law as her WhatsApp status and allegedly “guiding” her students during a protest on campus.Bandita Borah on Thursday received support from the All Assam Students Union (Aasu) and Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad, both of which demanded that she be reinstated within 24 hours.“I had voiced my opposition to the CAA through my WhatsApp status. I was also beside students when they staged a protest against the Act after morning prayers. A colleague insulted us by saying that anti-CAA agitators were uneducated people. I, along with the students, compelled him to apologise. The school authorities subsequently issued a termination letter to me,” Bandita, who teaches computer science , told TOI.She said losing her job was a price she was willing to pay for standing up to the legislation. “I am ready to face any kind of punishment for my stand on CAA. My protest will continue.”Diganta Borah, general secretary of Aasu’s Titabor unit, said his organisation met the principal of the school to protest against the assistant teacher's dismissal from service just because of her stand on CAA. "We requested him to reinstate her by Friday. The principal admitted that a teacher of the chemistry department had made disparaging remarks about anti-CAA agitators and later apologised."The principal was unavailable for comment.Meanwhile, a large crowd turned up in Jorhat from across the district on Thursday to join Aasu’s anti-CAA agitation. In Dibrugarh , where BJP MLAs had borne the brunt of vandalism and arson in the initial days of the agitation, state party president Ranjeet Kumar Dass was greeted with black flags and “go-back” slogans on his way to a meeting. BJP supporters and the protesters almost came to blows before police and CRPF personnel stepped in.
