Odisha: Board of Secondary Education matric exam from February 19

CUTTACK: The annual High School Certificate (HSC) examination will be held from February 19 to March 2, 2020.Ramashis Hajra, president of the Board of Secondary Education (BSE), made the announcement on Tuesday. Apart from the matriculation examination, the Odisha State Open School Certificate, Madhyama Sanskrit and Class IX vocational examinations would be held simultaneously, he added.Hajra said the matriculation examination would be held across 3,000 centres in the state from 10 am to 12:30 pm. Students will get extra 15 minutes for the mathematics papers.Around six lakh students are likely to appear for the HSC examination though the final figure is yet to be known because the registration process is still on.The BSE has taken steps to prevent question papers from getting leaked. Last year, question papers of many subjects had gone viral.“There will be a secret security code on question papers. The details will be stored by the BSE. If anyone tries to leak the paper, the centre will immediately know and can identify the person doing it. Action will be taken. We are hopeful that nothing of this sort will happen this year,” Hajra said.Hajra added that a team of officials would be engaged for carrying out the procedure to enable the secret security code. “The data will be stored in advance at the BSE and be monitored from here,” he said.Invigilators have been asked not to carry mobile phones inside examination centres. All examination centres in the state will be under CCTV surveillance.A central control room will be established at the BSE office here for monitoring the examination centres through CCTVs. “We can keep a watch on the activities of all students and invigilators during the examinations,” the BSE chief said.
