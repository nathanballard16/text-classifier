New Delhi: Amid massive nation-wide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad on Saturday appealed to the Muslims of the country to show restraint and do not indulge in any kind of violence. He then accused political parties of misleading the youth about the CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC).

While speaking to media, Jawad explained that CAA and NRC are two different things and that the NRC has been implemented in Assam only, not across the country. He went on to add that we don't know what rules are going to be in the pan India NRC and political parties are unnecessarily trying to create confusion. "I appeal to the Muslims to show restraint," said the Shia cleric.

Earlier this week, a faction of Jamiat Ulema-i-Hindi filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging the contentious citizenship law. In a statement, Jamiat's Maulana Arshad Madani had said, "CAA violates the basic values of the Constitution. The Act is prepared on the basis of religious discrimination and prejudice. Therefore, it must be invalidated."

Massive protests have erupted across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Hundreds of people have been detained and arrested in the wake of the protests while section 144 has been imposed and internet services have been shut in several districts to curb the protests.

Meanwhile, the Central government has released statements explaining no Indian citizen will be harassed during the CAA and NRC exercise. The government has iterated that the CAA is all about giving citizenship to people, not take it away from them.
