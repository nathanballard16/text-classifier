Amit Shah cancels visit to Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh amid CAB uproar

Home Minister Amit Shah has cancelled his visit to two Northeastern states -- Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh -- on Sunday and Monday amid protests against Citizenship Amendment Act.

The cancellation comes amidst widespread protests in Assam and Meghalaya against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.

Sources said the home minister's visit to the Northeastern region has been cancelled, without citing any reason.

Home Minister Amit Shah was supposed to take part in the passing out parade at the North Eastern Police Academy near Shillong on Sunday and a festival in Tawang on Monday.

Protests in various Northeastern states erupted soon after the Parliament gave its nod to the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, that aims to provide Indian citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Christians, Buddhist, Jains and Parsis from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, who arrived in India before December 31, 2014.

Earlier this week, 125 lawmakers voted in favour of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and 99 against it. On Thursday night, President Ram Nath Kovind gave his assent to the Bill, turning it into an Act.

Soon after the passage of the Bill, Army deployment surged in Assam.

Curfew was imposed in Dibrugarh district for an indefinite period on Wednesday as protesters targeted the houses of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.
