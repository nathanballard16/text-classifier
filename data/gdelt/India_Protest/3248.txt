Many more Indian students fear being trapped, detained

Thousands of Indian students are counting their days of stay in the United States, spending sleepless nights as they fear they could be “trapped” and detained anytime by the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) authorities for alleged immigration frauds.These are mostly students who have enrolled in their second master’s degree, after completing their first master’s, to get curricular practical training (CPT), which makes overseas students eligible for employment training and for work in paid internship positions, even as they wait for a chance to be picked up for H-1B visas Almost all of the students caught through a sting operation, conducted by the US federal police to uncover alleged “payto-stay” scam at the phony University of Farmington, at January-end are Indians, mostly hailing from the two Telugu speaking states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Out of the 146 students detained so far, 145 are Indians and about 140 are from these two states.Indian student associations in the US suspect more such “entrapments” are likely and that thousands of Indian students could face the threat of being trapped, detained and deported, even as these associations are trying to help detained students with legal and financial aid.“During the last fortnight, we found that there are two-three more universities akin to the University of Farmington, with similar descriptions of course offerings and flexible class schedules, apparently enticing international students looking to continue their stay in the US,” said Sagar Doddapaneni, media coordinator at Fremont, California-based Andhra Pradesh Non-Resident Telugu (APNRT) Society.“We suspect more skeletons could roll out and more international students could be trapped and detained as the US immigration sleuths are reportedly looking at more sting operations .”US authorities suspect that thousands of Indians have been staying and working in the country on the pretext of studying at such seemingly legitimate universities that offer proof of full-time enrolment.Many Indian students, cautioned through a series of awareness programmes organised by Telugu associations with the help of attorneys, are gradually trying to figure out such entrapments and to move out of such sham universities before they are slapped with charges of immigration violations, said Parmesh Bheemreddy, president of American Telugu Association (ATA).“We are hearing that a few more for-profit-universities with similar lures may have been set up, primarily to target gullible Indian students. We are trying to identify such universities and reach out to Telugu students to help them avert immigration violations.” Nearly 200,000 Indian students are currently pursuing master’s courses in the US and at least 25,000 Indian students are estimated to have enrolled in a second master’s with CPT facility from day one, said Bheemreddy.Sreedhar Nagireddi, external affairs director at North American Telugu Association (NATA), said association members found some universities of dubious credentials set up recently, making them suspect that these universities could also have been set-up by the ICE to entrap foreign students.Referring to a university floated in Florida region last year, he said, “Google maps show that the university is in an industrial complex with less than 1,000 sq ft space and not much parking space. No real university operates like that.”According to New York-based attorney Prashanthi Reddy, while the University of Farmington was set up by the ICE under a sting operation in 2015 to enrol students, coincidentally a lot of independent universities lost their accreditation around that time and a large number of students moved to the University of Farmington finding everything seemingly okay given the accreditations.“I think ICE should have more pressing priorities instead of trying to trap the students to commit a crime and then arresting them,” she said, “ICE should have gone after the universities that were violating regulations instead of setting up a university to entrap students.”Sridhar Reddy Korsapati, president of NATA, said options were being weighed in active consultations with attorneys to challenge “entrapment” by ICE officials and to rescue “innocent” Indian students.Several interactive sessions with the attorneys are being organised across the US to help Indian students with necessary legal aid, he said.Sting operation is a legal and familiar practice in the US used by the federal police to catch violators through baits, said senior software professional Narasimha Reddy from the Bay area, “The recruiters are being charged with criminal felony while the students are likely to be slapped with civil charges and asked to leave the country with a ban of specified period to return to the US,” he said.The ICE public affairs officer, Carissa Cutrell, said in interactions with the media that the detained students failed to maintain non-immigrant status and participated in unauthorised CPT, while challenging the argument of entrapment by the attorneys representing the detained students.The feds had set up fake universities in the past as well to weed out visa frauds, arguing that “pay-to-stay” was a national security threat. In April 2016, immigration officials charged about 21 persons with recruiting international students at the made-up University of Northern New Jersey.The root cause of the problem, according to Parmesh Bheemreddy of ATA, lies in mushrooming of substandard engineering colleges back home in India “Thousands of shoddy engineering colleges in India produce lakhs of below average engineering graduates every year who find it difficult to get decent jobs, forcing them to look at countries like the US for jobs.”Some representatives of the Telugu associations privately admitted that Indian students should have been more cautious and done more due diligence before getting lured by sham universities that offered flexible courses with CPT benefits from day one.“Greed for money and false social prestige back home in India that entails better matches with attractive dowry and wealth are some of the key reasons behind the ‘entrapped’ students taking well-informed risk. There are enough clues to figure out that something is fishy with many universities like the University of Farmington,” said Sushmitha, a North Carolina-based software engineer.“I have some cousins who weren’t interested in US studies and jobs but were compelled by their parents citing examples of ‘well-settled’ kids of relatives and neighbours earning huge amounts in dollars.”Bheemreddy, however, said , “International students, who are precious assets for the US and contributed immensely to its economy, shouldn’t be treated like criminals locked up in detention centres.Indian government representatives should speak to their US counterparts to ensure that the students are released from detention centres at the earliest.Citing data compiled by NAFSA, the world’s largest non-profit association dedicated to international education and exchange, he said that 1,094,792 international students studying at US colleges and universities contributed $39 billion and supported more than 455,000 jobs in the US economy during the 2017-2018 academic year.Congress party’s national spokesman Sravan Dasoju appealed to the US Consul General in Hyderabad, Katherine B Hadda, on Thursday to speak to the US government and help rescue the students from detention centres immediately. He also urged the Indian government to assist the detained students for transition back to normal life through financial and legal help.The government, on its part, last week announced that it would extend necessary support to the detained Indian students, while the Andhra Pradesh government has instructed its US-based residents associations to extend both legal and financial aid to the detained students.Besides, Andhra Pradesh proposed to extend IT training to the students returning to India, at the International Skills Development Centre in Amaravati, to help them get suitable jobs.Out of nearly 600 students enrolled in the University of Farmington, around 400 students reportedly returned to India immediately after learning about the crackdown by US officials. While nearly 146 students were arrested and locked up in more than 30 detention centres across the US, the hunt is on to nab the others who are absconding.So far, only a few dozen students have managed to come out of detention centres after judges granted them voluntary departures while directing them to leave the country by February 26. Many students have been told that hearing in their cases would be held in March or April.Most of the detained students are likely to be directed to leave the US and their entry to the country banned for a specified time while the eight recruiters named in the charge sheet could be prosecuted for criminal felony.“While voluntary departure entails three years of ban, with the students needing to buy their tickets to return to their native countries, deportation prescribes a 10-year ban where the US government will bear the expense of tickets for students to return to their home countries,” said Sreedhar Nagireddi of NATA.“In case of release on bail bond, with amounts ranging from $4,000-25,000, the person can stay back in the US and fight the case, which may take two to four years, while ICE officers hold their passports.”
