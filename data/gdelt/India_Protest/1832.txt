Sindh doctors' strike continues for third day

KARACHI: Doctors in government hospitals across Sindh continued their strike for a third straight day on Wednesday, despite the provincial government accepting their demands to raise their pay and allowances.



The protesting doctors said they want the Sindh government to issue a notification for the raise, or they will continue their strike.

On January 28, doctors across the province went on a strike to protest for a raise in their salaries and allowances. On Tuesday, reports emerged that the Sindh government and the protesting doctors had reached an agreement, allowing a raise of Rs25,000 to Rs75,000. A summary in this regard was approved by the Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah.

The call for the strike was given by the Pakistan Medical Association to demand the same perks enjoyed by doctors in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

The outpatient departments in government hospitals across the province including Hyderabad and other cities remained closed today, with patients facing difficulties as the doctors' strike continued despite an appeal by Sindh Health Minister Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho asking the doctors to end their protests.
