BHU Students Stage Protest Against Appointment Of Muslim Professor In Sanskrit Faculty

New Delhi:

The students of the Banaras Hindu University staged a protest against the appointment of Muslim professor in the literature department of the Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vijnan. The protest began on November 7 against the appointment of 29-year old Feroz Khan in Sanskrit Department of the university. However, the Banaras Hindu University on Friday backed the appointment of professor in the Sanskrit faculty, and clarified that it is committed to provide equal opportunities to everyone irrespective of religion, caste, community or gender.

The clarification comes after the RSS students' wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) opposed the appointment of Firoz Khan as an assistant professor in the Sanskrit literature department.

The BHU administration issued a statement in which it said that the selection committee recommended the selection of the said candidate on the basis of prescribed guidelines of the University Grants Commission and the central government.

Some students have been staging a sit-in outside the vice chancellor’s office against the selection of Khan in the Sahitya department of the Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vijnan (SVDV). Rajasthan-born Khan studied at the Jaipur campus of the Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan, which is a deemed university under the Ministry of Human Resource Development, reports The Indian Express.

Moreover, the vice chancellor assured the students that the administration is committed to achieve the objectives of the university in providing equal educational and teaching opportunities to everyone irrespective of religion, caste, community or gender. On the other hand, expressing their apprehensions, students said that a non-Hindu should not teach them religion.
