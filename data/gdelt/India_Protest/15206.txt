Noida: Cops in Lotus society as residents protest upkeep

NOIDA: About 100 residents of Lotus Espacia society in Sector 100 had a heated exchange with officials of the maintenance agency over the appointment of a new security agency.Members of the apartment owners’ association alleged that despite an order in July by the Noida Authority to hand over the charge of maintenance to the association, the builder had refused to do so.Residents said despite regularly paying the maintenance fee, the developer had not bothered to pay water and power bills. According to a notice issued by the jal department to Cloud 09 projects, the builder has water dues to the tune of Rs 88 lakh till July 31, 2019. The flat owners said the builder owed lakhs of rupees in electricity dues and they had been facing long outages over the past few days. The residents had also complained about a non-functional STP in the society, following which the builder had been fined Rs 18 lakh by the UP pollution control board.“Between July and September, we had approached the Sector 39 police multiple times to ensure the responsibility of maintenance is handed over to us, as directed by the Authority. But our complaint was never taken. On September 27, too, we informed police, but to no avail,” said Pawan Ghavri, executive board member of the AOA.On Sunday, residents gathered outside the maintenance agency’s office and reiterated their demands. The flat owners alleged that the agency — Gravity — had hired bouncers to prevent them from entering the office.As the situation heated up, police personnel came to the society in four vehicles and persuade the agency to hand over the maintenance charge to the residents in keeping with Noida Authority’s order.Captain Hemant Rudra, general secretary of the AOA, said the developer had been absconding since June 2018 and the facility management of 3C company had deserted the complex in June this year.Senior sub-inspector Sudhir Kumar Singh of Sector 39 police station said the builder had approached the high court against the AOA, but did not get a decision in its favour.Neeraj Sharma, estate manager of Gravity, said they had handed over all maintenance responsibilities to the residents.TOI had reported that three directors of 3C company, which owns the Lotus brand, were arrested by Delhi Police for alleged funds diversion.
