SAD leaders stage protest as cops detain party workers

Ludhiana: The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) leaders staged a protest in Model Town after the police detained Akali Dal workers following the firing incident during Youth Congress elections. But the protest — which was led by senior Akali leader Harbhajan Singh Dang, YAD district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha, Surinder Kaur Dyal, and Kuldeep Singh Khalsa — ended after the police released the detained Akali Dal workers.

Dang and Gosha said a meeting of Akali Dal was organised in Model Town gurdwara, and after the Youth Congress (YC) workers resorted to violence following a firing incident during the Punjab YC polls, the police detained SAD workers. Gosha said instead of taking action against YC workers for firing and violence, the police detained SAD workers who came to attend their party meeting. He added that it was after their strong protest that the police released five party workers.
