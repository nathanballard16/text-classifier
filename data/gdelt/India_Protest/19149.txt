Former BHU VC: Stir against Khan unconstitutional

Varanasi: Former vice-chancellor of Banaras Hindu University Prof YC Simhadri has termed protests against the appointment of Dr Feroz Khan as assistant professor in Sahitya department of faculty of Sanskrit Vidya Dharm Vigyan (SVDV) as unconstitutional. In a letter to President Ram Nath Kovind, Prof Simhadri said it was disheartening to see protests against a meritorious young scholar who was unanimously selected and recommended by a group of experts.

“Misguided protests are challenging the legitimate authority of a central university like BHU. The agitation is not only illegal but also affects academic atmosphere. It is not in the interest of the university, public and entire academic system,” Prof Simhadri said.

“Central universities function according to the Constitution of India and hence protests against the appointment are unconstitutional. Central universities are autonomous bodies and their selection committees also enjoy autonomy. The protest amounts to questioning BHU’s autonomy,” he said.

He said India had ancient ethos which taught us to respect all religions, people and groups. “BHU, which was established by Mahamana Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya for nation-building and national integration, must uphold the core Indian ethos and values,” he said. Prof Simhadri has also served as vice-chancellor of Andhra University, Acharya Nagarjuna University, Patna University (two terms), and Institute of Constitutional and Parliamentary Studies (ICPS).
