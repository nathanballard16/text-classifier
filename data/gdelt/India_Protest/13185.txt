MP: Driver-partners protest against app-based cab companies

Police on Monday foiled an apparent suicide bid by an office-bearer of an association of driver-partners of app-based cab companies who tried to set himself on fire and lathicharged protesters.

The incident occurred in the district collectorate campus here in Madhya Pradesh during an agitation against the policies of these companies, which they alleged are against the interests of the driver-partners.

According to eye-witnesses, Indore E-Cab Drivers' Federation president Inder Singh Yadav allegedly doused himself with kerosene.

However, police overpowered him before he could take any drastic step and lathicharged other protesters.

A police official said appropriate legal steps are being taken in connection with the protest.

Protesters alleged that app-based cab companies are ignoring their legitimate interests by charging hefty commission on every booking from car and auto-rickshaw owners, which is eroding their profits.
