Rajnath calls West Bengal CM, expresses concern over violence near Amit Shah rally

New Delhi [India], Jan 29 (ANI): Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday called up West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and expressed serious concern over reports of violence near the venue of the rally of BJP President Amit Shah.

The public rally was addressed by Shah in East Midnapore district.

Citing reports of large scale violence and arson against people who participated in the rally, the Home Minister also asked the Chief Minister that those indulging in violence should be brought to book.

The vehicles used for ferrying audience for Shah’s rally in East Midnapore on Tuesday were vandalised by some miscreants when these were parked outside the rally venue.

BJP supporters also staged a demonstration, condemning the attack on the parked vehicles. Police said the miscreants lobbed stones on the vehicles and also torched some vehicles.

Following the attacks, BJP had accused West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of unleashing ‘terror’ in the state and called her ‘Talibani Didi.’

“We have seen as to how very worried Mamata Banerjee has unleashed the terror of TMC on the BJP and the ordinary people of West Bengal,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra told reporters in New Delhi. (ANI)
