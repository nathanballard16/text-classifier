The turnouts were lower compared with 2014 in most of the 13 Uttar Pradesh seats that voted on Monday, repeating a pattern seen during last year’s by-elections when the BJP lost Gorakhpur, Phulpur and Kairana. The turnouts fell in Kannauj (57 per cent from 63), Shahjahanpur (51 from 57), Misrikh (56 from 57), Jhansi (62 from 68), Kanpur (50 from 52), Farrukhabad (56 from 60), Akbarpur (53 from 55), Kheri (62 from 64) and Jalaun (55 from 59). Etawah, Hardoi, Hamirpur and Unnao, though, recorded almost the same polling percentage as five years ago.
