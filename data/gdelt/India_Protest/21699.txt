Indian State Chief Equates Police Crackdown on Students to Jallianwala Bagh under British Regime

The excessive actions of police against students left 100 of them injured, while 35 policemen were also hurt. The incident had a cascading effect, with students at several premier universities across India hitting the streets in solidarity with their counterparts of Jamia Millia University since Sunday 15 December.

Chief Minister of India's western Maharashtra, Uddhav Thakeray said the incident reminded him of the massacre of innocents holed up in Jallianwala Bagh in northern Punjab, where more than 1500 innocents fell to British troops' bullets on the orders of Brigadier-General Dyer in 1913.

Thackeray's regional nationalist Shiv Sena was a long-term ally of India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party until they parted ways in November over differences on power-sharing in the state, after a fractured verdict in elections to the state legislature.
