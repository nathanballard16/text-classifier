Bihar's grand alliance to announce seat sharing for Lok Sabha election on March 18

PATNA: The much-awaited seat-sharing for the coming Lok Sabha election among allies of opposition’s grand alliance in Bihar has been finalised and it would now be formally announced on March 18 at a joint press conference by GA leaders in the state capital here.Earlier, the joint press conference was scheduled to be held in Patna on March 17 (Sunday). But the GA leaders on Saturday decided to defer it by a day as the major allies- RJD and Congress- remained busy giving final touches to the seat-sharing deal. Bihar has 40 Lok Sabha seats.“The joint press conference will now be held on March 18 in the state capital here. At the press conference, we will give you the number of seats allotted to different allies. The name of the Lok Sabha constituencies allotted to different allies may also be provided,” State Congress president Madan Mohan Jha told TOI on Saturday.Earlier, Congress in-charge for Bihar Shakti Sinh Gohil informed TOI that RJD leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav had been authorised to brief media about the seat-sharing deal in Bihar and he (Tejashwi) would address a joint press conference over the issue alongwith the State Congress chief Jha and senior leaders of other allies of the grand alliance.Besides the RJD and Congress, Bihar’s grand alliance comprises former union minister Upendra Kushwaha ’s RLSP, former CM Jitan Ram Manjhi ’s Hindustani Awam Morcha-Secular (HAM-S), Sharad Yadav’s Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and the Vikashsheel Insaan Party (VIP) of former Bollywood set designer Mukesh Sahni.“Tejashwi today telephoned Manjhi Ji and informed him about the rescheduling of the Joint press conference by a day. Later, Manjhi Ji informed me that the joint press conference would now be held on March 18,” Jha told TOI.“We will announce our seat sharing for Lok Sabha election on March 18 at any cost,” Majhi told reporters after a meeting of his party’s parliamentary board in the day.As per the seat-sharing agreement reached among the GA allies, Lalu Prasad’s RJD would contest 20 seats, Congress-11, RLSP- three, HAM(S)- two, LJD-one and the VIP-one. Remaining two seats have been left either for the Left parties or Samajwadi Party or any influential candidate(s) who comes from the rival NDA fold after denial of tickets, a senior GA leader who didn’t want to be identified told TOI.He also hinted that if former union minister Sharad Yadav agrees to contest on the symbol of the RJD from Madhepura or any other seat, the number of seats allotted to the RJD would increase.Other sources in the GA said, though the number of seats have been finalised the RJD and the Congress might swap some seats after announcement of name of candidates by the rival NDA camp.Sources said, Tejashwi on Saturday held another round of parleys with GA leaders on issue of finalisation of names of the Lok Sabha seats.In the meantime, senior Congress leader and Katihar MP Tariq Anwar and the nationalist Congress Party (NCP) general secretary D P Tripathi on Saturday called on jailed RJD chief Lalu Prasad at the Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi to seek his blessings for the Lok Sabha elections.After meeting Lalu, Tripathi told reporters that the NCP would give its candidate from Katihar seat and one Shakur Ahmad would be its nominee for the coming Lok Sabha election.Former Bihar minister Ramai Ram, who is keen to contest from Hajipur (SC) seat as the grand alliance nominee, also sought appointment to meet Lalu on Saturday, but the RJD chief declined to meet him.
