Tribal students of Samras hostels start hunger strike at VNSGU

SURAT: A large number of tribal students from Surat and Tapi residing at Samras hostel blocks, run by state government’s tribal development department, have taken to the streets on Friday evening to protest the management’s inhuman treatment and lack of basic facilities in the hostels.Students first gathered at the VNSGU campus and then moved out of it on service road portion of Udhna–Magdalla road near the University campus.Students had earlier informed the authorities that they will begin their strike at 7 pm on Friday. However, prior to that admission of two students, who were seen to be spearheading the agitation, were cancelled by the authorities. They are Ranjit Vasava and Vishal Padvi , both LLB students and living in the boys hostel.One of the students whose admission is cancelled said, “We all have decided to stay put here and start hunger strike and till the management comes here and listens to our genuine demands and fulfils them, we will continue with our agitation.”Located in Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) campus, the Samras hostels have two nine storyed blocks. Nearly 1,000 boys live in one block, while same number of girls live in the other. All the students hail from socially and economically backward families coming from towns and villages of Suart, Tapi and Navsari districts.“We have been demanding reasonable quality food, regular water supply, running water in the taps and the washrooms, etc. However, every time we were silenced with promises but nothing more was done,” said a student, who didn’t want to be named for fear of being thrown out of the hostel.He further said that their warden, Anju Kapadia, doesn’t stay on the campus but visits the hostel once a week and threatened the students of dismissal if they voice their angst. “How can we live in such inhuman conditions in a city like Surat?” the student lamented.
