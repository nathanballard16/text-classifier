Doctors’ strike enters sixth day

Patient services unaffected: health department sources

TIRUCHI

Doctors belonging to the Federation of Government Doctors' Association (FOGDA) staged a protest outside the KAP Viswanatham Government Medical College as the strike entered sixth day on Wednesday.

However, all services at the government hospitals and primary health centres were unaffected, Health department sources said.

The Dynamic Assured Career Progression ( DACP) scheme, introduced over 10 years ago has not been implemented for government doctors.

“We have been putting forth our demands to the government for the last two years. Due to lack of response, we have decided to protest. Even then, we have not let our strike affect patient services. All doctors at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are working without signing for the day,” said a doctor from the department of physiology, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital.

“We have been protesting since July. In August, the government asked us to suspend the protest and promised that a viable solution would be given in six weeks. However, it has been nearly two months but they are yet to respond,” the doctor said.

A. Thangavel, District Organiser, FOGDA, told The Hindu that the members of Service Doctors and Postgraduates Association, Tamil Nadu Medical Officers Association, and Democratic Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association, took part in the strike demanding pay parity, 50% State-wise reservation for PG courses for government doctors, correction of all discrepancies in the government order implementing the staffing pattern to the hospitals (the number of doctors is based on Medical Council of India guidelines and not the number of patient admissions), and regular counselling for PG students.
