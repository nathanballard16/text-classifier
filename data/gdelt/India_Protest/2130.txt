BJP to approach EC against Mamata Govt for blocking its rallies

New Delhi: A delegation of senior BJP leaders will meet the Chief Election Commissioner on Monday to complain about the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government for blocking rallies of BJP leaders.

Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman will reportedly be a part of the delegation along with other senior leaders of the party.

Earlier today, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath was denied permission to land his chopper in West Bengal to conduct two rallies in North Dinajpur district’s Raiganj and in South Dinajpur district’s Balurghat as part of the “Gantantra Bachao” (Save Democracy) campaign. Later he addressed the rally in Raiganj over the phone from Lucknow.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday kick-started the BJP’s campaign in West Bengal for the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections with two rallies, in Thakurnagar and Durgapur.

The BJP has been accusing the ruling Trinamool Congress of West Bengal of targeting and killing its cadres in the state.

Earlier in this week, vehicles used to ferry audience for BJP chief Amit Shah’s rally in East Midnapore were vandalised by miscreants.

The state government had even raised apprehensions that law and order would be compromised and communal harmony would be disturbed if the BJP were allowed to hold ‘Rath Yatras’ in the state.

Later, the Supreme Court allowed the BJP to hold rallies across West Bengal.
