CS assures steps to rectify goof-up in Inter results

Hyderabad: Chief Secretary S K Joshi here on Tuesday said the State government has taken a serious view of the irregularities in the Intermediate Public Examination results. The Chief Secretary's assurance came when the State BJP president K Laxman met him in the Secretariat here to highlight the irregularities that crept into the Intermediate results.

Addressing media after meeting the Chief Secretary, Laxman said the TSBIE had goofed-up Intermediate results, leaving thousands of students in the lurch. Nearly 16 students in the State had so far ended their lives after the declaration of results.

The CS had given a patient hearing and said that this was the first time that the State was witnessing such happening in the aftermath of the declaration of results. He also promised to take stringent action those responsible, he said.

Meanwhile, students from the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) tried to lay siege to the house of the State Education Minister G Jagadish Reddy at the Minister's quarters in the afternoon. The police intervened and foiled the bid to stage a protest by the students.
