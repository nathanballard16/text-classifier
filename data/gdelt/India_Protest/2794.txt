Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu launched his day-long fast at Andhra Bhavan in New Delhi on Monday, demanding special status for the state and fulfillment of promises made by the Centre at the time of state’s bifurcation.

Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat and garlanded the statue of Dr. BR Ambedkar in the morning before beginning his daylong hunger strike.

Naidu will submit a memorandum to President Ramnath Kovind on February 12, seeking justice for his state.

Andhra Pradesh ministers, TDP lawmakers, MPs, state legislators and leaders of students and employees’ groups and mass organisations would join the fast.
