Irked over ticket denial to Ballia MP, BJP workers stage demonstration

Varanasi: Irked over the denial of ticket to incumbent MP from Ballia, Bharat Singh, scores of his supporters staged a demonstration at the party office in Ballia on Wednesday. They urged the BJP leadership for a rethink.“BJP fielded Bhadohi MP Virendra Singh from Ballia replacing Bharat Singh for 2019 Lok Sabha elections. It is Singh, who won in 2014 polls with a margin of over one lakh votes and opened BJP’s account in this citadel of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar,” said Gama Singh, the local representative of Bharat Singh, who could not be contacted despite repeated efforts.He said that there must be some misleading feedback to the party leadership for replacement of Singh. We will continue to raise our voice until the party leadership changes this decision, he said adding that Singh strengthened party’s base in Ballia.Ballia had been represented eight times by Chandra Shekhar since 1977 to 2004 except 1984 when Jagannath Chowdhary of Congress won the seat. The seat went to his son Neeraj Shekhar, who contested on SP ticket and registered his victory in 2007 and 2009. Before Chandra Shekhar era, Ballia had a mixed poll results in favour of different parties including Socialist Party, Congress, and Communist Party of India.
