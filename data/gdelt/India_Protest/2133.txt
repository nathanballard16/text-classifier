Protest held against Left-leaning bias of Twitter, Facebook

Fighting for Right to Freedom of Speech, hundreds of members from the Youth for Social Media Democracy (YSMD) on Sunday staged a protest against the micro-blogging site, Twitter at its Delhi office. The agitating protesters demanded the Twitter and Facebook to curb the biasness before the Lok Sabha elections.

“The main aim behind this project is to create awareness about the biasness of Twitter before Lok Sabha elections. It has been witnessed that in the past few months, the social media networking sites Twitter and Facebook are systematically trying to curb the freedom of speech of individuals and citizens especially those who likes and subscribe the non-Left-wing ideology by suspending their handles, restricting their reach and removing trends from the trends list,” said a member of the wing.

The members also added that the Twitter has become so biased. While, the site (Twitter) ignores the offensive and abusing, threatening tweets posted by the Left leaning and the Congress parties. The wing took a silent march from South Delhi’s Saket to Lado Sarai where the regional office of Twitter is situated.

The youth wing further accused Twitter for spreading selective fake news. “Twitter has acquired anti-right wing attitude, block our accounts and impressions of tweets! Won’t tolerate this, they will have to change their policy” said Laxman Manjunath on Twitter.
