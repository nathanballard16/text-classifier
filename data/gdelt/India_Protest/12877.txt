Students of DU SOL protest against introducing Semester System at SOL

Students from School of Open Learning have started an indefinite hunger strike against the University of Delhi regarding the decision of introducing the Choice Based Credit System from this year onwards. The rule university had earlier on conducted an executive council meeting regarding the introduction of the semester system at Delhi University School of Open Learning and the NCWEB.

As per the students, the steps have been introduced without any preparation and the students were not informed or kept in the loop regarding the procedure.

In a statement issued by the students protesting against this, it has been stated that until now close to 1.5 lakh students have already been admitted to the Annual Mode but the Vice-Chancellor of Delhi University has been insisting on incorporating the CBCS system without conducting any discussions with the students. Along with this, no new study material has been prepared for the CBCS format until now and the SOL is distributing the old study material itself.

Officer of Special Duty, Ramesh Bhardwaj said that the move of introducing the CBCS system was a necessary step to ensure that the degree issued by the SOL does not lose its validity. Bhardwaj added that as per the centre, a university cannot be running two separate modes simultaneously. In case the university does not switch over this year, the degree would not be recognized. He also said that the authorities are working with the students to make sure that they get the PDFs of the study material soon.

The Delhi University Executive Council Meeting was conducted earlier last week to discuss the introduction of the Semester system for the School of Open learning and the Non-Collegiate Women’s Education Board (NCWEB) which is run by the University of Delhi for the Female students in Delhi.
