Jhajjar, September 2

Having sought permission for euthanasia from the President of India, MBBS students of World College of Medical Science and Research located near Girawar village in the district today pitched a tent at Shri Ram Park here and started a dharna against the college management.

They are demanding the state government to either listen to their grievances or help them in getting permission for mercy killing. They have also threatened to launch an indefinite fast if the government does not pay heed towards their plight.

“We took admission to World College in 2016. The college neither has doctors to teach us nor patients in its hospital. These are shown only at the time of the MCI assessment. Following which, the central authority had debarred the college from admitting students for two consecutive academic years (2017-18 and 2018-19),” they alleged.

Narendra Singh, Chairman of the college, refuted the allegations and said that an adequate number of doctors was available in the institution and classes were being conducted as per the schedule. The protesting students had been instigated by rival colleges and many of them were yet to deposit their fees. The college has fulfilled all parameters as per the norms, he added.
