BJP workers hold protest against Kamal Nath over Vande Mataram row

Bhopal: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers held a protest outside the Secretariat against Chief Minister Kamal Nath over Vande Mataram row.

Yesterday, the Kamal Nath-led Congress government in Madhya Pradesh decided to stop the previous BJP government’s tradition of reciting ‘Vande Mataram’ on the first working day of every month.

Nath had said that reciting the national song, ‘Vande Mataram’ cannot validate one’s patriotism.

While defending the move to put on hold the recital of ‘Vande Mataram’, Nath said on Tuesday: “We have no intentions of breaking or protesting against the national song. The order to recite Vande Mataram in the Secretariat on the first day of the month has been put on hold. A decision has been taken to implement the order in a new form. Those who do not recite Vande Mataram are not patriots?”

“We believe that we are nationalists by hearts. One cannot become patriotic by reciting Vande Mataram for one day,” he added.

The Madhya Pradesh assembly session is slated to begin on January 7, with the oath-taking by the newly-elected MLAs.

Earlier in the day, former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said that the 109 MLAs from the BJP will recite ‘Vande Mataram’ at the Secretariat and then take oath on January 7.
