Tis Hazari Court Violence: Delhi Cops End Protest At Police Headquarters After Assurance Of Necessary Action

The unprecedented 11-hour-long protests by Delhi Police personnel came to an end on Tuesday (5 November) night after Special Commissioner of Police (Crime) Satish Golcha assured the force that a review petition will be filed against the Delhi High Court order in the 2 November case of a violent clash between policemen and lawyers at Delhi's Tis Hazari Courts Complex, reports Indian Express.

Golcha also acceded to the demand of the protesting cops for an ex-gratia compensation of at Least Rs 25,000 for the policemen who were left injured in the violence that erupted between them and lawyers.

The massive protests came after the Delhi High Court directed the Delhi Police that the latter must not take any coercive action against the lawyers involved in the attacks on policemen at the aforementioned court.

On Tuesday, policemen in uniform and civilian clothes, with many holding placards, began assembling at the police headquarters since morning. Some of the placards read: “We are human in police uniforms” and “Protectors Need Protection”.

Many senior officers, including the Commissioner of Delhi Police Amulya Patnaik, tried to placate the agitating cops but failed in their efforts. It was only after assurance from Golcha that cops called off their protest.
