Upping the ante against the Central government over the abrogation of Article 370, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Monday announced that it will hold a protest in Delhi on August 22 against the government's decision. The DMK said that the protest will be held at Delhi's Jantar Mantar.

The protest will be attended by DMK MPs and other lawmakers to demand the release of political leaders who have been detained in Jammu & Kashmir.

In a brief statement, MK Stalin strongly condemned the abrogation of Article 370 and said the detention of family members of political leaders in J&K is "unacceptable and unconscionable".

"The Central government has isolated Kashmir from India by imposing curfew, using repressive forces and implementing prohibitory orders. By cutting channels of communication, the government has unnecessarily created a hostile environment," the statement read.

A source from the DMK said that the MPs from Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Congress are expected to participate in the protest at the Jantar Mantar.

Earlier, DMK president MK Stalin had chaired a meeting with party members to discuss the abrogation of Article 370.

"Without consulting people of Jammu and Kashmir, Article 370 has been taken away. Democracy has been murdered. AIADMK is also supporting the decision which is condemnable," Stalin had said.
