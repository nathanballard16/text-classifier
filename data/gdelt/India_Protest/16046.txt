A day after former MLA Amarpal Singh Bony raised the issue of “illegal sand mining” in Ajnala, residents of Ballarwal village held a protest and burnt an effigy of Bony today. They accused Boni of carrying out illegal mining during the SAD-BJP tenure.

Earlier associated with the SAD (Badal), Bony is now a Taksali leader.

Lakhbir Singh of Tehra Rajputan said, “Bony was indulged in illegal sand mining for 10 years during the SAD-BJP regime. He dug pits in the fields of Ballarwal which residents are now filling with sand."

Resham Singh, sarpanch of Harnam Singh Wala village, said, “We condemn the move of ex-MLA Amarpal Bony to create tension in the village. The government should take action in this regard.”

Despite repeated attempts, Amarpal Singh Boni didn’t not respond to phone calls.
