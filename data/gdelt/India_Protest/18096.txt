JNU protest: Cops stop JNU students' march to Parliament

NEW DELHI: The ongoing protest by the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students' Union (JNUSU) is largely over the proposed fee hike provision in the Draft Hostel Manual.Apart from the hostel fee hike, deadline for students to return to hostels and dress code were the major sticking points against which the university students were protesting.On Wednesday, the JNU administration decided to partially roll back the hostel fee hike "only for students below the poverty line category" and removed the provisions for curfew timings and dress code from the draft.The decisions, including partial roll back of the fee hike, were taken at university's Executive Council (EC) meet.No changes, however, were made in the hostel fee structure for BPL students who avail scholarships and for non-BPL students, the varsity had said.After careful consideration, the EC had decided to do away with a few clauses in the Draft Hostel Manual that had drawn the ire of the students, a varsity official said.The draft hostel manual, which was approved by the Inter-Hall Administration Committee on October 28, had a clause which said, "The residents should be back in their respective hostels latest by 11.00 pm or by half an hour after time for library closing, whichever is later."Students who are found outside their respective hostel premises after the stipulated time and involving in any violence or otherwise disturbing the peace on campus and privacy of JNU community will be evicted from hostel forthwith apart from any other disciplinary action by the University.""All residents and guests should come to the dining hall appropriately dressed," the new manual had said. This too was done away with.Service charges of Rs 1,700 have been introduced and the one-time mess security fee, which is refundable, has been hiked from Rs 5,500 to Rs 12,000.The rent for a single-seater room has been increased from Rs 20 per month to Rs 600 per month, while the rent for a double-seater room has been increased from Rs 10 to Rs 300 per month.
