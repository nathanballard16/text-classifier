A+ A-New Delhi: Delhi BJP and Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) MLAs here protested outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s office on Friday against the decision disallowing a “congratulatory resolution” on the revocation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir by the Central government. “We wanted to introduce a congratulatory resolution on the revocation of Article 370, we were not allowed to do so. “Shame on you Arvind Kejriwal. Kejriwal must answer why was I denied to express congratulation on abrogation of Art 370,” Sirsa tweeted. We hope this will bring peace and development in the state,” Delhi Chief Minister and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal tweeted after the Center’s decision.
