Cong protests against Shah, Yogi visit

Gorakhpur: The district unit of the Congress staged a protest against BJP president Amit Shah and CM Yogi Adityanath’s visit to Maharajganj on Friday.Led by the district unit president, the Congress workers staged a demonstration at Saxena Chauraha of Maharajganj district with psters and banners and raised slogans like ‘Amit Shah Wapas Jao’, ‘Yogi wapas Jao.’“Shah has no moral right to visit Maharajganj district as none of the promise made by him during his public meeting here in 2014 have been fulfilled. He had promised to restart Phatenda sugar mill which is still lying closed. Apart from financial assistance to farmers and linking every headquarter with railways, many other promised are yet to be fulfilled,” said the district unit president Alok Prasad.“Farmers in Maharajganj have to guard their farms due to stray cattle menace and nothing is being done for that. Youth is unemployed. Either you give them jobs or go back,” he added.
