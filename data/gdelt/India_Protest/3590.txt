Patiala DC, SSP fail to persuade protesting nurses to come down

PATIALA: Nurses, who had climbed the building of Rajindra Hospital in Patiala in protest have denied coming down. Interestingly, even Patiala deputy commissioner and SSP have failed to convince them.The DC and the SSP on Monday afternoon climbed the building of the hospital to urge the protesters to come down , but all in vain.Meanwhile, dozens of protestors can be seen near the hospital building. Some of them have even blocked operation theatres and OPDs in protest.Nurses, who are still on the top of the building, have recently issued ultimatum to the state government to accept their demands, failing which they could even intensify their agitation and jump."The government has paid no heeds to our demands. It will be responsible for future actions. The CM has been in the town but did not meet us. Various governments have cheated us by making false promise," said president of Punjab Contractual Nursing and Ancillary Staff Karamjit Kaur Aulakh.
