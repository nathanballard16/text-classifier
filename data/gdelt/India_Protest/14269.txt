Protest of India’s rule over Kashmir

Chanting “From Kashmir to Palestine, occupation is a crime,” over 100 people, mostly immigrants from Kashmir, rallied on Sept. 6 outside the Masjid Al-Madinah Upper Darby Islamic Center near Philadelphia to call attention to India’s recent human rights’ abuses and violations of Kashmir’s sovereignty.
