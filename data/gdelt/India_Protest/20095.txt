Guwahati: Students of top institutes detained over CAB protests

GUWAHATI: More than 100 students from leading educational institutions of Guwahati —Cotton University, B Borooah College, and Handique Girls’ College — were detained on Wednesday for protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill ( CAB ).Those detained included student leaders Jintu Thakuria, Hirakjyoti Borah, and Pranjal Kalita, who filed an FIR against Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma recently for his pro-CAB stance and accused him of shouting ‘Jai Bangladesh’ on the Assam legislative assembly premises. The students led a mass protest rally through the busy Guwahati-Shillong Road on Wednesday, as the anti-CAB agitation reached its peak in Guwahati, with agitating mobs vandalizing police vehicles, public property and scuffling with police at various places in the city.“About 50 Cotton University students were picked up by police from the protest site. Though other students were released later in the day, two of our leading protesters — Hirakjyoti Borah and Pranjal Kalita — are still at Dispur police station. This is a conspiracy to drub the anti-CAB protests headed by the Cotton University students,” said Deepjyoti Das, former general secretary of the erstwhile Cotton College Union Society.Meanwhile, a large number of students from many polytechnic institutions of the state did not take their examinations and staged a road blockade in Tezpur, Barpeta, Karimganj and other parts of the state, burning copies of the CAB. Though there are apprehensions that these students from the state’s polytechnic institutes may lose an academic year for skipping their papers on Wednesday, sources in the directorate of technical education said the absentee students will get a chance to clear their backlog later.Hundreds of students from IIT Guwahati (IIT-G) took out a torch rally from the main entrance of the premier technology institute, opposing the BJPled Union government’s move to pass the citizenship bill. Many IIT-G students, who hail from states outside the northeast, also joined the rally against CAB, which they have slammed for being “unconstitutional” and “communal” by the agitating students. “About 500 students, along with some faculty members and families of the staff marched from IIT-G, shouting antiCAB slogans. A large number of masters and research scholars from the institute took part in the rally. This is a warning to the government that the IIT-G fraternity won't remain silent during this hour of crisis for Assam and the northeast,” said a IIT-G student.
