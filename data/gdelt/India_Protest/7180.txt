Seeking coolers, students of Jamia Millia Islamia J&K Girls’ hostel stage midnight protest

New Delhi: Staging a massive protest outside the university’s Jammu and Kashmir Girls’ hostel on Monday night, students of Jamia Millia Islamia University sought the facility of coolers for relief during the summer season. Demanding that the college authorities equip the hostel with coolers as temperatures soared in the national capital during summers, the girl students gathered outside the hostel premises at around 10 pm and asked to be heard by the authorities.

Times Now uploaded the video showing girl students assembled in the courtyard of the hostel premises and loudly banging the building gate while chanting slogans such as “We want coolers” and “Down with tyranny”.

Tagging the official Twitter account of the HRD ministry, Twitter user Pragati Mishra tweeted “J and K hostel Jamia Millia Islamia University is torturing students by not allowing (them) to avail (the) cooler facility. Students are falling sick everyday and that too during exams time. Please help us!!!” She further tweeted “J and K hostel Jamia Millia Islamia University- torturing students with insensitive denial of availing our own cooler. They think Delhi’s summer is manageable. We are getting sick everyday. Please help the students.”
