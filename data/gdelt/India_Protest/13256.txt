'Save Amazon, burn Bolsonaro': Angry protest in India over Brazil forest fires

Dozens of protesters rallied outside the Brazilian consulate in India's eastern Kolkata on Tuesday against President Jair Bolsonaro and demanded protection for the Amazon rainforest.

Demonstrators chanted and waved posters saying: "Save Amazon, Burn Bolsonaro", condemning the Brazilian leader's policies and his response to the Amazon fires.

A record number of fires are ravaging the rainforest, many of them in Brazil, drawing international concern because of the Amazon's importance to the global environment.
