Kerala on lockdown as violent protests continue after third woman enters Hindu temple

The Indian state of Kerala was on lockdown on Friday after violent protests saw more than 1,000 people arrested after women were admitted to an historic Hindu temple.

Fresh demonstrations hit several towns and cities after a 46-year-old Sri Lankan woman became the third female of “menstruating age” to enter the Sabarimala temple complex, late on Thursday.

The woman known only as Sasikala is the third female under 50 - after Bindu Ammini, 42, and Kanakadurga, 44 - to offer prayers at the hilltop shrine, triggering violence across the state, police said on Friday.

Sasikala entered the temple 10 minutes before it was due to close on Thursday night, accompanied by her husband. She claimed her uterus was removed after an operation meaning she does not qualify as a menstruating women, the Hindustan Times reported.

A curfew was enforced in some parts of the state as police took part in Operation Broken Window, designed to quell mass disturbances after a general strike was called by a number of Right-wing Hindu groups.
