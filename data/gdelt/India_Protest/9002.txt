SURAT, June 12 (PTI)—The Deputy PM, Mr. Morarji Desai, said here last night that if China did not understand our language of peace, our strength would bring them to their senses. Mr. Desai, who was addressing a public meeting here said China took undue advantage of our friendship and our unpreparedness in 1962 and constituted aggression, but “it seems they realise now our strength and resort to false propaganda.” INFA adds: The Government of India has lodged a strong protest with the Chinese Government against its propaganda, inciting an armed revolution in India. India has taken strong exception to the highly exaggerated and fanciful accounts put out by Peking on happenings in India. New Delhi has taken note of a mischievous dispatch recently which says that “Indian revolutionaries have begun to go deep into rural areas, to lead and rouse the peasants to armed struggle. The heroic fight of the Naxalbari peasants in opposing with violence to reactionary rule and feudal oppression has become a glorious banner for the Indian people’s struggle for emancipation.”
