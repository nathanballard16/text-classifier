Youth Cong workers protest against Priyanka Gandhi's detention

Youth Congress activists, including women, staged a protest here Saturday against the detention of party leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in Uttar Pradesh on July 19 when she insisted on going to Sonbhadra where 10 people were gunned down this week.

The activists, led by its Telananga unit president M Anil Kumar Yadav, burnt an effigy of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath outside Gandhi Bhavan in the city, the party's headquarters in Telangana.

They raised slogans against Adityanath, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP.

AICC incharge of party affairs in Telangana R C Khuntia alleged that the "arrest" of Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is undemocratic.

Adityanath is ruling UP like a "dictator", he alleged, adding that people would teach the BJP regime a lesson. PTI SJR



The standoff between Gandhi and the Uttar Pradesh government ended Saturday, a day after she was detained



Gandhi headed back to Delhi after a meeting with some Sonbhadra villagers who travelled to the Mirzapur guesthouse where she had stayed overnight, refusing an offer from local administration to furnish a personal bond and leave.

Ten people, all Gond tribals, were shot dead Wednesday when a village headman, Yagya Dutt, and his supporters allegedly opened fire in an attempt to take possession of a piece of land in Ubbha village in Sonbhadra's Ghorawal area.

Twenty-eight others were injured, including nine supporters of the village head.

Twenty-nine people were arrested after the clash.
