BJP misusing agencies: Cong

New Delhi, October 12

A day after I-T raids on at least five persons working in the Congress’ accounts division, the party today cried foul alleging that the BJP was misusing the probe agencies to block financing of candidates in Haryana and Maharashtra where elections are due.

Senior Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma said raids had been conducted on five such persons dealing with Congress accounts and probe officers are sitting in the residences of some of them. “All this is being done with an ill intent. It is vendetta politics at its worst. It is pointless to tell this government anything about the rule of law. Our accounts office is under lock and key. We cannot disburse funds to candidates who have to fight the elections. Everything is at a standstill,” Sharma said, slamming coordinated raids by I-T officers in Karnataka on two senior Congress leaders, including former Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara.

Addressing reporters, Sharma questioned the BJP and the sources of its electoral funding. “Almost 99 per cent the electoral bonds have gone to the BJP. The amount, in addition to that, has been spent on the elections…it would be in excess of Rs 60,000 crore. From where does that money come?” — TNS
