Protesters call off stir against FASTag after visit to Kamrej toll plaza

Surat: A group comprising farmers and locals visited Kamrej toll plaza on Sunday to check if vehicles registered in Surat were being allowed free passage as announced by Navsari MP C R Paatil. The group’s leaders claimed that as local vehicles were being allowed to go without paying toll from the cash lanes of Kamrej toll plaza, they have ended their movement against FASTag whose implementation began from December 15. The protesters held no demonstration at the toll plaza and movement of traffic remained smooth.

“Charges will be deducted if a vehicle has FASTag even if it is a local vehicle. This benefit is only for those local vehicles which have yet to purchase FASTag. Meanwhile, National Highways Authority of India has extended the deadline for FASTag. Hence, we have discontinued the movement for the present,” said Dharmik Malaviya, convener of Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti.

Around 400 people gathered at the toll plaza in the morning. “A number of people and leaders gathered at Kamrej toll plaza to check if local vehicles were being allowed to go without paying toll charges. We declared discontinuation of our movement as no charges are being collected from local vehicles,” said Jayesh Patel, leader of Gujarat Khedut Samaj.

“Charges will be deducted as per norms for local vehicles which have FASTag. Local vehicles not using FASTag will be allowed to go from the cash lanes for the present,” an IRB official said.
