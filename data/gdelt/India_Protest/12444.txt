This Is Why Activists Are Vehemently Protesting Against The Transgender Persons Bill

Amid the massive nationwide uproar surrounding the revocation of Article 370 in Kashmir which was moved in Rajya Sabha yesterday, another protest is gaining strength in the backdrop. The transgender community in India is currently vehemently protesting against the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill 2019, which was passed in the Lok Sabha yesterday.

The Bill charts out the workings for social, economic and educational empowerment of transgender people in the country. It was first introduced on July 19, and the passing of the Bill provoked multiple voices of dissent, right from opposition to activists, who called the Bill discriminatory and unjust.

A spill-over from the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill 2018, which was shelved because it could not be passed in the Rajya Sabha, as the Indian transgender community is dead against the Bill. Activists are even declaring yesterday a 'Gender Justice Murder Day' for the community.

If you are wondering where the protests and voices of dissent stem from, here is a brief overview of what the Bill states, and what are its implications that the Indian transgender community is protesting against.

1. The 2019 Bill allows a person to rightfully choose their gender identity. That is, whether they wish to be identified as a man, woman or transgender person, irrespective of sex reassignment surgeries or hormonal therapies that they might undertake.

2. The Bill demands that an individual identifying as a transgender will have to go through a district magistrate and district screening committee to get certified as a transgender and acquire their ID cards.

3. No provision has been made for individuals to challenge, appeal or seek reviewal of the certificate issued by the District Magistrate, in case they are denied proper identification.

4. The 2018 Bill criminalised begging – which was opposed by the transgender community because it made them particularly threatened of one of their biggest sources of livelihood. The reason being that trans people in the country are often forced to beg due to lack of employment opportunities for them.

5. Though the aforementioned provision has been removed from the Bill, it now lays down these offences: (i) compelling transgender persons to do forced or bonded labour (excluding compulsory government service for public purposes); (ii) denial of use of a public place; (iii) removal from household, village or other place of residence; and (iv) physical, sexual, verbal, emotional or economic abuse.
