Special teams make more recovery in bank burglary case

Special teams of the Tiruchi Rural Police have so far recovered about 2.5 kilograms of gold jewellery that was looted from the Punjab National Bank’s Bikshandarkoil branch on the city’s outskirts in January this year.

A recent seizure of around 600 grams of gold jewellery was made at a couple of places in Bengaluru and near Chennai by the special teams following interrogation of Suresh – a key accused in the bank burglary case, said police sources.

Suresh is presently under the custody of the special teams of the Tiruchi Rural Police.

The sources said 800 more grams of stolen gold jewels were to be recovered.

The seven day police custody period of Suresh – a close relative of Murugan alleged to be the mastermind in the bank burglary- comes to an end on Tuesday. The sources said two more accused Ganesan and Radhakrishnan were already under judicial custody in connection with the case.

The teams were yet to interrogate Murugan as he continues to be under the custody of the Bengaluru Police for the slew of crime cases booked against him in that city. Murugan, Suresh and Ganesh were also allegedly involved in the Lalithaa Jewellery heist here that is being probed separately by special teams of the Tiruchi City Police.
