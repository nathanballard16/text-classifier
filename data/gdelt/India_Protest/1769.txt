The very best of the NSG

This year's calendar of the National Security Guard is about the high-level of training the commandos go through.

Shot by photographer Pravin Talan, this calendar shows a commando's valour and willingness to take risks and also gives a peek into the intense preparation that a commando does before embarking on a mission.

These stunning photos are a tribute to the martyrs and capture the 'men in black' at their combative best.
