Ahmedabad: 4 budgets worth Rs 1K cr approved

Budgets worth Rs 1,349.22 crore were approved amidst ruckus, without giving any chance to the elected representative to speak or start a discussion. In the two-day Budget session of the AMC, a general board meeting was held on Saturday to discuss the budgets of School Board (Rs 673 crore), MJ Library (Rs 12.86 crore), VS Hospital (Rs 213.36 crore), the Ahmedabad Municipal Transport Service (AMTS, Rs 450 crore), and the general Budget (Rs 8,051 cr), which are expected to be presented before the board on Sunday. Meanwhile, Amit Shah, BJP leader said that if Congress members didn't want to listen, they could leave. Congress chanted 'AMC ka Chowkidar Chor Hai', and BJP members yelled 'Pappu Ka Khandan Chor Hai'. A ruckus erupted in the House, where Congress held a mock budget and staged a protest before the mayor's office.
