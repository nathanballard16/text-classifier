JNU Students Protest Outside Campus Against Fee Hike And Hostel Manual, Clash With Police

The Jawaharlal Nehru Students' Union (JNUSU) on Monday (11 November) staged a protest outside the varsity campus over a reported fee hike and the hostel draft manual, even as Vice President N Venkaiah Naidu was addressing a convocation ceremony.

The protesting students alleged that the varsity administration had put barricades at its entry gate and also deployed CRPF personnel. However, several students were seen clashing with cops, reports India Today.

A protester was reported saying that the protests have been going on for the last 15 days over a fee hike. "At least 40 per cent students come from poor background. How will they study here?" the protester added

Sharing photographs of the blocked entry gates, former JNUSU President, N Sai Balaji wrote, "Barricades at Ambience Mall gate and CRPF deployed."

The JNU is holding its third convocation on Monday, which is being addressed by Vice President Naidu along with Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'.

However the students' union has called for a boycott of the convocation and demanded the roll back of the hostel draft manual and fee hike proposed by the administration.

No statement on the deployment of CRPF in the campus has been made by the JNU administration as of now.

In its latest orders, the JNU administration massively hiked the hostel, mess and security fee by a reported 400 per cent. It also limited the hostel timings.
