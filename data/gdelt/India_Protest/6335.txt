Sham polls in IOK a futile exercise

Srinagar, April 11, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the High Court Bar Association (HCBA) has termed the holding of so-called Indian Parliamentary elections in the territory as a futile exercise as such polls in the past have not helped in the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.

The HCBA in an Executive Committee meeting held in Srinagar said in terms of the UN resolutions of 1952 and 1957, elections held in the territory are no substitute to the right to self-determination, guaranteed to the people of Kashmir by the UN resolutions of August 13, 1948 and January 05, 1949 and also of those passed thereafter and will not in any manner constitute the final disposition of the territory.

The participants of the meeting said that it would be in the interest of the people of India to hold plebiscite in a fair and impartial manner to give the Kashmiri people a chance to choose their future in a democratic manner. They said the claims of repealing the Articles 35-A and 370 of the Indian Constitution by the BJP will not put the Kashmir dispute on the backburner, as even after the repealing of the provisions, the UN resolutions still hold the field as also reflected in the Proviso appended to Article 253 of the Indian Constitution and India is, therefore, bound to implement these resolutions and fulfill the promises and pledges made by its leaders to the people of Kashmir at international as well as domestic level.

Meanwhile, the General Secretary of Jammu and Kashmir Muslim League (JKML), Muhammad Rafiq Ganai, in a statement in Srinagar urged the Kashmiri people to completely boycott the sham elections in the territory. He said the election drama is a political gimmick by India to hoodwink the international community about the Kashmir dispute and the prevailing situation of the territory.

Rafiq Ganai said that the people of Kashmir had not rendered unprecedented sacrifices for the farcical polls but for securing their inalienable right. He said that polls conducted by New Delhi in the territory could not be a substitute to the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination. He maintained that the Kashmiri people would take the ongoing freedom movement to its logical conclusion, against all odds.
