Protest against sexual abuse

Students and organisations stage demonstration in Tiruchi and Thanjavur

Students and other organisations staged protests in Tiruchi and Pudukottai district in protest against sexual abuse case in Pollachi.

In Tiruchi, a group of students of the MIET College staged a demonstration in front of their institution demanding stern action against all the accused involved in the heinous crime. Over 100 students carrying placards took part in the protest.

A section of members of the Democratic Youth Federation of India and the All India Democratic Women's Association made a vain bid to lay siege the Collectorate in Tiruchi to express their condemnation against the sexual abuse of several women at Pollachi.

Around 35 members attempted to gain entry into the Collectorate. However, police prevented them from gaining entry by shutting the main entrance gate of the Collectorate.

In Pudukottai, members of the AIDWA, Democratic Youth Federation of Inda, Students Federation of India, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi formed a human chain seeking stern action against the accused in the crime.
