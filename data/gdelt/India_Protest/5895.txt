Women to march for their rights today

Over 25 women’s organisations, including the All-India Progressive Women’s Association (AIPWA), will take out a march from Mysuru Bank Circle in Bengaluru on Thursday “to oppose the current environment of hate and violence”.

It is part of the ‘All-India March’ call given by Women’s March, India, an inclusive platform for diverse communities of women who seek to dismantle the “current regime of oppression and strive towards a just and peaceful future”. Nirmala M., president, AIPWA, said women across the country would march to claim their constitutional rights as citizens of democratic republic. Women forums have extended their support to candidates Prakash Raj and S. Varalakshmi.

Activist Madhu Bhushan said the march was aimed at uniting voices of dissent against the targeted attacks on the constitutional rights of women. Film-maker Kavitha Lankesh said “voices of dissent have been systematically silenced. While Sudha Bharadwaj, Shoma Sen and others are languishing in prisons, activists like Gauri had to pay with their lives for exercising their fundamental right to speech and expression”.
