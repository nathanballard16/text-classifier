LAKHIMPUR: Alleging harassment on the minority people in the name of re-verification process for the NRC update, the activists of Lakhimpur district unit of the All Assam Minority Students’ Union demonstrated two hour long sit-in in North Lakhimpur on Friday.

Initiating the protest programme in front of the Lakhimpur Deputy Commissioner’s Office from 10am to 12am, the organization protested against this harassment and panicky situation allegedly caused by suspicious and mischievous notices served to NRC applicant for re-verification by NRC authority in the State. According to the organization, “Such notices are being served to the people and they are asked to appear before the NRC authority in far-flung areas with short notice of one or two days. The people of Assam, especially the people living in the riverine areas are just struggling to cope with the losses caused by the recent wave of flood at present. Under such circumstances, if these people are asked to attend the NRC hearing giving them just one or two days and summoned to 300-400km away from their homes, a large number of them would not be able to attend the hearing process.”

By staging the protest, the organization submitted a memorandum to the Home Secretary, Government of India, through Lakhimpur DC regarding the discrepancies in NRC update process. Through the memorandum, the organization demanded him to direct the NRC authority to re-schedule the hearing either within the district or within the adjoining district providing at least one week times to the applicants, to direct the NRC authority to make the notice available on internet along with other four demands.
