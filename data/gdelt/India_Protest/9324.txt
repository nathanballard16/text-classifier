New Delhi: The Indian Medical Association (IMA) will hold a 24-hour-long nationwide protest tomorrow when all non-essential services, including OPDs, will be closed starting from 6 am.

IMA will also stage a 'dharna' at IMA headquarters in Delhi starting 10 am tomorrow.

The association has called for the strike to support the West Bengal junior doctors who have been protesting for the past few days against the alleged attack on two of their colleagues by the relatives of a patient who died at NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on Monday night.

So far around 119 doctors of North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Darjeeling resigned over alleged violence against them in the state.

The strike, which entered its sixth consecutive day on Sunday, has brought the medical services in the state to a standstill.

On Saturday, the protesting doctors had set six conditions for the Bengal government to meet to call off the strike. They also sought an unconditional apology from Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her statement that “outsiders” are creating ruckus at the behest of BJP and CPI(M).

Banerjee, who visited the SSKM Hospital in Kolkata on Thursday, warned the protesting doctors to call off their strike.

Banerjee had on Saturday asked the agitating doctors to meet her at the state secretariat to resolve the issue, however, they turned down her invitation and asked her to come to the Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital for the meeting.
