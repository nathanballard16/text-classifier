NEW DELHI, Sept. 19 (Xinhua) -- Private commercial vehicles owners are on a one-day strike in the Indian capital on Thursday to protest against the recent steep hike in the amount of fines in traffic violations, imposed by the central government.

The amended "Motor Vehicles Act," which came into force from Sept. 1, entails provisions for hefty fines violating traffic laws like not wearing seatbelts, or driving on Indian roads without valid documents like license, pollution under control certificate or insurance.

The strike was called from 0600 local time to 2200 local time by the "United Front of Transport Associations (UFTA)," which claims representing as many as 41 associations and several other unions of goods and passenger segments.

Media reports quoted UFTA Chairman Harish Sabharwal as saying that "Our main demand is that the exorbitant penalties under the amended Motor Vehicles Act should be reviewed. While the government has increased the fines, it has not supported it with any infrastructure. Why do we still not have any scientific evidence of challans (tickets)?"

All the major commercial vehicles associations that run trucks, buses, autos, tempos, maxi-cabs and taxis in Delhi and adjoining cities like Noida and Gurugram joined the one-day protest.

Even the private airlines issued travel advisories to its fliers in this regard. IndiGo, a private airline, tweeted "We're anticipating transport disruptions due to the transport strike in Delhi tomorrow, Sept. 19. Passengers travelling to/from Delhi airport are requested to make their arrangements accordingly."
