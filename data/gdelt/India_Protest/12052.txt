Andhra Police official slaps medico during protest

Vijayawada, Aug 7 : A police official in Andhra Pradesh held a junior doctor by his collar and slapped him during a protest by medicos against the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill here on Wednesday.

The incident occurred outside NTR University of Health Sciences when a group of junior doctors were staging a protest.

The protestors had formed a human chain on Kolkata-Chennai national highway, leading to a traffic jam. In an attempt to clear the road, the police forcibly removed the protestors. The medicos tried to resist the police, leading to pushing and jostling.

Deputy Commissioner of Police V. Harshavardhan Raju held one medico by his collar and slapped him. The incident triggered tension as the medicos intensified their protest, demanding action against the official.

The students later made a representation to Director General of Police Gautam Sawang, demanding action against the DCP.

Leader of Opposition and Telugu Desam Party chief N. Chandrababu Naidu condemned the incident.

The former Chief Minister alleged that impatience to dissent was growing under the YSR Congress government. He said the government was trying to suppress the voice of people and tackling the protests by various sections in a high-handed manner.
