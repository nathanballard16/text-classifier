Indore: Auto and cab driver-partners of app-based cab aggregators staged a protest at the District Collector's office against the aggregators for allegedly charging hefty commissions.

Police had to resort to lathicharge after a protestor apparently tried to set himself ablaze. However, police overpowered him before he could take any drastic step.
