Jaganmohan Reddy had declared that the state would have three capitals - Visakhapatnam, Amaravati, Kurnool. He proposed Visakhapatnam as the executive capital, Amaravati as the legislative capital, and Kurnool as judicial capital.

After the proposal made by him, the political situation in Andhra Pradesh became very volatile with farmers in and around Amaravati led by the opposition Telugu Desam Party protesting against the ruling government's decision.

On the other hand, people in North coastal Andhra Pradesh surrounding Visakhapatnam city are jubilant over the government's proposal to set up executive capital in the city, and also people in Rayalaseema where a High court is being proposed in Kurnool town.
