The protesters claimed that there are 21 Sikh prisoners including 18 in Punjab jails who had completed their sentences but were still to be released. They said that generally the life term good conduct convicts are released after a imprisonment of 10, 12 and 14 years but the Sikh prisoners have not been released even after completing over 24 years in jail.The members added that besides the demand of the release of such prisoners they also held protest over the demand to arrest the accused involved in the desecration of Shri Guru Granth Sahib including former Chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and others.They revealed that Balwant Singh Rajoana, Subeg Singh and Nand Singh were convicted in 1995 in assasination of then CM Beant Singh case but are still in Patiala jail . Others in jail despite having completed teir sentences include Balbir Singh Bhootna, Lal Singh, Devender Pal Singh Bhullar, Lakhvinder Singh, Gurmeet Singh, Shamsher Singh, Paramjit Singh Bheora, and Jagtar Singh Tara, claimed the members of the organisation. One of the members, Baljinder Singh said, "We are protesting against the the discriminatory behaviour of the judicial system and the governments that had not allowed the Sikh prisoners to come out of jails despite they have completed their jail term over the years. In the upcoming polls, we would also raise the issue that Captain Amarinder failed to punish the accused involved in the desecration despite he took oath of Gutka Sahib, a holy book, during a rally at Bathinda and announced to punish the accused involved in desecration. Our peaceful protest is against the government to get the Sikh detainees released.’’
