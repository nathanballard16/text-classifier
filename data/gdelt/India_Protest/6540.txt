The Election Commission issued a notice against Bharatiya Janata Party’s Himachal unit chief on Tuesday for his remarks against Congress president Rahul Gandhi at a recent election rally in Nalagrah’s Ramashehar.

The police registered an FIR against Satti under section 294 of IPC (obscene acts) under Baddi police limits.

Satti is believed to have a used an abusive Hindi slur at Saturday’s rally while referring to Rahul Gandhi’s ‘chowkidar chor hai’ campaign against Prime Minister Narendra Modi. A video of the supposed speech went viral soon after.

Satpal Satti has 24 hours to respond to Chief Electoral Officer Devesh Kumar’s notice, which pertains to a rally on Saturday.

The development came after the Congress approached the commission with a complaint over Satti's remarks. This is the first major complaint against any state BJP leader this election season.

Congress meanwhile held protests at district headquarters of the state against Satti’s language. The party has demanded action from BJP chief Amit Shah.
