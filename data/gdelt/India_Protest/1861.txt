Budget session: MSP, Spl status, women’s quota BJD’s main agenda

New Delhi: With the commencement of the last session of the 16th Lok Sabha from Thursday, the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is all set to press for the long pending demands of the state.

BJD Parliamentary party leader in the Lower House Bhartruhari Mahtab said the party would raise its demands like hike in minimum support price (MSP) of paddy to the tune of Rs 2,930 per quintal, special category status to Odisha, assistance for natural calamities and others.

“We will be raising the MSP issue for which BJD had demonstrated in Delhi. We have also given notice relating to natural calamities. It was listed in the last session but could not be taken up. We will also raise the issues of reservation for women in the state assemblies and the Parliament, and the Polavaram dispute,” Mahtab said.

The session which ends February 13 will have 10 sittings in Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

“There are very few sittings in the session. We will try our best to raise the issues concerning the interest of Odisha. Around Rs 6,000 crore is pending with the Union government. So, we will also press for that,” Mahtab said.

“We thanked the Speaker for nicely conducting all the sessions. We will go back with good memories of the Lok Sabha,” he added.
