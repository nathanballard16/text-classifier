Attacks on Kashmiris outside valley distressing: JRL

Srinagar

Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) comprising of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Muhammad Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik while condemning the attacks on Kashmiris in various parts of the country.

The spokesman said that attacks on Kashmiri businessmen, students, tourists and people from other walks of life in various states of the country is distressing and apparently instigated by the ruling regime. The videos and photographs of Kashmiris being beaten, humiliated, looted, vandalized outside valley will only push more Kashmiri youth to the wall and path of rebellion.

Terming these attacks as distressing and horrible, Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) spokesman said that attacks on Kashmiri students including female students in different colleges, universities and institutions across India, is in every respect a dangerous trend that is promoting hatred between humans.

From last one week, Kashmiri students, businessmen, tourists are being beaten ruthlessly by unruly mobs, shops and business centres are being looted, vandalized and humiliated in broad daylight with police in many cases watching as mute spectators. This widespread, organized unilateral violence against Kashmiris is apparently instigated by the ruling regime as no one till date has been penalized or arrested for these hateful attacks.

JRL said that when announcements of vengeance come from as high as Prime minister’s office, home minister and other political class, when a sitting governor of Meghalaya Tathagata Roy is tweeting publicly to boycott Kashmiris, he is not even asked for restraint and when TV channels are let free to talk whatever they want, how can these ugly attacks be termed as mere acts of resentment and anger.

Leaders said that Kashmiris throughout history have always safeguarded religious harmony and protected all outsiders living or working here and we will Insha-Allah stand firm and provide safety, relief and other assistance to every outsider present on our land in future too and uphold our tradition in ensuring the safety of every human being.
