Zakir Musa: Thousands mourn India's 'most wanted' militant

"Protesters have clashed with police at many places since morning. Many people shouting 'Musa Musa Zakir Musa' also gathered at the only highway that connects Srinagar with the rest of India and threw stones at forces. The police have been retaliating with tear gas shells and pellet guns," Mr Yasir added.
