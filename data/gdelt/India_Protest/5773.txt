India can blow up satellites now. And a new space arms race could be starting.

Reacting to the Indian test, acting U.S. secretary of defense Patrick Shanahan underscored that there are “certain basic principles” that must be followed with these tests. The Trump administration is not known for its fondness for arms control, but it should seize on Shanahan’s observation and pursue a multilateral process to codify norms — even if nonbinding — on antisatellite weapon testing. The Indian government has correctly noted that its test violated no “international law or treaty.” But given the risks of these kinds of tests, this shouldn’t have been the case.
