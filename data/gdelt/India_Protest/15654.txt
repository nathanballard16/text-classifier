Three arrested for looting mobile phones

Surat: The crime branch arrested three persons who had targeted nearly 30 people and snatched their mobile phones in different parts of the city.

Of the three, two are minors while one is a 23-year-old man who provided motorcycles to the duo to carry out loot. The accused Abu Amir alias Lala Shabbir Kaskiwala, who runs a roadside eatery, also purchased the looted phones from them. Police recovered 57 looted phones worth around Rs six lakh from them.

Kaskiwala and his 17-year-old associate run a gang of eight robbers snatch mobile phones from citizens for him. He collects Rs 1,000 rent for one two-wheeler for a day from the robbers.

The robbers were supposed to return the two-wheeler at the end of the day and hand over the looted phones. Kaskiwala paid them money for the looted phones after deducting the rent for the two-wheeler.

“They looted four to five mobile phones in a day going around the city on the two-wheeler taken on rent. They also targeted passengers in rickshaws,” said a police officer.

Police are now working to nab other gang members involved in mobile snatching.
