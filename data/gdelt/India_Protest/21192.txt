Democrats want Mulvaney, Bolton to testify in Trump’s impeachment trial: A.M. News Links

Dems seek testimony

In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Sunday evening, Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, is outlining Democrats’ opening offer for a Senate impeachment trial against President Donald Trump, detailing what he calls a “fair bipartisan process” in the Senate.

Democrats are asking to hear from four witnesses -- acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Adviser John Bolton, Associate Director for National Security at the Office of Management and Budget Michael Duffey and senior adviser to the acting White House chief of staff, Robert Blair -- all of whom refused to participate in the House investigation.

Democrats, Schumer says in the letter, are open to additional witnesses with direct knowledge of allegations Trump withheld funding from Ukraine in a bid to get the country to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, who served on the board of Ukrainian gas company Burisma.
