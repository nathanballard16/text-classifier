Nirav Modi’s arrest has exposed Rahul Gandhi’s web of lies: Babul Supriyo slams Congress president

The arrest also proves that as long as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in-charge, no one can loot India's resources and escape, he stressed.

Union minister Babul Supriyo Wednesday said the arrest of fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi has "exposed the web of lies" created by Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

The arrest also proves that as long as Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in-charge, no one can loot India's resources and escape, he stressed.

The comments came after Nirav Modi, the main accused in the USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank scam case, was arrested in London and a court remanded him in custody till March 29.
