Chandrababu Spending AP Money On Campaigning In Other States

Hyderabad: BJP leader Vishnuvardhan Reddy lashed out at Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu for spending money from the state exchequer on his campaign trips in other states. He was addressing the media on Wednesday.

Vishnuvardhan recalled how TDP MP JC Diwakar Reddy had stated that crores of rupees had been spent in the April 11 elections. He described the TDP as a caste-ridden party. Vishnuvardhan asked as to why the TDP supremo and his MPs had been silent for 5 years on the subject of EVMs.

In 2009 Chandrababu had accused the Congress of hacking and had approached the BJP, he pointed out. Now in 2019, the same Chandrababu has tied up with the Congress. He is threatening IAS officials for deciding to hold a meeting, Vishnuvardhan Reddy further said. The BJP leader also flayed Chandrababu for not having expressed any doubts about EVMs at the time of casting his vote, but coming up with his criticism of EVMs later. This showed he was scared of likely defeat, he said.

Vishnuvardhan Reddy slammed Chandrababu saying he ferried the accused in an EVM theft case in a special aircraft. The Election Commission should take a stern view of Chandrababu demonstrating a video on VVPAT slips because it is in violation of the Model Code, he said.

Vishnuvardhan Reddy pointed out that Chandrababu was repeating KA Paul's absurd allegations which led people to believe whether Paul was working as an adviser of TDP. He also lambasted the Chandrababu government for its negligence in the TTD gold issue and wondered why the government had not suspended the EO and JEO in this matter.
