Pardhi community to take out march against govt apathy

Their demands include setting up of an independent financial development board for the welfare of the community and grant the status of ‘Adim Jati’ to Fase Pardhi community to bring them to the mainstream of society.Members of Fase Pardhi community, which has a seizable population across the state are forced to spend their lives without any identification from the government and denied their constitutional privilege of ‘right to live a dignified life’ in the country. Matin is the president of Adivasi Fase Pardhi Samaj Sanghatana.“My school has 35 students from Melghat alone and most of them are orphans,” Matin said, adding that the government is reluctant to grant neither approval nor any government aids. There are around 250 families of the community, residing in Arni tehsil itself, which is located over 40km from Yavatmal city, have no voter identity card and ration card, causing no benefits of the government schemes.“We are born in India. But we cannot avail benefits of the government schemes. There is no road, drinking water, anganwadi or any facility for our children,” said Anithrao Bhosale, a resident of Karegaon Bandi of Arni.The central government has launched the Mudra Yojana to ensure self employment for youths.
