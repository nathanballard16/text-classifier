AAP MLAs to protest at Jantar Mantar against temple demolition

New Delhi: AAP MLAs will hold a protest at Jantar Mantar here on Wednesday against the DDA allegedly demolishing a temple in the Tughlakabad area, Delhi Social Welfare Minister Rajendra Pal Gautam said on Tuesday. He added that Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers from Haryana and Punjab will also participate in the protest. The government resorted to repressive steps like stopping buses and nearly 15 passenger trains from Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan in order to prevent people from joining the protest," Gautam said. He said all the AAP MLAs will take part in the protest and also raise the issue in the Delhi Assembly session starting Thursday. He alleged that the Centre breached the trust of Dalits and failed to take everyone on board as it always claimed.
