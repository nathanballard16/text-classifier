Shirin Dalvi returns award in protest

MUMBAI: Urdu journalist Shirin Dalvi returned an award she received from State Urdu Academy to protest against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill passed by Rajya Sabha on December 11. She said it was her way of doing civil disobedience against the “unconstitutional” and “divisive” Bill.Dalvi had courted controversy in January 2015, when as editor of Urdu daily ‘Avadhnama’, she had published a cartoon of the Prophet. Though she published a front-page “apology” for publishing the cartoon “by mistake” the next day, she was hounded by a section of the community and five FIRs were lodged against her in different parts of the state. Bombay high court had clubbed all the FIRs but subsequently the cases against her were quashed as the allegations were found to be untrue.Talking about the reason for her returning the award, she had received from the State Urdu Academy in 2011, Dalvi said she was shocked and saddened by CAB. “It is an attack on our Constitution and secularism and, in protest against this inhuman law, I am announcing the return of this award. CAB is divisive and discriminatory. I am returning the award to join the voices of my community and people fighting for secularism and democracy. We all have to stand firm to protect our Constitution and the Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (composite culture),” she said.Based in the city, Dalvi now works for some news portals and is also working on her autobiography.Meanwhile, former head of Urdu department at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) Yaqoob Yavar also announced on Thursday evening that he had returned the Rs 1 lakh award he received from UP Urdu Academy for translation in 2018 to protest against CAB. “I am returning the award I received for translation of more than 20 books into Urdu. I am shocked at the assault on our Constitution and I will send a cheque to UP Urdu Academy by post on Friday,” said Varanasi-based Yavar.
