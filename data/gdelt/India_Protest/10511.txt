ASI issues notice to civic body

The Archaeological Survey of India has issued notice to Thanjavur Corporation, asking it to suspend drilling of a borewell within a 200-metre radius from the Big Temple, a World Heritage Monument.

Inquiries reveal that the Corporation, which maintains a park on Big Temple Road, took up drilling of a borewell on Tuesday as the existing one has dried up for watering the park. The area belongs to the civic body, sources said.

However, archaeologists and heritage enthusiasts registered their opposition with the civic body, in vain.

Meanwhile, ASI, which came to know of the drilling, issued notice to the Corporation asking it to stop the work immediately.
