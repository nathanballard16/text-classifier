Shajila Ali Fathim, a cameraperson working with Kairali TV, was repeatedly attacked and abused allegedly by protesting BJP workers after two women entered the revered Sabarimala temple early on Wednesday morning.

Her photographs and videos showing her covering the Sabarimala protests with a steely resolve despite being brought to tears, has gone viral on social media, reports India Today.

Shajila was photographed with tears in her eyes and still holding up her camera to shoot the protests in Thiruvananthapuram as the state boiled over the women of menstruating age entering the temple that has traditionally banned their entry.

Protests and a shutdown called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organization of various pro-Hindutva groups, and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), have brought the state to its knees with hundreds of protestors running amok.

Several journalists staged a march in the state capital on Thursday to protest against the assault they were subjected to since Wednesday.

The state was under siege as strike supporters clashed with police and the ruling CPI(M) activists at several places.

In Thrissur, three BJP activists were stabbed during a clash with workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, a militant Islamic outfit, police told PTI.

A 55-year-old man, who was seriously injured when CPI (M) workers hurled stones at protesters from atop their party office at Pandalam in Pathanamthitta district, died late Wednesday night.
