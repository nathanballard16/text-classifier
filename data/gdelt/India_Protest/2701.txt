New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi will visit the southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu today and will unveil various developmental projects followed by public meetings. His first stop will be Guntur in Andhra Pradesh followed by Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu and Hubli in Karnataka. In Andhra Pradesh, PM Modi will dedicate Visakhapatnam Strategic Petroleum Reserve facility of Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserve Limited (ISPRL) to the nation. Apart from this he will also inaugurate ONGC projects located in the Krishna-Godavari Offshore Basin and will lay the foundation stone for setting up a new terminal of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited at Krishnapatnam.

This will be his first visit to AP after TDP severed ties with BJP last year. Andhra CM N Chandrababu Naidu has ordered party workers to protest against Modi’s visit at large scale.

After Guntur, Modi will leave for Tiruppur in Tamil Nadu and will lay the foundation of various projects followed by similar programs in Mangalore, and Dharwad in Karnataka.

The BJP wants to increase its footprint in South India ahead of the Lok Sabha elections and the PM is rooting on development plank to woo voters. According to media reports, the BJP may enter into an alliance with the AIADMK in Tamil Nadu ahead of the general elections. TN deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam had recently stated that the party leaders are holding talks with a “friendly national party” for an alliance ahead of the upcoming LS elections.

In 2014 general elections, the BJP had won only one Lok Sabha seat out of 39 in Tamil Nadu while Karnataka is the only state down south which has been ruled by the saffron party in the past.
