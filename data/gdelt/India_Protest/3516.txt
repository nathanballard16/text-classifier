Jaipur: After the recent controversy of cow deaths at the state-run Hingonia gaushala, Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) has decided to conduct a population census at the gaushala for recording the actual number of cattle.JMC has appointed a 14-member team that will conduct the census starting from February 19 to February 21, 2019. As per the recent estimate, there are around 22,000 cows at the gaushala run by Akshaya Patra. Action was taken by CEO of JMC Vijay Pal Singh for not clearing Akshaya Patra Foundation bills due to which shortage of fodder at Hingonia Gaushala emerged.

BJP councillors on Friday protested against their own Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC) board at the civic body’s office.
