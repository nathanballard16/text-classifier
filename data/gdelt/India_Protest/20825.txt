Several Jamia students detained following violent protests in Delhi over citizenship law

Following anti-citizenship law protests that turned violent in south Delhi’s New Friends Colony area on Sunday evening, Delhi Police personnel allegedly marched into the Jamia Millia Islamia University campus and brought about 150 students out of the premises. Many students said the detained students were not part of the protest and were inside the university library.

Sounds of students screaming could be heard emanating from the campus with the Delhi Police firing tear gas shells. Both sides pelted stones while a violent confrontation also took place near the Jamia Millia Islamia metro station.

Protesters could be seen hurling crude petrol bombs while the policemen occasionally retaliated with stones. A distance of about 50-70 metres separated the Delhi Police personnel from the protesters.
