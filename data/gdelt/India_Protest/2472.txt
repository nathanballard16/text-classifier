Nitish Kumar hatched plot to kill me, alleges RLSP chief Upendra Kushwaha

PATNA: Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha has accused Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar of hatching a conspiracy to kill him during a protest march last week where he and other leaders were lathi-charged by the police.

"Nitish Kumar plotted to kill me. I was attacked during the Raj Bhawan march. I demand that the incident should be probed by a sitting judge (of the Patna High Court) immediately," Kushwaha said.

The RLSP chief alleged that an FIR was registered against him and 250 of his colleagues by the Chief Minister.

Further taking a swipe at Nitish Kumar, RLSP chief said, "I am giving a warning to Nitish Kumar. If he does not withdraw his complaint, then by February 9, all of us and 250 unknown people will surrender at the Kotwali Police Station."

On February 2, RLSP protesters while marching towards the Raj Bhawan in Patna for educational reforms in Bihar were subjected to baton charge.

Several protesters, including Kushwaha, were injured and many were detained during the protest.

The party on Monday observed "Bihar Bandh" in protest against the police lathi-charge on Kushwaha and other political leaders during its "peaceful" Jan Akrosh rally.

Scores of RLSP leaders and workers took out rallies across the state while holding aloft placards and party flags.

Armed with 'lathis' (sticks), the workers raised slogans against Kumar and termed him a "dictator".
