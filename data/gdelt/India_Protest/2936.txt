Thales to display ‘Make in India’ initiatives at Aero India

Thales, a French multinational company, with a focus on ‘Make in India’ plans to reaffirm its commitment towards the development and modernisation of the Indian Armed Forces.

Through a series of demonstrations, Thales plans to showcase its capabilities across civil and defence aerospace at the Aero India to be held in Bengaluru from February 20 to 24.

As a major player in the Indian defence and aerospace sector, Thales has been continuously supporting the Indian armed forces and the government’s flagship ‘Make in India’ programme.

“We would have solutions being manufactured in the country through our local partners – global supply chain partners and joint ventures, among others. In addition, we will also be highlighting our hiring plans, and skilling and upskilling endeavours through our presence at the Aero Skills Pavillion this year,” said Emmanuel de Roquefeuil, VP and Country Director, Thales in India.

Digital experience

At Aero India, the Thales stand will highlight and provide an insight into its high-technology solutions across airborne solutions, air defence, radars, optronics, radio communications, among others through special digital experiences.

Some of the main highlights at Aero India this year would be Thales’ optronic pod - TALIOS; latest generation mini-UAS - Spy’Ranger; high-velocity missile - STARStreak; tracking and illumination radar - STIR; airborne rockets and a range of products from Radio Communications among others.
