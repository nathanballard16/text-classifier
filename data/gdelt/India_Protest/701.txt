India’s Great Wall of Equality by Jayati Ghosh

This article appears to be written with a political agenda, because there are incorrect statements and half truths. Kerala has a matriarchal society unlike the many other states of India and hence women have not only equal rights but even more rights when it comes to matters of family property. Kerala is the most literate state in India and have a large percentage of women employees in Government establishments, private establishments and practically in every field.

The Sabarimala controversy has been brought about by vested interests.The Temple is a sacred Institution of the Hindus and is not a place for womens' activists to prove some political point. Hindu Women themselves believe and respect the religious rites of the temple and that is why there is so much protests and appeals to the Supreme Court to reconsider their order. This is the only temple which has this custom and it has nothing to do with any discrimination. It is to be noted that among the group of Jugdes who gave the judgement allowing entry to women of all ages, the lone dissenting voice was that of the Lady Judge who categorically stated that this is a matter of Faith and not of gender equality and the court has no role to play in this.

The human wall was a propaganda and the fact that the Government had to advertise and prod women of different faiths to participate in it is proof of that. Hinduism believes in tolerance and many take advantage of that and political parties play along to get to power.
