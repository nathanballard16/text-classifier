Election Commission allowing PM Modi to hold rallies, alleges Mamata Banerjee

Kolkata: Furious over the Election Commission’s order to cut short the campaign period for the last phase of the Lok Sabha polls in West Bengal and action against two key bureaucrats, Trinamul supremo Mamata Banerjee described the move as “politically biased”.

Wondering why the campaign ban was not made effective from Wednesday night itself, she alleged the EC had deliberately set the Thursday 10 pm deadline so that Prime Minister Narendra Modi could complete his two rallies in the state during the day. In a threatening mood, the West Bengal CM argued: “Does it mean that no one can else campaign after Mr Modi’s rallies? If any malpractice is found in EVMs during the last phase of polling on May 19, we will move the Supreme Court against the EC. Deputy election commissioner Sudeep Jain is intimidating the district magistrates.”

She asked: “Why was no action taken against BJP president Amit Shah, who triggered the violence with goons at Vidyasagar College and vandalism of Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar’s bust there on Tuesday? I did not see such massive violence even in the riots after the Babri Masjid demolition.”
