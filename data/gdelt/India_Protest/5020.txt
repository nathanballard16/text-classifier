They accused Pakistan for the genocide and ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Hindus and Sikhs."More than 400,000 members were ethnically cleansed and are forced to live as refugees in India," they said.They urged the global community to hold Pakistan accountable for "atrocities on minorities" and "sponsoring terrorism".The events were organised by Achalesh Amar, Houston Coordinator of Friends of India Society International, USA and Dr Surinder Kaul, Global coordinator of Global Kashmiri Pandit Diaspora.Recently, tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district in February 14.In the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, India launched a major diplomatic offensive against Pakistan, holding briefing for envoys of 25 countries, including those from the five permanent UNSC members -- the US, China, Russia, the UK and France -- to highlight Islamabad's role in using terrorism as an instrument of state policy.
