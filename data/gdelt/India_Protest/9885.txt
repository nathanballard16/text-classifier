Over 20 business associations to join protest against PSPCL

Ludhiana: Trouble seems to be mounting for the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) as more than 20 associations have decided to join the agitation called by the United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) against the department, on Wednesday. The protest has been called by businessmen against rising cost of power in Punjab and inability of the Congress government to fulfil its poll promise of giving power at Rs 5 per unit to industrialists.

Giving more information, Inderjit Singh Navyug, said: “We have been flooded with calls from dozens of business associations from Ludhiana and other cities as well those who have expressed willingness to join our agitation. Some of the leading organizations which will join our protest include Machine Tools Manufacturers Association, Federation of Punjab Small Industries Association, Plywood Manufacturers Association, Ludhiana Sewing Machine Industries Association, Chamber of Industrial and Trading Entrepreneurs, Fasteners Suppliers Association of India, Knitwear Club, Plastic Manufacturers and Traders Association (PMTA), Auto Parts Manufacturers Association, Focal Point Sheds Association, Ludhiana Foundary Cluster, Ludhiana Oil and Engine Parts Manufacturers Association and Ludhiana Tractor Parts Association.”

Navyug said: “We have had enough of false promises by the state government as it has been two years now since we were promised that power will be supplied at Rs 5 per unit, but nothing has been done so far by the government. Power is costing more than Rs 10 per unit to small businessmen who have medium supply meters installed in their factories. In addition to this, the high handedness of the PSPCL officials is worrying as they do not care to take feedback and problems of industries into consideration before asking for hike in power charges. Our agitation is not only against the high power rates, but also against the frequent and unscheduled power cuts in the industrial areas.”
