Hundreds protest in Dhaka over India's Kashmir stance

The move by India has "hurt and angered the global Muslim community": protestors

DHAKA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Bangladeshi protesters took to the streets of Dhaka on Tuesday (August 6) to protest neighboring India s decision to scrap special status for Kashmir.

Many of those joining the protest outside Bangladesh s national mosque were members of the Islamist political party Islami Andolan Bangladesh. Leading party member Maulana Zakaria addressed the crowd, saying the move by India has "hurt and angered the global Muslim community".

In a move to tighten its grip on the Himalayan region also claimed by Pakistan, India on Monday (August 5) dropped a constitutional provision that allowed the country s only Muslim-majority region to make its own laws.

As India maintains a telecoms blackout to deter protests in Kashmir, Pakistan s army chief said on Tuesday that the country s military would "go to any extent" to support the people of the disputed region.
