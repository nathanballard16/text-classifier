Gujarat Will 'Definitely Implement' NRC, CAA: CM Vijay Rupani

New Delhi: Amidst protests across the country, against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA), Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani on Wednesday declared that the BJP government in Gujarat will “definitely implement” the controversial law along with the proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens (NRC).

“All states are bound to implement both NRC and CAA, and Gujarat will definitely implement them,” Rupani told reporters.

“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have already made it clear that provisions of the CAA will not cause any trouble to any citizen of India,” he added.

Taking it further, without offering any evidence to support his claim, Rupani blamed the Congress and other opposition parties for staging protests in the country.

Chief ministers of states ruled by non-NDA parties have been stridently opposing the law. So far, West Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, Kerala’s Pinarayi Vijayan, Punjab’s Amarinder Singh, Madhya Pradesh’s Kamal Nath, Chhattisgarh’s Bhupesh Baghel, Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal and Rajasthan’s Ashok Gehlot have said that they “will not allow” the amended law to be implemented in their states.

The Shiv Sena-led coalition government in Maharashtra had said that their decision on implementing the CAA in the state will depend upon the Supreme Court’s opinion.
