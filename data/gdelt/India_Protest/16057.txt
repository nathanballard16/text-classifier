Bigg Boss 13: 20 people arrested outside Salman Khan's house for protesting against the reality show

Bigg Boss 13 has been off to a fabulous start as the reality show hosted by Salman Khan has been garnering high TRP's. However, the show's concept and content seems to have come under fire as political as well as non-political organisations have raised objections. Many have criticised the 'Bed Friends Forever' concept and also slammed the vulgar content. Now, according to a latest report in Bollywood Hungama, 20 people have been arrested for protesting outside the host Salman Khan's house in Mumbai's Bandra.

The controversial Karni Sena also has been at the forefront of these protests. As per IANS, Karni Sena has also written to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, claiming "Bigg Boss" is insulting Hindu culture and traditions. Earlier, BJP MLA from Ghaziabad, Nand Kishore Gujjar had written a letter to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javdekar demanding that the show be taken off air. In his letter, the BJP legislator has alleged that the "show was promoting obscenity and vulgarity and was unfit for family viewing". The BJP lawmaker also demanded a censor mechanism for content being aired on television in order to prevent such incidents in future.

Bigg Boss is currently on its 13th season and the show is a huge hit among audiences across India. The first eviction on the show took place over the weekend and Daljeet Kaur was the first contestant to bid goodbye to the house.
