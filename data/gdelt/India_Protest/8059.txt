Ahmedabad: Congress's protest to save VS Hospital continues

Congress' protest to save Vadilal Sarabhai Hospital, run by Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) continued. Party leaders conducted protests at VS Hospital on Saturday demanding that under no conditions this hospital should be shut down as it caters to the poorest community of the society.



Party leaders lead by City Congress president Shashikant Patel, MLAs Gyasuddin Shaikh and Imran Khedawala and other conduct protest. Shaikh said that there is no harm in promoting the new hospital but it should not be at the cost of old hospital. "We do not mind if they promote new hospital, if they levy charges. But the old hospital should run in the manner, it has run so far," said Shaikh.



He informed that Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Operation Theatre (OT) as well as other super specialty services at the old hospital have been shut down. Even 108 emergency service is being told to take the patients to new hospital. Now only Out Patient Department (OPD) is operational, a clear indication that AMC wants to shut down the hospital. In January this year, AMC had promised that old hospital will continue as usual but with such developments, Congress is not buying the argument.



"VS hospital is used by poorest. They can't afford costly treatment at private hospital. If someone is ready to pay hefty charges, they would go to private hospital and not the AMC one," said Shaikh. He added that Congress will continue to protest to ensure that the old hospital is not shut down in the interest of those at the bottom of the pyramid in the society.
