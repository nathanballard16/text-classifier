Workers in India protest after factory fire kills 43

NEW DELHI — Day laborers in one of New Delhi’s most congested neighborhoods demonstrated against unsafe working conditions on Monday, a day after at least 43 people were killed in a devastating fire at an illegal factory there.

Dozens of workers who were asleep when the fire broke out were trapped Sunday in the burning four-story building with little ventilation and only one exit.

Tucked in an alleyway tangled with electrical wires, firefighters had to fight the blaze from 330 feet away. Rescuers carried out survivors and the dead one by one.

The building, zoned for residential use, had been clandestinely and crudely converted into a cluster of small factories in a pattern repeated in old and crowded areas across the city of 28 million.

Tens of thousands of such spaces have been closed in a drive spurred by a decades-old court case, but a Delhi Municipal Corporation census counted more than 30,000 illegal factories last year.
