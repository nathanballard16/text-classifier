RPF nabs 14 for platform thefts

Ludhiana: The Railway Protection Force (RPF) on Tuesday claimed to have arrested 14 members of a gang involved in thefts at platforms of the city railway station. The RPF have recovered raw material and hosiery goods worth Rs 1,25,000 from the accused during the ongoing special inspection drive.

RPF in-charge Anil Kumar said, “After receiving several complaints from local businessmen that some miscreants looter their hosiery goods from railway platforms, a special investigation team was constituted to hunt the accused.”

The arrests were made from local stations of Mullanpur, Jagraon and Ladhowal. “Out of 14, there were four youngsters who looted raw material such as iron rods and other costly elements. The gang allegedly works in groups of 3-4 and keeps on shuffling targets,” said Kumar.

“During the initial investigation, the cops leant that some of these miscreants used to loot passengers by intoxicating them. They would mix the drugs in water or in cream biscuits and sell them to the passenger. On consuming the spiked food items, the victims would faint for at least 24 hours. Once the passengers would go unconscious, the gang would steal their belongings and alight at the next station,” said the RPF in-charge.

All the arrested persons are youths and most of them belong to Uttar Pradesh, cops said.

The railway police have registered a case against all the accused at a local police station and are investigating the matter. The officials said this special inspection drive will continue.
