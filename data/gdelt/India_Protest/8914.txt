New Delhi: To what it seems a big blow to Gautam Adani-led Adani Group, the Chhattisgarh government on Tuesday, June 11, 2019, has ordered to halt all work on the Deposit-13 mines. The work has been allocated to Adani Enterprises by state-owned mineral-explorer National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC).

The decision to stop the work has been taken after a delegation led by Bastar MP and MLAs from the areas along with tribal leaders met with Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel. Immediate halt on deforestation of the affected area and proper action will be taken after checking illegal cutting of trees, Chhattisgarh government said in a statement.

Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has further ordered that the concerned departments should initiate correspondence with the government of India about related subjects immediately and the complaint received against the Gram Sabha that was arranged in the year 2014 will be investigated.

CM Baghel has called for an immediate halt on actions related to the project for now with regard to Deposit-13 mines, Village-Hiroli, District-Dantewada.

Earlier last week on Friday, about 10,000 tribals staged a protest in Bastar, Chhattisgarh against an iron ore mine allotted to NMDC in Bailadial Hills.
