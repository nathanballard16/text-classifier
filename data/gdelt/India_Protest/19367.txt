Parliament Winter Session 2019 Highlights: Modi govt clueless on economy, says P Chidambaram

The Modi govt is stubborn, mulish in defending catastrophic mistakes like demonetisation, flawed GST, P Chidambaram said addressing a press conference at Congress headquarters.

Parliament Winter Session: Addressing his first press conference after walking out of Tihar Jail, former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday slammed the Modi government over the state of country’s economy and said that it was clueless about how to resurrect things. “Govt clueless on economy; It is stubborn, mulish in defending catastrophic mistakes like demonetisation, flawed GST. PM has been unusually silent on economy, has left it to his ministers to indulge in bluff and bluster. Economy can be brought out of slowdown, but this government incapable of doing that,” Chidambaram, who was released on bail in the INX Media case on Wednesday evening, said. The senior Congress leader walked out of Delhi’s Tihar Jail later in the evening after spending 106 days in the prison. Meanwhile, Opposition parties led by the Congress staged a protest outside Parliament on against the skyrocketing prices of onions in the country. Chidamabaram also participated in the protest and was seen holding a placard slamming the government over the issue. The opposition parties have been targeting the government over the rising prices of onions. In Delhi’s retail market, onions are being sold for Rs 100-120 per kg. In other metro cities as well, onion prices have shot up to beyond Rs 100 a kg. On Wednesday, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said that the government has taken several steps to check rising prices of onions and has initiated steps to improve technology for better storage of the kitchen staple. The government has also decided to import onions to meet the demand. Around 10-15 trucks from Afghanistan are arriving in India daily via the Attari-Wagah land route in Amritsar.
