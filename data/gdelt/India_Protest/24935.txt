CAA protests HIGHLIGHTS: ‘PM lying about detention camps, sanctioned Rs 46 cr in 2018,’ says Tarun Gogoi

Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Protest Today HIGHLIGHTS: Calling out PM Narendra Modi’s claim that there is no detention camp in the country, senior Congress leader Tarun Gogoi Friday termed him a “liar”, adding that the BJP-led government at the Centre had sanctioned Rs 46 crore for one in Assam’s Goalpara district.

“In 2018 the Narendra Modi government had sanctioned Rs 46 crore for constructing the largest detention centre at Matia in Goalpara district of Assam for housing 3,000 illegal immigrants. Suddenly he says there is no detention camp,” Gogoi said while addressing a press conference in Guwahati.

In Mumbai, two rallies were organised on Friday —one against the amended Citizenship Act and another in favour of the new law. Students and activists gathered at Azad Maidan to voice against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), while BJP’s Sanvidan Sanman Manch drew a massive crowd at August Kranti Maidan supporting the controversial law.

Earlier in the day, a huge crowd gathered outside Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid after the Friday prayers to protest against the new citizenship law, including Congress leader Alka Lamba and former Delhi MLA Shoaib Iqbal. Lamba hit out at the central government, saying “unemployment is the real issue in the county, but you (PM) are trying to put people in a queue for NRC, as it was done during demonetisation”.
