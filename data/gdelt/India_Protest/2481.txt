Citizenship Bill: Decoding ‘Chakma Threat’ Behind Mizo Protests

As Mizoram witnesses massive protests against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), it’s not Hindu immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan that Mizos fear, but rather a Buddhist minority from Bangladesh – who are already causing a headache to Mizo organisations.

The Chakma tribals, who are mostly Buddhists, are believed to have originated from greater Arakan Yoma North area – presently Chin State in Myanmar – before they migrated to Chittagong Hills Tract (CHT) in Bangladesh in the fifteenth century.

Their migration to India took place when the Radcliffe Award of Bengal Boundary Commission awarded Chittagong Hills Tracts to Pakistan during the Partition in 1947.

The construction of the Kaptai Dam and Karnaphuli reservoir in 1962 also triggered their large scale migration to India, especially in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.
