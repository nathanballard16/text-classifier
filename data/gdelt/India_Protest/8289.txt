We have been stuck in the snarl for over two hours and there is no alternative route to avoid the packed bridge,” said Sudha, one of the trapped commuters.Vinay, another commuter, said that the department should deploy ample traffic policemen to ensure that highways are free of jams. “They could have had cranes always ready to remove such vehicles on busy routes.”Passengers travelling between Allahabad and, Lucknow and Pratapgarh through buses and private vehicles were also trapped in the jam.
