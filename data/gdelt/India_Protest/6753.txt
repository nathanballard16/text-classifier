Darshana Jardosh, who has been renominated again by BJP as candidate from Surat Lok Sabha constituency, too held a rally in Surat North, Karanj and Varachha. “Now, our focus should shift to booth management. In a short span of time, we were able to meet almost all people in our constituency and distribute voters slips,” she said.No major incident of violence was reported from any constituency, though a number of complaints about violation of model code of conduct were made to Election Commission of India by different people, sources said.With the campaigning ending, political parties will now hold informal snack parties at different places and their election offices on Monday and Tuesday to keep the supporters and voters happy. “We treat visitors to our election offices with bhajias and tea.
