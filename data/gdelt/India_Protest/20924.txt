Muslim women protest against citizenship law

Gorakhpur/ Allahabad: Muslim women staged a protest against the implementation of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near Belal Masjid Imambara in Alahdadpur area on Sunday.Holding posters and banners carrying messages like ‘Reject CAB’, ‘Boycott NRC’, and ‘We Indians Stand against NRC’, the protesters said the new law was against the spirit of the Constitution.They also stressed on the need for educational institutes for women.Speaking on the occasion, Alima Nazish Fatima said, “In Islam, a lot of importance is given to education. We appeal the government to focus on education of women as they play a key role in nation-building. We also want to register protest against CAB and NRC and urge government not to implement it.”“NRC and CAB won’t do any good to the country. Our Constitution gives equal rights to all citizens irrespective of caste, creed and religious background. CAB is against the spirit of Constitution,” she said.Another speaker, Nausheen Fatima, said discrimination of citizens on the basis of religion cannot be justified in a democracy. “If it is happening in any other country, it is equally condemnable,” she added.Meanwhile, in Allahabad, a group of over 60 people on Sunday took out a protest march against the Citizenship Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in old city pockets demanding their roll-back.The protesters carried banners and placards and asserted that both Citizenship Act and NRC are not acceptable to them.The big banner carried by the protesters read: “Are Kaum-E-Hindustan – Tujhe Samvidhan Pukar Raha Hai”.Prayagraj SSP Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj told TOI that no untoward incident was reported during the protest.”“Police dispersed them near Atala area before they could enter to other pockets,” he added.After being informed that the protest march has a sizeable strength of youngsters, police forces of three police stations were rushed to the spot. However, no violent incident was reported.
