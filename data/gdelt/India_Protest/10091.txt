18 Images Show How Severe Water Crisis Has Become In Many Parts Of India

Whatever you are doing, stop that and start praying for rains right now. India needs water and at the moment it has very little to sustain. There are no signs of monsoon rains in many parts of the country and MeT department data shows that 84 per cent of the meteorological subdivisions have recorded deficient rainfall.

The Central Water Commission has suggested that out of 91 major reservoirs in the country, 80 per cent have storage below normal. Of these, 11 have zero per cent storage, making the water crisis acute.
