Mumbai’s Nair hospital nurses protest after argument with BJP corporator

Nair Hospital nurses held a protest outside the dean’s office on Monday, alleging that BJP corporator from Mumbai Central, Sunita Lokhande, threatened a nurse on Saturday. The nurses said that the nurse was administering a relative of the corporator who is undergoing treatment at the hospital. While the dean, Ramesh Bharmal, said the issue was resolved and the nurses ended their protest after an apology from Lokhande Monday, the corporator denied the nurses’ allegation and alleged that hospital staff had been negligent towards her relative. Nurses were not giving proper treatment, and due to some tension between nurses and a doctor, both were negligent towards the patient. “Later, the corporator came and she and her family member, after an argument, threatened the nurse saying she would lose her job,” alleged a nurse.
