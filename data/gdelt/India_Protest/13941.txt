TPDK to stop Kerala buses on Tuesday over Siruvani dam diktat

COIMBATORE: Members of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam (TPDK) along with the members of 12 other parties will stage a protest in the city on Tuesday against the Kerala government’s move to reduce the maximum storage capacity of Siruvani reservoir.“If the Kerala government does not fill water to the full capacity, then we would prevent all buses registered in Kerala from entering the city and stage a massive protest at Thiruvalluvar bus stand,” TPDK general secretary Ku Ramakrishnan said on Saturday.Despite heavy rainfall in its catchment areas, water level in the reservoir had not crossed 43feet in the last one month, Ramakrishnan said. “Instead of storing rainwater, the Kerala government has been releasing it into river. The move would have a serious impact on the water distribution system and would create water shortage during the summer season.”“The Tamil Nadu government had given money to construct the reservoir and the city corporation had been spending lakhs of rupees every year for maintaining it. Just because the reservoir is located there, the Kerala government should not take such a decision,” Ramakrishnan said.Though water overflowed from the reservoir thrice last year after incessant rainfall, no damage was reported, the TPDK leader said. “Administrative inefficiency of the Kerala government had led to the 2018 flood. They should not blame the stability of the reservoir.”Parties including SDPI, CPM, Welfare Party of India, Makkal Adhikaram and Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) have extended support to the protest.
