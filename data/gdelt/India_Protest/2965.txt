Two killed on NH-65

‘Bikers were travelling in wrong direction’

Two persons were killed on the spot as their motorcycle was hit by a car on NH-65 (Hyderabad-Vijayawada) here on Tuesday evening.

The victims were related, identified as P. Gopal, 33, and V. Nagesh, 53, residents of Chandampalli village in Nakrekal mandal here.

Motorists on the highway and local legislator C. Lingaiah, who was going that way, helped take the victims to hospital, but they were declared ‘brought dead’, police said.

Nakrekal police said the duo was travelling on the wrong side in search of fuel, and at around 4.45 p.m., when they tried changing the lanes to return to Chandampalli village, a car going towards Vijayawada hit them from behind.

Both on the bike, without helmets, were thrown apart and suffered head injuries. Nagesh, along with Gopal, was reportedly returning home after distributing invitations for his daughter’s wedding slated this week.

Villagers and relatives staged a protest on the highway stalling traffic till the police intervened to pacify and disperse them. Police have taken the car driver into custody as part of the investigation, and a case has been registered.
