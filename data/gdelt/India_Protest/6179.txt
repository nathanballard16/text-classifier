3 nabbed for looting courier firm staffer

Rajkot: Three persons were arrested for looting an angadiya firm employee of gold and silver ornaments worth Rs 25 lakh near Maliya on March 1 midnight.

Rohitpuri Goswami, who works for H Pravinkumar angadiya firm, had boarded a state transport bus to deliver the ornaments in Bhuj. When he got down for tea at a highway hotel near Maliya, two of the accused who were following him as co-passengers, picked up the bag and escaped. Goswami saw them taking away the bag and shouted for help, but they fled in a car that was following the bus.

From the footages of CCTVs installed at some locations on the highway, Morbi local crime branch (LCB) nabbed Bhagwatisinh Zala, a native of Sunsar village in Patan district, Jayanti Rawal of Bodla village in Mehsana and Mukesh Thakor of Mehsana.

The cops recovered ornaments worth Rs 12.30 lakh from the trio as well as the Chevrolet car used in the crime. Two more persons identified as Madarsinh Zala and Arvind Thakor are yet to be arrested. Police said Jayanti Rawal was also involved in an angadiya loot that had taken place on Bavla-Bagodara highway last year.
