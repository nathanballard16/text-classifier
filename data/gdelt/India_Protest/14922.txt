NRC Assam: AABYSF Demands Inclusion of Hindu Bengalis’ Names

Our Correspondent

Bongaigaon: In support of various demands, the All Assam Bengali Youth Students’ Federation (AABYSF) staged a demonstration on Tuesday in Bongaigaon.

They demanded a proper NRC where not a single Indian should be excluded. Talking to media persons, Samrat Bhawal, president of AABYSF, said that most of the Hindu Bengali people of India had been deprived.

“About 12 lakh Bengali people’s names were not included in the NRC. We demand that their names should be included in the NRC unconditionally. Moreover, the people in detention camps should be released immediately. Documents given by Indian Railways should be accepted as valid documents. Unless our demands are fulfilled immediately, we will launch a massive democratic agitation in the coming days,” Samrat Bhawal said.
