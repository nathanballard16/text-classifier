Rahul demands support for protesting CA aspirants

Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that the aspirants were alleging errors in the evaluation of answer sheets. He also urged all the political parties to support them.

"Across India 12 Lakh CA students are fighting for their right to have their exam papers re-evaluated by ICAI. Given the widespread reports of errors in the evaluation of answer sheets, this demand is justified and should be supported by all political parties," Rahul Gandhi tweeted.
