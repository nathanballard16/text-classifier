KSU units oppose road projects fearing uranium extraction bid

SHILLONG: The Khasi Students’ Union (KSU) South West Khasi Hills District and KSU Umdohlun circle reiterated their opposition to the two-lane road project from Nongstoin-Wahkaji-Ranikor which, they have alleged, is linked with uranium mining.

The students bodies are going to stage sit in demonstration in front of Deputy Commissioner’s office in Mawkyrwat on January 23.

In a statement issued here on Friday, organising secretary of KSU, SWKH and president of Umdohlun circle, Dusterwell K. Lyngdoh said the union would also protest against the public hearing conducted by the District administration and PWD (Roads) on January 29.

The union asserted that the objective of bringing the two-lane road project is to facilitate the mining of uranium in the name of development. Both the Center and state governments came under criticism from the students’ union pertaining to their stand on Uranium mining, known to be a radioactive element and fuel India’s nuclear engine.

He said the Center’s intention to mine Uranium was reflected in its unwillingness to cancel the environmental clearance to mine uranium at Domiasiat and Mawthabah which is issued by Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change in 2007.

Criticising the state government, the union said the state government had till date not pass any resolution at the state legislative assembly on uranium.

“The union condemns the move of the state government to go ahead with the public hearing as the project has links with Uranium mining,” Lyngdoh said.

The union has time and again opposed uranium mining in the state raising concerns over health risks and harmful environmental impact.
