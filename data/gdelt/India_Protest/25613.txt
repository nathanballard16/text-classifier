Rahul asks Congress workers to meet the injured in anti-CAA protests

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi called on party cadres to meet the families of those killed and injured during the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) protests and to extend every possible help to them.

On Saturday, he met families of two such victims in Assam. His sister and Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has been meeting such victims and their families in Uttar Pradesh over the last few days. On Saturday, the police tried to stop her when she went to meet the family of former IPS officer S.R. Darapuri.

“Across India, many young men & women have been wounded & even killed while protesting against the CAA. I urge our Congress party workers to meet the victim’s families & provide them all possible assistance,” he said in a tweet.

Mr. Gandhi also shared a video of a protest against the amended citizenship law.

Sources said he would visit many more such families over the next few days. On the cue from senior leadership, other Congress leaders from Uttar Pradesh would be on a spree of visits. With 19 deaths, the State has seen the maximum number of deaths in anti-CAA protests in the country.

“The BJP government will not be allowed to exploit people on the basis of religion for votes any more. National interest is paramount and we believe it is not in interest of the nation,” Congress leader Jitin Prasada said a day after he visited the home in Sajjad Ganj, Lucknow, of Mohammed Vakil, who died of bullet injuries in an anti-CAA protest.
