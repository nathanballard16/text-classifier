Photo Gallery: Violent Protests Over Citizenship Law Rock India

Violent protests have sprung up in numerous parts of India in recent days as anger has grown over proposed citizenship legislation based on religion. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government says the new law will give Hindus and Christians protection from persecution in neighboring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens the secular foundations of India. Police have clashed with demonstrators in several states of India.
