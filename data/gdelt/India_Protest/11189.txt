New Delhi: Lying low since the massive mandate for the Modi government in the Lok Sabha polls, the Trump controversy charged up the Opposition on Tuesday which vehemently protested in Parliament demanding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi should clarify in both the Houses on the issue.

The Rajya Sabha leaders of the Opposition parties which includes Congress, Trinamul Congress, RJD, SP, BSP and TDP among others met in the morning on Tuesday and then again in the afternoon to chart out a joint strategy.

While in the morning meeting, it was decided to mount a coordinated attack on the government, in the afternoon meeting, the parties decided to boycott the House for the day.

Sources said that depending on the feedback from the party bosses, the entire Opposition might decide to boycott the proceedings till the Prime Minister gives a clarification on the floor of the Parliament.

A further meeting would be held at 1 pm on Wednedsay to further decide on the strategy.

Mr Trump had on Monday offered to be the “mediator” between the two countries on the Kashmir issue as he met Prime Minister Imran Khan at the White House for the first time.

After the meeting of Opposition parties at Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad’s chamber in the morning, the parties had called for a suspension of all business.

Trinamul Congress’ Derek O’Brien said, “No matter which government was in power at Centre in past, our foreign policy has been that Kashmir is a bilateral issue and no third party can intervene and Mr Trump knows it.”
