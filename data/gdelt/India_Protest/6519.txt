New Delhi: The BJP is planning a two-day show of strength by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Varanasi on April 25 and 26, with him holding a big road show in the city on the first day and filing his nomination from Varanasi the next day.Modi is also focusing on Gujarat in a big way, and will hold five more rallies, in Himatnagar, Surendranagar and Anand on April 17, Amreli on April 18 and Patan on April 21. He will again go to Ahmedabad on April 23 to cast his vote on the Gandhinagar seat from where Amit Shah is contesting.The prime minister had held two rallies in his home state on April 10. Gujarat, where Congress gave BJP a close fight in state elections in 2017, will vote on April 23.Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi , meanwhile, may reach Varanasi just before or after Modi’s visit there, as part of her party’s ‘Nyay Yatra’ that began from Fatehpur Sikri, and launch a road-cum-river trip from Varanasi to Ballia in the eastern-most part of Uttar Pradesh.Speculation is abound that Priyanka may contest from Varanasi, a seat from which neither Congress nor the SP-BSP alliance has announced their candidate so far.Priyanka has made repeated references to Varanasi lately, including asking media why she should not contest from Varanasi if she has to from some seat and later attacking Modi, saying he never hugged any poor from Varanasi. “Even if she does not contest from there, Priyanka will campaign extensively in Varanasi,” a Congress leader told ET on condition of anonymity.BJP is leaving no stone unturned to make the prime minister’s Varanasi trip a grand affair.

He would do Ganga Aarti and stay the night in Varanasi where he is also expected to meet with groups of locals.On April 26, Modi may visit the Sardar Patel statue at Maldahiya Crossing before proceeding to file his nomination. Senior party leaders and ministers will accompany him.The prime minister will take a break from his outstation election campaigning to be in Delhi on April 19, when he will attend a meeting with traders and businessmen being organised by Delhi BJP leader Vijay Goel
