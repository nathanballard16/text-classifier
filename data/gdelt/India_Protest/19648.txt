Decision on Banaras Hindu University Sanskrit professor’s appointment today

VARANASI: Envelopes containing results of fresh appointments in various faculties of Banaras Hindu University BHU ), including that of Firoz Khan in the faculties of arts and Ayurveda, will be officially opened on Monday.A meeting of BHU’s executive council was held in Delhi on Saturday to grant approval to the decisions taken by the university administration.If Khan is selected to these two departments, the university will leave on him the decision to join either of the two faculties or continuing at Sanskrit Vidya Dharm Vigyan (SVDV) faculty. SVDV students have been protesting Khan’s appointment to the faculty as an assistant professor since November 7 claiming that the appointment of a Muslim teacher would disturb their religious and traditional education.BHU spokesman Rajesh Kumar Singh said as the university offices were closed on Sunday, the envelopes of selection of assistant professors and others in different faculties would be opened on Monday.The executive council’s meeting to approve decisions taken by BHU administration in academic, research, financial and developmental issues was held under vice-chancellor Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar at India International Centre in Delhi on Saturday.Khan, who is facing strong opposition from SVDV students for his appointment as an assistant professor at Sahitya department of the faculty, had appeared for interview to the post of assistant professor at Sanskrit department in the faculty of arts on December 4.Earlier, on November 29, he had given interview for the same post in the faculty of Ayurveda. In view of the controversy generated over his initial selection, the officials are tight lipped over the results of these two interviews. “SVDV students continued their protest against Khan’s appointment on Sunday by reciting the Bhagwad Gita,” said one of the agitating students Munish Mishra. SVDV students, who had started a sit-in near the VC’s residence on November 7, had called off their stir on November 22 after giving 10 days’ time to the university administration to reply to their queries regarding the process of shortlisting of candidates.After the deadline ended on December 2, the students claimed they were dissatisfied with the reply given to them by the BHU administration and resumed their agitation.
