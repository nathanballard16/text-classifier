We have also demanded the government to extend Rs500 crore financial assistance to the goat-sheep development corporation, financial assistance to the ones who have ended their lives during the reservation movement and arms licenses to the cattle and sheep grazers. The community members had also started an indefinite fast.Following this Fadnavis had met the community members and said if they supported the BJP and if they come to power, he would take a decision regarding the Dhangar community in the first cabinet meeting.Sandeep Ghugre one of the community leaders claimed that believing Fadnavis, the community overwhelmingly supported the BJP.“However, even after coming to power the BJP government kept giving us dates for the implementation of his promise over four years ago.
