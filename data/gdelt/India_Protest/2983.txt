Samajwadi Party protest disrupts Rayja Sabha

As soon as the House met again, members from various opposition parties trooped into the Well protesting against the incident involving Yadav.

New Delhi: Protests by the Samajwadi Party and other Opposition parties over the alleged stopping of former Uttar Pradesh chief minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav at Lucknow airport to prevent him from visiting Allahabad, led to two adjournments in Rajya Sabha, which finally had to be adjourned for the day by the chair as protests continued.

The government’s efforts to move the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill, which was mentioned in the business list of the Upper House, remained unsuccessful.

In the morning when the House assembled, SP members tried to raise the issue but chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu ordered that nothing would go on record. Mr Naidu said he could not allow them to raise the issue as they have not given notice.

Mr Yadav was allegedly stopped at Chaudhary Charan Singh International Airport in Lucknow by the police in a bid to prevent him from visiting Allahabad to attend an oath-taking ceremony of a student leader at Allahabad University. The UP government said the step was taken on the request of the university as there was apprehension that Mr Yadav’s visit could trigger violence on the campus.

The House had to be adjourned till 2 pm after SP members started shouting slogans. When the Rajya Sabha reassembled, SP, BSP, TMC, RJD, continued their protests following which the House was adjourned till 2.35 pm.

As soon as the House met again, members from various opposition parties trooped into the Well protesting against the incident involving Mr Yadav.

Deputy chairman Harivansh tried to pacify the members saying that the Chairman did not receive any notice regarding the issues being raised by them and therefore a discussion on them cannot be allowed.
