Rough Rahon Road to be rebuilt in November

Ludhiana: The rough Rahon Road will now be reconstructed.After a wait of almost 2.5 years, the public works department has received the state government’s permission to rebuild Rahon Road’s 3km stretch from octroi post. Commuters use this stretch to travel outside the city, to adjoining villages and Nawanshahr.With the road’s poor condition putting lives of commuters’ at risk, residents had staged many a protest to draw authorities’ attention.As all pleas fell on deaf ears, NGO Bhai Ghanhayia Ji Nishkam Sewa Society, along with 45 villages, filled the road’s potholes to check accidents.Avinash Kumar, a resident of Chander Lok Colony, said, “A few years ago, sewerage lines were laid in villages falling on Rahon Road. After the completion of the project, the road was to be reconstructed. But the change of government in the state left the work in limbo.”Kamaljit Singh, a resident of Naginder Nagar, said, “In the wake of the 550th birth anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev, various religious events are being organized in many cities and people take this route to reach there. Besides, there are many industrial establishments on this road near Seera village and heavy vehicles ply the stretch. Even the industrialists had requested the authorities to repair the road.”The number of vehicles plying the stretch increased after a bridge was constructed on Satluj river. The road helps cut the journey time to Nawanshahr by at least half-an-hour.Public works department superintending engineer Kulwant Singh said, “We have received permission from the state government to rebuild the damaged parts of the road at the cost of Rs 3 crore. We will start the tendering process and are hopeful to begin the work by next month.”
