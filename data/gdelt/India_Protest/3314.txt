Karnataka MP protests China’s support to terrorist Masood

Bengaluru: Condemning the deadly terror attack on CRPF troopers in Kashmir, Karnataka BJP’s Rajya Sabha member Rajeev Chandrasekhar on Friday protested China’s backing to dreaded Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) head Masood Azar. “China’s culpability in allowing Azhar to roam around and mount terror attacks against India must be accounted. “Pakistan has a perverse way of looking at issues and approaching things even as the US signals withdrawing from Afghanistan. Heading the Pakistan-based terror outfit, he lives and moves freely in Pakistan,” said Chandrasekhar. As Pakistani Army fears a power vacuum in the war-torn country, it wants to occupy it by keeping India and its troops engaged with terror attacks in Kashmir,” the MP said.
