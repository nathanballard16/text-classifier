Parents threaten to self-immolate

VIBGYOR FEE HIKE



The issue escalated after a student was expelled in Oct ’18



Three parents who have protested for over three years against Vibgyor School’s fee hike have now threatened to self-immolate at Central Building, Pune, if the state government does not take a decision by April 9. Prajakta Pethkar and Gunjan Mehta — whose kids study at the school’s NIBM branch — and Rupali Mahajan, whose kid is enrolled at the Magarpatta branch, have taken the battle to Bombay High Court (HC) after Pethkar’s son was expelled in October 2018.



On March 26, these parents had also approached the chief secretary of education, who had assured them that the student can appear for the final examination. The school had denied permission the very next day.



Pethkar said, “Nothing transpired even after education officers had requested the school. Now, we have asked for a special counsellor so that my son does not face any problem.”



In March 2018, an FIR was lodged against the school by the deputy director of education. However, parents claim that things have not moved ahead.



Education commissioner Vishal Solanki said, “We have tried to work on the case in tandem with the legal framework. The court has issued a stay on all the state government authorities and the work to vacate this order is in progress.”



A spokesperson from Vibgyor said that parents were told about the hike, way before the 2018-19 term commenced. “The child was not granted admission due to non-payment of fees — for academic years 2016-17 and 2017-18 — as fixed with the limit and permitted by HC. The school’s decision has also been placed before the court, wherein the state government and other authorities have been restrained from taking coercive action in this regard against the school.”
