Mumbai: BEST bus commuters were affected on Tuesday after the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply Transport (BEST) employees went on an indefinite strike from Monday evening. BEST buses continued to remain off roads, adding to the woes of citizens already affected due to the ongoing Bharat Bandh protests by Central Trade Union (CTU) workers. Many officer-goers were forced to resort to other means of transport including private operators to travel to work due to the unavailability of buses.

"As per the latest information from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation control (BMC) room, BEST buses will be on an indefinite strike from 5 am on Tuesday," Mumbai Police tweeted. The BEST employees have been demanding that the BEST budget should be merged with the budget of Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Recruitment and employee service residences are some of the other issues on the demand list of the agitating BEST employees. According to news agency ANI, the employees began their strike after talks with the authorities failed.

Meanwhile, the state transport department ran 40 extra buses in the view of the indefinite strike by BEST employees over demands of implementation of the merger of the BEST budget with the principal budget of the BMC, employee service residences etc- news agency ANI reported.
