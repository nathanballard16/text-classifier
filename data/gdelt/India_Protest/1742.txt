Man sets himself on fire outside police headquarters

Suffers about 80% burns; his condition is critical: doctors

A 25-year-old allegedly suffered about 80% burns after he set himself on fire outside the Delhi Police headquarters on Sunday night.

He was rushed to a hospital, where doctors said his condition is critical. He has been admitted to the ICU.

Police sources said the man has been identified with the help of ID cards found in his possession. He seems to be mentally disturbed.

They said he lives in a rented house in Pandav Nagar, but belongs to Kanpur. His family’s statement will be recorded, the police said.

Crowd takes pictures

Local shopkeepers claimed that they spotted the man near the mosque, located besides the police headquarters at ITO around 8 p.m.

They said he was carrying a bag and kept walking around. A few minutes later, he set himself on fire.

The police said a crowd gathered around him. Instead of dousing the fire, they were busy clicking pictures. He was rescued after staff from a PCR van and the IP Estate Police wrapped a blanket around him.

Money issue

Preliminary inquiry revealed that he had lent money to some people, who refused to return it. His family told the police that he was upset due to this.

The police claimed that he had not approached them with a complaint.

An inquiry has been initiated to find out whether he was turned away by the police.

Footage from CCTV cameras at ITO metro station and the police headquarters are being scanned to establish the sequence of events, said the officials
