Arundhati: Please stand up against CAA

‘We’re faced with biggest challenge since independence’

NEW DELHI, Dec 19: Famous writer-activist Arundhati Roy appealed Indian citizens to stand up and protest the discriminatory Citizenship Amendment Act passed by the Modi government last week.

Issuing a statement, the author of “The God of Small Things” and many other acclaimed books said, “We are faced with the biggest challenge since independence”.

“It will break the back of our Constitution and cut the ground from under our feet,” said Roy.

Drawing parallels between demonetisation and CAA, Roy blamed the Modi government for “breaking the back of the country’s economy”.

“Three years ago, we stood in line obediently outside banks as demonetisation was imposed on us, a policy that broke the back of our country’s economy,” her statement reads that was issued on Monday.

“Are we going to stand in line once again, obediently, and comply with the policy that eerily resembles the 1935 Nuremberg Laws of the Third Reich,” Roy asked.

She said India will cease to exist if we accept this, adding that “we are faced with the biggest challenge since Independence.” “Please. Stand up,” she appealed.
