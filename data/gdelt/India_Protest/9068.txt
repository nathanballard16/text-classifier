BJP workers hit the streets against land sale to Jindals

BJP workers protest in Bengaluru on Thursday against sale of land at throwaway price to the Jindals in Ballari.

Bengaluru: The BJP on Thursday held a massive protest against the state government's decision to hand over 3,600 acres of land to the Jindal group in Ballari.

The BJP, along with some Congress leaders including H.K. Patil has been alleging that the government decided to give away the land to the private steel maker at a throwaway price.

Thousands of party workers led by party leaders including R. Ashok and Bengaluru South MP Tejasvi Surya held a protest near Maurya Circle. Then they attempted to move towards Vidhana Soudha to lay siege to the state secretariat when the police detained them. Addressing the party workers, Mr Ashok said the coalition government has looted the state. Referring to an observation made by Dy CM G. Parameshwar, he alleged that the PWD department led by Mr H.D. Revanna had witnessed unprecedented corruption.

On the Jindal issue, Mr Ashok took a dig at former CM Siddaramaiah and said that the former CM had taken out a padayatra to Ballari on the illegal mining issue and now, he will not even open his mouth on the subject. The BJP has decided to intensify its agitation. It has decided to launch a dharna for three days from Friday.
