Protesters smashed windows of the Indian High Commission and even broke a windowpane of the building as they carried flags of Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir (PoK) and raised "freedom" slogans.

Confirming the violent protest, the Indian High Commission had tweeted, "Another violent protest outside the Indian High Commission in London today, 3 September 2019. Damage caused to the premises." The Indian High Commission had also shared a photo of the damaged window pane on Twitter.

Responding to the tweet by India in the UK, London Mayor Sadiq Khan condemned the violent protests, saying it was "unacceptable". "I utterly condemn this unacceptable behaviour and have raised this incident with @metpoliceuk to take action," London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted.

Tuesday's incident had marked the second time after India raised concerns over protests outside the Indian High Commission on August 15.
