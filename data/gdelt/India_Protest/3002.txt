He also said that other secular parties would join the alliance after the elections because of some state-level differences at present.* Several leaders from opposition parties, including Arvind Kejriwal, former Prime Minister Dr Manmohan Singh, Congress president Rahul Gandhi , NC chief Farroq Abdullah and Loktantrik Janata Dal chief Sharad Yadav visited Naidu at the dharna site in Delhi's Andhra Pradesh Bhavan.* AAP said an invite has been sent to Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, but he is unlikely to attend the rally. However, some senior leader from the party is expected to join the opposition.* There were talks of an alliance between the AAP and the Congress for the Lok Sabha polls, but the local leadership of the grand old party is believed to have been against it. The AAP and the Congress have been bitter rivals in Delhi and Punjab.* Rebel BJP MP Shatrughan Sinha is also expected to attend the rally.
