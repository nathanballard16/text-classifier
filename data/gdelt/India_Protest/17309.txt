Advocates in district abstain from work

Coimbatore: Thousands of advocates in the district boycotted work on Monday to mark their protest against the clash between lawyers and police at Tis Hazari court in New Delhi a few days ago.

The protesters demanded suspension of the police officers, who had attacked the lawyers. As many as 28 people were injured and several vehicles were destroyed during the clash.

Condemning the incident, advocates practicing in district and subordinate courts in the State had boycotted work for one day, said P Nandakumar, chairman of the Joint Advocates Associations Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry (JACC). “A similar incident took place at the Madras high court in 2009. To prevent such incidents, the government should take a conclusive decision after holding discussions with the police department and judges,” he said.

As many as 7,000 advocates, including those from Mettupalayam and Pollachi courts, participated in the boycott, sources said.
