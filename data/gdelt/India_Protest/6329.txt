Climate change strikes: Hundreds of students set to join nationwide protest for third time in three months

H undreds of students are expected to join nationwide protests today for a third time as part of an international youth campaign demanding action on climate change.

Organisers behind the Youth Strike 4 Climate movement said "sizeable events" are due to take place in major towns and cities in the UK, including a protest in London.

Protests earlier this year saw police intervening as roads came to a standstill, activists scaling traffic lights and statues, and some sitting in front of buses.

Friday’s strike will be the third in as many months.

Those going on strike said they are demanding the Government declares a state of climate emergency, and reforms the curriculum "to address climate change as an educational priority".

They are also campaigning for the voices of young people to be considered when it comes to policy-making and for the voting age to be lowered to 16

The strikes come in the wake of a UN report which warned that limiting global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels, beyond which climate impacts become increasingly severe, requires unprecedented action.

That includes cutting global carbon dioxide emissions by almost half within 12 years.

Environment Secretary Michael Gove has previously spoken of his support for strikes, saying: "Collective action of the kind you're championing can make a difference, and a profound one."
