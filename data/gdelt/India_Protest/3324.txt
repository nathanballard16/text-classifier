Kangana Ranaut on Shabana Azmi cancelling Karachi visit post the Pulwama attack: They're just trying to save their faces

Terming Shabana Azmi an "anti-national", Kangana Ranaut slammed her for organizing events in Pakistan in the first place

Bollywood veteran Shabana Azmi and her husband, lyricist Javed Akhtar had been invited by the Karachi Art Council for a two-day literature conference to celebrate the actress's father, the late Kaifi Azmi's writings.

However, the duo declined their invitation on Friday, as a sign of protest against the dastardly Pulwama suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

While the couple got much praise for their action, Bollywood actor Kangana Ranaut questioned why did they organize the event there, at the first place.
