CPI to rethink support to TRS in Huzurnagar

Government should back down on dismissal of RTC staff, says CPI

The Communist Party of India is likely to rethink on supporting TRS candidate in the Huzurnagar byelection in the backdrop of the strike by TSRTC trade unions, according to party State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy. He said the support may be withdrawn in the event of the government not taking back its decision on dismissal of the about 50,000 workers and employees of TSRTC.

Addressing a press conference, Mr. Venkat Reddy said the support extended by CPI to TR candidate was conditional. He said the party was assured of justice to farmers who suffered injustice thanks to the land records purification project and rights on podu lands, among others, he added.

The CPI leader condemned social media propaganda accusing him of giving in to inducements by the TRS for extending support in Huzurnagar byelection.

He said the decision to support was taken by the party and he did not give in to inducements of any kind.

Meanwhile, the CPI will conduct protests across the country on October 16 on the current situation prevailing in the country, Mr. Venkat Reddy said. The party was conducting meetings across the country until October 16 reviewing the situation.

Criticising the BJP, the CPI leader said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s economic policies have resulted in economic slowdown. He said protests will also be staged against the policy of promoting communalism of the BJP government.
