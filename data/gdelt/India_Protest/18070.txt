Citizenship Amendment Bill: RSS volunteers fan out in Northeast to explain Citizenship Amendment Bill

GUWAHATI: With several northeast groups raising their voice against the NDA government’s plan to introduce the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the winter session, RSS volunteers have fanned out to different parts of the region to explain the nuances of the bill.RSS is pressing for the bill as the final National Register of Citizens (NRC), published on August 31, was not up to its expectations.“We know there will be protest and opposition to the bill but we will reach out to the people to explain that it will not affect the demographic profile of Assam,” a senior RSS leader told ET.“Our volunteers have started reaching out to villages with leaflets that will explain in local language why the bill is necessary and how it won’t affect the indigenous people as has been claimed by some organisations,” he said.The RSS leader assured the bill will hardly impact Assam or any other northeastern state. “The bill is for the whole country and will be a big relief for several stateless people in Delhi, West Bengal, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.”Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had said in Nalbari recently that the revised bill will be placed in Parliament in the winter session.“The revised draft of CAB is different from the earlier one and will protect the unique culture and identity of the people of northeast,” said Sarma.The minister said in the Lok Sabha elections and panchayat polls, people had voted for BJP when CAB was an election issue. He said BJP had been committed to the CAB since 30 years.However, there have been a lot of resentment against the bill and student bodies have voiced their anger against it. The umbrella organisation of student bodies of the region, North East Students’ Organisation, will hold demonstrations on Monday.“We will not accept the bill — it is unconstitutional, illegal and anti-indigenous. We won’t accept it under any circumstances,” said All Assam Students Union (Aasu) chief adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya.The bill is aimed at making minority communities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan eligible to apply for Indian citizenship. The bill was passed by the Lok Sabha on January 8 but due to protests from several organisations in northeast and some NDA allies, it was not tabled in the Rajya Sabha BJP had often argued that as the NRC authority refused to accept refugee certificates issued before 1971, large-scale Bengali Hindu, Koch Rajbonshi and Buddhists couldn’t make it to the list. Before the Lok Sabha polls early this year, RSS cadres across Assam initiated mass contact programmes, where they explained that the bill is not inconsistent with the interests of the indigenous people in the region.
