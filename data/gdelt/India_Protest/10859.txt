Ministry to consider merger of Mangaluru Railway region with SWR

Minister of State for Railways Suresh Angadi on Wednesday promised to consider the demand for merger of Mangaluru Railway region with South Western Railway as decided by the Ministry in 2004.

He was responding to a plea by Nalin Kumar Kateel, Dakshina Kannada MP, who led a delegation of rail activists from the region to the Minister with the demand. Mr. Kateel told the Minister that the Ministry had decided to merge the region with SWR following persistent demand from people on the grounds that requirements of the region were not being met by the Palakkad division of Southern Railway, which presently has the jurisdiction.

A statement from the MP’s office here said Mr. Angadi responded positively and said the issue had come to his notice.

The MP also put forth some other long-pending demands before the Minister, who promised to look into them as well.

Other demands

They include operating the Bengaluru-Kannur/Karwar overnight express via Shravanabelagola on all days of the week, instead of the present four-days via Shravanabelagola and three days via Mysuru; operating Yeshwantpur-Mangaluru Central overnight express (16585/586) on all days of the week and changing its departure timing from Yeshwantpur from the present 4.30 p.m. to a convenient timing in the night, and speeding up construction of additional platforms (4 and 5) at Mangaluru Central Railway Station.

The Minister also responded positively to the demand for reintroduction of Mangaluru-Miraj Mahalakshmi Express that was stopped during the gauge conversion work of Hassan-Mangaluru line.
