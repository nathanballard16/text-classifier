Big Story: 19 for ‘19



As we prepare to lay 2019 to rest over the next few days and brace ourselves for a 2020 that will undoubtedly be more tumultuous, I wondered what might be the best way of looking back at the year.

The Political Fix is now a little over six months old – nine if you count the Election Fix, which preceded it. And in that time we’ve covered a massive amount of ground, from parochial policies in Andhra Pradesh to Narendra Modi’s escapades in Texas, with Nithya Subramanian’s amazing illustrations underlining all of it.

Although year-end listicles may be cliched, they do offer one advantage: variety. For a country as complex as India, you may be able to encapsulate a whole year through the lens of one topic (hint: the Bharatiya Janata Party) but there is much more going on that is worth mentioning.

And so, at the very end of 2019, instead of your regular set of analysis, headlines and op-eds, here are 19 things we learned about Indian politics in 2019.

That’s all from the Political Fix for 2019. Do write in to rohan@scroll.in telling us what you expect from Indian politics in 2020 and also what you would like to see from the Political Fix next year.

Thanks for reading, and have a Happy New Year.
