As many as 1,726 people were apprehended in the city and its adjoining areas for allegedly flouting law on Christmas Eve, a top police officer said on Wednesday.

Of the 1726, 143 were arrested under non-bailable warrants, he said.

While 558 were nabbed for disorderly conduct, nine were taken into custody for gambling, 262 for triple-riding on two-wheelers and 496 for riding bikes without helmets, Joint Commissioner of Police (Crime) Murli Dhar Sharma told PTI.

At least 106 have been apprehended for drunk driving and 66 people for rash driving, he said.

Also, a total of 86 people were taken into preventive custody, Sharma added.

West Bengal Police claimed that there was no untoward incident during the Christmas celebrations in the city or anywhere else in the state, where thousands took to the streets to soak in the Yuletide spirit.

"People from all walks of life are celebrating together and peacefully, and there is an environment of festivity. There are no incidents of law and order violation anywhere," an officer of West Bengal Police said.

Elaborate security arrangements have been put in place in and around the city as well as areas bordering West Bengal to avert any attempt to disrupt normal life during Christmas and New Year festivities, police sources said.
