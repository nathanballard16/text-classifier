Ruckus in PSERC meeting, SAD stages protest

LUDHIANA: Unruly scenes were witnessed in the public hearing being conducted by Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) chairman Kusamjit Kaur Sidhu at Ludhiana on Wednesday as Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) workers led by party's district youth wing president Gurdeep Singh Gosha stormed the meeting and started protesting against state government, PSERC and Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL).The protesters who were holding placards and cartoons of Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh alleged that Punjab government has cheated industrial consumers by claiming that the power to the industry was being supplied at Rs 5 per unit.The protesters refused to leave the venue and instead started shouting slogans against Punjab Government and both the departments. Unable to control the situation, PSPCL officials called police following which protesters were forcibly taken out of the hall and meeting was resumed.Gurdeep Singh Gosha who led the protest said, "This was a public hearing in which any member of public having grievances related to PSPCL could participate. For the past 2 years, we have been hearing that the industry of Punjab is being given power at Rs 5 per unit but in reality the industry is being robbed by Captain Amarinder Singh and his government by charging double the amount.”We went to the meeting to seek the stand of PSERC and PSPCL on these false claims. As officials were unable to reply to our questions and repeatedly asked us to leave the venue, we were left with no option except for to protest."Gosha also claimed that the Akali workers have decided to expose the Punjab government on its ‘false propaganda’ of supplying cheap power to factories of the state and ‘robbing the businessmen of Punjab of crore of rupees by overcharging them.’“This injustice will not be tolerated any more and we will take to streets to make people aware about this bluff being played by Congress government for last two years now. I am seeking legal opinion on this issue and soon i will file petition in high court on this issue," he said.
