Residents protest against BDA’s decision on CA site

Members of Sir M. Visvesvaraya Layout Welfare Association have accused Bangalore Development Authority (BDA) of allocating a civic amenities site to a private education society. Association members and other residents staged a protest on Sunday against the move.

The association claimed that in 2011, the BDA took a decision to allot a CA site in third block for constructing a Visvesvaraya Bhavan as per the request of the association. A compound wall was also built around the site and two name boards were erected.

However, last December, the BDA took a decision to allot the site to a private institution. The protesters said the BDA took an arbitrary decision without consulting the residents.

The protesters threatened to intensify their agitation if the BDA continued to ignore their demand.

A BDA official told The Hindu that the issue raised by the residents would be looked into.
