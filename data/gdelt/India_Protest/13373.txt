In a bizzare development from Islamabad, Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said that all 138 trains from Pakistan will stop for one minute between 12 pm to 12:30 pm every Friday to show solidarity over the abrogation of Article 370 in Kashmir.

Earlier, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has asked the people of Pakistan to stand up for Kashmir every Friday between 12 to 12:30 pm.

Imran Khan's asked the people of Pakistan to stand by Kashmir every week, as an effort to show solidarity.

He said, "We should give Kashmiri people a message that we are with them. We will do an event every week, in schools, universities and offices. This Friday, from 12 to 12:30, you must stop work and stand with the public to tell the people that we are with Kashmiri people. Those who are at home, should also get on the streets, so that people should know we are standing with them."

Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to revoke Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories.

Pakistan expelled the Indian High Commissioner after it downgraded the diplomatic ties with India in protest to India's decision to end Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Pakistan also suspended its trade with India and stopped the train and bus services.
