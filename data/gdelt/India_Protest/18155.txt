Fee protests: Indian cops baton charge JNU students

Indian police yesterday fought street battles in New Delhi with thousands of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students who stepped up protests over fee increases at one of the country’s top universities. Police baton charged some groups of demonstrators and media reports said dozens of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University were detained. Defying a ban on groups of more than four people, demonstrators started a march from the university to the parliament as part of their action against higher costs for accommodation as well as curfews and other restrictions on campus. They broke through police barricades and police had to close three metro stations because of the troubles.
