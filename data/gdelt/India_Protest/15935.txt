Tibetans protesting against Xi detained in Chennai

The police have detained five Tibetans who were protesting against the Chinese president Xi Jinping near the ITC Grand Chola hotel on Friday.

The coastal town of Mamallapuram will host the Indo-China summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr. Xi between October 11 to 13.

The Chinese president who will arrive this afternoon is scheduled to stay at the ITC Grand Chola. “Five Tibetans started raising slogans against the Chinese president. They were removed from the spot and taken to Guindy police station,” said a police officer.

The police have detained close to 20 Tibetans over the past few days to thwart protests. Six others have been detained at the Chennai Airport.
