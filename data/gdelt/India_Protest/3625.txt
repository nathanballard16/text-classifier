We have always hoped that one day, we would visit India,” said Myoung Nam Kim, exhibition commissioner.Why India? CHENNAI: Thirteen members of Sonamou, a Korean artists’ collective based in Paris, along with French artists, will present an exhibition – called Interlace -- in the Varija Gallery of DakshinaChitra here from February 23 to March 4.Also, a workshop will be held at InKo Centre on March 4 and 5.“India is a country that has always been inspiring, existing deep inside of us, somewhere in our memory. “Poems of Tagore, Mahatma Gandhi, Mother Teresa, and spiritual ideas, fascinating colours, a distinctive cultural flavour…All of these led us to have countless dreams and feel an irresistible pull towards the deep and glorious civilization of India,” said Kim.“Through this exhibition, we hope to be more open with one another, see each other with a fresh perspective, commune and share one another’s culture and in the process, immeasurably broaden the scope of our work,” she said.Entry for the workshop is free but the intake per session is limited and registration is on a first-come, first-served basis, said a release from DakshinaChitra.For details, call 9841266149.
