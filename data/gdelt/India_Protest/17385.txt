Modi-Sonowal meet to discuss citizenship bill

Guwahati: A day after anti-Citizenship (Amendment) bill protests rocked the state, Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Tuesday evening rushed to Delhi.

Sonowal is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. Apart from Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), Sonowal is also likely to take up the issue of the ongoing talks between the NSCN (IM) and Central government and its impact on Assam.

Several civil society organisations in Assam have started a series of anti-CAB protests across the state from Monday. Organisations like AASU, Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) and several others have threatened to launch house to house campaign to make the people aware against the CAB.

Although Assam had not seen much protests over the ongoing Naga talks and its impact in the state, tension is simmering in areas along the Assam-Nagaland border and in Dima Hasao and Karbi Anglong districts of Assam over the Naga talks. (IANS)
