News India: Mahendra Singh Gond sentenced to death over child rape

A teacher in India has been sentenced to death for a "gruesome" sex attack which left a four-year-old girl so badly injured she needed surgery to realign her intestines.

Mahendra Singh Gond abducted the girl on the night of June 30 last year in the Madhya Pradesh region, the Times of India has reported.

He raped the child and left her for dead in the jungle, where her family found her in the early hours of the morning.

She was airlifted to hospital, where she spent months in recovery, while police arrested Gond within hours.

He was initially handed a death sentence for the crime on September 19, with the trial including a statement provided by the victim via screen.

The death sentence was confirmed by the Madhya Pradesh high court on January 25.

In a statement, judges PK Jaiswal and Anjuli Palo said the significance of the crime was exacerbated because of Gond's position which meant he was "supposed to teach lessons in morality to his students".

"Courts cannot evade their duty to be tough with hard-core criminals so that there is some deterrent against indulging such gruesome crimes, particularly because such crimes are on the rise," they said.

A district court has since issued a death notice to the jail where Gond is being held, setting the date of the execution at March 2.
