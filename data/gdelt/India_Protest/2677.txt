United Special Olympics inaugurated

Governor Banwarilal Purohit inaugurated the United Special Olympics 2019 at the Jawaharlal Nehru Indoor Stadium in Chennai on Saturday. He also wished luck to the participants of the World Summer Games to be held in Abu Dhabi on March 2019.

Applauding the organisers Madras West Round Table 10, Madras Ladies Circle and Special Olympics Bharat, Mr. Purohit said, “The event establishes the fact that disabilities need not stand in the way of achievement.” “Stephen Hawking had a motor neuron disease. But it did not prevent him from achieving greatness,” he added.
