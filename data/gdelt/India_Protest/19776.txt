JNU students hold march, lathicharged

New Delhi, December 9Scores of JNU students were lathicharged by the police and several of them detained when they tried to march towards Rashtrapati Bhawan against the hostel fee hike here today. According to JNU Students Union president Aishe Ghosh, “Several students, including women, have been detained by police which brutally attacked the protesters, asking us to go back to campus. The commuters should avoid the route,” the Delhi Traffic Police tweeted. The HRD Ministry had set up a three-member committee to look into ways to restore normal functioning in the JNU and mediate between the agitating students and the administration. The JNU’s Executive Council had then announced a partial rollback of the hike for students belonging to the BPL category and not availing any scholarships.
