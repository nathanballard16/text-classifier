BJP Mahila Morcha protests against govt

Members form human chain at ITO

The Delhi BJP Mahila Morcha on Monday protested against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government for its “failure” to implement the Ayushman Bharat Yojana in the Capital.

The protesters formed a human chain at ITO here.

Led by Morcha’s president Poonam Parashar Jha, the protesters accused Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal of “cheating” the people of the Capital and suggested that he wake up from “his deep slumber” or resign from his post.

“The innocent people of Delhi were cheated by Kejriwal’s false image of a crusader against corruption and as a fighter for the Jan Lokpal. They gave him a massive mandate and he came to power in Delhi. During the last four years of Kejriwal’s rule, the people of Delhi have been disappointed,” Ms. Jha said.

“PM Narendra Modi introduced the Ayushman Bharat scheme for the medical care of the common man...due to the anarchic character of Kejriwal, this scheme has not been implemented in Delhi and the people have been deprived of its benefits,” she said.

Ms. Jha questioned Mr. Kejriwal, who she accused of “misleading the people in the name of full statehood”, for not implementing the “largest scheme of the country” framed for the welfare of the people terming him “the greatest enemy of the people of Delhi” by obstructing the implementation of the scheme.
