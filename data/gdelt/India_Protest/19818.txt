Protests rage in north-east India over citizenship Bill

GUWAHATI (AFP) - Protestors in north-east India set fire to tyres and cut down trees to block roads on Tuesday (Dec 10) in a shutdown across the region hours after lawmakers approved the government's new citizenship Bill.

The legislation, set to go before the Upper House on Wednesday, will fast-track citizenship claims from refugees from three neighbouring countries - but not if they are Muslim.

For Islamic groups, the opposition, rights groups and others, this fits into Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda to marginalise India's 200 million Muslims - something he denies.

People in north-east India object for different reasons, fearing that large numbers of Hindu migrants from Bangladesh who they say are intruders will be given citizenship.

On Tuesday, the region sandwiched between Bangladesh, China and Myanmar was crippled by a general strike called by dozens of organisations, with buses off the roads and most schools and shops shut.

"The bandh (strike) have drawn a total response in the north-eastern states," said Mr Samujjal Bhattacharyya from the powerful umbrella group the North East Students' Organisation.

"We have made it clear ... that CAB (the Citizenship Amendment Bill) will not be accepted and we are going to intensify our agitation," he told AFP.

"Assam and north-eastern states had already taken a huge burden of illegal foreigners," he said.

COMPARED TO NAZIS

India's Lower House passed the Bill just after midnight following a fiery debate that saw one Muslim MP compare the government to the Nazis.
