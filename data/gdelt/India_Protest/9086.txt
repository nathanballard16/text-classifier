West Bengal doctors’ strike HIGHLIGHTS: Mamata invites agitating doctors for meeting, medicos refuse

West Bengal doctors’ strike HIGHLIGHTS: West Bengal doctors’ protest entered its fourth day Friday as doctors continued to demand adequate security. In an attempt to solve the impasse, five senior doctors met West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the evening. On conclusion of the meeting, the physicians said Banerjee has invited the junior doctors to the state secretariat tomorrow for a discussion over the issue. However, the junior medicos turned down the offer.

Meanwhile, more than a hundred senior medical practitioners across various state-run hospitals tendered their resignations on Friday accusing Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee of failing to tackle the situation. The Indian Medical Association also launched a three-day nationwide protest and called for a strike on June 17 with the demand of proper security of the doctors in all hospitals. Meanwhile, Mamata Banerjee reiterated that outsiders were involved in the strike by medical bodies in the state.

Earlier in the day, Calcutta High Court refused to pass an interim order on the ongoing strike and sought details of the steps taken by the Bengal government over the alleged attacks on doctors. It gave the government time till June 21. The doctors on Thursday defied an ultimatum issued by Mamata to resume work after she paid an unannounced visit to SSKM Hospital around noon and spoke to unattended patients. “Whatever happened was unfortunate, but at times relatives of patients get agitated. We have taken action and police have made arrests,” she said.
