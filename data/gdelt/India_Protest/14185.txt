BSNL: BSNL federation opposes job cuts, says contract workers remain unpaid for 222 days, Telecom News, ET Telecom

NEW DELHI: The contract workers of state-controlled Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited ( BSNL ) who remain unpaid for more than seven months or 222 days precisely, are opposing the management’s retrenchment move with plans afoot to hold a mega strike.“We have not been paid for over seven months now, and have been asking the government not to exterminate contract workers,” BSNL Casual & Contract Workers Federation ( BSNLCCWF ) president VAN Namboodiri told ETTelecom.The Delhi-based group that represents more than 80,000 contact workers across BSNL’s licensed services areas, has said that over the last few months, cash-strapped BSNL’s top management removed nearly 20% of the indirect workforce and is also looking to further reduce the base on a month-on-month basis.“The BSNL management is saying that they have no sufficient funds to pay wages to contract workers,” Namboodiri said and added the telco ’s employee bodies were planning protests and strikes across circles if the situation remains unchanged.On Tuesday, contract workers in Kerala circle staged a hunger strike demanding immediate disbursement of their wage arrears.In a letter dated August 28, 2019, to BSNL chairman, the group has sought funds to circles to clear wages of workers including labourers so that their families could be saved from starvation and day-to-day BSNL’s network maintenance work could be restored.Plagued with high revenue-to-wage ratio, the state-run telco is finding it hard to meet the salary expenses of nearly Rs 800 crore monthly to its 1.63 lakh-strong employee base and has already delayed remuneration in March, July, and August in the current year.BSNL’s annual operating expense comes at Rs 10,500 crore, and according to its chairman Pravin K Purwar , the telco has been taking a slew of initiatives to save cost by cutting down on its internal expenses as well as increasing income from real estate and tower rentals.Inability to foray into commercial ultra-high-speed data services in the absence of fourth-generation or 4G airwaves is eventually making BSNL’s annual revenue tumble, which is pegged at nearly Rs 19,308 crore for 2018-19, compared with Rs 25,071 crore in 2017-18 and Rs 31,533 crore in 2016-17.Subscribers desist state-driven telco for private sector rivals such as Reliance Jio, Bharti Airtel and Vodafone Idea to upgrade to 4G-based services, following the availability of cost-effective smartphones in tier-2 and tier-3 cities.On the back of squeezed funds, the fourth-largest telecom carrier is also not able to clear vendor-partners’ dues for the last two quarters with some homegrown firms majorly relying on BSNL business are on the verge of shutdown, following nonpayment to staff and creditors.However, over the last few months, the Narendra Modi-led government is mulling the revival package for both— BSNL and Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Limited ( MTNL ) that would include allocation of 4G spectrum, Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) and assets monetisation.
