How ASAT works: Aimed at destroying space assets, can hit targets with precision - All you need to know

DRDO said a Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) Interceptor Missile successfully engaged an Indian orbiting target satellite in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in a 'Hit to Kill' mode.

India's successful anti-satellite missile test on Wednesday showed that the country now possesses the capability to strike satellites in outer space with centimetre-level accuracy and precision, DRDO Chairman G Satheesh Reddy said Wednesday.

Reddy, who oversaw the top secret operation, said the government accorded clearance to the project around two years back with an aim to deter threats to the country's space assets.

In a major feat, a DRDO-developed missile destroyed a low-orbiting satellite in a critical test that catapulted India as a space power alongside the US, China and Russia.

The anti-satellite weapon capability demonstrated by India was first developed by the US in 1959, primarily to counter the erstwhile Soviet Union.
