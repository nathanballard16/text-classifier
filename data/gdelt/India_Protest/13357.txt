Scores of students of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU) staged a protest late on Wednesday night against the poor quality of food served to them.

Students of New Engineering Girls' Hostel first took out a march late night on Wednesday inside the campus and then organised a dharna outside the office of the director, PK Jain, demanding better quality of food in the campus. The students also complained of low wifi signals in the hostel.

Speaking to the media, a student said, "We had also protested outside the director' s office two days ago against the poor quality of food served to us. Earlier, we were assured that immediate measures will be taken to solve our grievances but nothing has been done so far."

Another student echoed similar concerns. "We are protesting with utensils in our hand to highlight the poor quality food which is being served to us everyday. In the boys' hostel, good quality food is served and similar meals should be provided to us."

"This is a new hostel where the girls have been shifted recently. We have already instructed the mess to provide the best quality food to the students. We are committed to provide hygienic food to them," LP Singh, chairman, council of warden said.
