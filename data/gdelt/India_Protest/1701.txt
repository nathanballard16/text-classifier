Support for plea against transfer of nuns

Four nuns witnesses in bishop case

Leading lights of cultural and media world, including poet Satchidanandan and novelist Anand, have come out in support of an appeal by the Save Our Sisters (SOS) Action Forum to the State government and Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan that the five nuns, who participated in a public protest in Kochi demanding the arrest of Bishop Franco Mulakkal of Jalnandhar, should not be transferred out of Kerala.

Rape charge

The SOS Action Forum spearheaded the public protest against Bishop Mulakkal, who was arrested on a complaint of rape by a Catholic nun and was released on bail later.

In an appeal to the Chief Minister, they said that the transfer of the five nuns belonging to the Catholic religious order — Sisters Anupama, Josephine, Alphy, Ancita and Neena Rose — would weaken the case against the bishop.

The appeal alleged that the congregation Missionaries of Jesus had increased its pressure on the nuns in an attempt to weaken the case.

Four of the nuns are witnesses in the case against the bishop.

Witness dead

The appeal also pointed out that an important witness in the case, Catholic priest Kuriakose Kattuthara, had died under “suspicious circumstances.”

Those who have backed the appeal include academics like T.T. Sreekumar, professor at The English and Foreign Languages University, Hyderabad; Pamela Philippose, senior journalist; J. Devika, writer and activist; and organisations like Women’s Collective, Telengana, and Organisation for the Rights of Sexuality and Gender.

Letter to CM

Four of the nuns who have been ordered to move out of the St. Francis Mission Home at Kuravilangad and the nun who filed the complaint of rape have written to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his intervention to ensure their safety.
