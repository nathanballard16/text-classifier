Andhra places ex-CM Naidu and son under house arrest

AMARAVATI: Former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu and his son, Nara Lokesh , were placed under house arrest near Vijayawada on Wednesday as they prepared to launch a huge protest against the state government over alleged attacks against opposition cadres.Minutes before the Telugu Desam Party chief stepped out of his Undavalli residence to launch the party’s “Chalo Atmakur” rally, police swooped down and prevented the march.Naidu said he had not seen such an undemocratic government in his life, one which prevented other leaders from coming to his house. “How could police prevent party leaders coming to my residence? They have not only detained the leaders but also humiliated them by moving them across several police stations,” Naidu said.Protesting the police action, Naidu went on a 12-hour hunger strike at his residence and appealed to party leaders to follow suit. He termed the day a ‘’black day’’.He asked the police how they could prevent a democratic protest and criticised them for preventing TDP cadres from carrying food to victims of YSRC attacks who had taken shelter in a rehabilitation camp in Guntur. He described the police action as “inhuman”.“It will go down in history as a black day as they imposed restrictions on a peaceful, democratic protest rally. Police reacted with overenthusiasm and humiliated TDP leaders without any reason,” he added.Police also detained TDP legislators, former ministers and former legislators in their constituencies and arrested hundreds of opposition party activists across the state to foil the protest.The situation turned volatile in the early hours when the police moved additional forces to Naidu’s bungalow. Naidu was scheduled to leave his residence at 9 am to reach the rehabilitation camp in Guntur when police personnel blocked all roads leading to Naidu’s bungalow and even prevented the movement of locals.Senior police officials told TDP leaders at Naidu’s bungalow that they would not allow anyone to go out as they had not taken permission for the rally.The police said the revenue divisional officers of Guntur and Gurazala had imposed CrPC Sec 144 keeping in view the sensitive law and order situation across the district and no one would be allowed to stage rallies.TDP national general secretary Nara Lokesh had an argument with the police for preventing him and party leaders from leaving the house and demanded he be shown a magistrate’s orders restricting their movement. Senior TDP leader and MLC T D Janardhan demanded that the police should leave Naidu’s bungalow premises as it was a high-security zone.Naidu attempted to move out in his car but got off the vehicle as the police locked the main entrance gate from the outside.The police also denied permission for a YSRC rally to counter TDP’s march and kept several ruling party leaders under house arrest.YSRC leaders said they would expose TDP’s illegal and undemocratic acts in Palnadu if the former CM visited the area.TDP had planned the “Chalo Atmakur” rally in protest against alleged attacks by YSRC on its cadres in Palnadu region. Naidu wanted to visit Atmakur along with alleged victims of the YSRC attacks on Wednesday.For the past few days TDP has set up a rehabilitation camp for its cadres who had been allegedly attacked. On Wednesday he wanted to take them to their homes in Palnadu. Naidu said the police had failed to act against the accused and provide protection to the victims.
