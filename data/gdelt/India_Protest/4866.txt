SPMVV fraternity protests against land takeover by govt.

Convention centre to come up on 10.4 acres of campus

The smart initiative taken up by the civic authority of Tirupati seems to have rubbed up the Sri Padmavathi Mahila Viswavidyalayam (SPMVV) the wrong way.

The university’s teachers, non-teaching staff members and students staged a protest on the campus on Thursday against the State government’s move to acquire 10.4 acres of land on the 130-acre campus and give it to the Municipal Corporation of Tirupati (MCT). The Tirupati Smart City Corporation (TSCC) will construct a convention centre-cum-sports complex there.

Convenient spot

The MCT has chosen the site for its proximity to the Sri Venkateswara University, the Sri Venkateswara Veterinary University, the Sri Venkateswara Institute of Medical Sciences, the Sri Venkateswara Vedic University and the Rashtriya Sanskrit Vidyapeetha.

Moreover, the site is close to the Chennai-Bengaluru highway and the airport is accessible from there. The government, via order no.51 dated March 8, had directed the SPMVV Registrar to hand over the land under survey number 583 of Tirupati village to the MCT. Interestingly, the order leaves ambiguity as to the owner of the land to be acquired: ‘ownership of the land to be decided in future’.

After the protest, SPMVV Teachers Association president V. Kala Rani, vice-president Jeevana Jyoti, general secretary N. Rajani and non-teaching employees association president K. Padmaja submitted a representation to MCT Commissioner V. Vijay Rama Raju, who agreed to consider their demands.
