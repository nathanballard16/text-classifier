Ludhiana, March 17

The local municipal authorities have sealed an upcoming housing project, Grand Manor Homes, on Gill Road, following the controversy over the alleged CLU scam. The matter had rocked the Budged session of the Vidhan Sabha last month.

However, the sealing of the project itself raised a controversy. It is learnt that a team of the civic body had sealed both gates of the project in the early hours on Saturday. The MC officials, however, found one of the gates opened today. Questions are raised as to how one gate was opened if the civic body had really sealed two gates.

The project authorities, on the other hand, claimed that no seal was applied by the civic body as per their information.

Assistant Town Planner Harwinder Singh Honey confirmed that they had sealed Grand Manor Homes on Saturday as they promoter was not stopping the construction work at the site. “We have sealed both gates of the housing project. We have no information if any gate is opened. If any violation is found, we will bring the matter to the notice of the MC Commissioner.”

On March 6, the MC had got the construction work stopped. They had asked the project authorities not to continue any work as an inquiry is underway.

Baljinder Singh Kahlon, director, Grand Manor Homes, said, “Our main gate is still open and the construction work at the site is underway. We are not violating any law.”

In July 2018, the local government had ordered the promoter to stop the construction work and cops were also deployed at the site for some time.

Last month, Deputy Leader of Opposition Sarvjit Kaur Manuke had raised the matter of alleged CLU Scam in the Vidhan Sabha. AAP leaders had also dragged name of a Cabinet minister in the case.
