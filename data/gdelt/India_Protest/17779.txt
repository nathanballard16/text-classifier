TNEB contract staff to stage protest at Chennai headquarters

COIMBATORE: As many as 800 contract workers of the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB), who had launched an indefinite strike 12 days ago, have decided to stage a massive protest in front the TNEB headquarters in Chennai on Friday.“Ground-level works have stagnated after the workers launched the strike across the state. But no representatives of TNEB or the state government called us for a talk. Pressing our demands, we have decided to stage a massive protest in Chennai,” said state joint secretary of the Tamil Nadu TNEB Contract Labourers Union P Nagaraj.The workers demand Rs 380 as daily wage for those who joined between 1998 and 2008, as promised by state electricity minister P Thangamani. They want contract workers, who had joined before 1998, to be appointed as field assistants. They also want preference to the workers, who had joined after 2008, while filling the vacant posts of gangman.
