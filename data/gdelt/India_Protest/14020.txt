Adilabad: Adivasis protest over MP Soyam Bapurao’s arrest

Adilabad: Adivasis staged rasta rokos and dharnas and burnt effigies across the old Adilabad district on Monday in protest against the house arrest of Adilabad MP and Thudumdebba state president Soyam Bapurao at his residence in Hyderabad by the police.

The Adivasi leaders said Mr Bapurao was preparing to come to Armoor to attend a felicitation ceremony arranged for him by the local Naikpod Adivasis.

Adivasi leaders alleged that the state government was in favour of the Lambada community and their leaders and going all out to suppress other adivasi groups and their rights.
