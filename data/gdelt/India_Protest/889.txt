Neso team stopped by police at Khumlwng, ‘black day’ today

GUWAHATI: The North East Students’ Organization (Neso) on Friday said they would observe a ‘black day’ across northeast on Saturday in protest against the police action on anti-bill agitators in Tripura and Manipur A seven-member Neso delegation, which had travelled to Agartala on Thursday, went to Khumlwng on Friday to take stock of the situation following the police firing during the northeast bandh on January 8. However, they were reportedly stopped by Tripura police at Khumlwng and not allowed to meet any of the protesters who were injured in the police firing. Neso has also demanded a probe by a sitting judge into the police firing.“Neso and its constituent organizations will observe a black day in the seven northeastern states on Saturday, in protest against the barbaric action against the anti-bill protesters in Tripura on January 8 and in Manipur on Friday,” Neso adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya told the media here after returning from Tripura. “The black day will be observed as a condemnation of the atrocities unleashed by the state governments on the democratic protests against the citizenship bill. It will also be a stern warning to the Centre which, for mere political gains, wants to hurt the interests of the indigenous people of the northeast,” he added.While talking about their visit to Tripura, Bhattacharyya alleged that police personnel had attacked some of the agitators even when they were inside an ambulance and being rushed to hospitals outside Khumlwng. Arguing that an ‘emergency situation’ was prevailing in Tripura, Bhattacharyya said “Citing that Section 144 of the CrPC has been promulgated to maintain law and order, our delegation was prevented from meeting the injured and indigenous tribals.” He added that one of the protesters, who had sustained bullet injuries, is in a critical condition. He is undergoing treatment in Kolkata.Bhattacharyya further said they will again travel to Tripura to express solidarity with the Twipra Students’ Federation (TSF) and the indigenous communities which are opposing the bill.
