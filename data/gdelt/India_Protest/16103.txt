PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar has convened a high-level meeting of ministers and senior officials on Monday to review the reasons behind unprecedented waterlogging in some posh areas of the state capital including Rajendra Nagar, Kankarbagh and Pataliputra Colony, following heavy rains in between September 27 to 29.The meeting, which will begin at 4 pm at Samvad auditorium of the CM secretariat, would be attended also by the state’s deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi , urban development and housing department (UDHD) minister Suresh Sharma, chief secretary Deepak Kumar and principal secretaries of all leading departments.“All departments related to development works in the urban areas especially under the jurisdiction of Patna Municipal Corporation and Danapur urban area, have been asked to come out with an explanation as to why waterlogging continued for such a long period in certain areas of the state capital,” an official attached with the chief minister’s office (CMO) told TOI on Sunday.He said the UDHD had specifically been asked to explain as to why waterlogging continued for more than a week in areas like Rajendra Nagar and Kankerbagh. The department had also been asked to come out with a solid work-plan for proper draining out of the rainwaters from low-laying areas as well as some newly developed areas like Gola Road, Saguna More etc.As a precursor to the CM’s review meet, chief secretary Deepak Kumar on Saturday held a long meeting with the officials of the UDHD, the Bihar Urban Infrastructure Development Corporation and the Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) at the state secretariat and reviewed their proposed work-plan to drain out the rainwaters from urban areas.Sources in the UDHD said, the department has decided to bifurcate the PMC area in seven to eight catchment zones and develop separate sewerage lines for each zone to drain out the rainwaters in future.Ever after a fortnight since heavy rains stopped, the waterlogging continues in many low-laying areas of the state capital and Danapur.Annoyed over the problems of waterlogging and accumulation of garbage in their areas, a group of around 60 to 70 people on Sunday held a protest demonstration outside the residence of deputy CM and senior BJP leader Sushil Kumar Modi in Rajendra Nagar area of the city. Though Modi was not in the residence when protestors reached there and began shouting slogans.Modi and his family members were rescued by a team of State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) from his waterlogged residence on September 30, three days after heavy rains lashed the city.
