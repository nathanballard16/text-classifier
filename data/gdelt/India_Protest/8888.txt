‘Self-immolation’ bid in civic protest

GHAZIABAD: High drama ensued at Ghaziabad Municipal Corporation’s office on Monday morning when a woman councillor tried self-immolation twice over delay in construction of three drains and a park in Nandgram area.Maya Devi, the Congress councillor from ward number 6, and her supporters later staged a sit-in protest at the entrance of the GMC building for over two hours. The mayor, however, termed the agitation a “gimmick to gain publicity”.The drama began around 11 am when Maya, along with several other Congress councillors and their supporters, gathered at the GMC office and she tried to set herself on fire after pouring kerosene on herself. She was, however, stopped by the police. Maya subsequently blocked the entrance to the building and was adamant about not leaving the place till the senior officials and the mayor gave her an assurance.Around noon, she once again tried to set herself on fire but was stopped by the policemen deployed there.Maya alleged that she had been pursuing civic issues, particularly those related to the construction of drains and the park in Nandgram, for the past one-and-a-half years with the mayor as well as senior GMC officials, but no action had been taken yet.“I gave a memorandum to the GMC commissioner, Dinesh Chandra, on May 21 apprising him of the issues. At that time, I had given a deadline of 15 days and threatened self-immolation if no proper steps were taken. But even after 15 days, no action was taken,” she said.In the absence of a proper drainage system in the area, the councillor said, the local residents are being forced to live in a filthy environment.“The situation gets worse in monsoon when people are forced to walk through water-logged streets,” Maya said, adding that she had also been demanding the development of a park on a GMC-owned open plot at Vikalang Colony in Nandgram.Later in the day, Ghaziabad mayor Asha Sharma held a meeting with the agitating councillors, and said that a proposal for the construction of a 1.5km-long drain at a cost of Rs 3.97 crore has been sent to the state government for approval.She said the construction of the park in ward 6 would commence soon.
