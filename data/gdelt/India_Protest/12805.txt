Belagavi farmers hold NHAI responsible for crop loss

BELAGAVI: Various farmers organizations led by Narayan Sawant protestéd against the National Highway Authority of India ( NHAI ) at the DC office premises here on Monday.The farmers claimed unscientific construction of the national highway that passes through the outskirts of the city led to submersion of over 100 acres of standing crops and demanded that NHAI pay compensation to farmers.Narayan Sawant said NHAI was directly responsible for the crop loss, especially paddy on the outskirts of the city and said it should pay Rs 50,000 compensation to each farmer who suffered crop loss.According to Sawant, there were 16 underground pipes between Sambra Road Bridge and Alarwad for water to pass from one side to another. “While constructing the new highway in 2003, NHAI authorities not only closed the pipes and also increased the height of the road leading to saturation of rainwater on one side. Hence, NHAI is directly responsible for farmers’ loss,” he claimed.He added that he had been corresponding with NHAI since 2003 but had received a proper response from the authority. The error made during the construction of the new national highway needs to be rectified, he said.
