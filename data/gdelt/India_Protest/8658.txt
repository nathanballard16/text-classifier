Tension prevailed in Ludhiana as Hindu and Sikh activists confronted each other while brandishing swords in the old city area, near Chaura Bazaar, on Thursday. It all started after Sikh activists allegedly tore a poster of Shiv Sena which was also featuring the pictures of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, ex-CM Beant Singh, former DGP KPS Gill and former Army General AS Vaidya.

After the posters were tore down, Hindu activists led by Shiv Sena leader Rajiv Tandon gathered at Chaura Bazaar and raised anti-Khalistan slogans. Demanding immediate arrest of Sikh activists, the other group also staged a sit-in.

Hindu activists in large numbers later gathered outside historical Sangla Wala Shivalaya. The situation became tense after several Sikh activists also reached there.

Police Commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill, DCP Gaganajit Singh, DCP Ashwani Kapoor and other senior officers with large police force reached the spot to calm down the tempers.

While CP Gill was interacting with Hindu activists, Sikh activists allegedly started hurling bottles and stones. Area residents who were witness to the incident started looking for cover.

The tension brewing up since 1.30 pm subsided at around 5 pm. Sikh activists, who had gathered near the temple left for the gurdwara while Hindu activists were told to stay outside their temple. Entire area was cordoned off by the police.
