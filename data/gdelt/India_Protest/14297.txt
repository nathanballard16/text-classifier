‘Should become Bangladesh’s PM’: BJP MLA’s jibe at Mamata Banerjee for opposing NRC

New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh, Ballia Surendra Singh on Saturday attacked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee the issue of National Register of Citizens (NRC) and said that the TMC chief should become the ‘Prime Minister of Bangladesh’.

“If Mamata Banerjee wants to keep Bangladeshis and do politics then she should become the PM of Bangladesh if she has the courage,” said Singh while attacking Banerjee for opposing implementation of NRC in West Bengal.

“We will never tolerate if foreigners come to India, stay here as refugees and influence Indian politics,” he said.

“Mamata Banerjee is an Indian so she can stay here but if she gets influenced by anti-national sentiments then she can be taught a lesson, like P Chidambaram and others are going,” Singh added.

Banerjee has intensely opposed the NRC exercise in Assam and has asserted that she will not allow it in West Bengal.

“I dare the BJP to touch a single person in Bengal in the name of NRC. I will not let the NRC happen in Bengal till I am alive. If I die, then my young leaders will fight against this conspiracy to divide people in the name of religion,” said Banerjee in her address.
