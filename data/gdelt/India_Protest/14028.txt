High Court Refuses To Stay Ban On Telecast Of 'Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush' In Punjab

During the hearing, which went beyond 5 p.m., Colors TV contended that the ban order was passed without adhering to the principles of natural justice, and without the ingredients of Section 19 of the Cable Operators Regulation Act.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Monday refused to stay the ban on the telecast of the television series "Ram Siya Ke Luv Kush" imposed by the state of Punjab two days ago. The court adjourned the case for next hearing on September 12. During a special hearing on a petition filed by Colors TV, Justice T.S. Dhindsa declined to grant stay on the order passed by various District Commissioners in their capacity as District Magistrates. Arguing the case, Additional Advocate General Rameeza Hakeem said the decision to ban the telecast of the serial had been taken on the ground that Rishi Valmiki had been portrayed in a negative light, hurting the sentiments of the Valmiki community in Punjab.
