Law students stage protest

Demand PG course, hostel for women

Nearly 100 students of Government Law College, Vellore, organised a sit-in on Tuesday demanding post-graduate course in law and hostel facilities.

Though the college was started several years ago, the women’s hostel was yet to be opened.

They urged the management to expedite the construction of hostel buildings, which was going at a slow pace, to make it available for the students from this academic year.

Likewise, the students who completed graduation here had to go to other places for pursuing post graduation, a student said. He added that the petitions to Law Minister was yet to yield any result. Filling up of vacant posts in the college should be taken up immediately, they demanded.

College administrators held discussions with the students and promised to take up the issue with officials at the Secretariat in Chennai.
