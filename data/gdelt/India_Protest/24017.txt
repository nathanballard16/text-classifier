Peaceful protest outside Jamia university campus

New Delhi: Peaceful protest outside Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) continued over Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and NRC, on Sunday, with scores of people joining in from different parts of the city. He added that the violent protest made people realise how wrong the authorities are, while many still need to educate themselves about the Bill. As the protest has gained momentum with international media also covering the everyday developments, people outside Jamia seem to be mesmerised in chanting slogans. "It is still important for the media to support us," said Ahmed, a resident of Jamia Nagar, who had come to join the protest. Meanwhile, a meeting has been called by Jamia Coordination Committee to discuss the next plan of actions regarding the protest.
