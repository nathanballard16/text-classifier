MNS will soon be listed as endangered species: Sudhir Mungantiwar

Former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre had met Thackeray on Thursday to convince him to come on board.

Mumbai: State finance minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sudhir Mungantiwar Friday took a dig at Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray and said that his party would soon be listed as an “endangered species”.

Mr Thackeray campaigned against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah without contesting the Lok Sabha elections.

Holding a total ten rallies, the Maharashtra Navni-rman Sena (MNS) chief showed Mr Modi's videos to the common public, asking them not to trust the BJP. He not only urged people to bring down Mr Modi and Mr Shah but also to give Congress president Rahul Gandhi an opportunity to become the Prime Minister.

It seemed that his rallies would affect the Lok Sabha election results but nothing of that sort happened. On the contrary, the BJP won a huge majority and Mr Modi became the Prime Minister of the country for a second term. After this, Mr Thackeray only tweeted, “Beyond Rationale!”

Mr Mungantiwar criticised Mr Thackeray, saying that his party would soon become an endangered species. Because of Mr Thackeray’s comment, “Lava re to video”, it appeared that his rallies would be effective.

However, the crowd gathered at his rallies could not be converted into votes. Mr Mungantiwar advised MNS not to contest the upcoming Assembly elections in Maharashtra and not to participate in politics for now. Instead of criticising Mr Modi or Mr Shah, it would be better if Mr Thackeray spoke about development, said Mr Mungantiwar.

Meanwhile, Mr Thackeray indicated Thursday that his party might continue to remain non-aligned and fight all seats on its own in the state Assembly elections later this year. Former state Congress chief Manikrao Thakre had met Mr Thackeray on Thursday to convince him to come on board.
