Amit Shah to launch poll campaign in Bengal from Malda today

KOLKATA/ NEW DELHI: BJP leaders locked horns with Mamata Banerjee on Monday, citing the West Bengal's "reluctance" to give permission for party chief Amit Shah 's helicopter to land at Malda in an effort to prevent him from holding a rally and called it a "travesty of democracy".This comes just two days after Banerjee rallied opposition parties in Kolkata against PM's "authoritarian" stance. The Bengal CM trashed the claim, saying police had given permission to all gatherings, and accused BJP of spreading "misinformation and disinformation" .Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad took on Banerjee over Shah's rally in Malda on Tuesday. "Tomorrow, our national president Amit Shah, after having recovered, was to address a rally in Malda in West Bengal. But permission had been refused for his helicopter to land on the ground that airport renovation work is going on. At the same helipad, Mamata ji's helicopter landed a few days ago. We have been denied permission for holding rallies in Bengal after our candidates couldn't file their nominations in many seats during the panchayat polls. And, Mamata is blaming the PM for denying democracy," Prasad said. Piyush Goyal was the next to up the ante against Banerjee. "The desperation and fear of Trinamool Congress and Mamata are clearly visible in this decision. The state government is trying to block every programme of Amit Shah, be it a rally, yatra or the landing of his helicopter," Goyal said. Mamata rubbished the charge."Police gave permission for the landing. They raised security questions and proposed for a change in venue," Banerjee said. BJP will launch its campaign in Bengal for the national polls with a public meeting by Shah in Malda on Tuesday.
