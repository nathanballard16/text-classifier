Election duties: Teaching staff protest outside DC’s office

Ludhiana : As many as 300 government teachers also doubling up as booth level officers (BLO) gathered outside mini secretariat office on Tuesday to protest against the decision of keeping teaching staff occupied with administrative work especially during elections.

To press for their demand they met deputy commissioner , Pardeep Agawal who assured them they would be relieved from this duty once they get the list of non-teaching staff. Manoj Kumar, secretary of block officer union said , “Education secretary, Krishan Kumar has issued a letter to post non-teaching staff and not teaching staff as booth level officers, as the students at schools were suffering. We demanded that teaching staff should be released from this duty at earliest.”

Manoj Kumar said , “ State election commission should create a separate cell, so that work can be done by recruiting new volunteers as that will not only employ many people but also ensure that the work of other departments were not affected.”

He claimed that the teachers were being asked to do odd jobs for almost three hours a day like door to door survey. “Such duties are not only affecting school work, but the education of students were also taking a toll,” said Ajit Pal Singh , patron of the union.
