DMK, AIADMK flay Bedi for her comments on Chennai water crisis

Lieutenant Governor urged to retract her statement

AIADMK and DMK leaders in Puducherry on Monday criticised Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for her remarks blaming the government, politicians and bureaucracy in Tamil Nadu for the water crisis in Chennai.

The DMK threatened to hold a demonstration in front of Raj Nivas on Tuesday protesting against her remarks.

In a statement, AIADMK leader in the Legislative Assembly A. Anbalagan said Ms. Bedi’s comments were “highly condemnable” and demanded that she retract them immediately.

If the Lt. Governor failed to express regret, the party would launch an agitation against Ms. Bedi, he said.

DMK leader in the Legislative Assembly R. Siva said the party would hold a demonstration in front of Raj Nivas on Tuesday. He demanded an apology and immediate recall of the Lt. Governor for her “insensitive” comments.

Ms. Bedi had insulted the people of Tamil Nadu by making such a comment, Mr. Siva added.
