Congress Women Cell Activists Clash with Police in Patna

Patna: With massive protests and rallies by various political groups on a daily basis followed by clash with police and lathi charge leading to some injuries becoming the hallmark of Patna, Tuesday was the turn of the women's wing of the Congress Party that took out a rally in protest against crime against women in Bihar only to end up in a clash with the law enforcement officials.

The protestors, that also included a number of party legislators, then tried to storm through the police barricade only to be blocked by lathi-wielding cops.

Congress activists later blamed the police of beating them with their batons though eyewitnesses in the area and the photos taken at the rally showed no sign of a police lathi charge.

Demanding a CBI enquiry into the sexual assault on girls living in a shelter home in Muzaffarpur, Bhushan said that crime against girls and women under Nitish administration had skyrocketed and the Chief Minister continued to look the other way.

"Instead of doing something about it, Nitish Kumar not only denies Bihar has a problem, he also protects those who are clearly guilty of committing crime against women," she said.

With the proceedings at Bihar Assembly already in progress, Congress leaders in the House raised the issue of 'lathi charge' on the female members of the party calling the incident shameful. They, along with other opposition leaders, also staged a walk-out to express their resentment against the Nitish government.
