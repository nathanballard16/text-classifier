The first phase of Lok Sabha polls in Bihar on Thursday is set to be a tough battle between the BJP-led NDA and the RJD-led Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance).

In the 2014 elections, the NDA had won all four seats — Gaya, Jamui (both reserved seats), Nawada and Aurangabad — going to the polls, but this time it appears to be tough for them to retain them.

First General elections in Telangana

Telangana has 17 Lok Sabha seats with K. Kavitha, daughter of Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, contesting from Nizamabad against Madhu Yaskhi of the Congress, and sitting MP from Hyderabad and AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi contesting the same seat.

Over 2.96 crore voters will exercise their franchise in the 17 seats, 12 of which are general constituencies, three reserved for the Scheduled Castes and two for the Scheduled Tribes. This is the first general election to be held in Telangana since the formation of the State on June 2, 2014. The previous Lok Sabha elections were held on April 30, 2014 -- more than a month ahead of the appointed day for bifurcation of the erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh.
