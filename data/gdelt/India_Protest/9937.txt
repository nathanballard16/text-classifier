K Chandrasekhar Rao to lay stone for assembly, secretariat complex today

Hyderabad: Roads and buildings officials have made required arrangement for Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to lay the foundation stone for the new Secretariat complex at the existing location at Saifabad and for an integrated Legislature complex at Errum Manzil on Thursday.

Police has tightened security at both venues in view of protests expected from a cross-section of society against the demolition of the existing structures.

Sources in the TRS said that only ministers, MLAs, Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha and Zilla Parishad chairpersons belonging to the TRS are invited for the foundation ceremony. Invitation was not extended to other leaders.

The family members of Nawab Fakhrul Mulk, who built Errum Manzil, are opposing the demolition. The BJP and some organisations have called for a protest march against the construction.

The R&B officials said that the foundation stone for the new secretariat will be laid next to the D Block by the Chief Minister at 10 am. After that, he will lay the foundation stone for the Assembly complex at 11 am. The R&B department is tasked with executing the construction of the secretariat as well as the Assembly buildings. The Cabinet left the final decision on the building designs to the Chief Minister.

The government indicated that the new Secretariat, which would come up over about four lakh square feet, would cost Rs 400 crore. The proposed new Legislature complex is expected to cost Rs 100 crore.
