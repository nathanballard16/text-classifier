‘Rangasamy part of conspiracy to disrupt elected govt.’

CM says Centre is using the Lieutenant Governor as a tool

Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy on Sunday said the admission made by All India N.R. Congress president N. Rangasamy of his affinity toPrime Minister Narendra Modi showed that the former Chief Minister was “part of the conspiracy to disrupt” his government.

Addressing the media, the Chief Minister said the AINRC, by deciding to align with the BJP, had caused damage to the interest of the Union Territory.

The Centre had been “using” Ms. Bedi as a tool for the last two-and-a-half years to create trouble for the elected government.

The decisions taken by the elected government were overruled by the Lt. Governor in an undemocratic manner, he said.

Welcomes decision

“I believe Rangasamy is part of the conspiracy by the BJP to create trouble for the Congress government by using Lt. Governor Kiran Bedi as a tool. I welcome his decision to align with a party which has caused trouble to the U.T.,” he said.

Questioning the role played by Mr. Rangasamy as an Opposition leader, Mr. Narayanasamy said the former Chief Minister had failed to attend the Assembly sessions and raise issues concerning public.

The AINRC, which claimed to be championing the Statehood cause, did not attend an all-party meeting convened by the government on the issue.

Slams AINRC’s approach

In fact, the Opposition party boycotted the protest by the all-party delegation staged in Delhi seeking Statehood, he said. “Political parties can have differences of opinion. The AINRC, by not participating in the first of its kind protest in Delhi, had worked against the interest of the U.T. “The former Chief Minister is only interested in power,” the Chief Minister added.
