Jamia girl’s remarks at Kerala stir cause rift among parties

MALAPPURAM: The protest by a section of CPM and DYFI workers against Jamia Millia Islamia student Ayesha Renna during a joint rally organised by different parties against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Malappuram on Saturday has caused a rift among the very parties who had organised the rally.Ayesha, 22, shot to fame for her role in the anti-CAA protest in Delhi. She was allegedly insulted by a group of local CPM and DYFI workers at the rally in Kondotty organised by CPM, Congress, IUML and Welfare Party on Saturday.During her speech, Ayesha had criticised Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan over the arrest of six workers of Welfare Party’s students’ wing at Ponnani following the December 17 hartal against CAA.“We demand their immediate release,” she said. A group of CPM and DYFI demanded that she tender an apology for criticising the CM. After the programme, CPM and DYFI workers also allegedly set the flags of Welfare Party ablaze.In response, Welfare Party organised a protest march onSunday. “Ayesha had raised a valid issue and the emotional response of CPM workers was unfortunate and not democratic,” said Nasar Keezhuparamb, district president of Welfare Party.Meanwhile, CPM’s Pramod Das criticised Welfare Party for “raising unnecessary issues” during the joint protest.“We had decided not to raise other political issues during the programme. But, Welfare party leaders violated this. They are taking part in the anti-CAA protest with a hidden agenda,” he said.A Muslim League MLA said that the incident will affect the conduct of protest programmes against CAA. Congress MLA V T Balram demanded the CM take a strong stand against party workers who insulted Ayesha.
