“Is this Yogi’s Sarkar or Nehru’s?’: Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targets UP government over Sombhadra killings

She said: “I am very clear, I am not going to leave until I have met those families. If you want to jail me, jail me.”

On Friday, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and her entourage of Congress workers dug their heels in and stayed put in a guest house in Mirzapur where the Congress alleged the power had been cut to trouble them.

Speaking to news agency ANI, Gandhi-Vadra told them that it was a tragic incident where 10 people were killed after their lands were usurped.

She wondered if it was a crime to meet the oppressed saying that if she was jailed she wouldn’t file for bail, not even a single penny.

She said she would meet the victims’ families in Sombhadra.

She said: “I am very clear, I am not going to leave until I have met those families. If you want to jail me, jail me.”

Slamming the state government over lawlessness, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra asked who was in power, Nehru or Yogi Adityanath. She said: “Who’s in-charge? Is this Yogi’s government or Jawaharlal Nehru’s?”
