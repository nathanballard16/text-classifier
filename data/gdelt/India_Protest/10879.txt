They both died instantly, as their family members and fellow villagers turned hapless spectators.When they pointed their guns at Linga Raju, he pleaded innocence and begged their mercy. The rebels thrashed him badly and warned him against continuing to anti-party activities. The rebels then left the village raising party slogans.The Maoists also left a note written in red letters.
