Both Houses of Parliament adjourned amid uproar over Rahul Gandhi's rape remark, Northeast protests

Both Houses of the Parliament were adjourned on Friday, which was the last date of the Winter Session, amid an uproar over Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's "rape in India" remark and the unrest in Northeast over the amended citizenship law.

The Winter Session of the Lok Sabha concluded on Friday with Speaker Om Birla adjourning the proceedings sine die amid a hue and cry raised by BJP MPs over Rahul Gandhi's recent remark on the growing incidence of rape in India.

As Speaker Om Birla read out his remarks over various issues taken up during the session, the treasury benches were seen demanding an apology from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for the controversial comment on rape he made during an election rally in Jharkhand.

Opposition members were also heard shouting slogans such as 'we want justice' and demanded that Rahul Gandhi should be given a chance to respond. Both Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi were present in the Lok Sabha as the House erupted in protests led by Union minister Smriti Irani.

Rajya Sabha, on the other hand, was adjourned for the second time on Friday after the Congress, TMC, DMK and the Left created an uproar over violence in northeastern states over the amended citizenship law.

No sooner Rajya Sabha met at noon after the first adjournment, TMC MP Derek O'Brien raised the issue of violence in the Northeast, but Chairman Venkaiah Naidu did not allow him and proceeded with the listed questions.

In the meanwhile, Congress MPs too came in support of the TMC leader and soon other Opposition parties started raising slogans against the amended Citizenship Act, violence in the northeastern states, including Tripura.

TMC member Dola Sen even tore a piece of paper while standing in the well.

The chairman tried to pacify the protesting members. But as his efforts did not bring order in the House and Rajya Sabha was adjourned sine dine.
