Senior AAP leader Gopal Rai said, “All opposition leaders will attend this rally against the Modi government. It will be attended by all those who had attended Mamata Banerjee’s Kolkata rally last month.” As part of the 'India Against Corruption', Kejriwal had once called upon “Didi” to join the anti-corruption movement during the Congress-led UPA regime.

Bringing her fight against the BJP government to the national capital, Banerjee arrived in Delhi on Tuesday evening. Unlike Naidu, Banerjee may visit Parliament briefly on Wednesday morning before heading to the dharna site. It has been her practice for some time now to arrive in Delhi when Parliament is in session and spend some time both in the Trinamool Congress (TMC) office in Parliament and the Central Hall, where she likes to catch up with her old colleagues across parties.

The TMC chief, who has launched almost daily diatribes against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is hoping to firm up her claim to be an Opposition fulcrum at the Jantar Mantar rally. Banerjee is likely to return to Kolkata on Thursday.
