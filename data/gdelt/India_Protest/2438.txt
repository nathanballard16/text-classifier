The All Indian Kisan Sabha (AIKS), is all once again set to hold an agitation against the policies and promises in terms of agriculture, which remain unmet, previously promised by the Government of Maharashtra as well as the Centre. The rally will start on February 20, from Nashik up till Mumbai.

In the previous year also, the Kisan Sabha had held a rally of a similar kind between these two cities only. This time, the rally will start on February 20 from Nashik’s Mumbai Naka, and will arrive on February 27 in Mumbai’s Azad Maidan.

As per the State General Secretary of the AIKS, Ajit Navale, the march is a protest against the no fulfilment of promises made during the last year.

At least 50,000 farmers, along with farm-labourers from 22 districts of Maharashtra will be partaking in the rally. As the rally moves towards Mumbai, it is expected to gather force.

During the previous year, Maharashtra Government had promised to hand over 64 lakh pending farm-loan waiver applications to a State government Committee for further scrutiny. However, until now, the committee has not only been formed.

The Sabha has also made a demand of a monthly pension of Rs. 3,000 for widows, physically challenged and poor.
