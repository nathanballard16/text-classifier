EC Lifts Hold On Recruitment Of Teachers In Central Universities; Over 6000 Posts To Be Filled

The Election Commission of India (ECI) has approved the recruitment of over 6000 teachers to fill in vacancies held up across all central universities since March (2018), reports Economic Times (ET).

Faculty appointments in these universities had come to a standstill on account of the long drawn legal battle in the judiciary regarding the changed formula for SC/ST quota implementation in teaching posts.

The controversy stemmed from an Allahabad High Court order that directed the allocation of SC/ST or OBC quotas in faculty posts of central universities department-wise, and not by university or college-wise.

On account of massive protests from SC/ST groups who claimed that the new system would lead to fewer opportunities for teachers from these communities, the government promulgated an ordinance that reverted to the 200-point roster system wherein the institution is treated as one unit, instead of using departments or subjects as the basis for reservation.

This ordinance was challenged in the Supreme Court (SC) but the SC refused to stay the ordinance.

Freedom With Fetters

Though the EC has allowed the human resource development (HRD) ministry to begin the process of recruitment, it has directed the ministry to announce the list of final appointees only after the Lok Sabha elections are over.

In its order, the EC said that while it has no objection “to the starting of recruitment process’, from the Model Code of Conduct point of view, this approval is subject to the condition that “declaration of result and appointments shall be done after completion of election process.”
