Conservative Hindu groups say they believe women of menstruating age would defile the temple's inner shrine. Local news channels reported the chief priest closed the temple for "purification" rituals after the women visited.

A video from a local police official showed two women inside the temple with their heads covered.

The Bharatiya Janata Party's (BJP)'s Kerala state president P.S. Sreedharan Pillai called it "a conspiracy by the atheist rulers to destroy the Hindu temples”, and said his party will "support the struggles against the destruction of faith by the Communists”.

"Let all the devotees come forward and protest this," Mr Pillai told local television news channels.

However, the state government defended its decision to protect the women as they went into the temple, saying it was a matter of civil rights.

"I had earlier made it clear that the government will provide protection if any women come forward to enter the temple," said Pinarayi Vijayan, Kerala's chief minister, according to local TV.
