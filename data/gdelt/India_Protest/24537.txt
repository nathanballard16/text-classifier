Bengaluru: Criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi over a statement made during a public rally organised in Delhi, Former Minister DK Shivakumar demanded the latter to apologize for allegedly referring to students and intellectuals of the country as urban Naxals.

In a candid conversation with the media persons, Shivakumar said, “The students, intellectuals who are protesting to save the constitution are been called as urban Naxals by the Prime Minister. I urge the Prime Minister to apologize to the people of the nation.”

He further added, “People brought you to power not to bring them on the streets to protest. At a time when the nation is suffering due to economic slowdown, the government is bringing such act. The government is playing with people’s lives.”

“Whoever supported Modi-government – AIADMK, Biju Janata Dal, YSR Congress Party have all said that the act is wrong,” he said.

Speaking about Mangaluru violence he said, “Don’t blame Mangalore police. It is the Karnataka government and Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa who have issued orders for the implementation of Section 144 in the city.”
