The controversy surrounding the arrest of BJP Yuva Morcha leader Priyanka Sharma by the West Bengal Police for allegedly posting a meme of West Bengal Chief Mamata Banerjee on Facebook has finally reached the Supreme Court.

Twenty-five-year-old Sharma – who was arrested on the basis of a criminal complaint filed by TMC leader Vibhas Hazra—was on Saturday produced before the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Howrah, who sent her to 14-day judicial custody.

The BJP and social media activists have protested against her arrest terming it an attempt to suppress free speech.

On Monday, a Vacation Bench comprising Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Sanjiv Khanna agreed to take up her bail plea on Tuesday after senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul submitted that her plea against arrest needed urgent hearing.

She was arrested on May 10 by the state police under Section 500 (defamation) of the IPC and certain other provisions of the Information Technology Act.

Kaul said the BJP Yova Morcha activist was forced to move the top court as there was complete strike in local courts in West Bengal since April 25 following a “brutal attack” on lawyers in Howrah court by the state police.

Because of the strike, the petitioner had no option of availing of any legal remedy in the state, and she was forced to approach the top court, he said.

Sharma allegedly shared on Facebook the photo in which Banerjee’s face has been photo-shopped on to actor Priyanka Chopra’s picture from the MET Gala event in New York.
