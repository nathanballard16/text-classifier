NSUI protests against growing unemployment

The National Students’ Union of India (NSUI), a frontal organisation of the Congress, staged a protest here on Wednesday against growing unemployment in India under Narendra Modi-led Union government.

The organisation staged a sit-in near Rajiv Gandhi Chowk to register their protest against alleged failure of Modi government to provide employment to youth.

Modi had breached the poll promise made in 2014 general elections that two crore employment would be generated per year for the youth of the country, they alleged.

The NSUI activists led by their state president Akash Sharma also polished shoes of passerby as a symbolic gesture to show lack of employment opportunities in the country.

State vice president Bhavesh Sharma, state spokesperson Tushar Guha, district president Amit Sharma, general secretary Hemant Pal were prominently present during the protest.
