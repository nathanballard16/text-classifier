Weather News and Analysis

After a few short spells over Delhi and NCR a day before yesterday, dry weather conditions are prevailing over the region during the last 24 hours. At present, the pollution level is in moderate category over the city.

At present, an anti-cyclonic circulation is persisting over western parts of Rajasthan. Also, a Western Disturbance is moving away across Jammu and Kashmir. Hence, Northwesterly light winds are expected to prevail over Haryana.

Since, winds are constantly light and variable during most parts of the day hence pollution emitted from vehicles, dust from construction sites and smoke from surrounding regions remains trapped in the atmosphere, while continuously affecting Delhi. Also, as winds will blow from Northwest direction, these will carry along the smoke emitted from stubble burning in surrounding states.

Recently, Punjab and Haryana are seeing growing number of protests from farmers against the ban on stubble burning. As per farmers, burning the residuals on farms is the most cost effective, fast and hassle-free way to get rid of stubble.

This is the period for burning of paddy residuals over Punjab and Haryana. Hence, the smoke is likely to add to the pollution level during the next two to three days. The level of pollution is likely to remain in ‘moderate’ category.

During the next 24 hours, the day temperatures over Delhi and NCR will remain above 33 degree Celsius while night temperatures would remain around 19 degrees. Hence, morning would be hazy and pleasant while day would be slightly warm with a partly cloudy sky.

October 23 onward, air quality is likely to deteriorate further over Delhi as a new Cyclonic Circulation is likely to form over Northwest Rajasthan and adjoining areas.
