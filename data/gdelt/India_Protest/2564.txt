Rights body moved for rehabilitation of non-local women in IOK

Srinagar, February 07, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, a rights activist has filed a petition before the India’s National Human Rights Commission seeking rehabilitation of non-local women married to the Kashmiri youth. The petitioner, Mujtaba Hussain, prayed that the Indian government should either rehabilitate these women or facilitate their return as per their wishes.

Pertinently, on the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi’s visit to occupied Kashmir on Sunday, scores of non-local women married to the Kashmiri youth staged a protest in Srinagar. The women demanded citizen rights and travel documents so that they could be able to travel to their motherly country “whenever they want and also live with dignity in Kashmir”.

Scores of Kashmiri youth had returned to occupied Kashmir along with their spouses and their children under a rehabilitation policy announced by then Omar Abdullah-led puppet administration in 2010.
