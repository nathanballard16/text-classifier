NU students up in arms over new roster system

Nagpur: Nagpur University students under the banner of Babasaheb Ambedkar Students’ Association (BASA) on Thursday staged a protest outside campus on Amravati Road slamming the central and state governments over implementation of 13-point roster in educational institutes across the country. The Nagpur University had started clearing new roster as per the existing guidelines. Around 330 teaching posts are vacant in the university.The association said the existing guidelines make each department one whole unit. The cycle goes on with other categories replacing each other while SC/ST coming after seven posts.The association said in 200-point roster, every alternate post is reserved. In the ongoing recruitment drive, if a department having 7 posts advertises the three vacant ones, only open candidates would qualify,” it said.
