Students stir at Mumbai's Azad Maidan enters eighth day

Maratha students aspiring for admissions to postgraduate medical and dental courses continued their protest against the incumbent BJP-led government for the eighth day on Tuesday. Various organisations of the Maratha community have also extended their support to these 250 medical students. The community feels neglected after recently, the Supreme Court upheld the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court's order of not implementing reservations for Maratha students for medical and dental admissions this year. Students representatives met medical education minister Girish Mahajan on Monday, who tried to convince the students to withdraw their stir and promised required action after polls once the model code of conduct is lifted. The students are protesting against the government for not implementing the SEBC reservation.
