Left parties to fight assembly election in state together

RANCHI: Left parties on Sunday decided to fight the state assembly elections together in Jharkhand , while also keeping the door open for negotiations with mahagathbandhan partners.In a meeting held at the CPI office in Ranchi, Left parties resolved to reach a seat-sharing agreement for the elections during their next meeting on July 14. The CPI, CPM, CPIML, MCC and SUCI participated in the discussions.The participants also decided to hold a 'Raj Bhavan march' on July 9 to protest against the recent defacement of Birsa Munda 's statue, among others.Former CPI MP Bhubneshwar Prasad Mehta , who chaired the meeting, said that Left parties will not fight one another in the assembly elections.Mehta further said farmers are facing distress due to delayed monsoon, but he alleged that the state government also adopted a negligent approach towards the brewing agricultural crisis.He added, "The government has so far failed to make available seeds and fertilisers to farmers, rendering the latter vulnerable to exploitation at the hands of private producers of agricultural inputs."State secretary of CPM G K Bakshi said his party would take a decision on the number of seats it wants to contest during the two-day party meeting starting in Ranchi on Monday.On mahagathbandhan, he said that so far it has failed to put up a united front and win the confidence of people.
