Kashmir situation ‘not sustainable, must improve’: Merkel

The conditions in which the people of Indian-held Kashmir are living are unsustainable and must be improved, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters accompanying her on a trip to New Delhi. Merkel said she will be raising the matter with Narendra Modi, adding that while she is aware of India’s position regarding the region, she wants to hear Modi’s plans for restoring calm to the occupied valley. “The situation for the people there is currently not sustainable and must improve,” she addesd. In the occupied valley, people held demonstrations in different areas on Friday against the Indian occupation and division of Kashmir into two union territories.
