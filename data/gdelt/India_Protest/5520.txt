sp bsp alliance: Akhilesh Yadav, Ajit Singh may hold rallies for tie-up candidate

GHAZIABAD: The SP-BSP combine, which has teamed up with RLD for the upcoming Lok Sabha election, is planning a joint rally by Akhilesh Yadav and Ajit Singh in the district.Sources in all three parties said they had written to senior leaders to campaign for the alliance candidate, Suresh Bansal, in Ghaziabad.Bansal, meanwhile, is focusing on far-flung and rural areas of the district where people are not much aware of his work, the sources said. The SP-BSP-RLD combine is leaving no stone unturned to take on the ruling BJP and has recently replaced Surendra Kumar Munni with Bansal. Party leaders are now busy formulating Bansal’s canvassing trail and he has already covered Loni and Dhaulana in Hapur under the strategy.Moreover, the alliance has opened camp offices in all five constituencies in the district. RLD spokesperson Inderjeet Singh Titu said: “All the three parties are working as one in this election. Our aim is to defeat the BJP, which has taken voters for granted. We have requested senior leaders to come to Ghaziabad to boost our morale. We are hopeful that senior leaders would be here before the first phase of elections (April 11).”BSP district president Vinod Pradhan , however, pointed out that Ghaziabad does not feature in party supremo Mayawati’s election rally schedule so far. “We have put up a request, although she will take the final decision,” he added.Asked about preparations the alliance has in place, Pradhan said they were working at the grassroots level. “In each booth, we have a team of 23 people, including three executing officers, to oversee the outreach programme. The election results will surprise every one. The alliance has got the massive support of people,” he claimed. Apart from the chiefs of the three alliance parties, RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary is also likely to participate in the roadshow.
