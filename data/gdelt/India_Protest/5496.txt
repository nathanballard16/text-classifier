7 held in Congress Bhawan vandalism case

Bhubaneswar: Commissionerate Police Tuesday arrested seven persons in conection with vandalism at the Congress Bhawan, the state headquarters of the Congress party, here Saturday night.

The accused persons were identified as Sk Amir Muhamad, Sabir Muhammad, latifur Rehman, Sazir Khan, Hadakhat Khan of Jadupur area and Sayed Tafiq, Biswaranjan Khatei of Dumduma area under the Khandagiri police station limits.

A case (102/19) has been registered on the basis of a complaint filed by Biswanath Swain, party’s office secretary. Commissioner of Police Satyajit Mohanty told reporters that a hunt is on for other accused involved in the ransacking of the electronic gadgets and office furniture at the party office.

According to the complaint, a group of 100 unknown miscreants carrying sharp weapons and iron rods reached the Congress Bhawan and started vandalising the office in the presence of an electronic media channel. Swain reportedly rushed out of his office after hearing the commotion. The miscreants then sought to know the whereabouts of party president Niranjan Patnaik. Swain told them that Patnaik was in New Delhi and they can meet him later. However, without paying heed to his suggestions, they reportedly ransacked the office.

Notably, a few supporters of Amir Mohammed allegedly ransacked Congress Bhawan in protest against the party’s decision to field Rashmi Mohapatra from Ekamra-Bhubaneswar constituency.
