Members of IYC, NSUI take out protest marches over crime against women

Members of the Indian Youth Congress and the NSUI on Saturday staged protests here and took out marches over rising crime against women in the country.

Holding candles and placards, IYC members marched peacefully in Lutyens' Delhi.

Amrish Ranjan Pandey, the IYC national media in-charge, alleged that the government is not taking any action to curb crime against women in the country.

"We are saddened about the rising crime against women in the country. In last five to six years, crime has increased. The government is not doing anything and the time has come when we have to save our society ourselves," Pandey said.

The latest case of a 27-year-old veterinarian in Hyderabad, who was gang raped and then burnt, has brought the issue of women's safety in the country in focus again as the central government has "failed" to protect them, he said.

Members of the National Students' Union of India (NSUI) also marched from Patel Chowk metro station to Parliament Street police station.

They burnt an effigy of the Telangana government outside the police station, demanding justice for the veterinarian.

The Congress-affiliated NSUI also protested against the detention of Anu Dubey, who was detained at the police station for protesting against the incident earlier in the day, according to a statement by the organisation.

The members demanded that the accused be punished immediately and the provision of at least death penalty should be implemented on such a heinous crime.

They also appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to immediately address the nation regarding rise in crime against women across nation.
