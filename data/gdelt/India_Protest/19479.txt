TMMK cadre court arrest

About 700 volunteers of the Tamil Nadu Muslim Munnetra Kazhagam (TMMK) and Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) courted arrest after attempting to stage protest on the Ayodhya issue violating police orders here on Friday.

After police denied permission for the protest, TMMK volunteers, including women, assembled near Sandaipettai to stage protest around 4. 20 p.m., when police arrested them on charges of violating police orders. Police, however, avoided arresting the women volunteers.

About half an hour later, volunteers of SDPI assembled in front of the Union office and attempted to stage protest when police arrested them.

Police arrested 361 SDPI volunteers and 321 TMMK volunteers. The volunteers were released in the evening.
