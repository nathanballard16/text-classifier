No prior traffic advisory on Yuva Kranti Yatra causes traffic snarls in Delhi

The traffic in the national capital on Wednesday came to a standstill owing it to Congress Yuva Kranti Yatra at the Talkatora stadium. Senior police officials were deployed at the border areas to ensure people do not enter the city premises. Despite being aware about the event, the Delhi Police had not issued any prior traffic advisory.

The rally by the Indian Youth Congress (IYC) members that was about completing the 'Youth Kranti Yatra' campaign kick started from Kanyakumari and concluded at Delhi on Wednesday at the Talkatora stadium, causing heavy traffic jams. Over 1500 traffic police officials were deployed to manage the traffic, however the situation went out of hand as people marched and the VVIP movements led to a delay.

Roads around India Gate, Rajghat, Delhi Gate, Connaught Place and Akshardham temple were affected due to the snarls.Police said that a large number of people in buses and cars gathered on the Noida Link Road and Chilla Border stalling traffic for hours. A major snarl was also reported near the India Gate as movements by Congress supporters blocked traffic on the C-Hexagon and other arterial roads around it.

However, the Delhi traffic police regarding this issued no advisories, but updated about the traffic condition on their Twitter handle. "Traffic Alert Obstruction in traffic from RML hospital to roundabout Shankar Road (both carriageways) was reported due to procession in Talkatora Stadium."

From last couple of days the Delhiites faced severe traffic congestions first due to the Republic Day celebrations and later due to the Beating Retreat Ceremony.
