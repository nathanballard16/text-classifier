Congress adopts 'conflicting stands' in Bengal, Delhi

NEW DELHI: Congress stayed away from Mamata Banerjee 's dharna in Kolkata even as it backed Trinamool Congress' protests against BJP in Lok Sabha on Monday, highlighting its conflicting political compulsions in the state and at the Centre.While Congress' central leadership sought to pitch the CBI action in West Bengal against the Kolkata police commissioner as an assault on the Constitution's federal structure, Congress' Bengal unit announced a rally in Kolkata on February 6, demanding a thorough probe into the chit fund scams - action that the West Bengal CM is seen to be resisting.Speaking to TOI , Congress MP Adhir Chowdhury, however, sought to underplay the divide within the party. "The statement by party president Rahul Gandhi pertains to the misuse of CBI in its action against TMC.He has never said the poor who suffered as a result of this scam should not be get justice. Congress was the one which led the march against the ponzi scam, action that resulted in the court ordering a CBI probe. In this continuation, the Bengal unit is batting for a probe into the ponzi scam."On Tuesday, Rahul Gandhi also discussed with senior advocate KTS Tulsi the Supreme Court ruling in the CBI vs Mamata clash.Congress spokesman Abhishek Singhvi , who appeared for the West Bengal government in the apex court termed the court verdict a "complete victory" for the West Bengal government.
