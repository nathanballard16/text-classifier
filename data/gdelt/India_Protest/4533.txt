IWD 2019: Keira Knightley and Dua Lipa urge governments to do more to protect women’s rights

Keira Knightley, Dame Emma Thompson and Dua Lipa are calling for the government to do more to fight for equality and support women’s rights.

They are among a high-profile group of 76 women who have signed an open letter, published on International Women’s Day in The Guardian, that states “in no country in the world do women enjoy the same rights or opportunities as men”.

The letter cites stats such as one in three women experiencing violence in their lifetime around the world and fewer than one in four parliamentarians are women.

“Women’s rights are human rights, yet women and girls everywhere are still denied their rights,” it adds.

The letter is signed by women of all disciplines, including actors, activists, writers and politicians.

Among them, the group includes Emma Watson, Carey Mulligan, Paloma Faith, Felicity Jones, Gillian Anderson, Annie Lennox, Clémence Poésy, Caroline Lucas MP, and activist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.

“Women in all their diversity – women of every nationality, race, ability, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity – need to have their voices heard and respected,” the letter continues.

“Every woman should have the freedom to make her own choices and claim her rights. Yet, when women speak out, attempt to have a say in the decisions affecting their lives or defend their rights, far too often they are silenced, undermined and even endangered.”

The letter concludes with a direct address to global governments “to recognise and trust the expertise of women’s rights organisations and women’s movement” with a special emphasis on those in marginalised communities.

“We’re not looking for your sympathy, we’re demanding your action,” it adds.

“Because none of us are equal until all of us are equal.”
