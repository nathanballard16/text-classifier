Pak High Commission in India gets more security from CRPF Jawans Post Pulwama Terror Attack

After the Pulwama terror attack, the whole country is united against terrorism and ‘josh’ among Indians is running really high! With hundreds and thousands on the streets, fuming with anger protested against Pakistan in front of the Pakistani High Commission in India, a platoon of CRPF was deployed to guard the commission.

According to the reports, the decision to deploy CRPF was because some protesters tried to march inside the high commission. The protesters demanded that Pakistan should be given a befitting reply in the language that they understand after February 14 attack. Apart from CRPF platoon, a few BSF jawans and Delhi Police patrol vehicles are also around the High Commission to guard it. India on Friday briefed about Pakistan's involvement in Pulwama attack to P5 countries along with South Asian countries, Japan, Germany. On Saturday India will be briefing ASEAN ambassadors.
