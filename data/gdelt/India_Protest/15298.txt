Combine harvest owners protest state govt orders

Our CorrespondentTarn Taran, September 30Hundreds of owners of combine harvesters from various districts, including Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur, staged a dharna outside the local District Administrative Complex (DAC) on Monday. They protest against the prohibition orders by the state government, directing them not to make combines functional, without installing super stubble management system (SSMS). The agitators blocked the national highway in front of the DAC, as a result of which, buses and other vehicles had to ply on alternative routes. The Deputy Commissioner (DC) held a meeting with a delegation of agitators and persuaded them to lift the dharna. The protesters said the DC promised to take up their issue with higher authorities.
