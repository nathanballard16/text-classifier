Karnataka’s 1st detention centre to house illegal immigrants opens

Bengaluru, December 25

Amid nationwide protests over the controversial citizenship law, the first detention centre in Karnataka, reportedly meant to lodge illegal immigrants and migrants overstaying in the country, has been opened in Sondekoppa village near here.

The facility with several rooms, a kitchen and toilets has been kept ready on the directions of the government, a social welfare department official said. However, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai objected to the term ‘Detention Centre’. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, he had said, “There is no purpose per se to detain someone on issue of citizenship.”

“Please check with the social welfare department. At least I have no information that it has started. If at all it has been operationalised then there should be some detenue there. No one is there,” he added. According to Bommai, the purpose to keep the facility ready was to lodge African nationals overstaying in India and indulging in drug peddling. He said their illegal activities had created a law and order problem. — PTI
