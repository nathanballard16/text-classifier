Govt. doctors launch indefinite strike

Doctors affiliated to the Federation of Government Doctors' Association (FOGDA) staged a protest outside the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Government Hospital as they started an indefinite strike here on Friday.

Out patient service at the hospital and other government hospitals in the districts were affected though emergency services were not affected.

Speaking to The Hindu A. Thangavel, district organiser, FOGDA, said the doctors attached to associations, including Service Doctors and Post Graduates Association, Tamilnadu Medical Officers Association, and Democratic Tamil Nadu Government Doctors Association took part in the strike demanding time-bound pay promotion, 50% service quota for post-graduate seats, routine posting counselling for PGs and maintaining number of doctors based on needs of patients as opposed to norms laid by the Medical Council of India.

The Dynamic Assured Career Progression, introduced over 10 years ago has not been implemented for government doctors, the doctors claimed.

“We have been putting forth our demands to the government for the last two years. Due to the lack of response, we have decided to protest. Even then, we have not disrupted patient services. All doctors at Primary Health Centres (PHCs) are working without signing for the day,” said a doctor from the department of physiology, MGMGH.
