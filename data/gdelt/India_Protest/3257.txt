Screen grab from 'Jhansi Ki Rani'

Moropant wants Manu to take care of her friend Manjari, who must be traumatised to see her groom getting killed by the British. He comforts his daughter by boosting her morale and asking her to keep her spirits high.

But Manu is disheartened to see her friend in such a pitiable condition. Manjari loses control of her senses and weeps inconsolably. Manu is shocked to see the treatment meted out to her Manjari who is now a widow.

Manjari gets dragged by a few women who want to tonsure her head. Manu opposes orthodoxy and superstitions and vows to get rid of ill-practices from the system.

Meanwhile, in Jhansi, the villagers seek justice from Raja Gangadhar for giving away their farms to the British for the cultivation of a drug. Janki Bai prevents the Raja from addressing his subjects and instead meets them herself to give them a misleading justification.

Later, Janki Bai threatens the King's advisor Rajguru to remain tight-lipped about her plans. She wants him to help him find an innocent bride for the King who she could keep in her control.

The Rajguru and his wife, who are loyal staff members of King Gangadhar, refuse to work against him. They quietly agree to listen to Janki Bai but decide to do what they feel is right.
