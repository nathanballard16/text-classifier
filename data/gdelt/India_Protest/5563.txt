Majority of the senators remained absent to register protest against the alleged dictatorial administration by the VC and his aides, sources at the university informed.The group of students started protest soon after the senate meeting began at 12 noon and continued till the senate meeting ended at 3.30 pm. But the VNSGU officials refused to come out to accept the memorandum after which the students rushed to the senate hall pushing away the security.During the protest the students broke a portion of the door.The VNSGU officials called the police which tried to mediate a compromise between university management and agitating students. But by organising senate and tabling budget for next year the university has openly violated the code of conduct,” said Bhavesh Rabari, a sanator.
