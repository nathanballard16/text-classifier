Chandigarh: Over 500 female students of a privately-run university in Punjab's Bathinda went on a protest after they were asked to strip by the hostel warden. The students claimed, they were forced to strip and undergo a search exercise in order to check who among them had allegedly dumped a used sanitary pad in the toilet.

Reportedly, the university authorities initially described the incident as a small mistake but when the students held a protest, the university terminated the services of the four employees without taking any legal action. According to a report in the Times of India (TOI), the authorities at the Akal University in Talwandi Sabo terminated the services of two female wardens and two female security guards on charges of dereliction of duty.

Reportedly, the students have accused the university authorities of delay in taking action against the four employees. They also mentioned that the general atmosphere of the college is extremely conservative as the male and female students are not allowed to even talk to each other.

The students who had joined the protest told TOI that they have been standing firmly against the wardens and the authorities. They demanded legal action against the wardens.

A similar incident was reported in November 2018, when around 15 schoolgirls in a village were allegedly made to strip their uniforms by female teachers in order to find the girl who had allegedly dumped a used sanitary napkin in the toilet.

Reportedly, the warden found the dumped sanitary napkins two days ago and since then they had stripped two residents along with the help two female guards. The University's dean told TOI that the services of the accused employees have been terminated by the authorities.
