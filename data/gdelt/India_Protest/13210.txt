Anti-NDA Party Unites to Enforce Congress-led Bharat Bandh on Monday

Patna: A day before the Congress Party's call for a nationwide bandh on Monday to protest against NDA's economic policies, leaders of various anti-NDA parties in Bihar met with the Congress leaders at Sadaqat Ashram to express support for the bandh while pledging to march with Congress side by side across Bihar.

The bandh has been called to protest against skyrocketing petroleum prices, devaluation of rupees against the US dollar, and rising prices of essential commodities across the nation. The bandh will also highlight crime against minorities in the country, particularly in states where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is in power like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.

Leaders of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM), and a number of leftist leaders met with Kaukab Qadri and other Congress leaders on Sunday where they pledged to support the Congress-led bandh on Sunday while also hoping to forge an alliance that would be strong enough to take on the Modi-Shah juggernaut in the next year's Lok Sabha elections.

Bihar Congress president Kaukab Qadri said that his party was rallying in Bihar against rising crime under Nitish administration and systemic cases of rape and sexual assaults on girls and women in shelter homes across the state.

Congress legislator Premchand Mishra said that the bandh is expected to be peaceful and essential services like hospitals and pharmacies have been exempted from the shutdown.

Meanwhile, both Congress and RJD took out 'torchlight' processions late Sunday evening to drum up support for the bandh.
