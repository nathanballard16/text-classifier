IAF demonstrates fire power in Rajasthan

New Delhi, Feb 16 : As India explores military options to avenge Pulwama attacks, close to 150 Indian Air Force (IAF) fighters demonstrated their fire power at an exercise Vayu Shakti in Rajasthan on Saturday.

Though Vayu Shakti was planned months before the car bombing in Jammu and Kashmir, the exercise sends a strong signal about India's preparedness and capabilities.

A host of foreign military attaches were flown to the Pokhran field firing range, a designated location close to Pakistan border, for practising live fire, to witness IAF's precision and accuracy.

IAF chief B.S Dhanoa said that IAF was prepared for any action, including the present sub-conventional threat, and assured the nation of its capabilities and commitment.

"We are showcasing our capability to hit hard, hit fast and hit with precision, hit during day, hit during night and hit during adverse weather conditions through our autonomous bombing capabilities," he said.

An entire range of IAF fighters from Su-30 MKIs to Mirage 2000s, Jaguars and Might 21s are taking part in the practice. The upgraded Mig 29s are also taking part along with the transporters and helicopters.

Among the options on table to avenge Pulwama attacks is precision air strikes on terror targets across the border.
