In Pulwama terrorist's family, grief for jawans' deaths

SRINAGAR: The family of the Pulwama suicide bomber is anguished and remorseful for the CPRF soldiers killed by their radicalized young son.Twenty-one-year-old suicide bomber Aadil Ahmad Dar’s uncle Abdul Rashid Dar said he was extremely sorry. “Who would appreciate the killing of any human being in the manner they got killed?” Dar told the TOI on phone.“After all they were human beings and were coming here to earn their livelihood,” he said.Aadil’s uncle said that his nephew had left his studies and would occasionally work as a labourer with a mason at construction sites. However, on March 19, 2018 he along with his cousin Sameer Dar went missing after he told his parents that he was going to meet his friend. He went on his bicycle and never came back, Rashid Dar said.Recalling that his parents registered a missing report with the police, Dar said that they later even made a video appeal and posted online, urging their son to return home when they got to know that he had joined militants.Aadil was the second son of Ghulam Hassan Dar, a poor vendor who sells cloth on bicycle door-to-door in Pulwama district. The suicide bomber’s elder brother, Javid is a carpenter while the youngest one Arif is studying in school, the uncle said. “We never thought he would join militants groups or become such a hardcore militant himself,” he added.Dar said Aadil became a Hafiz (memorized the Holy Quran ) in 2015 and became religiously inclined. However, after he received a bullet in the leg during stone-pelting at Newa in Pulwama following Burhan Wani’s killing in 2016, he may have become radicalized, the uncle said.A couple of months after his joining militant ranks, the family members accused the security forces of attempting to set their house on fire. Later, an FIR was registered in the case after the villagers staged a protest demonstration against the incident, Rashid Dar recalled.
