Docs, jr docs in T'gana protest NMC bill

Doctors, junior doctors and medical students in Telangana staged protests against the National Medical Commission (NMC) bill Thursday.

The junior doctors in Hyderabad, who have been agitating against the bill, held a sit-in at Dharna Chowk here.

The doctors, mainly private practitioners, boycotted work and protested at several places in the state as per a call given by the Indian Medical Association, medical sources said.

The protesters took out demonstrations at some places, they said.

Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) president M Kodandaram, popular Telugu film hero Rajasekhar, who is a medical doctor, addressed the protesters at Dharna Chowk.

Opposing various provisions of the bill, the junior doctors have been on the warpath for several days now, boycotting emergency services.
