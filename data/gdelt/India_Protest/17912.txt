Party protests against Rajoana move

Ludhiana: Shiv Sena Punjab on Thursday organized a protest against the Union government for commuting the death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana into life sentence. Rajeev Tandon, national president of Shiv Sena Punjab, said, “Commuting death sentence of terrorist Rajoana and pardoning Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar is nothing less than a mistake, consequences of which will be very serious and give more air to terror activities in Punjab. This is a decision taken by BJP under pressure from its partner Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and speaks of double standards of BJP which portrays itself as as a nationalist party. On the one hand, BJP speaks of zero tolerance stand against terrorists and talks of crushing terrorists in Kashmir, but when it comes to Punjab it changes its stand and releases dreaded terrorists who had killed innocent people.”
