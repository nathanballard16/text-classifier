BJP to attempt khichdi record at Amit Shah rally

In its latest bid to reach out to potential votebank — this time the Dalits — before the 2019 general elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party is yet again attempting to make a world record in cooking 3,000 kg khichdi. At its rally on Sunday, which will be addressed by party president Amit Shah, the khichdi will be made with rice and lentils collected from nearly three lakh Dalit households in Delhi.

This is not BJP's first attempt as it had undertaken a similar feat headed by Nagpur-based chef Vishnu Manohar in October last year with Union minister Nitin Gadkari in attendance. The official record in the Guinness Book of Records, however, is for 918.8 kg, which was achieved by celebrity chef Sanjeev Kapoor and Ministry of Food Processing Industries at World Food India festival held in Delhi in November 2017.

Called 'Samrasta Khichdi', the latest attempt will be at the Bhim Mahasangam rally in Ramleela Maidan with the ingredients collected by members of Delhi BJP's SC Morcha. "We have covered over two lakh Dalit houses so far and expect to reach 90 per cent of the targeted three lakh households in the coming days. Also, we are in touch with Guinness Book for getting this feat registered as a world record," said Delhi BJP SC Morcha president Mohanlal Gihara.

Gihara shared further that Manohar and his team, who had also made the previous attempt, has been invited to cook the dish at the rally likely to be attended by over 50,000 people. "A specially designed utensil measuring 20 feet in diameter and six feet in depth, will be used by the chef, Gihara said.
