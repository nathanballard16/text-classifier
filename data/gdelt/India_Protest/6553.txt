Stop reclamation, maintain status quo on ongoing coastal road project work, Bombay HC tells civic body

The Bombay High Court Tuesday passed an interim order asking the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to stop reclamation and maintain status quo on the ongoing work in the Rs 1,400-crore coastal road project. It further states that the coastal road and the ongoing reclamation are in patent breach of the law on environment clearances, traditional rights and jurisdiction. Senior counsel Milind Sathe for the state government told the court that the coastal road project is the only solution to the city’s traffic problems. But if the whole coastal road is being constructed by reclamation on the south section, then it is not an exception but becomes a rule. The court while saying that “status quo to be maintained”, added that it will pass a detailed order on Thursday.
