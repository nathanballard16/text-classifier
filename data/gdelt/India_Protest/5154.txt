Protest over farmer's death: Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road blocked

Moga (Punjab) [India], March 19 (ANI): Traffic on Ludhiana-Ferozepur Road remained disturbed as farmers union staged a sit-in protest on Tuesday over the alleged suicide of a farmer in Kokri Kalan Village in the district.

“A farmer committed suicide in Kokri Kalan village and based on his wife's complaint, a case has been registered. According to the complaint, three names were raised and a raid was also initiated in this regard,” said Moga Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Kuljinder Singh.

He further added that the alleged perpetrators are absconding. However, the investigation is underway.

One of the farmer's relatives alleged: "A few months back, his shop was encroached by a group of people. "Whenever he used to approach the authorities for justice, the accused used to continuously torture and threaten him. Two days ago, we found him hanging from the ceiling.

B.K Jograhan, secretary of district press, said, “We approached the police and they assured us that they'll nab the culprits in 24 hours, but no action was taken. They didn’t even give us a proper reply.”

Further, he added that the whole panchayat was supporting the protest "We don’t want to disturb the social fabric in any means but the negligence of the authorities left us with no choice than blocking the highway and staging a protest,” he said.

The farmer reportedly hanged himself at his home on March 16. (ANI)
