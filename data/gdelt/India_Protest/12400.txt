Bahrain takes legal action against Pakistanis who held anti-India rally after Eid prayers

Bahrain authorities have taken legal action against a group of Pakistani nationals who held an anti-India rally after Eid al-Adha prayers on Sunday.

The protest was allegedly carried out over the Indian government's decision to scrap Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.

In a tweet, the Bahrain interior ministry said, "legal proceedings were taken against some Asians for gathering in a way that violated the law after Eid prayer."

Adding, "It urges citizens and residents to not politically exploit religious occasions."
