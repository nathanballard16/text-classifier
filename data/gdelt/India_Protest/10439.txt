BJP to hold protests state-wide, seeking resignation of the CM HDK led 'minority' govt

BENGALURU: The state BJP unit on Monday resolved to hold protests across Karnataka seeking the resignation of chief minister H D Kumaraswamy and his “minority” government.Speaking to the media, after the BJP legislature party meeting, party state general secretary Arvind Limbavali said the decision was taken to hold protests as the government has lost its mandate.“As is being witnessed through the day, the coalition government has lost its majority and even the two independent ministers have submitted their resignation to the governor Vajubhai Rudabhai Vala. Accordingly, the government has only 103 MLAs with them, and we the opposition have a strength of 105 MLAs along with the support of two independents. We are demanding that chief minister H D Kumaraswamy and his minority government will resign on its own,” said Limbavali.The BJP on Monday resolved to hold protest rallies across all district headquarters to build pressure on the coalition government to give-in and submit their resignation.On being questioned whether the BJP is not confident of staking claim to form the government, considering it has claimed the numbers, Limbavali said: “We are going to give the government two-three days, in which time we expect the coalition government to come to its senses and resign on its own. Further decisions will be taken at our legislature party meeting scheduled on Tuesday once again.”
