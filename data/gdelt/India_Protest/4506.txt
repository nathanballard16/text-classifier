Strike continues, PAU serves notices on 3 students

Ludhiana: As the students’ hunger strike entered the third day, the PAU authorities served notices on three more students — PhD scholar Karanvir Singh Sandhu, Gurinder Singh from MSc agri-economics and Gurmaninder Singh from MBA agri-business — for spreading misinformation and instigating other students to protest and disrupting university activities.

On Thursday, Jasleen Singh of MSc and four other students of BSc — Harman Singh, Harkirat Singh, Avtar Singh, and Mehakdeep Singh — sat on the relay fast.

Gurmaninder said: “My parents have received a notice. They also told us that only if other students are with you, then you should go ahead with your move.”

PhD scholar Karanvir Sandhu, who has received a notice dean College of Agriculture, said: “I am helping students fulfil their demands. I have never misled any one. The authorities should come forward to hear our problems.”

PAU estate officer Dr Vishvajit Singh Hans said, “On Wednesday, we had called students for discussion and asked them to give a proposal on what sort of arrangements they want so that they could take vehicles to the department, but they did not turn up. Today, we had a meeting with students in the evening, but they did not submit any idea or proposal on their own, and they just want that four-wheelers should be allowed in the campus. We have not banned cars, but we have told them to park their vehicles at the designated place.”
