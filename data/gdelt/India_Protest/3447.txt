(AIKS) members metat Sahyadri on Sunday, but despite the Chief Minister’s assurances they later confirmed that a second long march from Nashik to Mumbai would go ahead as planned.The week-long march will leave Nashik on February 20; the state legislative session will start on February 25. The farmers’ demands include immediate drought relief, loan waiver, MSP at one-and-a-half the full cost of production, a profarmer insurance scheme and increased pensions.“This time the number of protesters and farmers will be double because tribal farmers feel that this government has cheated them,” said Dr Ashok Dhawale, AIKS president.“The CM chaired a meeting to address various issues of farmers at Sahyadri, Mumbai,” an official tweeted.“Ministers Girish Mahajan,, MLAs, representatives of farmer organisations, senior government officials were present during the meeting. Thane, Nashik and Palghar officials joined via video conference.”“In March last year the state government promised many things, but did very little,” Dr Ajit Nawale, AIKS state general secretary, told Mumbai Mirror after the meetingHe said in Ahmednagar, Thane and Palgha, thousands of applications and original documents filed by tribals are missing from government offices. A loan waiver programme worth Rs 34,000 crore had not been implemented fully, he claimed.Dr Nawale said farmers and tribals were dissatisfied with the response of the government when it came to issues such as forest rights applications, the Rs 3,000 pension demand, forceful land acquisitions for the bullet train project, incomplete irrigation projects.Opening of cattle sheds across drought affected regions is another urgent issue, he said.AIKS also claimed that the government was trying to disrupt the march.“In Ahmednagar, a large farmers’ convention was held on February 13 to prepare for the march and a memorandum was submitted to the district collector. Nowhere was there any breach of peace. All necessary police permissions were taken. But just for organising this convention, police cases have been lodged against AIKS state general secretary Dr Ajit Nawale,” it said.The AIKS condemns this act of the government as an attempt to crush a democratic and peacefulstruggle. The AIKS warns that such repressive attempts of the government will not succeed in stopping the long march. The government should realise that farmers’ issues can be solved by accepting their just demands and by implementing them,” the AIKS statement said.
