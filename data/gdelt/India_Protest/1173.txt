‘Velivada’ which is a term for a Dalit ghetto, was raised by the late Phd scholar Rohit Vemula and his friends Dontha Prashanth, Vijay Pedapudi, Seshu Chemudugunta and Velpula Sunkanna on January 4, 2016, to protest against the HCU administration as they boycotted the scholars from entering the hostels in the University campus.

And after a few days of making the velivada, Rohit Vemula, was found hanging in a hostel room on January 17, 2016.

Ever since, the students of HCU commemorate Velivada day on January 4 and Rohith Shahadath Din on January 17. But this year, the portraits of revered leaders like Dr Ambedkar, Mahatma Phule and others, removed from Velivada at the instructions of the VC. Earlier in 2016, when it was set up the Velivada structure was removed in the night but the students set it up again.

And now this year the same thing has happened. Agitated Dalit activists demand a FIR to be registered against the VC.

Various Dalit organisations have condemned this act and have expressed their solidarity with the students of HCU who are demanding justice for Rohit Vemula. To express their solidarity these organizations have all joined with the students to protest against the destruction of the Velivada and the harassment of Dalit students by the Vice Chancellor.
