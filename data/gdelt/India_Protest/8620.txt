Srinagar: On the auspicious occasion of Eid, clashes broke out in Anantnag and Sopore in Jammu and Kashmir. Protestors shouting anti-India slogans took to streets displaying placards of separatist organisations. According to news agency reports, stones were pelted at security forces near Jamia Masjid in Srinagar; and a few posters depicting support to terrorist Zakir Musa and UN-designated terrorist Masood Azhar were also seen in the area.

Times Now channel reported that the violence broke out after Eid prayers. The protests began with stone pelting and intensified, following which police resorted to aerial firing and smoke shelling to disperse the crowd. While the situation has returned to normalcy in some parts of Srinagar town, tension prevails in other parts of the valley.

According to the Times Now channel report, the protests were not directly linked to the announcement of Assembly election dates in the state of Jammu and Kashmir. On Tuesday, the newly-appointed Home Minister Amit Shah held a high-level meeting with Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik, IB chief and other top officials of the ministry to consider the lifting of the ban on delimitation in the state.

"When delimitation takes place in the rest of the country the BJP is welcome to apply it to J&K until then we in the @JKNC_ will oppose, tooth & nail, any attempt to make changes without a mandate from the people of the state," National Conference chief Omar Abdullah tweeted on Tuesday.
