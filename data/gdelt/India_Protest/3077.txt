Chit Fund Bill: govt. breaches Oppn. unity

The government managed to expose the fissures in opposition unity as it introduced and managed to pass the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2018, in the Lok Sabha on Wednesday. The debate pitted the Congress and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)] against the Trinamool Congress (TMC).

The Bill seeks to ban chit funds and has resonance in the politics of West Bengal where several members of the TMC, among other politicians, have been accused of involvement in the Sarada and Rose Valley ponzi scams.

Acting Finance Minister Piyush Goyal introduced the Bill on Tuesday amid protests by the TMC, Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MPs after SP leader Akhilesh Yadav was prevented from visiting Prayagraj..

All this changed however, when Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhary spoke in support of the Bill and launched a blistering attack on the TMC.

“I support this Bill because ‘loot ka chhoot nahin hona chahiye’ (there should not be open season of looting),” he said. These people, he said, pointing to the protesting TMC MPs , are “the ruling party of West Bengal and together with chit fund companies, looted the poor people of the State.” Mr. Chowdhary said.

Scarcely had he finished when Mohammad Salim of the CPI(M) said, “The Chief Minister of West Bengal came to her position due to the chit fund companies. At least half a dozen of these MPs should have been in Bhubhaneswar jail now.”

On both occasions, BJP members, engaged in a political slugfest with the TMC over Saradha scam and other issues, were seen thumping their desks.
