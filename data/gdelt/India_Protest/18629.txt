Opposition likely to disrupt House over Maharashtra developments

NEW DELHI: The uncertainty in Maharashtra is likely to take a toll on parliamentary proceedings on Monday, with the political impasse likely to galvanise opposition parties into protesting against ruling BJP.Congress MPs confirmed on Sunday that they will move an adjournment motion in Lok Sabha to discuss the Maharashtra situation in addition to protesting against the “illegal” Devendra Fadnavis-Ajit Pawar combine. A separate meeting of the Congress ‘strategy group’ is scheduled at party chief Sonia Gandhi ’s residence at 9.15am, where Sonia and Rahul Gandhi Ahmed Patel , AK Antony, KC Venugopal and Congress whips in both Houses are expected to deliberate on strategy to be adopted.Party sources said a decision on floor coordination with like-minded parties, including DMK and NCP, is also expected to be taken. Till Sunday evening, Sena members said they had not taken a decision on whether or not to raise the Maharashtra issue in Parliament, nor on whether they will follow a coordinated floor strategy with Congress and NCP over the impasse. With government formation in Maharashtra, and the SC verdict on Congress-NCP-Sena’s demand for an immediate floor test taking centrestage, the opposition’s pet peeves like alleged corruption in electoral bonds are expected to be pushed to the back burner, if only temporarily.
