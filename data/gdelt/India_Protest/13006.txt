Ravidas temple row: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad send to judicial custody

A Delhi court on Thursday sent 96 people, including Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad, to 14 days judicial custody after they were arrested on the charge of rioting in the wake of the demolition of Guru Ravidas temple in the capital.

Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Bhanu Pratap came to the Kalkaji police station, where the accused were lodged after being taken into custody, and passed the order.

On Wednesday evening, Azad and his supporters had taken to the streets to protest against the razing of the temple and clashed with the police. They demanded restoration of the shrine at the same site.

An FIR was registered against them under several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including rioting, forming unlawful assembly and assault.

The Delhi Development Authority (DDA) had on August 10 demolished the temple in Tughlaqabad village, complying with an order of the Supreme Court.
