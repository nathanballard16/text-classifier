Don’t engage lung patients at chlorine plants, says expert

‘Negligence and insufficient know-how causing accidents’

Calling upon industries to avoid engaging people suffering from pulmonary diseases at chlorinated plants, chlorine expert from Vadodara Harbhajan Singh Sehgal on Monday said collective effort coupled with awareness could minimise risk and loss at industries.

“Chlorine is harmful to those suffering from asthma and other lung diseases. It is not advisable to depute them near chlorine plants. Similarly, industrial units must adhere to safety norms and be equipped with modern disaster mitigation devices,” he said, while addressing a workshop on ‘Water chlorination and safe handling of chlorine,’ organised by the Factories Department in association with the Andhra Sugars Limited as part of the National Safety Celebrations here.

He said negligence, careless handling of machines and hazardous material, and insufficient knowledge was leading to industrial accidents. “Starting from the Bhopal Tragedy to the recent accident in Mumbai, we can see negligence behind every industrial accident. People think they have the required knowledge, but fail to raise to the occasion,” he said. Stressing the role of managements, he advised them to conduct mock drills periodically and update safety equipment as per norms.

Deputy Chief Inspector of Factories M.V. Sivakumar Reddy presided over the meeting, in which representatives of different industries in East Godavari and West Godavari districts were present. A demonstration was held at the Victoria Waterworks on water chlorination.
