He said, speaking at a function here on Friday "Our soldiers were martyred (in Pulwama). There was an intelligence failure. I don't want to criticise anyone. But, whenever we say the truth or point at their mistake, we are dubbed as anti-nationals,". Patel further added that "I want to tell them that you (BJP) don't have the sole rights of nationalism. You have never made any sacrifices like Congress leaders did in the past,". He was here to inaugurate an exhibition on the subject ‘Congress' contribution in 60 years’.

The Rajya Sabha MP said "I laugh and also get angry when someone asks what the Congress did in 60 years. If they (BJP) can't see what we have done, it is not our fault. They should be ashamed of asking what we have done in 60 years,". Patel said"Present government is the weakest ever. They (BJP) used to tell us (UPA govt) to talk tough with Pakistan...You are only good at delivering speeches. But, that will not make India strong. We all countrymen should remain united to teach a lesson to Pakistan (for the Pulwama attack),".
