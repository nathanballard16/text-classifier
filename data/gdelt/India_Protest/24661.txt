Rush for birth papers of those born before 1952

‘Jump in number of those looking for

of grandparents’

MEERUT: As protests over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and NRC continued in different parts of the country, there has been a sudden rise in the number of people queuing up in UP’s Hapur municipal council office to get birth certificates, mainly of their parents and grandparents who were born between 1948 and 1952 . Hapur Nagar Palika Parishad executive officer JK Anand said the rush has increased in the past one week.“Earlier, hardly two-three people used to come here on a day to get birth certificates, but suddenly the number has increased,” Anand said.Earlier, hardly two-three people used to come here on a day to get birth certificates, but suddenly the number increased and strangely they want to get birth certificates of people born between 1948 and 1952. We don’t have such backdated records to work on and hence we are asking for time,” Hapur Nagar Palika Parishad executive officer JK Anand said on Wednesday.This comes at a time when confusion prevails over the documents that one would require to provide to prove their citizenship for NRC. While authorities have assured that people will not have to prove their pre-1971 ancestry or any compulsion to submit documents of parents or ancestors, confusion prevails as these were required during the NRC exercise in Assam . “People are coming here to get birth certificates of their parents and grandparents,”Anand said.“I have come here to get the birth certificates of my children. PM Modi has said all the documents should be there,” a local said. According to the home ministry, citizenship may be proved by giving any document relating to the date of birth or place of birth.
