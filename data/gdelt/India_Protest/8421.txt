Endosulfan daycare centres: Victims’ parents against change of guard

MANGALURU: A delegation comprising parents and caretakers of endosulfan victims from Kokkada in Belthangady submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner S Sasikanth Senthil protesting against the handing over of endosulfan daycare centres of Kokkada and Koila to Seon Ashram, on Wednesday.Speaking to TOI, after submitting the memorandum, Revathi Thamankar said that Seva Bharathi has been running the centre well for the last two years.Children have developed a bond and many of them are crying saying that they would not go to the centre in case the staff are changed. "We have noticed a lot of improvement in them during the last two years. We also want the district administration to consider setting up of a permanent rehabilitation centre," she said.Seon Ashram from Belthangady will be the new organisation to run endosulfan day care centres in Kokkada and Koila villages of Dakshina Kannada from June 1. The term of Seva Bharati, which handled the centres from March 2017, ends on May 31. The ashram that looks after more than 300 destitutes, including several who are mentally challenged, was the lowest among five bidders for the daycare centres in the district. The tenders were floated in March.In 2011, former chief minister B S Yeddyurappa set up two daycare centres. Initially, Srikshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Project (SKDRDP) looked after the centres.Deputy commissioner S Sasikanth Senthil said, “We have followed the guidelines and Seon Ashram has won the tender. In case the quality does not match, re-tenders will be called for after examining the situation.”A delegation comprising parents and caretakers from Koila Day Care Centre for endosulfan victims also met the deputy commissioner on Saturday.
