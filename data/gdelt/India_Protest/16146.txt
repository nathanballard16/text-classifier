OU students express solidarity with RTC striking employees

Hyderabad: Joint Action Committee (JAC) of Osmania University Students organized a strange protest by cooking the food in front of Arts College, Osmania University yesterday to express their solidarity to the RTC employees who are on strike.

The JAC of Telangana Students threatened the Govt. that they would intensify their agitation. They also completely supported ‘Khammam Bandh’ which is being organized today.

They declared that Govt. of Telangana is playing with the future of the students by extending Dussehra vacation. It is worsening the situation by not fulfilling the promises it made to the students during Telangana Agitation.

They recalled that due to the strength of the students, Mr. KCR was successful in getting separate Telangana State. They also said that they will not hesitate to launch a movement to dislodge Mr. KCR. They appealed to the striking RTC employees to refrain from taking extreme steps like suicide etc.

Sensing the unrest of the students, police had made elaborate arrangements at Arts College. The students announced that they have become part of RTC strike and they will continue their protest till the demands of RTC employees are met. The students of OU appealed to other trade unions to express their solidarity with RTC Union and to make the Govt. realize the strength of the workers.
