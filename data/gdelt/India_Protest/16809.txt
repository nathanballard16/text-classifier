Farmers take to the streets

Oppose move to enter trade pact with ASEAN

Farmers owing allegiance to various constituent organisations of the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) staged a dharna here on Friday vehemently opposing any move by the Central government to enter into the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade accord mooted by the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).

Vociferously opposing any move by the Centre to join the RCEP, the demonstrators alleged that the proposed trade pact would deal a crippling blow to agriculture and dairy sectors in the country, thereby affecting the livelihoods of crores of people across the length and breadth of the country.

Addressing the demonstrators, the leaders of the farmers' organisations warned that the farm sector in the country is bound to suffer adversely if India joins the RCEP, which would pave way for duty-free imports of cheap farm and dairy products and other goods from the ASEAN member countries.

“This would snatch away the livelihoods of crores of farmers and take a heavy toll on the already unstable agricultural sector in the country,” they said.

They demanded that the State government immediately convey its opposition to any move by the Centre to join the RCEP in writing to avert a major threat to the farming community and safeguard the interests of farmers in Telangana and elsewhere in the country.
