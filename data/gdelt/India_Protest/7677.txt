Jaipur: A protest was staged in Alwar on Saturday against the delayed police action in the case of a gangrape, reported in April. The protest was led by BJP Rajya Sabha member Kirorilal Meena who later courted arrested. A large number of people gathered in front of the Jagannath temple to protest the alleged police negligence in the case. They also blocked traffic at Roopvaas Gate in the city.

Earlier on Friday, National Scheduled Castes Commission Vice-President L Murugan, Rajasthan chief secretary D.B. Gupta and Director General of Police Kapil Garg reached Alwar to oversee the investigation.

After meeting the victim, Murugan said, "The case was registered on April 30, the police started acting only after seven days, which shows its negligent attitude towards it. We are awaiting the report of the high-level investigation, which is in progress."

On April 26, the victim along with her husband were stopped, abducted and dragged to an isolated place where the woman was raped. The alleged rapists also filmed the act and uploaded that on Youtube, which was removed on the commission direction. The couple had approached the police, which allegedly did not act citing lack of manpower and time due to the ongoing Lok Sabha elections.
