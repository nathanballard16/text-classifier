Patna: Patna University students representing various political outfits on Saturday created ruckus outside the Wheeler Senate Hall during a PU senate meeting where they clashed with the police resulting in injuries on both sides.

However, they were met with fierce resistance by the city police that used force to crush their advance into the Senate Hall.

Ironically, the students were protesting against anti-social elements in the campus - the very behavior they were engaging in during today's protest.

They were also chanting anti-PU slogans accusing it of squandering away money for infrastructural development and failure to obtain central university status to Patna University.

Several students were hurt in the lathi charge and at least two cops were seen bleeding from their head and were taken to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment.

Amidst all the mêlée, the Senate passed a deficit budge of Rs. 333.52 crore for the 2019-2020 fiscal year.

The Rs. 365.94 crore budget against an income of Rs. 24.36 crore was presented by Pro Vice Chancellor Dolly Sinha in the presence of PU Vice Chancellor Rash Bihari Prasad Singh.

"The deficit of Rs. 333.52 crore will be met by various grants including from the Education Department, Science and Technology Department, income from distance education and other self-financing courses," Sinha said.

Though such budge exercise is held each fiscal year by the Patna University, many claim that there is hardly any sign of improvement in the campus life or the quality of education despite crores of rupees being funded by the Central government.
