Delhi: ABVP protest against DU Vice-chancellor

New Delhi [India], Mar 5 (ANI): Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) on Tuesday protested against Delhi University's Vice-Chancellor Yogesh K Tyagi for non-implementation of various demands of the students.

“This is a protest against the Vice Chancellor. We are demanding supplementary examinations, new hostels, centralised admission to hostels, special paths for Divyangs, etc. I have written three letters to him to discuss and address the problems of students,” Delhi University Student’s Union (DUSU) president Shakti Singh told ANI.

“We got information that the V-C has been admitted to AIIMS. We are giving him an ultimatum of 15 days to fulfill our demands,” he added.

Shakti Singh was elected as the vice-president of DUSU but was elevated as president later after Ankiv Baisoya resigned from the post of president following his suspension from the ABVP in a fake degree row.

The Delhi High Court on December 18, 2018, had ordered Singh to take charge as DUSU president. (ANI)
