Farmers call off Amritsar-Delhi blockade

Agitating farmers in Punjab today called off their protest after blocking the Amritsar-Delhi rail track over the last two days, after the Punjab and Haryana High Court intervened. The agitation led to cancelation of 38 trains and diversion of 11 trains, officials said.

A petition was filed in the court on Tuesday that sought for removal of farmers protesting on the Amritsar-Delhi rail track, with the HC issuing notices to Punjab, Centre and leaders of farmers’ outfit Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee to appear before it on Wednesday.

The farmers called off their protest after the leaders of the protesting farmers gave an assurance in this regard.

Farmers under the Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Committee had blocked the Amritsar-Delhi rail track in Amritsar to get their demands fulfilled that included a full loan waiver, implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report, ending auction of land and arrest of farmers, and payment of sugarcane crop with 15 per cent interest.
