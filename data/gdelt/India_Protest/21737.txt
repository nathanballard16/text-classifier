New Delhi: Amid protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), traffic movement was affected in several busy areas of the national capital on Tuesday. Traffic movement between Daryaganj and Rajghat was closed due to a demonstration while vehicular activity on Seelampur to Jafrabad road was stopped in the wake of violent protests in the area.

Delhi Traffic Police announced on its Twitter handle, "Traffic movement is closed from Daryaganj to Raj Ghat (both carriageways) due to demonstration. Traffic is diverted from Delhi Gate, Nishad Raj Marg, ITO towards Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg."

"Traffic movement has been closed on 66 feet road from Seelampur to Jafrabad (both carriageways) due to demonstration," said the traffic police in another tweet.

Earlier in the day, traffic was affected from Daryaganj to Delhi Gate due to anti-CAA demonstrations, however, it returned to normalcy after a couple of hours.

After a clash broke out between police and protesters in Delhi's Jafrabad during protests against the CAA, entry and exit gates of Welcome, Jaffrabad and Maujpur-Babarpur, Seelampur and Gokulpuri were closed. The metro trains were not halting at these stations.

After three hours, entry/exit gates of Seelampur, Welcome, Gokulpuri, Johri Enclave and Shiv Vihar were reopened.

Delhi is witnessing massive protests across the union territory against the recently-passed Citizenship Amendment Act, which provides citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh living in the country.
