PMC Bank depositors pin hope on PMO & Matoshree

Tired of protesting everywhere- from RBI office to Azad Maidan in Mumbai, the helpless depositors are now planning to meet Shiv Sena Supremo and the Prime Minister.

On Wednesday they staged a protest at Azad Maidan against the bank’s management, the RBI and the government, demanding that they be allowed to access their accounts without restrictions as soon as possible, reports the Indian Express.

The depositors said they are now planning to knock on the doors of the Prime Minister’s Office and Matoshree, the residence of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, to seek a solution.

Devendra Fadnavis, who had earlier assured them of taking up the matter with the Prime Minister Narendra Modi is apparently silent once the results have been declared in his favour, charges many of the depositors.

When aggrieved depositors confronted Fadnavis after an election rally he said he could not give them any assurance as the Model Code of Conduct was in force. But he will be meeting Prime Minister Modi on the issue.
