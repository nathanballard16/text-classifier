Thevar outfits threaten major protest on Oct. 30

Madurai

Various Thevar outfits under Thevarina Desabakthi Munnani have threatened to stage a dharna at Goripalayam junction where freedom fighter Muthuramalinga Thevar statue is located here on his birth anniversary on October 30, pressing for naming Madurai airport after the leader.

Moovendar Munnetra Kazhagam leader G.M. Sridhar Vandaiyar told reporters here on Tuesday that the followers of Muthuramalinga Thevar had waited for long seeking a no-objection certificate from State Government to facilitate the Centre to name the airport after the freedom fighter.

Recalling that the munnani had staged a series of protests last year, he said one lakh people would gather at Goripalayam, if the State Government did not heed to their demand by October 30.

“I will launch a fast unto death at the memorial of Muthuramalinga Thevar at Pasumpon, if the State Government failed to fulfil our demand,” he said.

Former All India Forward Block MLA P.V. Kathiravan said that Thevar deserved to be recognised by naming the airport for he had served as MLA and MP three times each. He also pointed out that he had been honoured with a statue in Parliament and also a portrait in the State Assembly.

South India Forward Bloc leader K.C. Tirumaran was present.
