Is the Kerala temple battle about gender, law or religion? Unfortunately, all three

New Delhi (CNN) To call it big would be an understatement. On Tuesday, a human chain stretching for more than 600 kilometers (372 miles) was formed by millions of women in the southern Indian state of Kerala to demand entry to a major Hindu temple that traditionally barred women of child-bearing age.

It was the largest demonstration of its kind since the issue became a national talking point in September, when a ruling by India's Supreme Court scrapped the gender restriction, calling it unconstitutional.

For months, attempts to enact that ruling had been thwarted, with female devotees blocked entry to the temple site by angry mobs.

That changed on Wednesday, when two women made history by slipping into the shrine before daybreak, flanked by plainclothes police deputed to protect them.

For many in India, however, this isn't only an issue of gender equality. The battle over who can and can't enter the Sabarimala temple is also a question of tradition and the limits of the law. And then there's the politics, as orthodox and secular forces clash ahead of India's general elections later this year.

Kerala police attempt to disperse crowds protesting against women entering the temple.
