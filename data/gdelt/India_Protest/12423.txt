People Protest Indian Govt’s Decision On Kashmir’s Status

Hundreds of worshippers gathered on a street in a neighborhood in Srinagar after the Eidal-Adha prayers on Monday, following an unprecedented security lockdown by troops in India-administered Kashmir that forced most people in the disputed region to stay indoors on the Islamic holy day.

Protesters demonstrated against the Indian government's surprise revocation of Muslim-majority Kashmir's special status last week.

All communications and the internet remained cut off for the eighth day.

Protestors chanted “We want freedom” and “Go India, Go back,” witnesses said, and asked that the UN “Help us to get out of this oppression.”

“This is our mourning, this is an atmosphere of mourning. You can see my condition, you can see my throat (sore throat). We are dying, we don't have anything,” said Aijaz Ahmad, a local resident.



“We want to tell the UN to help us to get out of this oppression. We don’t know how many have died, how is the situation (elsewhere) - no phones, no contact with anyone - and Modi (Indian Prime Minister) says ‘there is peace in Kashmir’,” said Wamiqa, a local resident.

Officials said the protest ended peacefully.

The security lockdown in India's only Muslim-majority region is expected to last through Thursday, India's Independence Day.

The restrictions had been briefly eased for Friday prayers last week and for shopping ahead of Eid.
