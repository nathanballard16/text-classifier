Stop work on bus stop near Mukteshwar: ASI tells CRUT

Bhubaneswar: The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has issued a stop construction notice to the Capital Region Urban Transport (Crut), which has been constructing a bus stop near near the Mukteshwar Temple, without taking prior permission.The ASI, which is the custodian of the 10th century shrine, has issued the notice on the grounds that prohibits any new construction within a radius of 100 metres of protected monuments except repairs and renovation. The bus stop was being constructed near the boundary wall of Kedar Gouri and Mukteshwar Temple. According to the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act of 1958, any new construction is not allowed within a 100-metre radius of such monuments.“We have sent the notice to the urban transport body asking them to stop the construction of the bus stop since it falls within the prohibited area. We have asked them to shift the bus stop to some other place,” Arun Mallick, superintending archaeologist, ASI (Bhubaneswar), said.It must be noted that the Old Town or Ekamrakhestra is home to a number of such protected monuments. Many of them are facing problems due to various illegal construction works taken up in the prohibited areas.“Any new construction near the protected monuments amounts to gross violation of rules. We have been monitoring these illegal construction works and issuing notices to the agencies concerned,” Mallick said.Officials said a person needs to take the permission of the National Monument Authority, New Delhi for taking up even repairs and renovation, leave alone new construction in the vicinity of protected monuments.“The local authorities should allow such construction works. It is the duty of the state tourism department to look after such constructions and take appropriate action,” another ASI official said.Old Town resident Jagannath Tripathy said many such monuments in the Old Town are now facing crisis due to the arbitrary nature of the local authorities. “If there are rules regarding any new construction near protected sites, the local authorities should adhere to them,” Tripathy said.
