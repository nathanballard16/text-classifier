Criminal silence of international community over Indian state terrorism in occupied Kashmir could create a massive humanitarian crisis in the held valley:

Altaf Hameed Rao (Kashmir Journalist): Yesterday, after Jumma prayers the Kashmiris hold a march towards the United Nations Office to defy the curfew and illegal lockdown imposed by the Indian authorities. Indian forces used tear gas on the innocent Kashmiris. There could be a massive humanitarian crisis if the world community continues to maintain criminal silence on the continued lockdown in the territory. The measures imposed after India revoked the constitutionally mandated status of the state of Jammu and Kashmir would exacerbate tensions in the region.
