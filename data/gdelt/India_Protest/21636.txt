Jamia Violence: Live updates from the Supreme Court of India

Mehta: 67 persons, including students and other miscreants, sustained injuries and were taken to the hospital. Several police personnel also sustained injuries

SG Mehta: No student is arrested. We have to be responsible while arguing on facts. No students are in jail, were never in jail

Mehta: Students were taken to the hospital, given medical care and no money was charged. In some time, Jamia University Officer came and he identified the students and took them.

CJI Bobde: What about the claim that there are hospitalized students who are not getting attention?

Mehta: One more thing, there was a rumor spread that two students had died

Jaising: We never said or claimed that. Why is he addressing the rumors?

CJI Bobde: We are asking about the medical attention

Mehta: The Delhi Police had to make use of tear gas shells to disperse the crowd and one of the protesters picked up the shell and tried to throw it back when it exploded and that is why they sustained injuries.

Gonsalves: Please send a retired SC judge to Aligarh

Jaising: Please pass orders for peacekeeping measures. Just by asking in Open Court for maintenance of peace, it won’t help.

Supreme Court dictating its order now.
