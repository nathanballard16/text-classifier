Loadmen protest use of non-union men

Tirupur: About 150 loadmen belonging to the Tirupur railway goods shed loadmen association-CITU staged a protest against a company’s move to deploy loadmen not registered with the railway unions for loading and unloading goods at the Vanjipalayam railway station in the district on Wednesday. Later, India Cements, which deployed them, withdrew its workers and allowed the union loadmen to unload goods.

The incident took place when the first freight train carrying cement bags from Sankari reached Vanjipalayam on Wednesday morning.

The company deployed around 40 people, mostly from northern states, to unload the cement bags and load them onto trucks.

“In Tirupur and Vanjipalayam railway stations, 147 loadmen and 42 loadwomen attached to our association have been loading and unloading goods. Besides, there are around 40 people who substitute the regular loadmen if they are unavailable. But, the company was trying to set a wrong precedence by deploying ‘outsiders’, which would directly affect our livelihood,” S M Palanisami, president of the association, said.

The protest stalled the unloading work for more than three hours before the company accepted to withdraw its workforce. Subsequently, the regular loadmen unloaded and loaded the cement bags in the trucks, most of which would be transported to Kerala.
