Mandi, August 9

Regular traffic was restored on the Chandigarh-Manali highway by Friday evening after landslides near Hanogi, Dawada and Banala blocked the road between Mandi and Kullu.

Although traffic flow was restored by evening, some vehicular congestion was still reported at the site of landslides.

The landslides forced authorities to divert light vehicles through Katola, which Mandi SP Gurdev Chand Sharma said was not fit for heavy vehicles.

Administration halted vehicles that came from Mandi at Pandoh. Vehicles coming from the other side were stopped at Kullu.

The National Highways Authority of India and district authorities deployed heavy machinery to clear debris.

It has been raining in the region since Thursday night.

Tjhe police official said heavy rain the region has been witnessing since Thursday night coupled with ongoing construction in the area to loosen soil, causing landslides.

One vehicle carrying apple boxes was hit by a large boulder near Banala. Although there were five people in the vehicle at that time, nobody was wounded. The vehicle however suffered major damaged.

A landslide was also reported at Banta Mod, near Rohtang, on Thursday. The Border Roads Organisation cleared the road the same day.
