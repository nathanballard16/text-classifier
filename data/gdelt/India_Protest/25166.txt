Why include only 3 nations under CAA, asks Congress leader

ALLAHABAD: Condemning the police action on students protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University, Congress spokesperson Supriya Shrinate questioned why were refugees from only three countries — Pakistan , Bangladesh and Afghanistan — were included in the new citizenship law.Shrinate was in Allahabad on Fridayto attend the swearing-in ceremony of newly appointed district president Ram Kishun Patel. The journalist-turned politician said, “Why did the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government chose to include refugees from only three countries — Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan — and followers of six religions to offer citizenship under CAA. Why is PM Narendra Modi not allowing Hindus of Sri Lanka and Christians of Bhutan to get an Indian citizenship too under the law?” Shrinate said that the CAA will divide the country on the lines of religion. She also claimed that Congress and its allies had not tried to turn anyone against the law and people had themselves taken to streets to protest against the government’s failures.“Even an ordinary Congress worker could debate over CAA.”Saying that there was no room for violence during protests, Shrinate said that her party condemned the upheaval.
