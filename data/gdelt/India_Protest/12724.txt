Article content The state and federal governments did not respond to questions about the number of incidents and the level of injuries. Rohit Kansal, Jammu and Kashmir spokesman, told a news conference that there had been no untoward incidents from areas where the security forces had relaxed restrictions. Restrictions remain “There were reports of incidents of disturbance at two-to-three places where relaxation was not given; the security forces dealt with those incidents locally,” he said. The Indian authorities also reversed a decision to allow internet and mobile phone use in parts of the Jammu region, according to one of the officials.

Article content Photo by Yawar Nazir/ Getty Images India has been battling a revolt for 30 years in the part of Kashmir that it controls, in which at least 50,000 people have been killed. Critics say the decision to revoke autonomy will cause further alienation and fuel the armed resistance. Some also say they fear that Hindus will eventually come to dominate the state, and that Kashmiri Muslims will lose their cultural and religious identity. The change will allow non-residents to buy property in Jammu and Kashmir, and end the practice of reserving state government jobs for local residents. Modi’s government has said the measure is necessary to defeat terrorism, reduce corruption and nepotism, speed up development, and integrate Kashmir fully into India.
