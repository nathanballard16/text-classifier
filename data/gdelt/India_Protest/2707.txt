SARUPATHAR: The All Tai-Ahom Students’ Union (ATASU) and other organizations in Assam called for a 12-hour dawn-to-dusk State-wide bandh in Assam on Saturday in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019.

Normal life was affected in several areas across the State, including Sarupathar under Dhansiri subdivision. Although State Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma had earlier announced that all shops and business establishments should remain open while government employees must report for their duties, business establishments remained closed at Sarupathar, Barpathar, Naojan and Uriamghat under Dhansiri subdivision.

SMSS general secretary Akash Daw of Sarupathar regional unit said that this bandh would not be called off as the very existence of the Assamese people and their identity was at stake.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was introduced in the Lok Sabha to amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 to grant Indian Citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians who fled religious persecution in Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan and entered India before December 31, 2014.

Meanwhile, Daw also urged the public of Dhansiri subdivision to protest against CAB on February 11 otherwise on February 12 the Bill would be passed in Rajya Sabha by the BJP-led government.

Moreover, activists of different organizations like Satra Mukti Sangram Samiti (SMSS), Assam Jatiyatabadi Yuba Parishad (AJYP) and All Tai-Ahom Students’ Union (ATASU) of Dhansiri subdivision burnt tyres on roads in various places of Dhansiri subdivision in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 on Saturday.
