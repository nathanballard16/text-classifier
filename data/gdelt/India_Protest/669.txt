Mumbai: Shiv Sena union withdraws from BEST bus strike as stir enters day 2 - Latest updates

The employees are demanding higher pay, merging budget of BEST with that of the BMC and deliberations on new wage agreement.

Over 32,000 employees of Mumbai's civic transport undertaking went on an indefinite strike Tuesday in support of various demands, including higher salaries. The strike is expected to continue Wednesday as talks between the undertaking's management and striking workers failed.

The state government quickly moved to invoke the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act (MESMA) against the striking employees of the Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST), while its management asked them to end the stir and come to the negotiating table.

The employees are demanding higher pay, merging budget of the loss-making transport undertaking with that of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), deliberations on new wage agreement, resuming appointments on compassionate grounds and a bonus equivalent to that of the civic body's employees.
