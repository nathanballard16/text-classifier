After discussion, students agreed for a peaceful protest and sat on dharna outside the senate hall with demand to submit memorandum.Police officials, who were trying to control the situation, were also surprised by the approach of the VNSGU officials who refused to come to accept the memorandum.“VNSGU officials refused to allow a number of senators to speak on important issues citing model code of conduct for election. But by organising senate and tabling budget for next year the university has openly violated the code of conduct,” said Bhavesh Rabari , a sanator.
