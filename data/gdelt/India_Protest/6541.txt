CloudNine Awards Multiple LAW Certifications to LDM Global

HOUSTON, April 16, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- Discovery automation software provider CloudNine™ has awarded administrator certification for CloudNine LAW™ to LDM Global, solidifying the relationship between the two companies. LDM Global is an information management, data solutions and litigation support firm with offices around the world.

Continuing its commitment to streamline the discovery process and offer multiple eDiscovery tools for its clients, LDM Global pursued certified administrator training with CloudNine LAW for members of its litigation support team. LAW is a robust software used to process and produce millions of print and digital documents, with speed and efficiency.

LDM Global's core focus includes growing its team members' expertise through continued educational training. Partnering with other software providers such as CloudNine ensures a well-rounded knowledge of many eDiscovery tools to ensure clients are offered the best support by subject matter experts regardless of the tool chosen.

"LDM Global considers itself to be technology-neutral, and we offer and support a number of top eDiscovery tools to ensure our clients are offered the best resources for their needs," said LDM Global CEO Conor Looney, "As an experienced software provider, CloudNine offers a robust and effective training program to ensure attendees have the knowledge needed to support the LAW software efficiently."

Administrator certification is offered only after the successful completion of two prerequisite courses totaling 8 hours of hands-on, instructor-led training. CloudNine LAW 301 is a rigorous, 4-hour training course during which students engage in a virtual environment to run experimental test data and demonstrate their expertise in complex, troubleshooting scenarios. The web-based training is delivered through a live, scheduled session moderated by an instructor for immediate interaction and support.

The CloudNine LAW certifications were issued to Trilok Singh Rawat, Operations Manager, with more than a decade of eDiscovery experience; Nagaraju Kshirasagar, a senior associate with three years experience in eDiscovery and litigation support; Vignesh Kamalakannan, a Project Manager with six years of eDiscovery experience; and Kiran Kumar, an Assistant Manager with 12 years of eDiscovery experience. Trilok specializes in eDiscovery domain knowledge and ESI trends. Nagaraju is a keen learner of technologies. He is well versed in Nuix and ViewPoint and is a certified Relativity One Pro and certified Relativity User. Vignesh also is certified as a Relativity Certified Administrator, Processing Specialist and Relativity One Pro. In addition to eDiscovery, Kiran has experience in ViewPoint as well as legal coding.

CloudNine CEO Brad Jenkins remarked, "As both our industry and technology have evolved, the expectation for immediate results parallels the progress. Success in litigation support means processing data fast but also thoroughly to minimize risk. LDM Global is a strong service provider with an impressive list of clients, and we are thrilled to have LDM Global team members certified in expert-level LAW administration and able to support more clients across the world in the tool.
