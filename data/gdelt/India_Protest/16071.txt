Kashmir lockdown: Curfew, communications blackout enters 70th day, protests continue

SRINAGAR (Monitoring Desk): Curfew and the lockdown entered its 70th day in Indian occupied Kashmir on Sunday as protests continued over New Delhi’s revocation of the special status of the occupied valley.

Residents of the valley amid suspension of mobile and internet services and absence of public transport, continue to face acute shortage of basic items of daily use including food and medicines.

Business establishments continue to remain shut while schools and offices continue to wear a deserted look.

According to Kashmir Media Service, four Kashmiri youth were martyred during a cordon and search by Indian troops in Ganderbal district. The operation, which was launched by the troops in Naranag, Trumkhal Gangbal and other areas of the district on September 27, has turned out to be the longest operation in the last 15 months. Indian para-commandos, who were airdropped, are also taking part in the operation.

On Saturday, at least seven people were injured after unidentified persons lobbed a grenade in Hari Singh High Street area of Srinagar. Soon after the incident, Indian police and troops cordoned off the area and launched searches to nab the attackers.

Indian government has said there have been over 330 incidents of protests in occupied Kashmir in last two months after the Narendra Modi-led government abolished Article 370, which granted special status to the territory.

The lockdown in the valley has cost the territory’s economy more than Rs 200 billion over the past two months.

The lockdown has rendered more than 50,000 workers jobless in the carpet industry alone.

There is also a shortage of skilled labour in occupied Kashmir, as some 400,000 migrants have left since India imposed undeclared martial law in occupied Kashmir on August 5.

As per industry experts, Srinagar’s almost 1,000 iconic houseboats have been running empty due to absence of tourists.
