India eliminated JeM leadership within 100 hrs of Pulwama attack: Army

Srinagar, Feb 19 : The Indian Army on Tuesday said within 100 hours of the February 14 Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy that left 40 troopers dead, it eliminated the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) leadership that planned and executed the deadly carnage.

This was stated by Lt Gen K.S. Dhillon of the 15 Corps Commander, at a joint press briefing here in Jammu and Kashmir.

He also made it clear that the Pulwama attack was carried out by the JeM, which is based in Pakistan, with active support of the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) and the Pakistan Army.

"Within 100 hours of the Pulwama terror attack, we hit the JeM in the Kashmir Valley which was being handled by the Pakistan-based JeM," Dhillon said.

Giving a stern warning to sympathisers of the terror movement in the state, he said: "Anyone who picks up a gun in Kashmir will be eliminated, unless the person surrenders."
