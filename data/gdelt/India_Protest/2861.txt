College event with Mevani as chief guest cancelled

A college in Ahmedabad has cancelled its Annual Day event in which independent legislator and prominent Dalit activist Jignesh Mevani was invited as the chief guest after the management received numerous protest calls.

On Monday, Prof. Hemant Shah, principal of the H.K. Arts College in Ahmedabad where Mr. Mevani is an alumnus, resigned in protest, claiming that the Brahmchari Vadi Trust, which runs the college along with several other educational institutions, “compromised on freedom of expression” by calling off the event.

Interestingly, those on the trust include two Padma awardees: renowned architect B.V. Doshi and noted writer Raghuvir Chaudhary.

Prof. Shah said that the trustees caved in before a “few hooligans” who allegedly threatened to create ruckus and violence if Mr. Mevani was invited.

Following the resignation of the principal, Mr. Mevani slammed the trust for not standing up to the hooliganism of a few student leaders associated with a political party.

“H.K. Arts College with prominent trustees like B.V. Doshi, R. Chaudhary and K. Desai (all Padma awardees) are not standing up against the hooliganism of BJP and its student wing. This is a shameful day for freedom of speech and democracy. Strongly condemn this move,” Mr. Mevani said on Twitter.

In his resignation letter, Prof. Shah said his decision to invite Mr. Mevani was not wrong as leaders from different political parties had been invited to earlier events in the college. “It is clear that freedom of thought and expression is being stifled in the current political scenario, and this is being patronised politically,” he wrote.
