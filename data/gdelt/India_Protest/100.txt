Pak-based terror groups training cadre for samundari jihad against India, Parliament told

Ten years after the 26/11 terror attacks in Mumbai, Pakistan-based terror groups continue to train their cadre for underwater strikes and exhort them for 'samundari jihad' (seaborne jihad) against India, Union minister Hansraj Ahir said on Wednesday.

Replying to a written question in Rajya Sabha, the junior home minister said according to available information, there is no specific information about any terrorist group planning a 26/11 Mumbai-type terror attack on ports, cargo ships and oil tankers in the high seas.

"However, the available information indicate that Pakistani-based terror organisations continue to train their cadres for underwater strike capabilities in a bid to infiltrate into India by sea or waterways. They continue to exhort their cadres for samundari Jihad against India," he said.

The revelation comes even as efforts are on to extradite David Coleman Headley's aide Tahawwur Rana from the US.

In a response to separate question in the Lok Sabha, the Ministry of Exteranal Affairs confirmed that a two member NIA team visited the United States to pursue the matter. Rana, a former Pakistani Army doctor-turned-Chicago travel agent, is being held in federal prison for plotting overseas terror strikes. Rana, who along with Headley, is accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

On the threat to Indian shores, The Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Defence have taken several measures to improve the 7,500-km Mumbai coastline following the 26/11 terror attacks in which more than 160 people were killed and nearly 300 injured.

In a recent move, the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) has trained a unit

of deep sea divers to take on threats in waterways. Intelligence inputs show Pakistan continues to fish in the troubled waters.
