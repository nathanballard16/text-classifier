Fate of 9K students in Thane still uncertain as they wait to get admission under RTE

The schools in Thane region are going to reopen soon, but more than 9000 students are still waiting to know if they have got admission under RTE (Right to Education). The second round of lottery is still pending, and the education department is also uncertain about the dates of the second round of lottery under RTE admission.

Nitin Dhule, RTE activist pointed out to Hindutan Times that schools affiliated to international boards in Kalyan, Dombivli and Navi Mumbai have already opened this week and state board schools are set to start from next week. "Students who have applied under the RTE quota are yet to secure admission. By the time the admission process completes, they would have lost an academic year. If the education department does not announce the dates for the second lottery, we will stage a protest,” she said.

After the end of first round of lottery under RTE, 3957 students were allotted admissions, out of which 1,907 did not take admission.

Responding on the matter, Education department officials from Thane said that the lottery process is allowed uniformly across the state and they have to be apprised by state education board.

Education officer of zilla parishad Sangeeta Bhagwat said, “In spite of elections, we went ahead with the first lottery and even sorted out the problems with private schools which were not keen on accepting RTE students. However, as far as the dates for the second lottery are concerned, the process is followed across the state uniformly and we have to wait until the state education board makes an official announcement about it.”

Bhagwat also ensured that if students do not get admissions under RTE, they will be enrolled in zilla parishad schools.
