Earlier, TDP and Congress also held protests against Prime Minister Modi’s Andhra Pradesh visit. TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu accused PM Modi of reneging on his promise to grant special category status to the state. He said that how can the prime minister set foot in Andhra Pradesh after breaking his promise on the special status?

“I think he is coming to see for himself the injustice he has done to this state and its people. Let us all unite and oppose his visit and his betrayal,” Naidu said.

Responding to Naidu, Modi said that his government gave to Andhra Pradesh more than what was mentioned in special status. “Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh acknowledged this package but took a U-turn as they failed to use the funds in the appropriate way and were not able to develop the state,” the prime minister said.
