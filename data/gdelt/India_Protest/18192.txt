Fathima Latheef suicide: IIT Madras students call off hunger strike

They had launched the indefinite fast on the campus.

A section of students who went on a hunger fast on Tuesday have called it off, following assurances that the Indian Institute of Technology Madras would concede to two of their three demands.

According to the protesters, the Dean of students had assured them that the demands made by the Students Legislative Council —for an external committee to study the issues of students in the Institute and the setting up of a grievance mechanism in every department to deal with issues of harassment and discrimination, apart from academic grievances — would be implemented.

The Dean of students has also informed the ChintaBar team that the possibility of constituting an Institute-level committee to inquire into the conduct of faculty can be discussed with the Director when he returned on November 21.

The appeal for such a committee came from the father of Fathima Latheef, the first-year humanities student, who died by suicide in her hostel room on November 9.

Assistance for overcoming suicidal thoughts is available at 104 -- the State’s health helpline and at 044 2464 0050 — Sneha suicide prevention helpline.
