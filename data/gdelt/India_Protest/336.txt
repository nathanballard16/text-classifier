Puneri pagdi, pheta in protest by those opposed to wearing helmets

Prominent citizens and activists of Pune joined hands under non-political banner, Action Committee Against Helmet Compulsion, to oppose the new police mandate that they said is looting the public.



Over 200 riders on Thursday morning conducted a massive motorcycle rally from Patrakar Bhavan in Navi Peth to the Pune police commissionerate. Most skipped helmets and used traditional headgear, including the Puneri pagdi, traditional pheta, Phule pagote, and more. Meanwhile, on the third day of the traffic police crackdown, 9,519 people were booked.



17.38 lakh were the number of traffic violations in 2018. Fines collected from violators last year amounted to Rs 44.02 crore.



These daunting figures propelled us at Pune Mirror to kick off a campaign to promote safe driving in the city, only so that reckless drivers may mend their ways. We encourage readers to send pictures of people breaking traffic rules on city roads on punemirrorcampaign@gmail.com or WhatsApp us on: 9960509256. Let us together make our roads safe.
