Citizenship Act protests in Assam: Curfew relaxed in Guwahati, Dibrugarh

Curfews have been relaxed in Assam's largest city, Guwahati, and in Dibrugarh after days of protests against a controversial new law on refugee naturalisation.

In Guwahati, the curfew has been relaxed from 9 am to 4 pm; in Dibrugarh it's 8 am to 2 pm.

Broadband services have resumed in Guwahati.

India's Northeast has witnessed angry demonstrations against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which fast-tracks naturalisation for non-Muslim minority refugees who faced religious persecution in Bangladesh -- which borders a number of Northeast states -- and two other Muslim-majority nations.

Indigenous people in the Northeast worry that the law endangers their identity and livelihood.

No violence was reported in Guwahati last night.

Assam has been on the boil for several days. Thousands have come out on the streets to protest against the amendment of the Citizenship Act.

Two people were killed in police firing on Thursday.

The Assam government has transferred 10 officials in the rank of superintendent of police, an official order said on Friday.
