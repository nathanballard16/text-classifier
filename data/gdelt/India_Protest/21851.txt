BJP briefs Modi on violence

A pictorial booklet to Modiji on the violence in Bengal that is hampering the daily life of common people

Party sources said a state BJP delegation had given to Modi the booklet during his stopover at Andal greenfield airport in West Burdwan, en route to Jharkhand for an election rally.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on Tuesday handed a pictorial booklet titled Jal Raha Hay Paschim Bangal (Bengal is burning), detailing the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in Bengal.

“We handed over a pictorial (booklet) to Modiji on the violence that is going on in the state and hampering the daily life of common people,” said state BJP vice-president Biswapriya Roychowdhury.

“We also told him about the complete breakdown of law and order, following which Modiji assured us of looking at the booklet on his way back to Delhi,” added Roychowdhury, who along with Burdwan-Durgapur MP S.S. Ahluwalia, led the delegation.

Roychowdhury alleged that while the situation in Assam and Tripura was brought under control by the respective state governments, protesters in Bengal were being instigated by chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s public rallies from Monday.

“The pictures and videos say everything,” Roychowdhury said.

State law minister Malay Ghatak, who was also at the Andal airport to receive the Prime Minister as per protocol, said: “There were no discussions between me and the Prime Minister. It was just a protocol.”

Roychowdhury had met Modi at the airport on Sunday also during a similar stopover and had briefed the Prime Minister on the vandalism.
