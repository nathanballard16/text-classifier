Kejriwal’s vehicle attacked by BJP workers in Narela, says govt

Police refute govt’s allegations that security was ignored

The Delhi government on Friday claimed that Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s vehicle was attacked by BJP workers in the presence of police personnel in Narela.

Mr. Kejriwal had gone to Narela to attend an event when BJP workers gathered in front of his vehicle and held a protest.

“It is extremely shocking that the Chief Minister’s vehicle was moving along the route cleared by the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area, when the BJP workers, armed with sticks, attacked the vehicle in police presence,” read a statement issued by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government.

“Delhi government categorically states that under political pressure and directions, the Delhi Police ignored the Chief Minister’s security and the people of Delhi are watching all these conspiracies,” the statement read.

The police, however, denied allegations that Mr. Kejriwal was attacked. Additional PRO of the Delhi Police, Anil Mittal, said that the Narela ACP was escorting the cavalcade. On the route, former BJP MLA Neeldaman Khatri and his supporters came in front of the cavalcade, but the ACP removed the protesters and escorted the CM’s cavalcade to its destination, he said.

In a statement, the Delhi BJP said that party workers had shown black flags to the CM to protest against the Delhi government’s “denial of Metro Rail expansion and other development activities” in rural Delhi.

Photos and videos of the incident shared by the BJP as well as the government showed BJP workers with flags and banners protesting in front of the vehicle.
