Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati will together hold 12 rallies in the state of Uttar Pradesh to woo voters before the general polls.

Interestingly, Mayawati will also seek votes for Mulayam Singh Yadav, father of Akhilesh Yadav.

After the 1995 Guest House episode, there has been a lot of bad blood between Mayawati and Mulayam Singh. On 2 June 1995, an unruly mob of SP workers marched into the Meerabai Guest House in Lucknow, where Mayawati was in a meeting. Reportedly, her room was vandalised, casteist and sexual slurs were thrown about and she was beaten up.

Lok Sabha elections 2019 will begin on April 11 and continue for over a month till May 19 across seven phases, followed by counting of votes on May 23, the Election Commission announced on Sunday, kick-starting a mega electoral battle where the BJP will pitch for a re-election of the Modi government amid the Opposition's efforts for a united fight to unseat it.
