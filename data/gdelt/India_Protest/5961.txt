Earlier in the day, in an exclusive pre-poll interview with ABP news, Modi took a dig at Congress and called its manifesto for the Lok Sabha polls a “hypocrite one.” He said the Congress has insulted country’s Army in its manifesto and that it is in sync with the language that separatists use for the country. He accused the Rahul Gandhi-led party of taking a shortcut in their manifesto.
