By Apoorva Prakashdistributetoin cityMembers of theState Retired Police Officers Welfare Association took to the streets of Bengaluru to distribute woollen blankets to homeless people.“All of us were discussing about how cold it’s been in Bengaluru and especially at night. We got to know that Ramaiah Hospital recently distributed a hundred blankets to the poor and needy. So our committee thought of doing the same but with greater intensity.” said Pemmaiah, the president of the association.The Association distributed blankets across Nagarbhavi II Stage, Chowdappah Orphanage, Majestic Bus Stand, the City Railway Station and various other slums. So far, the members have distributed 500 blankets after generating Rs 85,000 from the association’s fund and donations from the committee members.“It’s very difficult to stay warm in this cold weather that Bengaluru is experiencing. Thinking about people who do not have a proper shelter or a place to sleep and end up in bus and railway station corridors made us realise our privilege. We want to help at least a few of them,” said a volunteer.“We used to serve our people and our nation earlier when we served in the police force. So, helping people in need is ingrained in all of us in this association. Being retired limits us from doing certain things but nevertheless, all 400 of us do our best to make sure that our association, in some way, helps the needy," he added.
