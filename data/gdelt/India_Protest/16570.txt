State Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) Ajay Kumar Shukla said the voting was peaceful and no untoward incident or complaint of booth capturing was reported.

However, there were a few complaints of delay in voting due to faulty Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in different Assembly seats. In Lucknow Cantonment’s Sadar area, EVM at a polling booth was changed twice. In Mau, there was a delay in voting after the EVM at booth number 34 wasn’t working properly.

Earlier, people in Mahoa village of Iglas Assembly area in Aligarh decided to boycott voting over the stray cattle menace in the village. No vote was cast in the village with around 2,200 voters till around 11:30 am, after which the Additional District Magistrate went to the village and assured the villagers that a solution would be found to their problem.

“Our crops are being destroyed by bulls and cows. This started around two years ago. Now the farmers either spend a lot of money in barricading fileds or spend day and night on the field itself. We are anguished and decided to boycott the election. However, after the intervention of the district administration some of us agreed to vote. However, only 460 votes were cast by the time polling ended,” said the village pradhan’s husband, Praveen Tomar. He claimed that around a dozen surrounding villages had also decided to boycott voting because of similar issues.

Earlier in the day, Rampur MP Azam Khan’s wife Tazeen Fatma, who is contesting from Rampur Vidhan Sabha, alleged that police personnel were creating problems for the voters. She also alleged that the government was misusing power. However, media in-charge at the CEO’s office Ashok Kumar, said no merit was found in the allegations.
