Amid protests, Centre tables Bill to adjudicate water disputes

The government at the Centre, on Thursday tabled a Bill in the Lower House, proposing setting up of a single tribunal with different benches to help settle the water disputes of inter-State rivers and river valleys at a faster pace.

Amid protests from the opposition, the Bill was later introduced by a voice vote. In a bid to increase the pace of the adjudication of inter-state river water disputes, the Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill, 2019 seeks to bring in amendments to the Inter State River Water Disputes Act, 1956.

Union Jal Shakti Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said, “There are nine (separate) tribunals (to adjudicate water disputes). Four of the tribunals took 10 to 28 years to deliver their award. There is no timeframe to adjudicate disputes and tribunals were extended indefinitely.”

A similar Bill proposed in 2017 could not get nod from the Parliament and got lapsed with the end of the 16th Lok Sabha.
