BJP men come to blows in UP

NEW DELHI: Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) leaders on Wednesday came to blows at party meet in Utter Pradesh (UP).

BJP MP Sharad Tripathi and BJP MLA Rakesh Singh were seen exchanging blows after an argument ensued between them, international media reported.

Two UP BJP lawmakers came to blows at a party meeting in Sant Kabir Nagar after an argument broke out over the placement of names on the foundation stone of a project.

The incident took place during a meeting of the District Action Plan Committee at the Collectorate where various representatives and officials were present.

Even as others present at the meeting tried to pacify the leaders, Tripathi hit Baghel with his shoe to which the latter retaliated by slapping the MP.

A police officer later came in between and the two were separated. The entire episode was captured on camera. Later in the day, Baghel and his supporters protested outside the District Magistrate office, demanding the arrest of Tripathi.

“The meeting was underway when the brawl broke out between the duo over some issue related to PWD. We could not even complete the meeting. This is highly condemnable. We were trying to discuss things about development,” media quoted an eye-witness as saying.

Condemning the incident, UP BJP chief MN Pandey said both Tripathi and Baghel have been summoned to Lucknow and strict disciplinary action would be taken. “We have taken cognizance of this condemnable incident and both have been summoned to Lucknow. Strict disciplinary action will be taken,” media quoted Pandey as saying.

Following the brawl, Tripathi said he regretted the incident. “I regret the incident and feel bad about it, what happened was against my normal behaviour. If I am summoned by state chief, I will put my point across,” he said.

Meanwhile, the Congress took a swipe at the BJP after a video of the ruling party’s leaders thrashing each other with shoes surfaced, saying the BJP was the “Bharatiya Joota Party”.
