Mumbai: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar on Tuesday wrote a letter to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee expressing solidarity with other like-minded leaders in their protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). He also asserted that he would be more than willing to take part in any proceedings against the Central government over the contentious citizenship law.

In a letter dated December 27, 2019, Sharad Pawar said, "I received your letter dated December 23, 2019, raising serious concern over the current alarming situation across the nation.

I totally agree with your concern and pledge to stand in solidarity with all like-minded leaders and parties to protest against the implementation of CAA and nationwide NRC.

I will be happy to associate myself with my concerted plan to rise against the authoritarian regime of the Central government and for saving our democracy. Please inform about any meeting convened or steps taken in this context."

Earlier this month, Sharad Pawar had slammed the Centre over the controversial citizenship law saying the government is trying to divert attention from serious issues the country is facing.

He even questioned why only immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan are allowed citizenship under the new law and why not Sri Lankan Tamils or Tibetan Christians.

In West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee is leading massive protests against the CAA for weeks now. She has been demanding revocation of CAA and has asserted that she will not let the Central government implement NRC in the state.
