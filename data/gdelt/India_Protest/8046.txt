11,000 Candidates Seek Euthanasia As They're Yet To Get Appointed Despite Clearing UP Police Exams in 2013

It has been five years since 11,000 candidates cleared the Uttar Pradesh Police recruitment exam in 2013 and they're yet to receive their appointment letters. "It has been six years but we have not been appointed yet. Even the candidates from 2018 batch have been appointed. If our demands are not heard we will commit suicide" one of the protestors said on Friday.

Another protestor told news agency ANI that they have approached Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, State Home Secretary and other concerned officials but of no avail.

These candidates have also sought permission from President Ramnath Kovind for euthanasia after the state government failed to make them join the department despite a high court order.

Narrating their ordeal, the protestors have threatened to commit suicide as no option is left with them.

"We had won the case in High Court. The court said that we are given appointment letters but it did not happen. We have met State Home Secretary, Chief Minister and DG-UP Police Recruitment and Promotion Board but to no avail. We have no other option but to commit suicide, also written to the President," a protestor said.
