'Secular' Cochin university allows North Indian students to conduct Saraswati pooja after protest

The permission was granted after north Indian students studying in the Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanad (CUCEK) protested the CUSAT authorities' decision not to grant permission to organise the religious function in the institution, college authorities said.

Authorities of the Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) Thursday granted permission to a section of students in its Alappuzha campus to conduct 'pooja' for Goddess Saraswati, in a peaceful manner following a protest by them.

The permission was granted after north Indian students studying in the Cochin University College of Engineering Kuttanad (CUCEK) protested the CUSAT authorities' decision not to grant permission to organise the religious function in the institution, college authorities said.

Students from North India had sought permission from the college authorities to conduct 'Saraswati Pooja' in the campus on February 9,10 and 11, following which the request was forwarded to the CUSAT authorities.

However, the request was declined by the CUSAT authorities, sayingit "cannot permit religious function/activities of any religion inside campus" "since it was a secular campus.

The North Indian students staged a protest against the decision, claiming that such a pooja was performed in the campus last year with the permission of the college authorities.
