Family members of youth arrested in India hold demo

Srinagar, February 23, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the family members of a youth arrested in Deoband town of Saharanpur, yesterday, staged a protest in Srinagar, today, to demand his release. Uttar Pradesh police had on Friday claimed that Shahnawaz Ahmed Teli and another youth, identified as Aaqib Ahmed Malik of Pulwama, were arrested in Deoband and they had affiliation with a mujahid organisation.

However, the family of Shahnawaz Ahmed Teli trashed the police claims, saying that he was being framed under a false name. The family members came all the way from Kulgam in south Kashmir to Press Enclave in Srinagar where they staged a demonstration demanding his immediate release.

Displaying the marks sheets in which he was named as Nawaz Ahmed Teli, his uncle said, “Police is making his case on a false name as his name is not Shahnawaz Ahmed Teli but Nawaz Ahmed Teli as written on documents. We are in pain and confusion as we don’t know what to do.” “My brother had gone there (Deoband) for religious education and he is innocent, we demand his release,” said Waqar Ahmed Teli.
