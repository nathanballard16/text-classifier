Bengaluru: The second year pre-university examinations are more likely to be announced with in a week informed a pre-university education department official.

It is gathered that usually the results of second-year pre-university examinations were announced only after the completion of CET exams. This was done to avoid pressure on students ahead of the Common Entrance Test (CET) exams.

Evaluation work for all the subjects concluded on Sunday and as the entry of marks was done online this year, it took less time to process the results, informed sources.

Meanwhile, another official said that as the results this year will be announced early there will be increasing pressure on students who are preparing for various competitive examinations like NEET and CET.

“In order to avoid pressure on students all these years results of second-year PUC used to be declared after the completion of the CET,” he added.

The officials also advised the students not to skip the CET even if they fail to clear PUC exams.

The CET 2019 is scheduled to be held on April 29 and 30 and May 1.

This year, over 6 lakh students appeared for the second year pre-university course final exams which were held between March 1 and 18.
