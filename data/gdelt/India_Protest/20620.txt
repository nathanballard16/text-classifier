‘I am not Rahul Savarkar’, will not apologise for speaking truth: Rahul Gandhi

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Sunday launched an attack on the BJP government saying he will not apologise for his ‘rape in India’ remark that rocked Parliament on Friday.

“The BJP asked me to apologize. My name is not Rahul Savarkar, I am Rahul Gandhi. I will never apologize for speaking the truth and nor will any Congress worker will do so. It is PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah who has to apologise to the country for destroying India’s economy,” Rahul said at the Ramlila ground in Delhi, where the Congress held a “Bharat Bachao” rally.

Congress Interim president Sonia Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were among the other senior leaders who spoke at the Delhi rally.

Stepping up the attack on PM Modi, Congress Interim President Sonia Gandhi said, “there’s an atmosphere of ‘andher nagri, chaupat raja’, everyone is asking whatever happened to ‘sabka saath sabka vishwaas’. What happened to the economy, where are the jobs?”

She further said, “There comes a time in the life of any person or society or country when you have to decide which side you’re on, today is one such day. We have to fight hard to save the country.”

“When I see the condition of my farmer brothers, I feel sorry. Their problems have increased so much that it has become difficult for them to survive,” she added.

Taking a swipe at PM Modi and Amit Shah, Sonia said, “Public money is not safe even in banks. The common man cannot withdraw his own money from banks. Modi-Shah call it ‘achhe din’,”

“Modi-Shah do not care that CAB will destroy the soul of India as can be seen happening in Northeast India,” she added.
