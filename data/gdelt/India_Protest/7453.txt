Maharashtra students warn of protest against quota ruling in PG medical courses

A group of students in Maharashtra has warned to protest against the Bombay High Court’s ruling that the 16 per cent quota offered to Marathas will not be applicable on admissions to post-graduate medical courses this year.

Suyash Patil, who recently took admission in a Pune-based medical college, claimed around 250 students have been affected by the ruling given by the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court last week.

The state has filed a petition against the HC ruling in the Supreme Court, which is likely to be heard on Friday, a government official said.

A representative of the students affected by the HC ruling said if the state government failed to resolve the matter, they would launch an agitation.

“We have decided to wait for the Supreme Court’s ruling. If the state fails to come up with an amicable solution, we will organise a state-wide agitation,” a representative of the affected students said.

“But with this HC ruling, our admissions are likely to be cancelled and the time limit to seek admissions in other colleges is also over. We fear losing an entire year if the Supreme Court backs the HC ruling,” he said.

A group of affected students also met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Monday, requesting him to take steps in the matter.
