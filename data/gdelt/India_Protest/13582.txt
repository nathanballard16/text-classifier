Bank employees protest Centre’s merger move

Ludhiana: Bank employees have upped the ante to protest against the Union government’s decision to merge 10 nationalized banks, including Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India.

The merger will leave 12 public sector banks in the country. Even as Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has claimed that this step is for the betterment of the banks and the staff, employees are not so convinced.

Resisting the move, members of the United Forum of Bank Unions’ (UFBU) Ludhiana unit on Saturday protested against this decision. Naresh Gaur, convener of UFBU said, “We have been opposing the merger of public sector banks as all the banks cannot work in the same way. Even after understanding the consequences, the government wants to go ahead with the decision of merging big banks like Punjab National Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce etc. This is not a merger, but a cold-blooded murder of these banks and their employees. In the past 50 years, the nationalized banks have made a phenomenal contribution in building up a strong economy with a visible social orientation.”

Gaur added, “About 8,000 branches have gone up to 90,000 today, out of which 40,000 branches are located in rural and semi-urban areas which were earlier neglected. Credit to priority sector has boosted our economy resulting in achievements like Green Revolution, White Revolution, industrial progress, job generation and rural development. All of this is possible only due to public sector banks. But we will not sit silently and will oppose this move. Yesterday’s protest was just a trailer, we will do what it takes to ensure that the government takes back its decision.”

Other prominent employee union leaders present on the occasion included Pawan Thakur, Ashok Arora, G S Mangat, J P Kalra and Iqbal Singh Malhi.
