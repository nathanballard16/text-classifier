Sloganeering, walkout in Lok Sabha over Karnataka

New Delhi: The Lok Sabha on Tuesday witnessed intense sloganeering and walkout by members of Congress and allies who protested against the crisis in Karnataka . The opposition parties accused the Centre and BJP of engineering defections, a charge which defence minister Rajnath Singh rejected.Trouble started after Speaker Om Birla disallowed a notice for adjournment motion given by Congress floor leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on the Karnataka issue. Birla disallowed the motion by pointing out that the issue was discussed in the House on Monday and Singh had replied on behalf of the government. He asked Chowdhury to give a written request for raising the matter during Zero Hour. Soon Congress and DMK members trooped into the well of the House, chanting slogans such as “attack on democracy” and “stop politics of dividing”. Rahul Gandhi too raised slogans.The Speaker took objection to sloganeering and display of placards.“You have to protect the dignity of the House. I have been giving opportunities for all members even by going out of turn… Please don’t reduce the conduct of the House to the level of municipalities,” he said but allowed Chowdhury to raise the matter after MPs went back to their seats.Chowdhury demanded an end to “politics of poaching” and accused the Centre and BJP of “engineering defections” in Karnataka. Singh, once again, dismissed the Congress allegations: “What is happening in Karnataka is entirely due to the internal issues of the Congress. The BJP and Centre have nothing to do with it.” Following his reply, the Speaker said he was denying the request for an adjournment motion. Sonia Gandhi then led the walkout of Congress, DMK, NC, IUML and other allies.
