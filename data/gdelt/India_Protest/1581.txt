In his reply, Ajay Singh, grandson of BJP MLA, Dalveer Singh, wrote that the allegations and charges framed against them are false and unjust. The letter reads, “Is it a crime to take out Tiranga rally in our country? The rally on Tuesday was carried out from the education department to the Baba Syed Gate, in the memory of freedom fighters. The administration had not issued notice to those students who burnt copies of the Constitution of India in protest against the amendment for 10% reservation.”Earlier in the day, the two students replied to the show-cause notice and countered every issue raised by the AMU authorities. He said several programmes are organized in the university against the moral principles and ethics of the society and also violate the provisions of the university, but the administration has never reacted to them.Singh claimed that no outsiders were involved in the rally.
