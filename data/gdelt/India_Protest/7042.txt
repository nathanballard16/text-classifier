Jet Airways employees take out candle march at Jantar Mantar

New Delhi [India], Apr 27 (ANI): Jet Airways employees and their family members took out a candle march at Jantar Mantar on Saturday appealing the central government to save the private airline.

Around 500 employees of Jet Airways, including ground handling staff, cabin crew members, administration and sales team took part in the march here.

The employees were holding placards that read - 'Hear our cry! Let 9W Fly', 'We have dependents to feed', 'Pls don't let our 9W Bleed', 'Save Jet Airways' and 'Save our families.'

Earlier on Monday, nearly 500 Jet Airways employees held a protest in Bengaluru urging the government to save the airline.

The future of nearly 20,000 employees of the troubled airline is in limbo as uncertainty looms large over the Naresh Goyal founded airline.

Jet Airways on April 17 cancelled all flights, including its international flights temporarily, after failing to secure emergency funds from its lenders, according to a statement by the airlines.

The embattled airline said it took the decision to ground all aircraft after State Bank of India on behalf of a consortium of Indian lenders informed that they were unable to consider its request for critical interim funding. (ANI)
