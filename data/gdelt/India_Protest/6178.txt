British troops fire on unarmed Indian crowds

New Delhi, 23 April 1919 - India is in a state of turmoil.

Fierce rioting is being reported across the country. Lives have been lost, buildings have been burned and telegraphic lines cut. Cavalry and police charged demonstrators in Bombay, while in Delhi and the Punjab the situation is described as serious.

A state of open rebellion is said to exist in the Lahore, Amritsar and Ahmedabad districts where martial law has been declared.

There have also been reports of British soldiers firing on unarmed crowds. One report from Calcutta states that troops in Amritsar had been ‘compelled to fire on a mob’ killing and wounding a dozen, but there is no confirmation of the numbers of fatalities.

The Indian Office refutes the charges levelled against the British soldiers. It states that one British soldier was killed and two more injured in Amritsar. It further claims that the Treasury there was attacked.

Amidst the turmoil Indian activist Mohandas Gandhi has issued a statement calling on his followers to temporarily cease their protests against the Rowlatt Acts, which were introduced earlier this year. Mr Gandhi states that his opposition to the Acts are unchanged, as is his faith in his policy of passive resistance, however, in the current climate he could not allow any action of his own to contribute to feeding violence.

The authorities claim that the Rowlatt Acts are directed specifically against revolutionary and anarchical crime and that they can only be brought into force in any locality when the Governor-General is satisfied that the crime or movements tending to such crime exist.
