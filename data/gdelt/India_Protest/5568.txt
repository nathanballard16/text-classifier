However, the court rejected the argument.“Considering the statement of the minor and upon examination of the witnesses and evidence, the court convicted the accused under Section 6 of the Pocso Act and IPC Section 363 for kidnapping a minor.”According to lawyers, Vadaliya was a bright student before he was arrested.
