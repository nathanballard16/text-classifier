SC/ST Act: Supreme Court to look into setting up a bench to hear petitions together

The Supreme Court on Friday said it is considering setting up a bench to hear together the Centre’s review petition and other pleas challenging the amendments to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, ANI reported.

A bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi said it will consider the matter and take an appropriate decision soon, Live Law reported.

Attorney General KK Venugopal said that a bench headed by Justice AK Sikri on Thursday had ordered that it will be appropriate to hear the Centre’s review and other writ petitions together. The court had refused to stay the amendments made by Parliament last year, which ruled out anticipatory bail for a person accused of atrocities against the communities.

In its verdict on March 20, 2018, the court had diluted the law’s provisions and had said public servants cannot be arrested immediately after a complaint is filed against them under the law. The Centre had moved court to review this order.

The petitions claim that the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha had arbitrarily decided to amend the law and restored the earlier provisions in a manner wherein an innocent person cannot avail the right to anticipatory bail. One of the petitions claimed that the structure of the act violates “basic principles of liberty and accountability” after the amendments.

At least 11 people died and hundreds were detained during the protests against the Supreme Court order in April last year. The Parliament passed an amendment bill in August to reverse the court’s order. The amendments said no preliminary inquiry will be needed to register a criminal case and an arrest under this law would not be subject to any approval.

In September, the Supreme Court agreed to examine petitions challenging the amendment but had declined to stay the legislation without hearing the government’s view.
