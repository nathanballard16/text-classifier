While Pakistani Minister Threatens Missile Strike On India, An ‘Islamic Missile’ Is All Set To Strike Islamabad

In the video Gandapur can be heard saying that if matters escalate towards a war, any country which supports India will automatically become Pakistan’s enemy. He adds that after firing a missile on India, Pakistan will also fire a missile on any pro-India country.

While Gandapur’s speech is being considered as an empty rhetoric aimed at pleasing Pakistan’s domestic audience, his ruling Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party itself has a ‘missile’ coming its way.

The Missile That Is Azadi March

While the Imran Khan is trying to build a global consensus against India, consensus is building against his own government in Pakistan.

Besides Pakistani Army Chief General Bajwa exceeding his brief, the opposition parties of Pakistan have called a massive protest march against the Imran Khan government, which has been titled as - Azadi March.

This march is being predominantly led by the president of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) Fazal-ur-Rehman and is set to hit the streets of Islamabad on Thursday (31 October).

JUI-F is being supported by both Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan People’s Party led by Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari respectively.

At least 1 lakh protesters are expected to attend this protest rally in Islamabad after it passed through the cities of Sukkur, Multan and Lahore in the last few days.

The march has been receiving overwhelming support from the members of the opposition parties, especially the JUI-F.
