Police detain hundreds as Indians defy protest ban

India continued to be racked by protests yesterday as police detained hundreds of students and social and political activists, who came out in large numbers across multiple cities against a citizenship Act they said was discriminatory.

In defiance of a ban, coordinated protests took place in at least 15 cities against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which provides Indian citizenship to non-Muslim illegal immigrants from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

Critics have slammed it as against India's secular Constitution.

Outside the Red Fort, a historic sandstone structure in the capital city of Delhi, police personnel, outnumbering protesters, escorted more than a hundred people into buses, which were quickly driven away to different locations.

Some offered little resistance, while others had to be moved against their will. One woman cried for help as she was led away by five policewomen into a waiting bus.

Some protesters said they felt compelled to come out despite their fear of the police.

Nineteen-year-old Abdul Samad, a history student from Hindu College in Delhi University who managed to evade detention, said: "The Red Fort reminds us about the independence struggles and the fight for freedom and rights. And today, we are denying people the right to express themselves."

Most of those detained were released hours later.

Every year on Independence Day, the prime minister hoists the flag and addresses the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort.

In other parts of India, similar scenes unfolded yesterday.
