Oil pipes set afire

Miscreants set fire to pipes stacked on an agricultural field at Arunthavapuram near Ammapettai on Thursday.

The pipes, belonging to Chennai Petroleum Corporation, were brought to the village for being laid underground as part of Narimanam-Vazhavanthankottai oil pipeline project. The miscreants, presumably to register their protest against laying of oil pipelines through agricultural fields, set fire to them on Thursday night.

Ammapettai police have registered a case and are investigating.
