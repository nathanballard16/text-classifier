TMC behind Kolkata violence, says Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: BJP president Amit Shah on Wednesday blamed the TMC for violence during his roadshow in West Bengal and claimed that the TMC workers vandalised Ishwar Chandra Vidysagar's statue.Shah said that nobody except the TMC had access to the college campus. " Mamata Banerjee is making baseless allegations after the bust was damaged by the TMC goons purposely to gain sympathy and paint BJP in bad way," he added.Addressing a press conference, Shah said that violence did not take place in 6 phases of Lok Sabha elections anywhere but West Bengal which proves that the TMC is responsible for it.Showing pictures of the Vidyasagar College , Shah said the gate was closed before and after the violence and the TMC workers were pelting stones from the campus."Mamata Banerjee claims that the BJP is doing it. I want to tell her, we are fighting in every state in the nation, unlike you on 42 seats in West Bengal. Violence didn't take place anywhere but Bengal which proves that TMC is responsible for it," he added.Amit Shah also said that Mamata Banerjee took the extreme step of resorting to violence as she has realised that she has lost the polls, and is taking these steps out of frustration.The BJP president also said he would not have escaped unhurt without CRPF protection when his convoy was allegedly attacked in KolkataHe also urged the Election Commission to take action against the West Bengal government.The BJP also held a protest in Delhi against the violence in Amit Shah's roadshow in Kolkata yesterday.
