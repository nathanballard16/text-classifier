2. Profile Based Unique Admission Process

SPJIMR admission process is unique and the key differentiator is a Candidate’s Profile. Even if you may not have scored a high 98-99 percentile in CAT, but if you have the desired leadership qualities with good past academic profile, you are likely to be the candidate that SPJIMR is looking for. SPJIMR focuses not just on CAT scores, but conducts a holistic assessment of candidates to pick future leaders and change agents.

Explains Prof. Bindu Kulkarni, Head-Admissions, SPJIMR,“Our selection process is done in two phases. In the first phase (profile-based shortlisting) applicants are shortlisted on the basis of their profiles before submission of entrance test scores. Applicants shortlisted in the first list are called for an early interview as well. They are, however, expected to meet the qualifying scores in at least one of the entrance exams as a qualifier. In the second shortlist applicants are shortlisted basis their profile and entrance scores. During the interview phase all shortlisted applicants are considered on par.”

3. Unique Curriculum & Pedagogy offers Great Learning Experience

SPJIMR has a unique curriculum and pedagogy that nurtures not just IQ but also EQ, thus creating socially aware managers. In addition to regular courses that all leading B-schools offer, SPJIMR takes five key initiatives in ‘Non-Classroom Learning’ area which include ADMAP, DOCC, Abhyudaya, PG Lab and Science of Spirituality.These unique course curriculum at SPJIMR offers three distinct levels of learning:

Self-awareness: How do you understand yourself?

Self-management: How do you reflect this awareness in your behaviour and interactions with others (interpersonal) and with yourself (intra personal)?

Societal awareness: How do you understand societal systems and needs, like the idea of India along with the idea of Bharat?

Many Recruiters and Alumni rate this SPJIMR pedagogical approach very high as it nurtures grounded managers, who not only just excel in their work but also care for society and people.

4. Smaller Batch Size offering more focus, resources

A very important and an often-ignored factor while choosing a top B-school is to look for the B-school with smaller batch size to enhance learning experience. While top IIMs and private B-schools have very large MBA/PGDM batch sizes, the batch size at SPJIMR comprises only 240 students. This offers a huge advantage for students like easier access and proximity to faculty and higher bonding amongst the batch.
