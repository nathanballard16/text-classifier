CAB bill: BJP’s CAA Act ‘myth-buster’ to cover 3 crore families

BJP to connect over 3 crore families to expose lies around CAA

NEW DELHI: In its bid to counter what it claims is an opposition-backed campaign against Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), BJP on Saturday announced a massive countrywide campaign to share details of the legislation, assure people that it is not against existing citizens and to expose “lies” and “myths” being spread against it.At a press conference, party general secretary Bhupender Yadav told reporters that BJP will contact more than three crore families in the next 10 days, organise over 1,000 big and small rallies and hold over 250 press conferences across the country to inform the masses about CAA.The decision was taken in a meeting chaired by BJP working president J P Nadda to chalk out the party’s strategy over the issue amid protests in various parts of the country against the new provision in the Citizenship Act and the proposed creation of a National Register of Citizens.“BJP will reach out to over three crore families. We will organise press conferences at over 250 places in the next 10 days. In addition, over 1,000 rallies will be held to clear the air over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and to bust the myths created by the opposition,” Yadav said.He said the party will take along refugees to be benefited by the new legislation to some of the rallies and request them to share their ordeal with the people.Yadav asked Congress leaders to explain how the new Act was different from the one demanded by party leaders, who too, had been sympathetic to the minorities fleeing from neighbouring Islamic countries due to religious persecution.“As leader of opposition in Rajya Sabha, Congress leader Manmohan Singh himself had demanded citizenship for Bangladeshi Hindus in 2003. I request Congress to explain how the new Act is different from what Singh had demanded,” Yadav said, adding that it was the Congress government that had framed laws in favour of the minorities from neighbouring countries taking refuge in India, but they are opposing the new legislation now only for political reasons.The BJP functionary alleged that Rashtriya Janata Dal ’s Bihar bandh turned violent at several places and Congress owes an answer to the nation. “Congress’s ally in Bihar, RJD, has organised violent protests in Bihar... Congress should explain if they support such violence,” Yadav said.Asked about its ally JD (U)’s announcement not to support the proposed NRC, Yadav said the CAA and the NRC are different issues. “We thank JD(U) for supporting the CAA in Parliament. However, NRC and CAA are different. The NRC is an administrative issue,” he said.Yadav accused opposition parties, especially Congress, of spreading misinformation in a bid to disturb peace across the country during recent protests which have claimed several lives.Earlier, the party had launched a social media campaign with a short-duration video in its bid to clear “confusions” about the CAA and NRC. The party reiterated that the Modi government’s Citizenship (Amendment) Act is not what it’s being made out to be by the protesters.
