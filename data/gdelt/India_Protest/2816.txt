Akhilesh extends support to Naidu's fast

Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav Monday extended support to Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's day-long hunger strike in New Delhi.

"We all are with Chandrababu Naidu, who is sitting on day long hunger strike in New Delhi," the former Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister said in a tweet.

He also posted pictures of his party MP Dharmendra Yadav and others with Naidu, trying to underline his party's support.

Naidu began his fast in the national capital demanding the Centre grant special category status to Andhra Pradesh and fulfil all the promises made before its bifurcation in 2014.
