IIMC continues protest over fee hike issue

New Delhi: Students from Indian Institute of Mass Communication (IIMC) on Sunday continued to protest, for sixth consecutive day, over the fee hike issue. "Nothing concrete has been provided in written by the administration to ensure that the demands of students will be met. We are always (ready) to dialogue, but not at the cost of oral consolations," said a statement from the students. The statement said that out of total of 274 students, 43 percent have applied for the freeship program whereas only a limited few are provided freeship. "Even if they provide freeships to students, it is far less than enough to resolve the issue of unaffordable fee structure," it added.
