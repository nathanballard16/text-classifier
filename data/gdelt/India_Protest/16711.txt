No word on India boycott

KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysia has yet to receive any diplomatic note from India regarding calls to boycott Malaysian palm oil products, says Deputy Foreign Minister Datuk Marzuki Yahya.

He said the issue could have been exploited by certain groups in order to worsen the relationship between the two countries.
