legislatorhas accusedcadres of 'caste insult.'The dalit lawmaker who representsconstituency indistrict lodged a police complaint saying that Youth Congress workers sprinkled gobar (cow dung) water on the spot, where she staged a sit-in on Saturday.Geetha protested in front of the Public Works Department (PWD) office at Cherpu against the delay in repairing work of Cherpu -Thriprayar-Guruvayoor road. The road was reportedly dug up for laying pipes for the Guruvayur Amrit project. Geetha staged a sit-in after the local people blocked her car holding her responsible for the poor condition of the road.However, she withdraw the protests after officials assured her of appropriate action in this regard.Once she left the premises, activists of Youth Congress took out a protest march against her and called her protest a political gimmick. They also sprinkled gobar water to 'purify the place.'The MLA said that she will take the matter to the notice of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and Assembly Speaker P Sreeramakrishnan. The Congress workers should've resorted to other democratic ways of protest instead of sprinkling gobar water to harass a Dalit woman law maker, said a report quoting Geetha Gopi.Health and Social Justice Minister KK Shailaja described the casteist discrimination against the lawmaker as 'shocking.' Cultural Minister AK Balan, while slamming the Youth Congress workers, claimed such 'purification ceremony' was usually seen in north India and not. It cannot be accepted, he added.Cherpu police said that an FIR was registered on Sunday against 'identifiable' Youth Congress activists under Indian Penal Code sections including 143 (unlawul assembly) 147 (punishment for rioting) besides SC/ST Act.
