Posters caricaturing West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee have come up in Delhi ahead of her public address at a rally that is being organised by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) today. In a veiled attack, the posters take a dig at Mamata Banerjee, saying the Trinamool Congress chief can enjoy democracy in Delhi because it exists here unlike in Bengal.

The posters also attack Mamata's dharna politics. In the posters, she is depicted as an angry rebel.

In one of the posters, she is seen marching with a drum in protest. The text of the poster reads, "Didi, we welcome you warmly in the Republic of India!"

All posters are signed by 'Save Youth Democracy'.

In another poster, Mamata Banerjee is requested not to bring her "dadagiri" (bullying tactics) to Delhi.

The third poster says: "Relax Didi, we are all safe here! It's democracy."

These posters come against the backdrop of the recent tussle between Mamata Banerjee and the Modi government. A week ago, she sat on a dharna protesting against the Modi government and accused it of using the CBI to trouble opposition leaders.

Besides Mamata Banerjee, other opposition leaders like Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda, National Conference leader and former J&K CM Farooq Abdullah and others will also participate in the rally.
