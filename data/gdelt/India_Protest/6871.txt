Lok Sabha elections 2019: Electoral heat sees Pune seat experience moderate turnout

Electoral heat resulted in a moderate voter turnout in the Pune Lok Sabha constituency as the city witnessed high to lacklustre polling in parts of the city, registering an overall estimated 52-54 % polling. This matched the turnout in the 2014 elections.

The neighbouring Baramati Lok Sabha constituency, which is witnessing a fierce battle between Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar’s daughter Supriya Sule and BJP’s Kanchan Kul, saw polling of 59-60% as estimated by the Pune district collectorate.

The high voter turnout in Baramati, from where Sule is seeking re-election for a third term, sparked speculation of a surprise outcome. The BJP demonstrated extraordinary resolve to defeat the Pawars in their hometown with party president Amit Shah holding a rally in Baramati.

“Overall the poling was peaceful in Pune and Baramati. There were no complaints of EVM malfunctioning although there were reports of technical glitches in VVPAT machines at five places. After getting reports, we immediately replaced the machines,” said Pune district collector and returning officer Navalkishore Ram.

The relatively high voter turnout in the Parvati and Kothrud assembly segments under the Pune constituency, upped the overall voting percentage. During 2014 and 2009, the city reported 54% and 40.66% turnout respectively although its highest performance came in 1989 when 62% voters turned up for vote.

If the absence of an anti-incumbency wave was the reason for the city not crossing the 2014 mark, the involvement of social media and dominance of local issues in the poll campaign helped cross the half mark. Interestingly both BJP and Congress claimed that they would benefit from the relatively low voting in the city.

With the much-awaited polling having come to an end, the fate of 31 candidates in the poll fray has been sealed in the EVMs which will be opened on May 23.
