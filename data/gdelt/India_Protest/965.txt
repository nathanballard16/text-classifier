Four mourners with pellet injuries in eyes were admitted to the Zainapora hospital while three injured, including the woman, were brought to the district hospital Shopian for treatment.

Another five, three with bullet and two with pellet injuries, were brought to the district hospital Pulwama. Later, three of them who were hit with bullets in head and legs were shiftedto Srinagar for specialised treatment.

All the shops and business establishments were closed in Pulwama and Tral areas of south Kashmir. The authorities suspended train services between Banihal and Srinagar apprehending eruption of anti-India protests against the killings.
