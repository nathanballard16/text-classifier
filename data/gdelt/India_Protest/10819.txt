Ravindra was part of the six-member gang hailing from Haryana that committed armed robbery in March this year



A member of the Haryana gang that looted a jewellery store at Rahatani, a suburb of Pimpri-Chinchwad, in March this year, was killed in an encounter by the Uttar Pradesh (UP) police at Meerut on Tuesday.



Ravindra alias Kaliya Goswami of Hisar in Haryana was part of a six-member gang from the state, which committed armed robbery at Punekar Jewellers in March. They did shot at the owner of the shop and made away with 3 kg gold worth Rs 90.15 lakh. Besides Ravindra, the group included Hanuman alias Chotu Bishnoi, Mahipal Jat, Anup Dawa, Sachin alias Akshay and Sandeep.



On their trail the Pimpri Chinchwad Crime Branch reached Haryana, where they managed to nab Bishnoi, while Jat was picked up from Jodhpur in April. Between them, the police managed to recover 700 gms of gold worth Rs 25 lakh. However, Ravindra and rest of the gang was absconding, as they kept moving from one state to another to evade arrest.



However there was no escaping the long arm of law and Ravindra was picked up along with another accomplice – Amit alias Sheru – by the UP police. “On Tuesday the duo was being taken to court when they attacked the cops and in the ensuing encounter both were killed. However, the other deceased had no link to the Punekar Jewellers’ case,” informed police inspector, Santosh Mane, with the Wakad police station.



There was a Rs 50,000 reward on Ravindra’s head, for his involvement in a murder case at Shishwal, Hisar. The Wakad police had booked the deceased and his accomplices under Sections 395, 397, 427, 504 of the Indian Penal Code for dacoity, with attempt to cause death, mischief causing damage and intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of peace
