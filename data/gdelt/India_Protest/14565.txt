Babul Supriyo 'heckled' at Jadavpur University

Union minister Babul Supriyo was shown black flags and allegedly heckled by a section of students at Jadavpur University (JU), where he had gone to address a seminar organised by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) - the student wing of the RSS.

Supriyo was initially stopped from entering the campus for around one-and-half hours by members of two Left-leaning organizations - Arts Faculty Students' Union (AFSU) and Students Federation of India - (SFI), who raised slogans 'Babul Supriyo Go Back'.

The BJP leader faced another round of protests while trying to leave the campus around 5 pm.

Sources said he is currently held up on the campus, with the protesting students blocking the way to his car.

"I did not come here to do politics. But I am saddened by the behaviour of some of the students of the university, the way they have heckled me. They pulled me by my hair and pushed me," Supriyo, who attended the seminar amid heavy security, told reporters visiting the campus.

Describing the behaviour of the agitating students as "absolutely deplorable", he alleged that the protesters were trying to "disturb peace" at the institute by "instigating the students and seminar organizers to create a stampede-like situation".

Supriyo also claimed that the protesting students tried to "provoke him by openly calling themselves naxals".

Sources said JU Vice Chancellor Suranjan Das, who rushed to the spot on being informed about the incident, tried to reason with agitating students, who refused to budge from the main entrance of the university.

"It was unfortunate. I will send a report on the incident to the governor, who is also the chancellor of the university," Das said about the incident.
