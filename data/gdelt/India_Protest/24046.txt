Buoyed by the Opposition alliance inching closer towards victory in Jharkhand, Congress workers celebrated here at All India Congress Committee (AICC) office by bursting crackers and playing the drums.

Scores of party workers gathered outside the AICC office to celebrate even as the counting of votes is still underway.
