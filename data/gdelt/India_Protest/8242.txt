The killing of terrorist Zakit Musa yesterday (Thursday, 23 May) has triggered violent protests across Kashmir, reports Kashmir Life.

Musa, a former member of Hizb-ul-Mujahideen and founder-chief of al Qaeda’s arm in Kashmir, Ansar Gazwatul Hind was neutralised by security forces in Dadsara village of Tral area in Pulwama district.

Protests were witnessed in various parts of Srinagar, Trehgam village of Kupwara district and Sopora area of Baramulla district. Students of the University of Kashmir have also gathered outside Zakoora campus to protest against the killing.

In Srinagar’s Nawakadal Chowk, protestors assembled shouting slogans in favour of the slain militant. Okay, Yaripora and Shouch areas of Kulgam district, Soaf-Shali area of Kokernag village in Anantnag are also affected.

The protesters can be seen shouting slogans “Takbeer Allahu Akbar” (Allah is the greatest). The phrase donned by flags of many countries attained notoriety due to usage by Islamic radicals while committing acts of terror against “non-beilevers”, so much so, that in the aftermath of Barcelona attacks 2017, the mayor of Venice announced that anybody shouting the slogan in the main square of the northern city of Venice, will be shot on the spot. Slogans in favour of ‘Azadi’ were also heard. Mosques have become the site of such slogans.
