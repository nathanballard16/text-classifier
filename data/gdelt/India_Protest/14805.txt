4 pose as cops, loot Hry trader

Ludhiana: Four men impersonating as cops looted a Haryana trader of Rs 2.5 lakh in old city’s Namak Mandi on Sunday morning.

Ashok Kumar, 45, a resident of Jakhal Mandi in Fatehabad district, said in his police complaint, “I run a department store in Jakhal Mandi and often come to Ludhiana for wholesale purchasing. On Sunday morning, I went to Sabun Bazaar in old city. After having breakfast at a dhaba there, I was walking towards Namak Mandi when two men on a bike intercepted me.”

One of the two bikers came to Ashok and introduced himself as a cop. “Accusing me of peddling drugs, he asked me to accompany him, saying his seniors will frisk me. A few metres away, there were two other men on a bike. He told that they were his seniors. While one of them was checking my bag, the other two kept me engaged in a conversation. As I pleaded innocence, they returned my bag, saying nothing objectionable was found in it. All four then sped away on their bikes,” he added.

When Ashok checked his bag, he found Rs 2.5 lakh missing. He raised the alarm tried to chase the four, but they managed to make good their escape.

Division 1 police station SHO inspector Rajwant Singh said, “CCTV cameras installed near the spot have captured all four miscreants on two bikes. One was standing a few metres from the other three. They were in civvies. It is being investigated if anyone from the market is involved in it as Ashok often visited the market for wholesale purchasing.”

Police are trying to trace the accused and have registered a case under section 379 (theft) of the IPC, he added.
