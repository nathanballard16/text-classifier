India calmly navigates UNSC meet on Kashmir, says Pakistan and China isolated

WASHINGTON: India calmly navigated a pincer diplomatic move by China and Pakistan to alarm the world about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, saying constitutional changes made in the state are “internal to India and have not made any difference to our external orientation.”India’s permanent representative to the United Nations Syed Akbaruddin was a picture of composure as he told journalists at the UN following an information consultation of the UN Security Council members on the Kashmir situation "Our national position was and remains that matters related to Article 370 of the Indian Constitution are entirely an internal matter of India….and India remains committed to ensure that the situation there (J&K) remains calm and peaceful.”“We note that there were some who tried to project an alarmist approach to the situation which is far from the ground realities. Of particular concern is that one state is using terminology of 'jihad' against & promoting violence in India including by their leaders,” Akbaruddin said, underscoring the hysteria being whipped up by Pakistan, including talk of nuclear war, following India’s constitutional and legislative changes in J&K.Earlier, Akbaruddin’s Pakistani counterpart Maleeha Lodhi exulted before journalists that the Kashmir issue has been “internationalized,” although the informal closed door gathering of the 15 UNSC members concluded sans any formal votes, resolutions, or statements. No formal minutes or notes were taken at the meeting, and neither India not Pakistan were present at the deliberations. Effectively, Pakistan and China attempted to pass off their views as that of the UNSC members, a bluff that was called out quickly by India.But Lodhi maintained that “The fact that this meeting took place is testimony to the fact that this is an internationally recognized dispute... The people of #Jammu& #Kashmir may be locked up their voices may not be heard in their own homes &land but their voices were heard today at the @UN & their voices will always be heard because #Pakistan will always stand by them extending full diplomatic and political support.”However, Indian diplomats said it was clear there was no traction for Pakistan’s exertions considering no country other than China came out and spoke about the matter, including the US till the time of writing this.Ahead of the meeting, Pakistan's prime minister Imran Khan reportedly phoned President Trump (and heads of all P5 countries save France, who he could not reach), but the exertions did not appear to make any impact. News of the call surfaced in the Pakistani media but neither the White House nor Trump made any mention of it, although the U.S President tweeted on several other issues, as is his wont.There was also no reaction from any other country among the 15 U.N Security Council members, of whom ten are non-permanent rotating members.“If there was some agreement, even informal, they would have come out and spoken. Who else spoke? No one…only the Chinese,” one Indian official pointed out, maintaining it was not India but Pakistan and China that were isolated. In fact, the Pakistani and Chinese delegations made no secret that they were working in tandem at the U.NBut even the Chinese intervention, and presentation outside the meeting, was not entirely to Pakistan’s satisfaction.China’s envoy to the U.N Zhang Jun said the issue of Jammu and Kashmir is “leftover from history and according to UN resolutions its status is undecided and it is an internationally recognized dispute." However, he said the matter should be resolved properly through peaceful means in accordance of the UN charter, the relevant resolutions, AND bilateral agreements.”As he was telling reporters that India’s actions had changed the situation and “parties concerned” should refrain from taking any unilateral action which might further aggravate tension in an area where “tension is already very tense and dangerous” someone knocked over a stand. “Is that the tension?” Zhang joked. “So we can see how serious the situation is.”Similarly Akbaruddin also disarmed some aggressive questioning by Pakistani journalists who wanted to know when India would initiate peace talks by joking, "let me come and shake your hands first," while asserting that India was always ready for talks under the bilateral agreements if Pakistan ceased its support to terrorism.A small demonstration by Pakistanis outside the White House abjured the violence that militant British Pakistanis and Khalistani separatists unleashed in London yesterday, their protest restricted to placards and slogans. “Kashmir is for Kashmiris, not for India or Pakistan. Modi is killing innocent terrorists,” one protestor told TV cameras in a quote that became an instant meme.
