SRINAGAR

The Joint resistance Leadership (JRL) leaders and activists on foray staged a protest demonstration in Srinagar in the wake of the recent ban imposed on Jama’at-e-Islami (JeI) outfit by the home ministry and restrictions in parts of Kashmir.

Soon after the culmination of Friday prayers, scores of the leaders and activists from JKLF, Hurriyat (m) and Hurriyat (g) jointly gathered in Lalchowk and protested against the new order by the government against Jama’at-e-Islami (JeI) outfit.

Earlier, JRL comprising Syed Ali Geelani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik called for peaceful protests across Kashmir against the New Delhi’s “dictatorial measure”.

Meanwhile, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, a chairman of Hurriyat (m) was not allowed to offer Friday prayers, as the Jamia Masjid was locked down amid the “resections” in most parts of the city.

“Not allowed to offer Friday prayers. #JamaMasjid locked down and restrictions in most city, while arrests continue and jamat e Islami declared “unlawful”. Dictatorship at its best,” Mirwaiz wrote on his twitter handle.
