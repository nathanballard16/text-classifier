Inter exam row: Panel submits report; re-verification of scripts to be completed in 12 days

The panel investigating the discrepancies in intermediate examination results in Telangana has submitted its report to the Government on Saturday.

While the contents of the report has not been announced officially yet, it is learnt that the panel has blamed the private firm, Globarena which processed the results, as well as lack of co-ordination among the officials of Board of Intermediate (BIE), Government of Telangana for the fiasco.

It may be recalled that large scale discrepancies have been reported in the results announced by the BIE on April 18. In the examinations held in March-April about 8 lakh students appeared out of which 3.28 lakh were declared `failed’.

The errors in the marks memo, confusion in hall tickets numbers and wrong identification of students, mismatch between marks obtained by the students and required cut-off, and others triggered major protests by students, parents as well as opposition political parties across the state.

Bowing to the pressure, the government formed a three member panel on April 22 which submitted a report today.

RE-VERIFICATION

According to B Janardhan Reddy, Secretary, Department of Education, Govt of Telangana, re-verification of answer scripts of all failed students will be completed in 12 days from now.

The process is currently on in 12 centres across including five in Hyderabad. In districts, collectors have been given the charge of the process.

Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had earlier directed the officials to conduct re-verification of answer sheets of all failed students free of cost.

Meanwhile, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has on Friday issued notice to the state government over reports of 18 suicides by the failed students.
