This is first batch of buses BEST is procuring on wet-lease; drivers will be provided by contractor, BEST employees’ kin get preference.The Brihanmumbai Electric Supply & Transport (BEST) Undertaking is set to restart bus services on long routes that had earlier been shut down to curtail losses. This will be facilitated by BEST’s procurement of its first batch of 10on abasis by August 4.The 10 electric midi-buses will include six AC buses and four non-AC ones, and will operate on routes from Mahim to Mira Road; Sion to Thane; and Sion to Bhayandar railway station.To cut down its losses, BEST had stopped bus services on 170 of its Ccategory routes that earned it less than 40 paise per km. This affected lakhs of commuters who used these routes on a daily basis. The 400-odd buses which earlier ran on these routes were instead moved to B-category routes, which fell under the break-even category.ABEST official said running the new electric buses on longer routes will ensure an assured number of kilometres covered per day. But unlike older buses, which had a seating capacity of 70 passengers each, the 10 new electric buses are midsized, with a seating capacity of 31 passengers and standing room for another 12.“Earlier, the buses would regularly operate at half of their carrying capacity, but with these midibuses, the buses will ply at full capacity. This will ensure that we cater to our long-distance passengers, who had been inconvenienced by the routes shutting down,” a senior BEST official said.The shorter length of these buses will ensure they don’t have to wait long to fill up. This will improve their turnaround time, too.To train drivers to operate the new electric buses,— the original equipment manufacturer (OME) of the buses — sent a 12-m-long electric bus from Telangana, where it is based, to the BEST depot in Dharavi on Thursday night, to train the first batch of 25 drivers who will operate these buses in the city in two shifts.As per the wet-leasing contract agreed upon between BEST and Olectra Greentech, the drivers for the new electric buses will be provided by Olectra, while the conductors will be from BEST. Olectra has already invited applications for drivers’ jobs, and has so far received around 130 applications, of which 40 are from the kin of BEST employees. Priority in hiring will be given to family members of BEST employees, Olectra said.Speaking to Mirror, an official from Olectra Greentech said, “These electric buses are different from buses that run on. Experienced drivers will be hired, and will receive training in controlling the accelerator to get good mileage. After being shortlisted, the new drivers will be trained for around 15 days.”“We have informed employees in all depots to forward the applications of their family members who are interested in applying,” the official said.BEST is also in the process of finalising the contract for 400 nonelectric buses, which will also be wet-leased. Earlier, the contracts were allocated to Antony Garage Pvt Ltd and Shri Krupa Service for providing 200 buses each.However, these contract are currently being reviewed and are likely to undergo changes, BEST sources said.The state government on Friday issued a Government Resolution removing the BEST Undertaking from the ambit of the Bombay Industrial Relations (BIR) Act, 1946.The move will affect the BEST Workers’ Union, which had called for a strike from August 6.The union must now prove its majority before the administration can invite it for talks over wage negotiations.A BEST official said the registration process was currently underway, and is expected to end on July 31. “Whenever there is a fresh registration in any union, or workers want to move from one union to another, they need to intimate the administration about the move. This process takes around three months, after which the headcount of each union is declared,” he said.BEST currently ownsbuses, of which aroundply daily.1,3231,85325
