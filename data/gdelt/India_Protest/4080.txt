Police nab tea burglar after 5 yrs

The Rajasthan native had looted a truck of goods worth Rs 14 lakh



The Bharati Vidyapeeth cops have arrested an absconding accused in a case of theft that was registered about five years ago with the police station. The court remanded him to four-day police custody on Tuesday, informed one of the police officials attached to Bharati Vidyapeeth police station.



Police sub-inspector Abhijeet Ratnaparkhi said, “We have been searching this man for the last five years.” The arrested man has been identified as Garibram Hariram Chaudhary (30). He was nabbed from Uruli Kanchan area.



Ratnaparkhi added, “The case was registered back in June 2014. One of the distributors of Society Tea company was carrying a truckload of tea packets via logistics for selling. This information was present with the accused even before the truck could leave the city. He then hatched a plan and stole tea packets worth Rs 14 lakh from the truck. He was accompanied by four others, who threatened the driver and forcibly plundered the vehicle late in the night at Katraj Chowk. Then, they fled to Mumbai and sold all the packets.”



However, the cops did not lose sight and the probe progressed. After several years, a cop received a tip-off that Chaudhary was in Uruli Kanchan since a last few days. The cops acted immediately and arrested him. He was then produced in the court.



Ratnaparkhi said that the accused hails from Rajasthan and had fled away to his hometown after the case was registered against him. He had returned to Pune in search of a job last month. He added, “He thought that the cops might have even forgotten the case, but we did our job.”



The case was registered under section 379 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) for theft. He was also booked under section 418 of IPC for cheating, informed the cops.
