Pakistan Plans to Stop Second Train Running to India Amid Kashmir Row - Minister

Pakistan's Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad stated on Friday that another train running to India would be shut down.

Commenting on the cancellation, Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar stressed that the decision was unilateral and that Islamabad made it without consulting with New Delhi.

Previously, Pakistan suspended diplomatic and trade ties with India, protesting against a decision to cancel the autonomy of the predominantly Muslim-populated Jammu and Kashmir, which is also a disputed territory between the two countries.
