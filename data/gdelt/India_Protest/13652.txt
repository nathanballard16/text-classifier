ITANAGAR: The students of the Himalayan University on Monday, staged a massive protest in wake of the recent media report that educational degrees are being sold to unqualified students.

The students under the banner of the Himalayan University Students’ Union demanded that the university’s chairman should come to the State and give a clarification on the matter to the students and to the public.

Stating the allegation of selling fake degrees is linked to the University’s Delhi office, the students demanded that it should be shut down immediately.

The other demands of the students include that the record of students who have passed out from the University since its establishment should be made public, taking up the matter with authorities concerned for a strict investigation, and setting up a vigilance committee.

University’s registrar Dr Vivek Mittal said that the allegations are levelled against persons who are not associated with the University in any way, and that they have already filed a complaint in this regard with the police.
