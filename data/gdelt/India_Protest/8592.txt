Protest Over Class XII Result Continues in Patna

Patna: For the third day in a row, failed students of Class XII protested outside the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) office on Buddha Marg in Patna demanding re-evaluation of their test papers alleging massive irregularities in the appraisal process.

Blocking the road for over two hours, activists representing All India Students' Federation (AISF) and Pappu Yadav's Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) tried to break open the iron gate of the BSEB premises forcing the police to react forcefully and chase them away at the force of their batons.

Pushing back at allegations of any wrongdoing, BSEB secretary Anup Sinha said while the board had already ordered re-checking of papers of aggrieved students, many of their charges like the math test paper consisted of only 35 marks and not 50 as intended.

"BSEB chairperson Anand Kishore had already said that students who feel they were cheated by the system should fill out a form available on the BSEB website and regional offices in many districts. However, papers of students who have qualified in various competitive exams will be re-evaluated first," Sinha said.
