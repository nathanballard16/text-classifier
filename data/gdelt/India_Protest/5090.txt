A debt-ridden Agra farmer has sent Rs 2,000 he received under the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The potato farmer also sent a letter to the chief minister, demanding euthanasia.

Speaking to the Times of India, 39-year-old Pradeep Sharma said that he has sent Rs 2,000 to Yogi Adityanath and if the chief minister cannot help him, "he can at least grant me the permission to kill myself". The farmer also said that he is under Rs 35 lakh debt.

Pradeep Sharma said that he lives with his family in rented accommodation and has been struggling to make ends meet. He said that he has written to the district administration and state government seeking help after crop loss in 2016 but never received a reply.

"In December last year, I had gone to Delhi to meet Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh but returned empty-handed from there too," he said.

Pradeep Sharma said that he had brought the matter to the notice of the administration officials when his debt-ridden uncle died of a heart attack in 2015.

In December last year, a Maharashtra-based onion farmer sent his paltry income of Rs 1,064 from selling 750 kg onion to Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a mark of protest.

"I produced 750 kg of onion this season but was offered a rate of Rs 1 per kg at Niphad wholesale market last week. Finally, I could negotiate a deal for Rs 1.40 per kg and received Rs 1,064 for 750 kg," farmer Sanjay Sathe told PTI.

Days later, another onion farmer in Maharashtra registered his protest against the farm crisis by sending Rs 6 to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis.
