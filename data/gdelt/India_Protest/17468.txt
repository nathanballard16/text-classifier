Lawyers, policemen clash in Alwar

Close on the heels of the clash between lawyers and policemen in Delhi, a scuffle broke out between the advocates and police personnel on the court premises in Rajasthan's Alwar town on Wednesday.

The two groups manhandled each other after a policeman from Haryana was allegedly beaten up during a sit-in staged by lawyers to protest against the Delhi incident.

The lawyers allegedly misbehaved with a woman constable after thrashing the head constable from Faridabad who had come to the court to attend the proceedings of a case. The incident angered the policemen, who gathered in large numbers and clashed with the lawyers.

Senior police officers and judges reached the spot and intervened to bring the situation under control. Alwar Superintendent of Police Paris Deshmukh said four cases were registered at two police stations in connection with the thrashing of four policemen. No arrest was made so far.

Earlier in the day, the Rajasthan Police Service Officers’ Association held a meeting here and condemned the incident in Delhi’s Tis Hazari court. Association president and Additional Superintendent of Police Raghuveer Singh said a resolution demanding stern action against the guilty was passed at the meeting.
