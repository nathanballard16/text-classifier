Teenage boy among two martyred as India violates ceasefire yet again

At least two civilians were martyred and two others, including a woman, injured as Indian forces violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) on Thursday.

Indian forces resorted to unprovoked firing at Jora sector, the ISPR said, adding that the martyred were identified as 14-year-old Shehryar and 29-year-old Naveed.

Pakistan Army, the military’s media wing added, effectively responded to the aggression and targeted Indian posts.

Three soldiers of Pakistan Army also got injured in an exchange of firing between the two forces.

Earlier in the day, ISPR DG Major General Asif Ghafoor said that the escalation was an effort to divert the world’s attention from the continuing violent protests against the anti-Muslim law in India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s move to drive the law through parliament last week has ignited nationwide protests that have often turned violent, with six people killed.
