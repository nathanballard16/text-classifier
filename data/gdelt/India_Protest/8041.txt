Toeing the US Line on Iran

Indian foreign policy should be guided by strategic autonomy, respect to sovereignty, and international law.

The Indian position on the recent sanctions imposed by the United States (US) on Iran confirms what has been a matter of speculation so far. Given the stakes, India’s reluctance to protest these unilateral sanctions demonstrates its eagerness to play a junior partner of the US in world politics.

The official position, so far, is quite vague as there are two different versions floating around. Immediately after the US announcement of ending the exemptions from sanctions given to India and other countries, the minister of petroleum and natural gas in the Narendra Modi government responded with a tweet. In the tweet he said nothing about the decision. Instead he talked about India being fully prepared to deal with the situation arising out of it.
