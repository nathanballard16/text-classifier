Vashi FOB collapse: action against two engineers

NMMC initiates internal inquiry against them

Navi Mumbai Municipal Commissioner N. Ramaswami on Thursday suspended two engineers from the Vashi division in connection with the foot overbridge (FOB) collapse in Vashi that injured two people on April 11.

The two officials, deputy engineer Yashwant Shrirang Kapse and junior engineer Vishal Sangramsingh Suryawanshi, face action for negligence. “A work order was given to an agency on March 8 to change the railings and repair the bridge. It was the responsibility of these engineers to make sure that the contractors put up barricades near the FOB so that no one uses it,” Mr. Ramaswami said.

An internal inquiry has been initiated against the two officials and the punishment will be decided as per the report. “The inquiry should be over in three months’ time. Till then, the suspended officers will get 50% of their salary, and after three months, 75% will be given,” Mr. Ramaswami said.

As of now, the NMMC is covering all the medical expenses of the injured people. “Once they are discharged, we will take a call on the compensation that can be provided to them,” Mr. Ramaswami said.

Around 7.45p.m. on April 11, Vashi residents Jitendra Subhedar Pal (23) and his cousin Sarvesh Pal (21), were out on a walk when the FOB collapsed and they sustained injuries. While Jitendra received head injuries and is undergoing treatment at NMMC hospital, Sarvesh was shifted to the ICU of Hiranandani hospital in Vashi. Both are said to be stable. The NMMC will soon demolish the FOB and build a new one.
