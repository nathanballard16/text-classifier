Washington: In a strongly-worded protest letter to the Trump administration, 25 members of the US House of Representatives, the lower house of the US Congress, have called for better trade ties with India. They have demanded that the Trump administration should not terminate the 45-year old Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) Programme as it will hurt American workers. The GSP Programme ensures that duties on many products imported from over 100 developing countries are reduced. If the GSP Programme were to be terminated, it would slow down hiring and increase layoffs among American workers, this bipartisan group said.

The letter, dated May 2, 2019, to Robert Lighthizer, the US Trade Representative by the Congressmen, both Republican and Democrat, said: “We are writing to express our concerns with the recent announcement of intent to terminate India's designation as a beneficiary of the GSP Programme... We urge you not to terminate benefits once the 60-day notice period required by statute ends in May. Instead, we hope your office will continue negotiating a deal that protects and promotes jobs that rely on trade -- both imports and exports -- with India.”

Explaining why a termination would hurt both the USA and India, the legislators said:

* US firms that rely on duty-free treatment for India under the GSP Programme will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in new taxes every year, benefitting, quite naturally, the US government.

* Any lapse in benefits will force firms to sack workers, cut salaries and delay job-creating investments in the United States.

* Termination of the GSP Programme will also hurt firms exporting goods to India and importing good from there. Instead, the 25 Congressmen want negotiations with India, as opposed to a termination, which they call a step back, not a step forward.

*After the US government's announcement, India is already on notice. The programme will be terminated by mid-May. The 25 legislators pointed out that the Lok Sabha elections are going on in India, it will be difficult for the Modi government to do anything right now. The new government takes over in late May and only then can India begin to look at the issues and try and resolve them after negotiations.

Importantly, the Congressmen said: "We urge you not to terminate any GSP benefits until there is an opportunity to negotiate with India's next government." Showing India the door, they said, would be risky. "A decision to terminate GSP in the midst of the elections risks politicizing the issues further, with potentially negative consequences for broader relations with an important ally."

* The alternative to negotiations, the Congressmen said were "higher trade barriers all around, which would hurt American companies and workers that depend on strong two-way trade between the United States and India."

Twenty-one of the legislators are part of the Democratic Party, which has a majority in the 435-member House of Representatives and four are from US President Donald Trump's Republican Party. They are from every part of the country, from 15 states, including Connecticut, New Jersey and New York in the east, Louisiana in the South, Iowa and Illinois in the mid-West and Texas, the second largest state bordering Mexico. Eight of the legislators are from California, the largest state, on the west coast.
