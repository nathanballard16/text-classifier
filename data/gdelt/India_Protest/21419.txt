Protests held in India against ‘anti-Muslim’ citizenship laws

In India, there have been violent clashes and further protests against a controversial new law which will ease citizenship for people from persecuted religious groups – but only if they aren’t Muslim.

Critics say it’s just the latest effort to marginalize India’s Muslim community by the Hindu nationalist government.

Although the UN has called the law ‘discriminatory’, India’s Prime Minister has claimed ‘no Indian has anything to worry about’.
