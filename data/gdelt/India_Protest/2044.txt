India protests at U.S. detention of several Indian students

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India on Saturday said it had lodged a protest with the United States government after several Indian students were detained there in connection with their enrolment in a fake university, following an undercover operation by U.S. agents.

U.S. authorities this week said eight individuals who exploited the country's student visa system had been indicted. They had helped foreign nationals illegally remain in the United States by enrolling them into a metro Detroit private university, which was actually being operated by U.S. agents themselves.
