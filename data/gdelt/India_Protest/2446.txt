Gujjars threaten to go on rasta roko strike in Rajasthan on February 8

Gujjars in the state of Rajasthan are set to revive their annual agitation over the issue of reservation on February 8.

Gujjar Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti (GASS) leader Kirori Singh Bainsla threatened to call a strike in the state on Friday if the community and four other castes are not provided five per cent reservation in government jobs and education.

Making the community's intention clear, Bainsla reiterated the demand for fresh quota at a community meeting held in Ajmer.

"We want reservation. The Congress in its poll manifesto promised the same and now we are asking it to fulfill its promise which the government made in an official document," he said.

Gujjars had initially demanded a shift from Other Backward Category (OBC) to Scheduled Tribe (ST) category. However, they settled down for a special OBC category with five per cent reservation.

They had given the state government a 20-day deadline ending February 8.

Bainsla said the community will block railway tracks of in Dausa, Bijayanagar, Sawai, Modhpur and Kota, which will cause huge disruptions in rail traffic between Delhi and Mumbai. They are also expected to block roads across the state to disrupt traffic as well.

However, if the five per cent reservation is granted, total reservation to the community will exceed 50 per cent. Therefore, courts have been striking down five per cent special reservation to the Gujjar community in the state.

Meanwhile Rajasthan Deputy Chief Minister Sachin Pilot, who himself is a Gujjar, has said there will not be any further injustice to the community.
