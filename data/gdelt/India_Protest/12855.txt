Kashmir lockdown sees at least 2300 detained

Srinagar: At least 2300 people, mostly young men, have been detained in Indian-administered Kashmir during a security lockdown and communications blackout imposed to curtail unrest after New Delhi stripped the disputed region of statehood, according to top Kashmir police and arrest statistics.

Those arrested include anti-India protesters as well as pro-India Kashmiri leaders who have been held in jails and other makeshift facilities, according to three police officials. The officials have access to all police records but spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren't authorised to talk to reporters and feared reprisals from superiors.

The crackdown began just before Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist-led government stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its semi-autonomous statehood on August 5, creating two federal territories.

Thousands of Indian troops have been sent into the Kashmir Valley, already one of the world's most militarised regions, to man checkpoints. Telephone communications, mobile phone coverage, broadband internet and cable TV services were cut, although some have been gradually restored in places.
