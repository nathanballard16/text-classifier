Dissent grows louder in Navodhana forum

KPMS threatens to quit objecting to govt stand on Sabarimala

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) government’s attempt to cobble together an alliance of social organisations under the aegis of the State-sponsored Navodhana Samrakshana Samiti (Renaissance Protection Committee) showed signs of unravelling on Saturday.

The Kerala Pulayar Maha Sabha (KPMS), a major constituent, threatened to quit the forum in protest against the government’s position that the State was under no legal obligation to escort women to Sabarimala. General secretary of the samiti and president of the KPMS Punnala Sreekumar said gender equality was the linchpin of the social alliance. Any trade-off between that core value and political expediency would rob the samiti of its credibility. He held the State leadership of the CPI(M) accountable for the U-turn. The party’s central leadership was for the entry of women of all age groups.

The cracks in the forum had begun to show in September when the Hindu Parliament, an umbrella body for at least 50 Hindu organisations, quit the samiti citing an ‘overwhelmingly backward caste tilt in the organisation.’

The general council of the KPMS had met in Alappuzha on Thursday. It had formed a three-member committee to apprise Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan of its position.

SNDP stance

Meanwhile, Vellappally Natesan, general secretary of Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana (SNDP) Yogam, a constituent of the Samiti, said the Yogam was with devotees on the Sabarimala issue.

At a press conference on Saturday, Mr. Natesan said he believed that women aged between 10 and 50 would not visit the temple. The final verdict in the Sabarimala case was yet to come. He said an opinion on the issue could wait till that.
