“It Was a Different Environment”: Evaluating a Cultural Exchange Program

Background: As nursing colleges seek to respond to the demands of the profession for nurses who are globally engaged and of the students for global health educational experiences, Riner's Globally Engaged Nursing Education framework is an effective tool for developing and evaluating an experience.

Method: Using Riner's framework, faculty and students at a nursing college evaluate an inaugural cultural exchange program between their U.S.-based college and a partner in India.

Results: The framework helps the team identify the strengths of the program, as well as areas for improvement for future global endeavors. The framework as an evaluation tool is also critiqued in light of this process.
