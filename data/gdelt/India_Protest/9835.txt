Healthcare services were affected across the country earlier this month after doctors went on a strike in protest against an attack on one of their colleagues.

Long before this, doctors in Muzaffarpur polled in money and hired quick-reaction teams (QRT) for their security.

"Around 60 doctors have set up QRT for their safety and to stop the violence. We have been deployed at three places in the city," a member of one of such teams was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. This comes at a time when over 100 people have died of encephalitis in Bihar's Muzaffarpur.

While bigger hospitals have their own teams to ensure security, smaller clinics pooled funds to hire QRTs. These security teams include gunmen and bodybuilders who are available call 24x7, The Times of India reported.

Dr CB Singh of the Indian Indian Medical Association in Motihari told the daily that doctors took the step as the cops are already overburdened with their primary duties.

"How can they save a doctor who is being attacked? They often come after the incident when the clinic has been vandalised or the doctor was beaten up," Dr Singh was quoted as saying by the daily.

Muzaffarpur, a major medical hub for patients across north Bihar, hogged national and international headlines after more than 100 children died due to acute encephalitis syndrome (AES).
