Lucknow is one of the few prominent cities that had seen major protests against the contentious Triple Talaq Bill. The All India Muslim Personal Law Board had held three big meeting against bill and many Muslim clerics and intellectuals had vehemently opposed it. But the Bill is a reality now.

India Today TV spoke to several Muslim women in the city who expressed their pleasure at the passage of the bill. Activist Saiyad Zareen said, "Women are happy to see this bill becoming a reality. The fear of instant talaq will gradually disappear from their minds."

Zeenat, a resident of Old Lucknow said, "The rule should be equal for every woman. There shouldn't be any discrimination on the basis of religion so uniform civil code should be there just not the bill for women."

There was jubilation at the residence of Mohsin Raza, the Minority Affairs minister in the UP government. Sweets was distributed in family and women in the family thanked PM Narendra Modi for this big move.

But there were voices of dissent from clerics and Muslim intellectuals. Lawyer and prominent face of AIMPLB Zafaryab Jilani said that they will challenge this in the Supreme Court.

Muslim women and clerics may be on two sides of this bill but in Lucknow today's development was widely hailed by Muslim women.
