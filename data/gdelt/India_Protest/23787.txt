Shiv Sena's Sanjay turns Raut Indori over CAA, NRC; says kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai

Amid protests in the country over Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Shiv Sena on Sunday launched sharp attack against the BJP-led government in the Centre.

Targeting the Narendra Modi government over the new citizenship law, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Twitter quoted Rahat Indori's poetry line which roughly translates to -- that the country does not belong to one person.

"Sabhi ka khoon hai shamil yahan ki mitti mein, kisi ke baap ka Hindustan thodi hai (Everyone's blood is mixed in the soil of India. The country does not belong to one person)," Sanjay Raut tweeted.

Earlier, Sanjay Raut accused the BJP of trying to create "Hindu-Muslim divide" in the name of vote bank politics.

While the protests are in full swing across the country over the amended Citizenship Act which critics say is an attack on India's secular foundations, Maharashtra Chief Minister and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray linked the new citizenship law with BJP's dream of Hindu Rashtra.

Hitting out at the Centre, Uddhav Thackeray also asked how and where the government intended to settle Hindu immigrants in the country.

"I would like to know how and where the Hindus from other countries are going to be settled. I don't think you (Centre) have a plan for it," Uddhav Thackeray said.

Shiv Sena, which recently snapped its 35-year-old ties with the BJP to form a government in Maharashtra with the Congress and the NCP, had earlier supported the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the Lok Sabha, but staged a walkout during voting on it in the Rajya Sabha, saying there was no clarity on questions raised over it by the party.
