A day before Delhi goes to poll for the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Congress has moved the Election Commission of India to protest against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) saying it is trying to "mislead" voters in the national capital.

The Congress's Delhi unit has alleged that the AAP is making phone calls to "mislead" voters ahead of the polling day.

The party has alleged that AAP is using call centres to call voters in Delhi and present them findings of bogus surveys. The Congress has said the AAP is spreading fake survey figures to influence voters.

News agency ANI in a tweet said the election agent of Congress leader Sheila Dikshit, who is contesting from North-East Delhi has written to the Election Commission saying "certain automated phone calls are being used to spread misinformation in attempt to influence electorate".

All seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi will go to poll on Sunday. In the run-up to the Lok Sabha election, the AAP and Congress had several rounds of talks to form a pre-poll alliance in Delhi. However, the talks failed and the two parties are now fielding candidates on all seven seats.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the Bharatiya Janata Party won all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi. The Aam Aadmi Party currently runs a majority government in Delhi while the Congress ruled Delhi continuously for 15 years under the chief ministership of Sheila Dikshit.
