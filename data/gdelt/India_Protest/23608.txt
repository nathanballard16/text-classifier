A protester who came from Bihar to join the protest said, “The rich have proof of their identity or they will procure it somehow. How will the labourers and workers, who migrate from UP and Bihar, manage to get the proofs?”

The students also took out a march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019. Some former students of the university came to the spot with their children holding posters for demonstration.

Salim Ahmed from Okhla said, “I am with students of this country. What happened at Jamia Millia last week was unpardonable. My son is here carrying a poster and I want my son to grow up in a secular nation and not a biased country , who had brought his five-year-old son to the protest venue.

“Our friends have been detained by Delhi Police but we will not get demoralised by it and continue with our protests, he added.

Waseem Khan, LLM student from Jamia who was spearheading the protests said, The CAA is biased on the basis of religion and each of us are fighting for something erroneous we have observed in the CAA. No students ever protest violently. We have been protesting shouting slogans since a week and never initiated violence .

Several groups of people lent their support to protesters and distributed food, water and tea to the agitationists sitting outside Gate no 7 of Jamia for long.

Various groups, including some women supporters, had brought biryani, samosas and other food items and distributed tea, biscuits and toast to protestors urging them to eat and protest with full vigour.
