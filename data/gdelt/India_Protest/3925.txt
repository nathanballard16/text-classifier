Karachi Bakery gets its name back as police arrest nine protesters

BENGALURU: After an angry mob in Indian city Bengaluru threatened to vandalise the 'Karachi' part of renowned Karachi Bakery, the outlet has got its name back two days after.

The bakery on Sunday removed the covered part of the board that said 'Karachi' in the wake of the threats the owners received.

The move came after police officials detained nine accused of threatening to vandalise the bakery if the name wasn't changed in the wake of the Pulwama attack.

According to Indian media, bakery in-charge manager Sukumar said police have provided security and citizens came out in voicing support. Moreover, police have also provided security to five outlets of the bakery in the city.

Meanwhile, the bakery took to Twitter to clarify that it was founded by Khanchand Ramnani who had migrated to India at the time of partition.

"The brand, established in 1953, is an Indian company based out of Hyderabad in Telangana. The popularity and love for its products has contributed to its growth across India and abroad. The essence of Karachi bakery is absolutely Indian by heart and will remain so. We request everybody to refrain from any kind of misconceptions," it said.

Police said the accused claimed they hadn’t done anything wrong and described their actions as 'patriotic'. They have been booked under IPC sections 146 (rioting) and 504 (breach of peace).
