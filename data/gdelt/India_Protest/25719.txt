Shashi Tharoor: Don’t give communal colour to stir

NEW DELHI: Congress MP and former Union minister Shashi Tharoor on Monday warned all those protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed NRC to not allow the discourse to be “communalised” as “identity politics will destroy India”.In a series of tweets, Tharoor advised protesters to “broadbase” their agitation against the contentious law. He said the protests over CAANRC and NPR are “about constitutional values” and the “foundational pluralist idea of India, not Hindu versus Muslim”.“... the basic idea of Indian pluralism is threatened. Broadbase the cause. You can’t fight Hindutva communalism by promoting Muslim communalism,” he said.“BJP is looking for an opportunity to paint this agitation in communal colours. Don’t give it to them,” he said.The Congress MP from Kerala expressed concern over the protests being given an increasingly religious colour rather than being limited to be a battle to protect India’s constitutional values.
