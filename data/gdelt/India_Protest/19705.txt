Protests over Indian nationality Bill

Modi's government had tried to bring in the contentious legislation during its first term but the Bill could not pass the upper house where the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies lacked a majority.

Shashi Tharoor, a member of the opposition Congress party, told parliament amid angry exchanges that the Bill "infringes upon the principle of equality before law" guaranteed to all persons, including non-citizens.

The Bill seeks to amend the Citizenship Act of 1955 which prohibits illegal migrants from applying for Indian citizenship.

Under Modi, the Islamic-sounding names of several cities have been changed, while some school textbooks have been altered to downplay Muslims' contributions to India.



On Monday, 100 scientists and scholars at institutions in India and abroad published a joint letter expressing their "dismay" at the legislation.

They said that enshrined in India's constitution is the notion of treating all faiths equally.

But Modi's "proposed Bill would mark a radical break with this history and would be inconsistent with the basic structure of the constitution".

The letter said such a careful exclusion of Muslims would "greatly strain" India's pluralism.

AGAINST INFILTRATORS

The government has defended the Bill, saying it was only aimed at flushing out infiltrators, and that Muslims did not face persecution in the three neighbouring countries.
