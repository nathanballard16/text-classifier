Young citizens rightly worried about India's future: Yechury

CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Tuesday said the young are "rightly" worried about the country's future and lauded the courage shown by a woman student of Pondicherry University who refused to accept the gold medal to express solidarity with students protesting against the new citizenship law.

In a series of tweets, Yechury also condemned reports of a 24-year-old German student being asked to leave India for taking part in the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

"India's future, which these young citizens are, is rightly worried about the future of India. Our solidarity with all patriotic Indians like the courageous Rabeeha.

"Is this the Republic as declared by India's Constitution? There is no limit to how low this govt will stoop to muzzle voices. But India and the world hear the message clearly," he tweeted.

Rabeeha Abdurehim, who hails from Kerala and had done her Masters course in Mass Communication, alleged that she was prevented from attending the convocation ceremony on Monday at which President Ram Nath Kovind was the chief guest.

She also refused to accept the gold medal to express solidarity with students protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
