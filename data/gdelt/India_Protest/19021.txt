Protests over rape, murder of woman vet in Telangana

A large number of people staged a protest Saturday outside Hyderabad’s Shadnagar police station, where the accused in the rape and murder of a 27-year-old Hyderabad-based veterinary doctor were lodged before being shifted to Chanchalguda Central Jail.

The four accused in the case have been sent in judicial remand for 14 days.

A huge crowd can be seen raising slogans against the accused and throwing slippers at cops.

The incident, in which a 25-year-old veterinary doctor, who worked in a state-run hospital, was raped and killed by the four youth, all lorry workers, on the city outskirts, on Thursday night, has triggered a national outrage.
