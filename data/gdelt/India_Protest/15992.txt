At India-China summit to mend ties, Modi, Xi see common challenge on 'terror'

MAHABALIPURAM, India (AFP) - Chinese President Xi Jinping and his Indian host Prime Minister Narendra Modi pledged at an informal summit to cooperate against "radicalisation", India said late on Friday (Oct 11), after the Asian giants with historically prickly ties had exchanged sharp words over Kashmir.

The seaside meeting, aimed at mending relations, came after India irked China by its August move to split Jammu and Kashmir in two. The decision will make the area's Ladakh region - part of which is claimed by Beijing - a separate Indian administrative territory.

India, meanwhile, has been enraged by China's diplomatic backing for Pakistan, which controls a much larger part of Muslim-majority Kashmir.

Part of Beijing's Belt and Road infrastructure mega-programme is planned in Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Xi held talks with Prime Minister Imran Khan in Beijing just two days before meeting Modi.

When Mr Xi said he supports Pakistan's "legitimate rights", India's foreign ministry thundered it was "not for other countries to comment on the internal affairs of India".

But at their "very open and cordial" two-and-a-half-hour dinner conversation on Friday, the leaders acknowledged a common challenge, the Press Trust of India quoted Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale as saying.

"The two leaders said that these are large countries and that radicalisation is a matter of concern to both and that both would work together so that radicalisation and terrorism did not affect our multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-religious societies," Mr Gokhale said.

The Indian Express newspaper had earlier quoted unnamed sources as saying Mr Modi would "explain to the Chinese president the reasons behind Delhi's decision on Kashmir".
