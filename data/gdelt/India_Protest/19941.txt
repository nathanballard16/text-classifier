RS adjourned till noon over delays in GST dues

New Delhi, Dec 11 : Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) members along with other opposition MPs protested the delay in payment of GST dues to the states in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, resulting in the adjournment of the upper House till noon.

Some of the members had given notice for raising the GST issues but it was not considered by House Chairman M. Venkaiah Naidu. Naidu said that the issues had been discussed earlier and hence could not be permitted again.

TRS Parliamentary Party leader and Rajya Sabha member K. Keshava Rao, Vijay Sai Reddy of YSR Congress, Vivek Tankha of Congress and Aam Aadmi Party leader Sanjay Singh were among those who wanted discussion on GST issues.

Several state finance ministers had earlier expressed concern over the delay in compensation for the months of August and September forcing them to resort to ways and means or even overdraft.

As many as nine states have complained of delay in GST compensation dues and appealed to the Centre to make timely payments as promised at the time of the GST launch.

Trinamool Congress' Rajya Sabha member Manas Ranjan Bhunia said that the Centre had cleared the dues of West Bengal for the months of August and September but the compensation dues of subsequent months of October and November were yet to be transferred.
