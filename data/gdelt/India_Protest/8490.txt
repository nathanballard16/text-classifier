Farmers protest with cattle in front of SDM office

Ludhiana: In a unique form of protest against stray cattle, a group of farmers brought the bovine in tractors and staged protest in front of sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) office in Khanna on Friday. Raising slogans against the government, they demanded that the government take care of the stray cattle.

One of the protesting farmers said the government collects money in the form of cow cess, but stray cattle continue posing risk to crops and humans. He added that the number of stray cattle in villages have increased which are a growing cause of concern for them.

Protesting farmers said they had dropped the stray cattle previously in front of government office in Khanna and the officers concerned had assured them of proper action, but nothing had happened. They threatened to intensify their protest after their meeting with Balbir Singh Rajewal of Bhartiya Kissan Union (BKU) Rajewal in Patiala on June 4.
