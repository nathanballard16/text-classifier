Farmers’ convention in city on February 6

To put pressure on the State Government to fulfil their longstanding demands of price, pension and prestige, farmers under the banner of the Nabanirman Krushak Sangathan (NKS) will hold a massive rally here on February 6.

“Thousands of farmers from across the State will join a convention in th city on February 6 to begin the second phase of agitation against the lackadaisical attitude of the State Government in increasing paddy MSP to Rs 2,930 per quintal and making a pension provision of Rs 5,000 for farmers. The protest will continue for an indefinite period till our demands are fulfilled,” said NKS national convenor Akshaya Kumar.

Kumar said the State Government is playing a blame game with the Centre forgetting its own responsibility towards farmers. “Like Biju Swasthya Kalyan Yojana and other scemes, the State could have challenged the Centre by adopting an own scheme to hike paddy MSP to Rs 2,930 per quintal of paddy. Instead, it made a farce holding a demonstration in Delhi to demand increase in MSP to Rs 2,930,” alleged Kumar.

He said the Government has also tried to divert the people’s demand for waiving farm loans by implementing ‘KALIA’ scheme. This scheme would not help farmers much, he said.

Kumar said 36 lakh farmer will benefit if the State Government adopts a pension scheme for them and there would be a annual burden of Rs 21,600 crore on the State exchequer for execution of the scheme
