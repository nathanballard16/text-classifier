Internet blackout hits India unrest, mass arrests

Hundreds of people have been arrested in parts of India and authorities are imposing internet blackouts, in an effort to stem the mass protests that have rocked the country for the past week.

The government is refusing to budge on the controversial immigration law that sparked the unrest.

In the capital New Delhi and some other regions a ban on public gatherings has also been put into an effect, to keep protesters from organizing.

Some flights have been canceled.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's law expedites the path to citizenship for immigrants of certain religions, including Christianity and Hinduism.

He says it's designed to help protect those worshippers from persecution in neighboring countries like Pakistan and Afghanistan.

But it doesn't include Muslims, which has critics crying foul in a country that has long cherished its diversity and secular constitution.

It also caps a string of other policy decisions from Modi that opponents claim amounts to a Hindus-first agenda.
