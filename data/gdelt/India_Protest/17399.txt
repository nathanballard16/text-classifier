Delhi Police on Tuesday staged a symbolic protest at the Police headquarters. India Today TV Team captured all the emotions, ranging from aggression to the officers shedding tears, addressing their plight.

An officer told India Today TV, "We work day and night for the people but the situation is so bad now that we are forced to protest on roads to have our voices heard. Our superiors are ignoring our pain and it is the biggest issue prompting us to step out in this way."

An officer, who couldn't hold his tears while highlighting his plight, urged the authorities to take accountability of the entire issue.

"Our demands are not unknown to anybody. Be it the common men, media, authorities or the society. The integrity of the Delhi Police stooped to a new low when we faced disproportionate punishment [in Tis Hazari incident]. It's heartbreaking to see what Delhi Police has come down to. Today, while I was stepping out with my uniform on, my daughter came to me and said, papa, please don't leave home in your uniform. I am afraid you'll be attacked and beaten up. I couldn't hold my tears. This is how my little girl thinks, forget about society."

"Our work calls for selfless service of people round the clock. But we'll always stand in solidarity with our uniform and the dignity it carries. This protest is symbolic to draw the attention of our superiors, Lt governor and the home ministry to take this matter seriously with an immediate effect. We are always committed to serve the people and we will be serving them until our last breath," another cop said.
