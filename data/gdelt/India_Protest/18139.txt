Youth Congress protests against desecration of B. C. Roy's bust

The activists claimed that the BJP was behind the act

With posters and placards in hand, the activists raised slogans against the BJP, claiming that the party was behind the 'heinous act'.

Youth Congress activists on Monday staged a protest outside Raj Bhavan against the desecration of a bust of party veteran and former West Bengal chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy in East Burdwan district.

In a veiled attack, the Trinamul Congress leadership had also blamed the BJP for the rise in incidents of violence.

Ashutosh Chatterjee, the president of Chhatra Parishad (Congress youth wing), slammed the BJP leadership, claiming that the party 'harbours criminals and disrespects noted leaders and eminent Bengalis'.

The activists dispersed following an intervention by the police.

Roy, the second chief minister of West Bengal, has been widely credited for modernisation of the state after Independence.

Sunday's bust vandalisation in East Burdwan led to a slugfest between the ruling Trinamul and the BJP.

Describing the act of vandalism as 'unfortunate', state urban development minister Firhad Hakim said such incidents have been on the rise in West Bengal after the BJP came into prominence.

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh denied the allegation and asserted that his party is above 'such petty acts', and demanded a probe into the incident.

A similar incident had occurred this year when the bust of polymath Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was desecrated at a Kolkata college, during a roadshow of BJP president Amit Shah.
