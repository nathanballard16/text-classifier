The Bengal chief minister, who also holds the health and family welfare portfolio, told the doctors that stringent action will be taken against them and hostels will be vacated if they do not resume work. She also directed the state police to clear the premises and only allow patients to stay. However, the stir continued despite Mamata Banerjee’s ultimatum. Emergency wards, outdoor facilities, pathological units in several state-run medical colleges and hospitals in West Bengal remained closed on Thursday after private hospital doctors joined the protest called by the junior doctors.

Mamata said the BJP asked the doctors not to see and treat the Muslim patients and the party is trying to score political brownie points by creating communal tension in West Bengal. She said that BJP asked the doctors not to see and treat the Muslim patients.

The junior doctors sat on a dharna demanding stringent action against one Mohammad Sayeed and the people who accompanied him. Sayeed and his men had reportedly alleged that their relative, a 75-year-old patient, died due to negligence in treatment and attacked the interns inside the hospital premises.
