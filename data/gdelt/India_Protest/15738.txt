Broken manhole cover on Karve Road fixed

The problem on the stretch in Erandwane had been left unattended for a while, posing a high risk of accidents



Commuters and residents of a busy stretch of Karve Road in Erandwane have heaved a sigh of relief after as a broken manhole cover, which was posing a high risk of accidents and source of anxiety for many, was fixed.



This comes after Pune Mirror reported about the hazard on the busy stretch, which is narrow, routinely causing traffic jams.



The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had seemingly turned a blind eye to the situation, after which the citizens and MahaMetro staff put up barricades warning people about it.



However, following the report in Mirror, Nitin Udhas, deputy commissioner of PMC, zone II, took swift action and escalated the matter to the respective officials. “Instructions were issued to the engineering department concerned to repair the broken manhole on a priority basis. The cover of the manhole had gotten damaged due to the movement of heavy vehicles. Orders have been given to officials to also look into similar issues in the vicinity.”



Shalini Raju, a regular commuter, said, “ PMC has responded quickly and the manhole has been repaired. We had given up all hope that it would be mended quickly. The PMC has at least covered the hazard it at a time when the city is getting a lot of rain, which is good for the public. PMC should not have waited for the media to highlight the issue before covering the manhole.”



Another area resident, Sunil Salunkhe from Navi Peth, said, “The PMC ward office lags behind in maintenance work, which creates a lot of inconvenience for citizens. I have come up across several broken and open manholes across the PMC limits. We are happy that the problem is solved. The local body should conduct a survey to identify broken or open manholes in their jurisdiction before the monsoon and fix them.”
