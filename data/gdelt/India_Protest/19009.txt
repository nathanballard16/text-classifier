CHENNAI: Two decades after the now defunct Tamil Nadu Liberation Army (TNLA) attacked a police station at Andimadam, Ariyalur, a special court for bomb blast cases here has sentenced 11 members of the group to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment.

The attack was carried out by a 15-member group in 1997. However, three of the accused died during the trial and one, Veeriah, turned approver. TNLA started in the 1980s with a primary agenda to declare Tamil Nadu a separate nation was later banned by Tamil Nadu and the union government.

On July 13, 1997, a 15-member gang conspired to attack the Andimadam police station in Ariyalur district to rob arms and ammunition kept there. After locking the policemen in the station in the cells along with the convicts, the gang looted all the arms and ammunition.

Subsequently, the Q branch police booked 15 people and registered cases under IPC for dacoity, criminal conspiracy, and attempt to murder.

On Friday, concluding the trial, special judge P Chenthoorpandi said the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt and convicted all the 11 for the charges framed against them.
