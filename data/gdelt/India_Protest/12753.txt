India loosens clampdown in Kashmir, but leaders remain detained

A fact-finding team of three well-known activists and an academic that traveled to Kashmir last week said that in Srinagar and nearby villages, hundreds of boys and teenagers had been picked up by security forces and held in detention. They met an 11-year-old boy who said that he was held in a police station from Aug. 5 to 11 and that children younger than him were also in custody.
