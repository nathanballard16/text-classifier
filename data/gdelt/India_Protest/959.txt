Auto Bandh from Jan 17, JAC alleges Police Partiality, Double Standards

Hyderabad: Telangana Auto Drivers JAC has given an Indefinite Auto Bandh Call from January 17 in twin cities in protest against the police partiality and double standards. The JAC has appealed to the auto drivers to boycott the “My Auto is Safe” project launched by the police. An indefinite auto strike notice is already served on the police and transport department.

Mohd. Amanulah Khan, convener of the JAC, while addressing media persons at NSS here today alleged that the City Police is indulging in partiality and double standards in dealing with Auto Drivers and Ola and Uber Drivers. The city police Commissioner says that the auto drivers should not charge over the meter charges. But at the same time, he is silent over the cabs which are looting the passengers day and night in the name of “Surge Pricing”. The cabs are supposed to fix taxi meters and this is not being implemented.

He demanded that the diesel run cabs causing pollution should be banned on the city roads. He clarified that the auto drivers in twin cities are unable to carry passengers as per the existing auto fares since the fares are not increased for the last five years. It may be mentioned here that the auto fares i.e Rs. 20/- minimum and Rs.11/- perr km were fixed by the then United AP Congress Government with effect from February 14, 2014.

As such “My Auto is Safe” program should be postponed till such time the auto fares in the city are increased on par with the other neighbouring states. Another important demand of the drivers is that the Government should issue necessary guidelines to the private auto financiers so that their harassment is stopped forthwith.

Maruthi Rao Jagtap, Shakiruddin, Jibran Hussain, M.A. Saleem, A. Sathi Reddy, Mohd. Azeemuddin, Mohammed Lateef and Farooq Bhai also participated in the press meet.
