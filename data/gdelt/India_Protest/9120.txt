Students stage protest outside Kejriwal’s house: IP University fee hike

Battling against the fee hike in the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (IP University), imposed from 2015, about 500 students from 13 colleges affiliated to the University, on Sunday, staged protest outside Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence at Civil lines.

The students put before him their demands and in return CM assured them to move a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court in coming days. Also they asked him for the compensation to which he said, “The government cannot do it. The Opposition will accuse the government of favouring a self-funded college.”

A student protesting outside his house said the students did not get a satisfactory response from the CM.

A former student of Maharaja Surajmal College, Karan Rohera said, “The CM seemed ignorant about the matter. He said he hasn’t gone through the related documents that were handed over to his Personal Secretary yesterday. Since February, we had written to the CM several times regarding the matter and now he is saying he doesn’t know anything about the issue.”
