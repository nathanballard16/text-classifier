Over 100 Activists, 35 Policemen Wounded in Protests Against India’s New Citizenship Law in Delhi

Police lobbed tear gas shells, resorted to cane-charging, and allegedly dragged students out of Jamia Milia Islamia, a premier university in the southern part of the national capital. More than 100 activists and 35 policemen, including some senior officers were injured.

Later, students from various universities in the national capital and political activists supporting them staged a sit-in through the night outside the police HQ, demanding action against the policemen.

Najma Akhtar, Vice Chancellor of Jamia Milia Islamia denied the students had made any call for protest. She claimed the protesters, who torched and damaged buses were from neighbouring residential settlements, saying “they (protesters from neighbouring residential colonies) clashed with police and got inside the campus after breaking the gate of the university".
