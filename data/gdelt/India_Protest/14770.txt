'We want freedom from Pakistan', demands activists; seek Modi's help

HOUSTON: While PM Narendra Modi is all set to participate in the 'Howdy Modi' event today in Houston, Sindh activists have urged him to help them in attaining freedom from Pakistan. Several people belonging to the Sindh and Baloch communities have gathered outside the NRG stadium to seek help from Modi and US president Donald Trump.

The two communities will be highlighting the human rights violations committed by the Pakistan army. Both Baloch and Sindh communities have been raising protests against Pakistan for a long time. These groups will be hoping to draw international attention through their protest during the 'Howdy Modi' event.

Baloch National Movement leader Nabi Baksha Baloch said that they hope India to support their cause just like how it supported Bangladesh Liberation war in 1971.
