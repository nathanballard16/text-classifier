Delhi government extends support to protesting employees

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday met the protesting employees of the Delhi government and promised them that he would take up their demands with the Lt Governor and the Union Home Minister.

"In this decisive fight, the government is with you," Sisodia assured the employees.

Sisodia said the Delhi government is in agreement with their demands. It should be accepted immediately by the Lt Governor and the Union Home Minister, the state government said in a statement.

The Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS) cadre employees are on a hunger strike since last week in protest against unfair service conditions. The Dass comes under the Lt Governor.

They are demanding implementation of the Sahai committee report, recruitment and promotions to vacant positions and the general transfer posting policy.

Sisodia said he will seek appointments with Lt Governor Anil Baijal and Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh to apprise them of the demands.

The Minister stressed the Delhi government must have authority over the services department not only for its smooth functioning, but also for creating a positive environment for the employees, the lifeline of any government.

"Since May 2015, we are fighting to retain the services with the Delhi government. This is not a personal fight, but a fight against the repressive system," Sisodia said.

He also appealed them to call off the hunger strike since it affects the health of those sitting on protest. However, they refused.
