‘Staging’ trouble between Bengal BJP and the TMC

Both parties spar over who gets to build their stage first; Modi’s rally is on Sunday, Mamata’s a day later



KOLKATA Fresh trouble is brewing between the BJP and the ruling TMC in West Bengal as both parties are sparring over who gets to build a stage first for rallies.



Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to hold a rally at Cooch Behar’s Rash Mela grounds on Sunday, while Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s rally is scheduled there a day later.



The state BJP has demanded that the Trinamool Congress party dismantle the stage they have already begun building as they want to set up PM’s stage first. The TMC, however, has reportedly refused to do so.



BJP leader and Bengal Observer Kailash Vijayvargiya has urged the state administration to resolve the issue. The TMC, it is learnt is building the stage at one corner of the ground and has said that they will not have enough time to build it after Modi’s Sunday rally.



Trinamool leaders and the Cooch Behar District Magistrate could not be reached for comment.



According to rules, the party that first applied for the rally at the venue will get priority to build their stage.
