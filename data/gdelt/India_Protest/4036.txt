Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed a huge crowd for the first time after the IAF's air strike on Pakistani soil during a public rally in Churu district of Rajasthan. He said the country is in safe hands and he will never let the country down. Recognising the valour of security forces, PM Modi said we should all bow our heads to the soldiers. "After 70 years of independence, we have dedicated a national war memorial to those who sacrificed their lives for the nation. This memorial is quite important for Rajasthan as this state has sacrificed thousands of their sons from Charu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu," he said. Attacking the opposition, Modi said, "Your one vote will give a befitting reply to those dreaming of forming a weak government and will also strengthen my government." PM Modi is being given credit by his party colleagues and his ardent followers for the decisive and punitive action taken by the Indian Air Force. BJP Spokesperson Sambit Patra said why the UPA government didn't take such a decision after the 26/11 Mumbai attack. Although, Congress leaders are not missing a single chance of reminding BJP about 1965 and 1971 wars, which were fought under Congress rule and brought Pakistan own its knees. (BCCL)
