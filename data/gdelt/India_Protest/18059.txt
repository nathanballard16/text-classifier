Imphal | November 17

Following the Central Government’s reported plan to pass Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the upcoming Parliament session, Manipur People Against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill 2016 (MANPAC) has announced Manipur bandh.

While announcing launching of a series of protest against CAB under the aegis of North East Forum for Indigenous Peoples (NEFIP), MANPAC announced total shutdown in Manipur on November 19 which will be commenced from the midnight of November 18 till 6 pm of next day (November 19).

Ahead of the total shutdown, MANPAC will stage a mass protest against the Centre’s reported plan to bring out the bill in the Parliament on November 18, the day Winter Session of the Parliament is to be begun.

Series of protests are to be launched by MANPAC as part of NEFIP's campaign against the CAB to be launched across the Northeast states, said NEFIP president Ningthouja Lancha, at a press conference held in Imphal on Sunday.

Ningthouja then condemned the incumbent government at the Centre of its "attempt to pass the bill despite knowing the fact that the indigenous peoples of the Northeast states are against it". He added, "NEFIP will not remain silent if the BJP-led NDA government attempts to pass the bill".

Ningthouja Lancha then alleged that the Prime Minister of India is yet to give his reply to the memorandums submitted by over 250 civil society organisations from across the Northeast states under NEFIP to him through the Governors of NE states.

The NEFIP president then termed CAB as “genocidal act” while reiterating that NEFIP will stand firm against the bill.

Lancha then informed that NEFIP Central Executive Council has resolved to launch mass agitations against the “authoritative attitude” of the Central Government from November 18. He further said the Forum has also decided to urge all the MLAs and MPs of the region to oppose the bill.
