Hindu Council dedicates Holi to Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Hindu Council (PHC) Sunday unanimously decided to dedicate upcoming Holi festival, being celebrated on March 20, to Pakistan.

Pakistan Hindu Council, in connection with Holi festival and Pakistan Day, will hold a colourful mega event on Wednesday, March 20, at the Shri Panchumukhi Hanuman Temple, Soldier Bazar, Karachi.

A large number of Pakistani Hindu families, holding national flags, will be present to demonstrate their love for beloved Pakistan. Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, who is also patron-in-chief of Pakistan Hindu Council said that patriotic Pakistani Hindu community has decided to celebrate the Holi in a very unique way. This year's Holi festival will acknowledge the noble achievements of Quaid-i-Azam and our elders to organise historic Lahore Jalsa on March 23, 1940 for passing Pakistan Resolution.

He also appealed to all segments of society to actively participate in Holi celebrations, emphasising that their presence would deliver a positive message to show solidarity with non-Muslim minorities, promote interfaith harmony, strengthen patriotic zeal and represent diverse Pakistani society, according to Quaid-i-Azam's vision.

The council has unanimously passed a resolution against Indian aggression and vowed to support brave Pak Army for defending motherland. According to a press release issued on Sunday, the Managing Committee, during its meeting held at PHC House, also termed the recent visit of prominent parliamentarian Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani to India a remarkable peace initiative to defuse Pakistan-India regional tensions.

The meeting was attended by Dr Ramesh Kumar Vankwani (Patron), Gopal Khamuani (President), Parshotam Ramani (Gen Secretary), Paman Lal Rathi (Joint Secretary), Bharat Kumar Mangalni (Finance Secretary), Prem Talreja (Adviser) and other members.
