Panjab University fee hike: SOI sits on hunger strike

CHANDIGARH: The members of the Students Organisation of India (SOI) on Sunday sat on an indefinite hunger strike outside the office of Panjab University (PU) vice-chancellor (VC) Prof Raj Kumar against the decision of the syndicate and senate members to hike the fees of self-financed courses.The students said that the PU’s decision to increase the fee for the new session and old session was unjustified and that it would lead to commercialization of education.They further said that they had submitted a memorandum regarding the same. “We had submitted the memorandum but authorities are not paying any heed towards it so we are forced to sharpen our protest,” they said.SOI Chandigarh unit president Iqbal Preet Singh said the fee hike was shocking and not justified. “This is just added pressure on students’ shoulders. The authorities should look out for other ways to go about this because otherwise, we are going to intensify our protests with every passing day,” he warned.
