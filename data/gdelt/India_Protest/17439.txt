Vijayawada hoteliers to stop logging in to Swiggy from Nov. 11

The Vijayawada Hotel Owners’ Association on Wednesday announced that all the hoteliers in the city would log out of online food delivery app Swiggy from at 6 a.m. on Nov. 11, as a protest against all the food delivery apps.

Addressing a press conference here, Association president P. Ravi Kumar and secretary Sanjay Mehta Jain said that the delivery apps are now charging 18% to 25% commission on orders and it has become a huge burden for the hotel owners in the event of increase in prices of ingredients and operating costs.

“The online apps like Swiggy, Zomato, Uber Eats and others started businesses about one and a half years ago with zero commission and gradually increased it to 10%. Now with their hold in the city becoming stronger they are increasing it to 18%-25%. In addition we have bear costs of order cancellations, telephone charges, and many other hidden charges," Mr. Ravi Kumar said.

The hotel owners associations have already put this issue in the notice of Competition Commission of India which is pursuing the case, Mr. Ravi Kumar said.

“All the apps are more or less practicing the same making it a burden for us. To start with we have decided to stop logging in to Swiggy from Nov. 11 and later we would extend it to other apps if things are not set right. We need the governments to intervene and regulate the food delivery companies so that fair business practices are followed," he said.

The Association has 240 restaurants, including a majority of the hotels in the city, as its members and all of them came together and took a decision in a meeting held on Tuesday, they said.
