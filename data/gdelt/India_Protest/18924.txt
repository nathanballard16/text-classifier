Youth Congress protest against Pragya Thakur on Godse remarks

New Nov 29 : Youth Congress workers dressed as Mahatma Gandhi protested on Friday here against BJP MP Pragya Thakur for her remarks about his assassin Nathuram Godse and demanded that the Bhopal MP be expelled from Parliament.

The Congress has upped its ante on the issue and targeted the BJP. Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi has also tweeted and slammed Pragya Thakur for her remarks.

Earlier on Friday in the Lok Sabha, Pragya Thakur apologised for her remarks, saying that her statement had been twisted, and targeted Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for terming her as terrorist. She said that she has not been convicted in any case and being a woman and MP had been called a terrorist by a leader of the Congress.

A day after her remarks, Rahul Gandhi had tweeted "Terrorist Pragya calls terrorist Godse, a patriot. A sad day, in the history of India's Parliament." Earlier on Thursday, the BJP cracked the whip on the controversial Bhopal MP and barred her from attending any further parliamentary party meetings during the ongoing winter session of Parliament and also removed her from the Consultative Committee on Defence headed by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.
