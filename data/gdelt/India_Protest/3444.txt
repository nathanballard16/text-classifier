Jaipur: 2-hour sit-in by BJP in 33 districts against Pulwama attack

Protesting against the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, the BJP staged a dharna in all the 33 districts of the state on Sunday for two hours and souted slogans against Pakistan.

In the state capital, Jaipur, BJP workers staged a dharna at the district collectorate where 40 soldiers of CRPF who were killed in the terror attack were paid tributes.

This dharna was organised at the collectorate circle in the leadership of BJP Jaipur city president Mohan Lal Gupta from 1 pm to 3 pm. Hundreds of BJP workers from Jaipur city unit joined this dharna.

Addressing the gathering of party workers, former minister and former state party president Arun Chaturvedi said that the attack on our braveheart soldiers in Pulwama was supported by Pakistan.

There is no doubt that this act should be punished. PM Narendra Modi has taken tough decisions against the separatists and it is necessary to end such activities in the country, he added.

BJP’s city unit president Mohan Lal Gupta said that the Union government is understanding the country’s sentiments. Various countries across the world have also condemned this terrorist attack on India. Different countries stand with India’s diplomacy. Pakistan’s cowardly attack is not worth the excuse, he said.

During the protest demonstration on Sunday, several councillors and city BJP office bearers including state secretary Mukesh Dadhich, Laxmikant Pareek, former mayor Nirmal Nahta, paid homage to the martyrs and expressed their deep condolences to the bereaved families.

Like Jaipur, the BJP has staged dharna in all the 33 districts of the state. The BJP office-bearers of the concerned district, legislators, MPs and councillors joined the dharna.
