BJP Women Demand Action Against SP Leader Azam Khan

Patna: Just a day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Kumar Choubey found himself in hot soup following his sexist comment against former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi, the women's wing of the BJP on Monday in Patna burnt the effigy of Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Azam Khan for making derogatory remarks against former film star and newly-inducted BJP leader Jaya Prada saying his remarks were insulting to women all across India.

Ironically, the same allegation was made by the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) camp following Choubey's demeaning comment against Rabri Devi.

As reported, Azam Khan, an SP candidate from Rampur in Uttar Pradesh, had reportedly said that even the color of Jaya Prada's panties were khaki – apparently referring to the color of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) uniform.

Jaya Prada, the star of dozens of Hindi and other regional language films, recently dumped SP in favor of the BJP that that wasted no time in fielding her against Khan from the Rampur seat.

Outside BJP office in Patna, dozens of women burnt the effigy of Khan urging the Election Commission to take tough action against him. They also demanded from the SP candidate an unconditional apology to the women of India.

"Khan's statements were not only insulting to Jaya Prada but also demeaning to women everywhere. This says all about Khan and the party he belongs to. People of Bihar and UP will teach them a lesson in the ongoing elections," they said.

Meanwhile, for obvious reasons, the protesting women did not mention the comment of BJP leader Ashwini Kumar Choubey who had on Saturday advised RJD leader and former Bihar Chief Minister Rabri Devi to 'remain within the confines of her 'ghoonghat' (veil)' instead of indulging in politics.

His remark was deemed sexist and misogynist though Choubey refused to apologize for his comment despite demand for apology from the RJD camp.
