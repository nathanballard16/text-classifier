EEPC to hold engineering show in Coimbatore for first time

Over 400 delegates from 50 countries will participate in the event

The International Engineering Sourcing Show (IESS) will be held in Coimbatore for the first time --from March 4 to 6 next year -- the Engineering Export Promotion Council (EEPC) India announced on Wednesday. This is the ninth edition of the show, and the previous ones were held in Mumbai and Chennai.

Rakesh Shah, Chairman – Publicity, Exhibition and Delegation Committee and former Chairman of EEPC India, told presspersons that this was the first time that a “non-metro” city was chosen to hold the show. “Metros are not necessarily the industrial hubs,” he said, highlighting the various industries present in Coimbatore.

On whether the future editions of IESS will focus on non-metro cities, Mr. Shah replied in the affirmative, saying that EEPC India would open 15 of its chapters in Tier-II and Tier-III cities this year. “Smaller towns and cities will be the industrial hubs of tomorrow,” he said.

The theme of the forthcoming edition of IESS will be “Smart Engineering”, Mr. Shah said. About 400 delegates from over 50 countries will participate in the show, where buyers and sellers can have a one-on-one interaction, Mr. Shah said.

S. Chandrasekar, Convenor & Chairman, EEPC India – Coimbatore Chapter, said the show in Coimbatore would be held at CODISSIA Trade Fair Complex. Over 300 Indian delegates would also participate, he said.

The sixth, seventh and eighth editions of IESS, which were held in Chennai, saw more than 21,000 business queries valued over $14.14 million and the signing of eight Memoranda of Understanding, according to a press release. More than 60% of the members of EEPC India belong to the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises, for which IESS would provide a platform to reach the global engineering forum in India.

Suranjan Gupta, Executive Director of EEPC India, was present at the press briefing.
