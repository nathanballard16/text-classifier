JNU teachers, students vow to campaign against Modi

Students call off hunger strike; take pledge to ‘save education and universities from being destroyed’

The Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU), JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA) and faculty from various universities have declared that they will “save education and universities” from being destroyed and actively campaign to vote out the Narendra Modi-led government.

At the All India Universities Convention, held by the JNUTA, members decided to vote out the Modi-led government in order to evict several people who have been appointed as heads of universities by the Centre and “are destroying higher education in various universities”.

“Members of more than 20 universities across the country as well as student and teachers of JNU have pledged to vote out the Modi-led government in order to save higher education,” the JNUSU and the JNUTA said.

The declaration that was read out said that the past five years had seen a concerted attack on public-funded universities and other institutions of higher education and that the assault has been on multiple levels. The JNUTA listed out the attacks: “Availability of funding, irregularities in recruitment and finance, inadequate infrastructure, attacks on institutional autonomy, political interference, constriction of equity, access and reservation, diminishing quality of education and research, restrictions on freedom of expression and association, democracy and security.”

After making the declaration, the students who were on an indefinite hunger strike for the past nine days called off their agitation to “invest their energy into campaigning to defeat the Modi-led government in the Lok Sabha election”. The students had been protesting against the university’s new admission policy.
