Odisha ruling BJD to hold demonstration to protest against bifurcation of East Coast Railway

Bhubaneswar: The Biju Janata Dal (BJD) would hold a demonstration before the East Coast Railway (ECoR) headquarters here on Saturday to protest against the bifurcation of the ECoR .

The BJD said that with the creation of a South Coast Railway (SCR) headquartered at Visakhapatnam and transfer of major assets there, the railway networks would be ruined in Odisha.

Speaking at a Press conference here on Friday, BJD general secretary Sanjay Dasburma opposed the move of the Centre and demanded revocation of the bifurcation order.

Terming the move as a death knell for railways in Odisha, Dasburma argued that north and west Odisha have continued providing major traffic of iron ore and other minerals are under the Bilaspur Zone of the South Central Railway (SCR) and the Chakradharpur Zone of the South Eastern Railway (SER), but the Centre is depriving the Odisha people of their legitimate right.

Similarly, the maintenance sheds of electric and diesel engines and wagons units based at Visakhapatnam under the ECoR Zone would now move to the SCR Zone. These loco sheds and wagon maintenance units are the biggest in the country. After bifurcation, the ECoR would lose these facilities and depend on other zones for supplies of wagons and engines to Odisha.

Dasburma pointed out that on February 16 2018, Chief Minister in a letter to Union Railway Minister Piyush Goel had opposed the move.
