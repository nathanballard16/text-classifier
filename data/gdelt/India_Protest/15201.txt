BAREILLY: Bail applications of the law student from Shahjahanpur , arrested for alleged extortion, and former Union minister Chinmayanand, accused of raping the girl, are slated to come up on Monday. The applications are listed in the district judge’s court and both sides are hoping for relief from the district judge.Speaking to TOI on Sunday, the law student’s father said, “We have belief in the judicial system and there is not much I would like to say about my daughter’s bail application. I will file an application in the court to enquire whether the jail authorities have intimated the honourable court about Chinmayanand’s stay in PGI Lucknow or not.”Meanwhile, demanding the immediate release of the law student, the Uttar Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) has decided to hold a 10-day protest march from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow on Monday.
