New Delhi, May 13: Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government has refused permission to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah's proposed rally in Jadavpur. According to reports, the government has also denied permission to land his chopper.

The BJP plans to approach the Election Commission against the move.

However, this isn't the first time, earlier too, in the month of January, citing upgradation of work, the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government denied permission to the state BJP to land party president Amit Shah's chopper at the Malda airstrip ahead of his rally.
