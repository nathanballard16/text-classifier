KARACHI: The observance of Black Day in protest against the carnage of innocent Muslims in India was marked in Karachi yesterday [Oct 3] by meetings held by students after the Juma prayers. A meeting was held at the Arambagh mosque and flags of India as well as an effigy of the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi, were burnt. Namaz-i-Ghaibana for the Muslims killed by the Indian Hindus was held at the Memon Masjid, while prayers were offered at various mosques throughout the City.

Students, wearing black arm bands carried banners in Urdu, English and Gujrati, reading “Stop killing Muslims”, “Hindu Goondaism Murdabad”, “Humanity is dying in Ahmedabad”, “We will take revenge of the martyrs”, “Snap diplomatic relations with India”, “Declare Jehad”, “Introduce general military training”, “We hail President Yahya’s stand at the Rabat Conference”.

The meeting at the Memon Mosque was sponsored by the National Students Federation and ad­d­­r­essed by its President, Mr Rashid Hasan. It strongly condemned the brutal killings of the Mus­­­lims of India, blamed imperialist agents and said that it was a challenge to the whole Muslim world. — Correspondent
