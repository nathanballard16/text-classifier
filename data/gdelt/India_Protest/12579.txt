Activists hoist Kannada flag in protest

A group of Kannada activists leading a campaign #KarnatakaJobsForKannadigas hoisted the Kannada flag on Independence Day as a mark of protest against the policies of the Union government.

The campaign has been demanding 100% reservation of all jobs – government and private sector — in the State for Kannadigas.

Kannada Ranadheera Pade, a Kannada organisation, has been leading a campaign. “We have done this to register our protest against gradual erosion of federalism in the country robbing States of their autonomy. We are Kannadigas first and then Indians. India is a country made up of States and not the other way around,” Harish B. Kumar, president, of the Pade said. He emphasised that they were proud Indians. “It is sad that the Union government has refused to acknowledge the flag officially despite a request to do so.”

The question of jobs for Kannadigas found mention in Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s Independence Day speech. While promising that the government was committed to ensure that the lion’s share of available jobs went to Kannadigas here, he sought to strike a balance by saying, “In the federal structure, we are ready to offer equal opportunities to all those who come to Karnataka seeking employment.”

However, the activists are not happy. “The Sarojini Mahishi report has been gathering dust for decades now. No government has taken measures to implement it. All we have are empty promises,” said Ramananda Ankola, secretary of the Pade, and a techie here.
