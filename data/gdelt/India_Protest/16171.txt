‘Taking Equality Seriously’: Two Men in India Get ‘Pregnancy Test’ Prescription for Stomach Ache

The bizarre incident came to light after the duo Gopal Ganjhu, 22, and Kameshwar Ganjhu, 26, complained about the doctor to the civil surgeon of the state’s Chatra District Hospital.

The two visited the hospital for a stomach ache, following which the examining doctor prescribed medical tests for their pain.

It was only when the two visited the hospital’s pathological lab that they learnt from an assistant that a pregnancy test had been prescribed for them, along with other tests like HIV, and haemoglobin.

The medical practitioner, however, has rubbished the allegations of him prescribing a pregnancy test for the men, saying that it was a conspiracy to defame him. "This is not true. This is an effort to defame me. Those tests could have been added by overwriting", the web portal India Today quoted the doctor as saying.
