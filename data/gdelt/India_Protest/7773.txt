Mani Shankar Aiyar justifies 'neech' remark for PM Modi, says it was 'prophetic'

It led to a sharp response from BJP. BJP leader Amit Malviya wrote: “Upset that Sam Pitroda was getting all the attention, the irrepressible Mani Shankar Aiyar pulls Pitroda’s foot out of his mouth... Reiterates and justifies his ‘Neech’ comment for PM!"

Mani Shankar Aiyar, who had ceded the space reserved for making most asinine remarks about PM Modi to Sam Pitroda, appeared to make an attempt to return to the top fo the charts with an article in which he claimed that his ‘neech’ remark for PM Modi was ‘prophetic’.

Writing for an online publication, the vocal Modi critic expressed confidence that Modi would be ‘ousted’ by the voters on May 23. Aiyar called Modi the ‘most foul-mouthed PM the country has ever seen’.

Aiyar wrote: “Modi will, in any case, be ousted by the people of India on 23 May. That would be a fitting end to the most foul-mouthed Prime Minister this country has seen or is likely to see. Remember how I described him on 7 December 2017? Was I not prophetic?.”

It led to a sharp response from BJP. BJP leader Amit Malviya wrote: “Upset that Sam Pitroda was getting all the attention, the irrepressible Mani Shankar Aiyar pulls Pitroda’s foot out of his mouth... Reiterates and justifies his ‘Neech’ comment for PM!"

In December 2017, in the run-up to the Gujarat state polls, Aiyar had said: "Ye aadmi bahut neech kisam ka aadmi hai, is mein koi sabhyata nahi hai, aur aise mauke par is kisam ki gandi rajniti karne ki kya avashyakta hai?"
