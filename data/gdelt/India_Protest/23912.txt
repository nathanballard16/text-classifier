Jaipur, December 22

A local court in Jaipur has ordered the police to register an FIR against the producers, director and writer of the movie ‘Panipat’ for distorting historical facts and allegedly maligning the character of Raja Surajmal which released nationwide on December 6.

Considering a complaint filed by one Dale Singh Leel, the court on Saturday ordered the police to lodge the FIR under Sections 153A, 504 and 505 of the IPC against writer Ashok Chakradhar, filmmaker Sunita Gowariker, and director Ashutosh Gowariker.

When asked, the SHO of Sadar police station RS Shekhawat said his office has not yet received any such order from the court probably because of Sunday.

Quoting his complaint, Leel (also an advocate) told The Tribune on Sunday that the movie has shown Raja Surajmal as a greedy king which he never was.

Surajmal had a liberal personality as per history and wasn’t defeated in any war, he said.

“When the police denied lodging a complaint in Jaipur, I had to approach the court which was accepted yesterday,” he said.

The Jat community had already held protests in parts of the state after the release of movie and its screening was gradually stopped in all cinema theatres afterwards.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, his Jat ministers and BJP’s former CM Vasundhara Raje had also demanded a ban on such scenes and even urged the Censor Board of Film Certification to review the film.
