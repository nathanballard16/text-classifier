MUMBAI, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Medical Association has called for a 24-hour token strike withdrawing all non-essential services on Wednesday to protest against the passage of National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill in the lower house of Parliament on Monday evening.

"Section 32 of the NMC Bill, instantly, provides for licensing of 350,000 unqualified non-medical persons to practice modern medicine and provides to add more and more such persons every year," said an official from Indian Medical Association.

The term Community Health Provider has been vaguely defined to allow anyone connected with modern medicine practice to get registered in NMC and be licensed to practice modern medicine, the official said.

This would mean that all paramedics including pharmacists, nurses, physiotherapists, optometrists and others are becoming eligible to practice modern medicine and prescribe independently. This law legalizes quackery, said the official terming the bill as "draconian."

According to PRS Legislative research - a think-tank body, the Bill seeks to repeal the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956 and provide for a medical education system which ensures availability of adequate and high-quality medical professionals.

The new bill would also adopt the latest medical research by medical professionals, periodic assessment of medical institutions, and introduce an effective grievance redressal mechanism, the research body said.

Terming the bill as the biggest reform, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan while introducing the bill in the lower house of the Parliament on Monday said the need for trained medical professionals in addressing the ordinary ailment needs of the population has been appreciated by the world bodies.
