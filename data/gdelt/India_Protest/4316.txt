Gregory Kottmeier

DELHI - Gregory Lorenz Kottmeier found peace on March 3, 2019, following a brief period of illness. He will be fondly remembered as a respected attorney in Delaware County.

Greg was born on Long Island April 8, 1960, to Dr. Peter and Pat Kottmeier.

He attended schools on Long Island and then graduated from Hampshire College. Gregory wed Christine Dunphy in 1992 and worked and lived in Manhattan.

In 1992, Greg decided to pursue a law degree and achieved a near-perfect LSAT score that resulted in a scholarship to St. John's University.

Interested in a solo practice and a family oriented community, Greg and Christine relocated to Delhi. Through early years and a subsequent divorce, they were always the proud parents of their sons, Lorenz and Declan.

Greg was devoted to the practice of law and exceptionally creative in finding favorable outcomes for his many and diverse clients. He was known for a keen intellect, cutting humor and a very inquisitive mind. He loved the outdoors with adventures in biking, hiking and kayaking. Iceland was a particular place that he found unique and visited several times. He also helped many people throughout his career in an often unassuming fashion.

In addition to his former wife,Christine, sons, Declan and Lorenz, Greg will be remembered by his parents, brothers, Stephen (Leslie), Pete (Gina) and sister, Andrea (Greg). He will be missed by a loving, loyal and steadfast friend, Melissa.

A memorial service will be held at noon, Saturday, March 9, at The United Ministry of Delhi, 1 Church St., Delhi.

Contributions in memory of Greg may be made to Heart of the Catskills Humane Society, P.O. Box 88, Delhi, NY 13753.
