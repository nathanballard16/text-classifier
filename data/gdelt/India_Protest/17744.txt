Surat: Powerloom labourers protest over wage hike

SURAT: Textile workers in some industrial pockets in and around the city have taken to the streets to demand hike in wages. The labour unrest that started in Jolva and Laskana industrial estates near Palsana has now spread to other industrial estates, including Pipodara. On Monday, textile workers entered the industrial societies which house powerloom units in Pipodara and forced the owners to shut their units.Sources said the workers have been demanding hike in labour charges by 20 paise per metre. The powerloom unit owners are adamant to not give any hike due to bad market conditions and reduction in overall production of grey fabrics since last one year.Last week, a delegation led by Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Welfare Association had met city police commissioner to demand protection for the weaving units in and around the city areas.Vijay Mangukia, president of Anjani industrial estate, said, “Over 1,000 units in Laskana, Pipodara and Jolva are shut for the last one week due to labour unrest. The unrest is slowly spreading to other industrial estates. We had demanded protection for unit owners and police patrolling in our estate has kept anti-social elements at bay.”Mangukia added, “The workers’ demand is totally baseless. We are already paying them good wages and that the workers are earning about Rs15,000 per month. Still they want hike in the wages by 20 paise. We are not earning more than Rs2 per metre on fabric.”Ashok Jirawala, president of Federation of Gujarat Weavers’ Association, said, “A group of anti-social elements is keen to create labour unrest in the industrial estates here. It is instigating workers to demand wage hike . We have requested police to ramp up security in the industrial units.”
