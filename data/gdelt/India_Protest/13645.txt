Social media calls for #BoycottRedLabel for 2018 Ganesh Chaturthi film

Call it the storm that was slowly brewing in a tea cup.

During the Ganesh Chaturthi celebrations in 2018, tea brand Brooke Bond had released an ad that promoted inter-religious bonding.

The was conceptualised by Geometry Encompass.

Nearly a year later, coinciding with the Ganesh Festival of 2019, the ad and the brand owner, Hindustan Unilever, India's largest FMCG company, has come under severe criticism on social media.

In the commercial, an old muslim man, is the subject expert who is helping a young Hindu executive choose the right Ganesha idol for his house. The buyer nearly pulls out of the deal when he realises the man selling the idol is a Muslim. This changes after the seller serves him a cup of Red Label Tea. A year later, Twitterati has taken note and protested against the ad saying that it shows the majority Hindu community in a negative light.

Bigot Sanghis are insulting Hindus by making so much of fuss and trending #BoycottRedLabel. Hindus like us are not only enjoying Red label tea but are enjoying this advert as well which is giving strong message of love and unity. Bigots can only see insult of Hindus. — Jaane bhi do Yaro (@mat_jane_de_yar) September 2, 2019
