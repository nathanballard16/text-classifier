AAP challenges Cong. on power bills

‘Congress hiked tariffs every year it was in power in Delhi’

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday challenged the Congress to show a single State in which the party is in power where power tariffs are lower than in Delhi.

The challenge was in response to an allegation made by the Congress that the AAP government was “looting consumers” by being in “connivance with power distribution companies”.

“The Congress still has governments in some States. We challenge the Congress to show a single State it has governed where power tariffs and bills are lower than that of Delhi and until then it should refrain from making these silly allegations,” AAP chief spokesperson Saurabh Bharadwaj said.

On Saturday, the Delhi Congress unit alleged that the Aam Aadmi Party government had benefited power discoms by coaxing people living in rented accommodations into installing separate power meters.

Levelling allegations of corruption against Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Sheila Dikshit had said that the AAP government was in “connivance with power distribution companies” and was “looting consumers” by levying higher “fixed charges”.

‘No hikes’

“The Congress made a wild allegation against the AAP government on June 8 over electricity pricing in the city. It is worth noting that these allegations are coming from a party and an individual whose government hiked power tariffs every single year for 15 years, against AAP, which has successfully prevented tariff hikes for the last 4.5 years, thereby providing the cheapest electricity in the country,” Mr. Bharadwaj said.
