Australia, Singapore upbeat on concluding RCEP talks by end-2019

Singapore and Australia expressed confidence yesterday that talks for a 16-nation mega free trade pact will conclude by the end of this year.

At a joint press conference with his Australian counterpart Scott Morrison, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said: "We are reasonably confident that with sufficient political will and willingness to make difficult trade-offs, it's possible to conclude the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) by the end of 2019."

PM Lee noted that when leaders of the RCEP's participating countries met last November, they had expressed a strong political commitment to push for the conclusion of talks by the end of this year.

The RCEP comprises the 10 Asean members and Australia, China, India, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. Formal negotiations began in 2012. The RCEP aims to lower trade barriers and secure improved market access for goods and services for businesses in the region.

Mr Morrison said progress on the RCEP has "had some frustration" due to the "electoral cycles of the partners, particularly over the first half of this year".

Australia, India, Indonesia and Thailand have held elections from March to last month.

Mr Morrison, who was re-elected as Australia's PM last month, said there is "a very good opportunity for considerable focus" to be placed on the RCEP, with those elections completed.

Both leaders also affirmed the importance of the RCEP yesterday.
