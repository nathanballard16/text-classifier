Telegu Desam Party (TDP) leader and veteran actor Naramalli Sivaprasad passed away on Saturday at the age of 68.

The TDP leader was suffering from kidney failure and breathed his last at around 2 pm in Apollo Hospital, Chennai.

He was being treated at the hospital for nine days and was on the ventilator for the last three days.

The celebrated TDP leader's body will be moved to Tirupati for his last rites which will be performed on Sunday.

Sivaprasad was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Chittoor constituency in Andhra Pradesh in 2009 and held his Lok sabha seat for two consecutive terms.

Sivaprasad was also a celebrated theatre actor who was known for his unique ways of protest outside Parliament as he dressed up in many roles to voice his outrage against the government.

Among his memorable stints in acting outside the world of theatre, he dressed up as BR Ambedkar and late DMK leader M Karunanidhi to demand special status for Andhra Pradesh.
