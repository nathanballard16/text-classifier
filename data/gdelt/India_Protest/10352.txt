GHAZIABAD: Residents of Panchsheel Primrose in Kavi Nagar staged a protest on Saturday against a rise in thefts and burglaries in the area after a flat in the society was broken into and goods worth Rs 2.5 lakh stolen.This was the second case to be reported in the past two weeks. Residents alleged that despite the presence of 80 guards, such cases were being reported inside the society periodically.They staged a protest against local police and the builder alleging that no progress had been made in another theft case reported two weeks ago.The burglary, which triggered the protest, came to light after its owner, retired central government employee Gopal Krishna Gupta, returned home on Saturday.The flat had been closed for a long time as Gupta and his wife had gone to Pune and Chennai to visit their children.When they reached home and unlocked the door, they found the flat ransacked and cash and goods worth Rs 2.5 lakh missing. It is suspected that the burglars entered the house through the balcony.Another burglary was reported in the society on June 21. Residents claimed that the burglars had a similar modus operandi in that case.On Saturday, the protesters put a lock on the builder’s office in the morning, which was removed in the evening, though the protest went on till late in the evening.Anuradha Sharma, a resident, said, “We have been raising the issue of safety and security with the developer for a long time now, but no concrete steps have been taken from their side so far. Moreover, the society does not have a resident welfare association as yet.”SHO (Kavi Nagar) Raj Kumar Sharma met the residents and assured them of proper action in the case. Sharma said police patrolling would be conducted inside the society as well. “CCTV footage has been collected to identify the culprits in both the cases,” he said.
