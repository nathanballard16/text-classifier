Nepal on Wednesday formally protested over the inclusion of the region of Kalapani in the new political map of India. A press release by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Nepal said Kathmandu is committed to protect Nepal's territorial integrity.

"Nepal is clear that Kalapani is a part of Nepali territory. We are committed to protect the international boundaries of Nepal and for that we have diplomatic dialogue with friendly nations," Nepali foreign ministry said.

The latest political map of India reiterated the Indian claims on the region that Nepal says belongs to its westernmost part. India claims the historic region as part of the state of Uttarakhand.
