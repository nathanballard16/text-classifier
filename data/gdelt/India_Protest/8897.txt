APDP holds protest sit in against enforced disappearances

SRINAGAR, Jun 10: Scores of men and women of the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP) held a sit-in protest here against ‘enforced disappearances’ of their relatives.

Holding placards and photographs of their relatives, who disappeared in 90s from the state, the APDP members assembled demanded to know their whereabouts. “The victim families will not stop, till they get their disappeared children back,” APDP chairperson Parveena Ahanger said.

Speaking during the protest, Parveena Ahangar, chairperson APDP, reiterated the demand for ratification of international convention for protection of all persons from enforced disappearances. “In a situation where India has not ratified the international convention for protection of all persons from enforced disappearances and the vagueness of India’s domestic law that does not enumerate enforced disappearance as an offense, the challenges in pursuing legal struggle is insurmountable,” she said.

Parveena added that the ratification will help to bring out the special nature and circumstances in which such crimes are perpetrated and will make more evident the multiple rights that are violated as a result of an enforced disappearance. “We also demand that law on enforced disappearance be passed by the Jammu and Kashmir legislature so that the vagueness and ambiguity in the Indian domestic penal provisions can be overcome and the perpetrators could be prosecuted,” she said.

APDP has been documenting the cases and had been active to bring the issue of enforced disappearances to the public; it is a counter-movement against the forgetfulness,” the chairperson said.
