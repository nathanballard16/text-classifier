According to a TOI report, the state government transferred Maths teacher, Mangal Deen Patel, who was posted at government high school, in Dinarkheda village of Katni district.

Mangal Deen Patel was among 30,000 teachers who are being transferred across the state. The teachers were being transferred as a part of government's redeployment to maintain a teacher-student ratio in schools.

After learning about the transfer, the school students started crying and hugging him. In the video that's going viral, Pandey is also seen getting emotional but at the same time, he tries desperately to console the kids bawling their eyes out.

In the video, the students can be seen holding on to the teacher as they refuse to let go of him.

A similar incident that took place last year in Tamil Nadu when students staged a protest during the transfer of their favourite English teacher, G Bhagwan. When the government decided to transfer 28-year-old G Bhagawan students locked the gate and refused to let him go.
