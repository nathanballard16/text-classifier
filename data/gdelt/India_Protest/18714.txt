In Howrah, BJP holds protest against lack of civic amenties, rise in dengue

The BJP workers on Monday protested near the office of Howrah Municipal Corporation (HMC), alleging mismanagement on part of the civic body in providing basic amenities and tackling dengue, which claimed many lives in the city this year.

During the protest, a scuffle broke out between the protesters and police, as the latter tried to stop them near the corporation. The BJP alleged that police even resorted to lathicharge, in which three of their supporters were injured.

Denying the charge, police claimed the protesters, instead, pelted them with stones.

According to sources, the BJP workers and supporters took out the protest rally from Panchanantala under the leadership of district leaders Sanjay Singh and Surojit Saha. When the rally reached near the corporation they were stopped by the police. Several barricades were put up to block the BJP supporters.

The protesters alleged that the condition of roads, drinking water facilities and drainage system is not good in Howrah. “Several persons have already died due to dengue, but the situation remains same,” said a protester.

Attributing this to “mismanagement”, the party alleged that even after the expiry of the Howrah Municipal Board term in 2018, no fresh elections have been conducted till date.

The BJP workers also burnt an effigy of Mayor and state minister Firhad Hakim.

Police said the situation was under control.

Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on November 19 had confirmed 23 deaths due to the vector-borne disease in West Bengal this year.

“So far 23 people have died of dengue… As the nature of the virus has changed, we are having outbreaks of dengue in the past few years instead of malaria,” the Chief Minister had said, addressing an administrative meeting in Malda district.
