Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari distributes masks as protest against AAP govt on air quality

New Delhi [India], October 13 (ANI): Delhi BJP president Manoj Tiwari on Sunday protested against Delhi government over the current air quality in the capital by distributing pollution masks at Connaught Place.

Criticising Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's decision of distributing masks, Manoj Tiwari said, "It is okay if the opposition party distributes these masks but if the government which has all the funds to control pollution, still have to distribute masks, then that government is an enemy of the people."

Last month, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had said that the Delhi government was planning to procure N-95 anti-pollution masks on a large scale to tackle bad air quality.

"Even in 5 years, AAP government failed to control pollution in Delhi. Forget about controlling pollution, they have only been adding to it," Tiwari said.

The Bharatiya Janata Party MP said that they will be distributing about one lakh masks in Delhi over the next 15 days.

Tiwari further accused Delhi Chief Minister of lying on the issue of stubble burning in Haryana.

"Arvind Kejriwal is lying. Haryana government has already started buying stubble. In fact, they are even generating power from it. He should show me one place where stubble is being burnt in Haryana," Tiwari stated.

He also criticised the Delhi Government's decision to implement the odd-even scheme and urged the government to improve public transport facilities. (ANI)
