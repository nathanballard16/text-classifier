BJP leader slated for wearing army uniform during election rally

NEW DELHI: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Manoj Tiwari addressed a party rally wearing military fatigues in New Delhi on Saturday, drawing accusations of trying to cash in on the recent aerial face-off between India and Pakistan at a time when the country was gearing up for the Lok Sabha polls, Indian media reported.

Among the first to target the BJP lawmaker on social media was Trinamool leader Derek O'Brien, who accused him of politicising an incident that had Indian Air Force pilots putting their lives on the line. "Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. Manoj Tewari BJP MP and Delhi President wearing Armed Forces uniform and seeking votes. BJP-Modi-Shah insulting and politicising our jawans. And then giving lectures on patriotism. Low life," he tweeted.

BJP Delhi chief Tiwari was addressing the Delhi leg of BJP's Vijay Sankalp bike rally, which had party members taking to the streets in an effort to connect with the people ahead of the polls.

National Conference leader Omar Abdullah also posted a photograph of Tiwari addressing BJP supporters in the military jacket, along with a caption that read: "And senior BJP leaders including the Hon PM want to lecture the opposition about politicising the recent military action. Go figure!"

Artiste-turned-Congress leader Sharmistha Mukherjee said that Tiwari's act was nothing short of a political stunt. "Utterly disgusting & disgraceful! A soldier sacrifices his life to uphold the dignity & honour of this uniform. And BJP MP @ManojTiwariMP is turning it into Tamasha resorting to cheap stunts & cheaper politics," she tweeted.
