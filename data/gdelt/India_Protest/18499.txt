Mumbai: Veteranjournalist Nilkanthwho passed away on Friday, would be remembered for his fearless front-page editorials in '' (New Era), a popular daily owned by his family.Khadilkar was 86. He breathed his last at Lilavati Hospital around 1.20 am.Khadilkar was one of the few editors who stuck his neck out to criticise latesupremoand the 'anti-labour' policies of a belligerent Shivin the 1980s and 90s."Such was the power of his pen that even governments had to pay heed to his point," said Narendra Wable, President ofMarathi Patrakar Sangh.Khadilkar was popularly called as 'Nilubhau' by successive generations of journalists in Mumbai.Recalling Khadilkar's dare of Thackeray, seniorRam Pawar, said, "Following the exit of heavy-weight leader Sudhakar Lone from the Shiv Sena (in the late 1980s), Navakal had published a cartoon of the Tiger (Sena's symbol) with a severed tail. However, Thackeray hit back by drawing a cartoon in his magazine, 'Marmik', showing the tiger slapping Khadilkar, with a caption 'the power of the tiger lies in its claws, not in the tail'.Stating that Khadilkar was critical of the actions and decisions of the Shiv Sena in his writings, Wagle says, "He shared an excellent personal rapport with Thackeray. The late Sena founder had once called him to his popular Dasara rally at Girgaum as the chief guest."Khadilkar took over the reins of Navakal from his father. The newspaper was founded by his late grandfather Kakasaheb (KP) Khadilkar a century ago.In fact, workers in the erstwhile textile mills spread across Central Mumbai constituted the bulk of its readership as it highlighted labour issues prominently.Khadilkar was also the President of Marathi Patrakar Sangh and remained its trustee until some years ago. After editing 'Navakal' for over four decades, he was editing his eveninger 'Sandhyakaal' of late, despite being bound to a wheelchair.Khadilkar is survived by his daughters Vasanti, Jayashree and Rohini-- the famous chess prodigies- Khadilkar sisters. While Jayashree now edits Navakal, Rohini edits Sandhyakaal from the press at Shendewadi in Girgaum. Vasanti looks after the management of the newspapers."His passing away has left a void in Marathi journalism," Wable said.
