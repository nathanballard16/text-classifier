Over two dozen students held from Maitighar during demonstration

KATHMANDU, Nov 10: Over two dozen students affiliated with the student wing of the Chand-led Nepal Communist Party were arrested from Maitighar Mandal on Sunday when they were a staging demonstration against Nepali territory encroachment by India.

The arrested students have been kept at Nepal Police Club, Exhibition Road. Dozens of students belonging to All Nepal National Free Students Union (Revolutionary) protested against a recently-released Indian political map that placed Nepali territory Kalapani inside Indian borders.

During their protest, the students also chanted slogans against the Oli-led government carrying placards.
