Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray who shook up the BJP-Shiv Sena with his video presentation-based rallies criticising Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the eve of the Lok Sabha elections here is yet to decide on campaigning elsewhere in the country.

MNS sources told reporters that parties were requesting for rallies by Thackeray in other states like Delhi, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, which go to the polls in the coming weeks.

“Rajsaheb has decided not to hold rallies elsewhere in the country,” MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande said.

Though Thackeray is known to hold a good command over Hindi and English, a section of the MNS believe that their leader holds forth best in Marathi and his speeches would lose their punch were he to

speak in Hindi.

Meanwhile, efforts are on by several political parties to get the MNS chief to change his mind about holding at least a few rallies, sources said.

Thackeray’s take-down of Prime Minister Modi’s election promises have been a big hit on social media and translations and subtitled versions of his speeches have been shared across the country.
