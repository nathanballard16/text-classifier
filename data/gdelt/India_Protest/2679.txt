Imphal, Feb. 9 (EMN): More than 3000 women vendors of Ima keithel, Imphal joined the ongoing mass agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill on Saturday, demanding a written assurance from the state government that the Bill will not affect Manipur and other north-eastern states.

As the group decided to continue the agitation, a large number of womenfolk were seen sitting on the market road till late evening.

T Rani, one of the women vendor activists, said: “The government should issue a written assurance to the effect that when enacted the Bill shall not affect the people of the north-eastern states.”

However, spokesperson of the BJP-led state government P Saratchandra said: “The Citizenship Act was passed by the Centre in 1955 to save the people in some countries from religious persecutions.”

Several protests against the Bill are being held in the north-eastern states ever since it was passed by the Lok Sabha on January 8. It is still awaiting the nod of the Rajya Sabha.

There are reports of launching mass agitation at various places in the state.

Students’ organisations in Manipur have been organising widespread protest against the Bill in the state since the last few weeks. The students’ body also joined the North East Students’ Organisation (NESO) team in Delhi to meet the national leaders on the issue.
