In a bind, Congress turns to late Rajiv Gandhi for help

Hoping to revive Congress’ dwindling fortunes, party president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday turned to her late husband former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi as she hit out at the Centre by accusing it of creating an atmosphere of fear.

“Rajiv Gandhi came to power in 1984 but he never used powers to create an atmosphere of fear or to destroy the freedom and liberty of the people. He never used his power to put the principles of democracy in danger,” she said kick starting year long celebrations to commemorate the 75th birth anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi.

Her refrain comes at a time when Congress veteran leader and former finance minister P Chidambaram has been sent to CBI custody for four days on money laundering charges in INX Media case.

Already facing crisis in its ranks, the Congress went on the offensive by accusing the Centre of using the CBI and ED as a personal “revenge-seeking departments”.

“The vindictive, selective and malicious manner in which former finance and home minister Chidambaram has been persecuted and prosecuted is nothing short of a brazen personal and political vendetta,” said Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala in a press conference.

“Over the last two days India witnessed the broad daylight murder of democracy and the rule of law by a government hell-bent upon using CBI and ED as personal revenge seeking departments for the party in power,” he charged.

Leader of the Congress in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury also criticised the BJP government for pursuing vendetta politics against the party’s leaders and said the former union minister was arrested as he was a vocal critic of the BJP government.

Congress workers also held protests in West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh against Chidambaram’s arrest. In various parts of West Bengal, party workers staged road and blockades and organised rallies on Thursday.
