Pulwama attack: India looking at something very strong against Pakistan, says Donald Trump

Washington : Amid tension between India and Pakistan after deadly Pulwama attack on the CRPF personnel in Srinagar, Donald Trump tagged the situation as intense and said India will soon be taking some big action against its neighbouring nation.

Talking to reporters in Washington, Donald Trump said, "There’s a terrible thing going on right now between Pakistan and India. It's a very very bad situation and it is a dangerous situation between the two countries. We would like to see it stop. Lot of people were just killed."

He added, "India is looking at something very strong. India just lost almost 50 people. A lot of people are talking. But it's a very very delicate balance going on. Right now there's a lot of problem b/w India&Pakistan because of what just happened in Kashmir. It's very dangerous."

On February 14, Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed had attacked a convoy of CRPF personnel in Pulwama, Srinagar; at least 40 soldiers were martyred in the attack.

Meanwhile, Indians residing in the United States protested outside Pakistan embassy, demanding action against the culprits.
