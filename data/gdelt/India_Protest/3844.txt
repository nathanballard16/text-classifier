Protester dies, 2 hurt in Arunachal police firing; Army called in

ITANAGAR: The Army was called in on Saturday in the Arunachal capital as clashes over the government-appointed panel’s recommendation to grant Permanent Residence Certificates (PRCs) to six non-Arunachali communities spiralled out of control. One person was killed and two others injured in police firing late on Friday night here during protests. Police personnel were injured too.Protesters clashed with police through the night and as the violence escalated, the Itanagar district administration imposed prohibitory orders on Friday night, effective until further notice, and suspended internet services. On Saturday, the Army staged a flag march through Naharlagun and other violence-hit areas of the city.CM Pema Khandu said at the bottom of this is a “misconception”. “People had a misconception that government is bringing a bill to grant PRC (to the six communities), but I’m clarifying that there was no plan . We only wanted to have a wider discussion on this in the House,” he said, adding, “I appeal to people not to participate in violence and stay in their homes at night.”
