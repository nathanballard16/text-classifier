Over 100 detained as Indian police ban protests against new citizenship law

NEW DELHI (AP) - Police detained more than 100 protesters in key Indian cities on Thursday (Dec 19) as they defied a ban on protests that the authorities hoped would stop widespread demonstrations against a new citizenship law.

Dozens of demonstrations were to take place around the country as opposition grows to the new citizenship law that excludes Muslims. The law has sparked anger at what many see as the government's push to bring India closer to a Hindu state and which opponents say threatens the secular nature of Indian democracy.

Historian Ramchandra Guha, a biographer of India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, was among those detained in Bangalore, the capital of southern Karnataka state.

When reached by the phone, Mr Guha said he was on a bus with other detainees and did not know where the police were taking them.

In New Delhi, Mr Yogendra Yadav, the chief of the Swaraj India party, was among those detained as protesters said they would go ahead with a demonstration at New Delhi's iconic Red Fort and surrounding historic district.

Officials said more than 100 people were detained at the fort. Police could be seen dragging women protesters to a staging area behind the fort.

The protesters were loaded into buses and other vehicles. It was not clear where they were taken by the police.

The main roads leading to the fort were blocked by the police and they were not letting pedestrians go to nearby temples or shopping areas.

Internet service was blocked around the fort and in some other parts of New Delhi, a tactic the authorities are known to use in other parts of the country, such as disputed Kashmir, to try to stop protests from being organised. Such tactics are rare for the capital.
