Blindfolded, hundreds of citizens take to the streets to raise awareness

Hundreds of people gathered at St. Joseph’s School on Thursday evening to take part in the Bangalore BlindWalk to mark World Sight Day, observed on October 10. Similar events were organised Project Vision in 227 locations across five countries.

People donned blindfolds and took to the streets of Bengaluru, led by those who were visually impaired with the aim of promoting eye donation and creating more awareness.

Jayant Kumar, Founding Member of Project Vision, said, “Being visually challenged myself, I wanted to start a movement for people to realise the need for people to donate eyes. I started a four-pronged project in 2012 which included providing eye care, eye donation movement, setting up hospitals and rehabilitation camps.”

For participants, it was an opportunity to understand some of the challenges the visually impaired face in a city where pedestrian infrastructure is poor.

Uma Francis, a volunteer and participant in the walk says, “By participating in the walk we get to experience how it feels to rely on other senses in the absence of the ability to see.”

According to Project Vision, only 68,409 people donated their eyes in the past year while India has 15 million people who are blind. In Karnataka, the figure is 5,561.

The event was organised with the support of non-governmental organisations and institutions like Samarthanam, Rotary Abilities, St. Joseph’s College, and AIFO, among others.
