Chennai: As Tamil Nadu has been reeling under severe water crisis, the residents are irked with inadequate water supply for the past three months. Villagers near Madurantakkam district on Friday staged a protest and detained a government bus between the Selaiyur and Madurtanakam area.

The village where the protest began was Thachur, which hold upto 500 families. The villagers use borewells as the primary source of water but due to the decline of the groundwater table, two borewells among the five overhead water tanks failed. Meanwhile, the remaining three tanks are non-functioning due to a technical snag. The villagers were

devoid of drinking water as well.

According to a report in the Deccan Chronicle, the villagers were upset after officials kept ignoring their requests to supply adequate drinking water. Due to zero water supply, the inhabitants used to travel another 1km to Anaikattu village for fulfilling their basic water needs.

But on Friday, the villagers were infuriated by the apathy of officials and around 100 villagers with empty pots blocked a government bus to mark the protest against the authorities.

The Anaikattu police and the Madurantakam police reportedly rushed to the spot and held talks with the protesters. Reportedly, the villagers ended their protest after two hours as the police and revenue officials promised to resolve the drinking water issue.

However, the officials also arranged water tankers so that the villagers could use them.
