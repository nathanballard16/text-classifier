Ludhiana: The residents of Vishal Colony in ward number 5 sat went on a protest against the choked sewerage system in the locality. The residents on Sunday morning protested against the civic officials as well as the leaders who, they alleged, have turned apathetic towards their woes. Meanwhile, the MC officials claimed that they will begin the cleaning work by Monday.The residents were adamant that they will not end the protest unless the sewerage choking is cleared. MLA Sanjay Talwar sent a few Congress leaders in the area for pacifying the protesters.The residents had also gone to meet the MLA Sanjay Talwar and Congress MP Ravneet Bittu while he was in the area falling under ward number 4. The residents protested after they were denied a meeting with the MP. The residents complained that almost every month, the sewerage gets choked at least once and despite several complaints, the MC authorities do not clear the choking. They also added that due to the continuous choking of the sewerage lines, several residents are facing health-related problems.While describing the problems in the area, Harish Kumar said it has become difficult for them to reside in such a locality where sewerage remains choked all the time.Questioning the preparedness of the civic authorities, another resident Kuldeep Singh said there are high chances that an epidemic-like situation will be created in the coming days if the choked sewerage is not cleaned.Meanwhile, ex-Congress councillor Varinder Sehgal who reached the locality shared that they have asked the MC officials to clear the choked sewerage. He added that with the help of super suction machines, the problem of choked sewerage lines will be resolved.The executive engineer of operation and maintenance cell Pardeep Saluja said staff will be deployed on Monday to take care of the matter.
