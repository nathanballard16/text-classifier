Protest by Dalit association at Jantar Mantar on March 31

MYSURU: In a bid to lend voice to the longstanding problems of their community, members of the All India SC/ST and Minority Labourers’ Welfare Association will hold a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi on March 31.The president of the association N Hanumanthappa on Friday said that the activists would also raise issues pertaining to increase in crimes against women, unemployment, etc. “Both the state and central governments have failed to provide 33% reservation for women in assemblies and the Lok Sabha. Although there are many women scholars and rationalists, why is it that popular actresses are allotted cabinet berths?” he asked.Questioning the discrepancy in Reservation at the Centre and in Karnataka, Hanumanthappa said, “At the Centre, Reservation for Dalits is at 7.5%, whereas it is a mere 3% in Karnataka. It is imperative that 7.5% Reservation be extended to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in Karnataka too. While 10% Reservation has been extended to upper castes from economically weaker sections, those still struggling to get into the mainstream are accorded just 8%.”Hanumanthappa also demanded stringent action against those targeting Dalits and members of religious minorities under the garb of cow protection. “The central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has failed to create jobs. Even those with PhDs are working as second-division employees,” he said.
