Amid row, Akbaruddin Owaisi says he didn’t hurt any group

Hyderabad: MIM Chandrayangutta legislator Akbaruddin Owaisi on Friday claimed that he did not make any offensive or illegal statement while delivering his speech in Karimnagar on July 23. This clarification comes against the backdrop of resentment showed by various sections of society on his recalling the “15 minutes” remark made by him in 2013.

Mr Owaisi said in Karimnagar that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) was “still scared” of the “15 minutes” remark. In 2013, Mr Owaisi had said, “We (Muslims) are 25 crores and they are 100 crores in population. Remove the police for just 15 minutes and see how the numbers turn out after that.” This sparked anger in sections of Hindus and complaints were lodged against him in many places.

The reference to this statement on Tuesday rekindled the anger. In Karimnagar and Adilabad districts, BJP workers demonstrated against Mr Owaisi and a Bajrang Dal activist filed a complaint against him.

Mr Owaisi clarified that he did not make any offensive or illegal statement nor hurt the feelings of any community. “Some persons with an ulterior motive for their political gain were adding words and creating different meanings as per their own desire and imagination,” he said.
