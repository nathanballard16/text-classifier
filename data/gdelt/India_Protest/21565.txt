CAA Protest Updates: 21 injured, 5 detained in Seelampur in Delhi

Violence no solution to any problem, says Vice President Naidu

Stressing on the ongoing protests in the country over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, (CAA), Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu has said that violence is not the solution to any problem.

"There shouldn't be any obstruction or destruction, everybody should focus on construction. And our attitudes must change after all we are in free India, our own India. If you are destroying, means you are destroying the nation's wealth," he said at an event here on Monday.

"The other day some public transport has been destroyed. Who are the losers? It's the people and the country. So, while agitating for our cause, one must be systematic. It shouldn't become destructive. Violence is no solution," he added.
