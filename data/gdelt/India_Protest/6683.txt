CM fooled state’s youth over smart phones: BJYM

Ludhiana: Making a scathing attack on Congress chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh for failing to deliver smart phones to the youth, Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) members held a protest on Friday in Aarti Cinema chowk. The protest was led by BJP leader Kamal Chatly and BJYM president Mahesh Sharma. In the protest, BJYM workers made commuters aware about the hollow promises made by Congress during the assembly elections. While enacting a satire on the hollow promises of Congress, BJYM workers held a smart phone in one hand, and a baby rattle toy in another hand.

BJYM district president Mahesh Sharma said: “The Punjab CM betrayed the state’s youth, as during the assembly election, Congress had assured them that smart phones would be given to them immediately after coming to power. Captain Amarinder fooled the youth just to gain their votes.” He asserted that the CM had launched the smart phone dummy along with Congress MLAs, but nothing happened on the ground. Sharma also alleged that even the promise of giving government jobs to one member of every family in Punjab failed to see any results.

Chatly said: “Congress has been making hollow promises during every elections, but it failed to fulfil any of them, and this is a kind of betrayal of the youth. People of Punjab are angry with the Congress government, and the party will have to face the consequences in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections.”
