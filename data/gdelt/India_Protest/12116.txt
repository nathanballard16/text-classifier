India arrests hundreds of Kashmiri academics, activists and politicians

A total communications block remains in place in Indian Kashmir, with mobile networks and the internet cut off for days

More than 500 people have been arrested and scores of opposition politicians have been detained in Indian-controlled Kashmir as the government steps up a sweeping crackdown on dissent after imposing direct rule on the disputed Himalayan region.

Academics, business leaders and activists were among hundreds seized during overnight raids in the capital, Srinagar, and throughout the region. Opposition politicians were detained at the airport and a total communications blackout remains in place, with mobile networks and the internet cut off for days.
