Legal Affairs Secretary to head committee on insurance scheme for lawyers

New Delhi, March 8 : The government on Friday set up a five member committee headed by Legal Affairs Secretary Alok Srivastava to examine issues related to framing of a structured scheme for providing insurance cover to advocates.

The committee would also suggest modalities for the implementation of such a scheme and would submit its report within three months, the government said.

The other members of the committee would include a senior representative from the Department of Financial Services and a representative from the Department of Legal Affairs. The committee will also have one representative each from the Bar Council of India and the State Bar Councils, an official statement said.

Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad directed that the committee shall recommend a comprehensive insurance scheme for the welfare of advocates all over India to address concerns relating to untimely death and medical insurance.

The committee may take the opinion of all stakeholders including the representatives of the insurance companies to devise the proposed scheme, the statement said.

Earlier this month, a delegation of lawyers, which included members of the Bar Council of India and office bearers of various Advocates Associations, met Prasad in connection with their concerns and demands.

Prasad said that the scheme may include assistance from central and state governments as also the involvement of State Bar Councils and the representatives operating the lawyers welfare fund.
