Narendra Modi likely to start another round of war of words against Pakistan: Ashok Swain.

NEW DELHI (Dunya News) – Indian journalist and professor Ashok Swain has claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is most likely to start another round of war of words against Pakistan if protests against Citizenship Amendment Act continue till next week.

Ashok Swain also expressed concerns in his tweet that we are most likely to see a terror attack taking place in Kashmir if the demonstrations persist.

If the protests against #CitizenshipAmendmentAct continue and spread in mainland India till next week, we are most likely to see a terror attack taking place in #Kashmir and Modi starting another round of war of words against Pakistan! — Ashok Swain (@ashoswai) December 18, 2019

He further added, “What India is experiencing today, it is only a small fraction of what Kashmir has been getting since 5 August! But, some have just managed to discover that India is no more a democracy under Modi-Sha!”

“Modi government has intensified a crackdown on largely peaceful mass protests against the flawed Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and its bigoted twin the National Register of Citizens (NRC).”
