NLS students protest over admin possibly stacking EC against Sudhir vote with BCI members

The students of NLSIU Bangalore have started a protest today, abstaining from classes all day, after learning that its interim administration is (probably) planning to reshuffle the Executive Council (EC), potentially to oppose the swift appointment of new vice chancellor (VC) Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy.

The word on campus is that the administration is intending to not invite the three special invitee Supreme Court judges to the next EC meeting scheduled for 28 September.

Instead the number of Bar Council of India (BCI) members on the EC would be increased from 7 to 8.

We have not been able to authoritatively confirm the full invite list to the next EC, and NLSIU registrar Prof OV Nandimath has not responded to requests for comments.

However, Nandimath had also not denied messages seeking comments on the above allegation.

We have also sent an email to acting vice chancellor Prof MK Ramesh requesting comment.

The SBA had sent an email to students yesterday, with the subject “Emergency GBM! Protest from Tomorrow!”:
