COIMBATORE: Roiled by the recent controversies, a central government school in Sulur on Friday issued transfer certificates to two siblings studying in classes XI and IX. Based on a complaint from the Class XI boy, a case under Pocso Act was registered by the Sulur police against the principal and three teachers of the school for sexually harassing him.The school authorities pasted the copies of the TCs on the main gate of the school. Original copies of the TCs were sent through registered post to boys’ home. However, the two students entered the school premises on Friday morning, prompting sit-in by students of classes XI and IX. Teachers also supported the students’ protest against the presence of siblings on the school premises. Later, the father of the boys, a junior warrant officer at the IAF, Sulur, visited the school and took his wards home around 11am.
