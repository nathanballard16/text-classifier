Muslim women protest against Saamana over burqa ban demand

Hundreds of Muslim women protested against the Shiv Sena mouthpiece 'Saamana' at Mumbra near here Friday for demanding that India should ban burqa.

Most of the women were wearing burqa or veil themselves.

The Saamana editorial Wednesday said that India should follow the suit of neighboring Sri Lanka and ban burqa for security reasons. The Shiv Sena later said it was not its official stand.

The protesters shouted slogans against Saamana editor Sanjay Raut and carried placards with message 'Samvidan Bachao, Desh Bachao' (save the Constitution, save the country).
