As it happened: India-Pakistan fears rise amid military escalation

It's been very difficult today for everyone, journalists included, to separate fact from fiction.

This hasn't been helped by a whirlpool of misinformation on social media.

Pakistan's government earlier released footage of the captured Indian fighter pilot on Twitter, with the video being shared far and wide.

But several accounts claimed there was also video of a second Indian pilot being captured. A Facebook page circulated this supposed video and it has been shared more than 29,000 times. It has also been retweeted hundreds of times on Twitter.

The footage is fake.The original footage of an injured airman was filmed last week when two Indian Air Force (IAF) planes collided in mid-air during a rehearsal for an air show in Bangalore.

Various Twitter accounts and some Pakistani news sites have also used an image of a crashed IAF jet for their coverage, suggesting the picture was taken on Wednesday in Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

But the original picture was actually taken in 2016 when a fighter plane crashed into a building in the Indian city of Jodhpur.

In the hours immediately after news of the air clashes broke, other media outlets published old images from a plane crash in India's Orissa state in 2015.

They claimed the pictures showed an Indian fighter jet shot down by Pakistani forces.
