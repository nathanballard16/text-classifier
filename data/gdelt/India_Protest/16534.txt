Bittu warns SAD, other parties; asks them to not spread ‘gundagardi’

Ludhiana: Tempers ran high in Dakha constituency where byelections will be held on Monday. Member of Parliament from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu, in a series of Facebook videos, gave a warning to both Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and other parties to desist from “gundagardi”.

Bittu said if this “gundagardi” was not stopped then Congress workers would not even let the representatives of other parties come out of their homes.

Speaking on his Facebook live, he said: “These people are creating environment of fear by damaging our cars and threatening our workers. I dare Ayali that if he has guts, MLA Kulbir Zira is coming to his home and he should come out and face him.”

Bittu also accused Lok Insaaf Party candidate Sukhdev Singh Chak of attacking Congress workers and said: “Chak’s supporters came to Boparai Kalan village and beat up our supporters and villagers. I want to warn Chakk sahib that our workers are not wearing bangles and we are standing here. If they do this again they will be given a befitting reply.”

Meanwhile, SAD candidate Manpreet Singh Ayali said: “It is hilarious that the party whose leaders from all over Punjab are camping here in Dakha are trying to use violence, money, liquor and all sorts of tactics and are blaming us for the same. The reality is that everyone right from Congress leader of mohalla level is roaming scot free in Dakha and instilling fear among voters just to be in the good books of chief minister Amarinder Singh. But unfortunately, the reality is the other way round and they have now realised that none of their tactics is going to work. Moreover if Bittu, Zira or anyone thinks that they will scare me or any of SAD workers and supporters, they are wrong.”
