Two dead in protests after India passes religion-based citizenship law

But protesters in India’s northeastern Assam state weren’t mad about the exclusion of Muslims when they set an official’s house on fire, vandalized railroad stations and burned down a post office, according to Reuters. The protesters are upset because they think the bill will lead to a flood of immigrants in the region. Police answered back with tear gas and gunfire while the government shut down the internet in the state.
