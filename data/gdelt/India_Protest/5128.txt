Pollachi abuse case: Shops, hotels shut in protest

Chennai, March 19 : Shops and hotels downed their shutters in Pollachi on Tuesday in protest against the sexual abuse-cum-blackmail case that hit the Tamil Nadu town.

"It is an apolitical protest demanding punishment to all the culprits. Almost all the shops have downed their shutters as people of the town are shocked at the sordid episode. There may be one or two shops open here and there," K. Mahalingam, Taluk Secretary of the CPM told IANS from Pollachi.

He said permission for a rally slated for Tuesday was denied.

Mahalingam also demanded a fresh probe into the suicides of girls that happened during the last seven years.

Echoing him was R. Ganesh, District Secretary (South) of Pattali Makkal Katchi party.

"All the shops are shut except pharmacies. Couple of vegetable shops selling perishables are open but they too will be closed soon. Autorickshaws too are not plying."

The picturesque Pollachi part of Coimbatore district is located about 543 km from here.

Four persons -- Thirunavukkarasu, Sathish, Sabarirajan and Vasanthakumar -- all in their 20s, have been accused of sexually assaulting women in Pollachi and filming the act to blackmail them for money or for physical submission for over seven years.
