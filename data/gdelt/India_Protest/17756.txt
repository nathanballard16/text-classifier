Baba ji took the term #GodiMedia literally, says Twitterati

NEW DELHI: A clip of Yoga guru Baba Ramdev lifting Republic Media Network’s Editor-in-Chief Arnab Goswami effortlessly off the floor to “prove his strength” has surfaced online.

As the Ayodhya verdict dominated Hindi news channels, Baba Ramdev too appeared for the first time on Goswami’s Hindi channel ‘Republic Bharat‘ on Sunday to comment on the judgement.

Ramdev, after demonstrating a number of yoga postures towards the end of the show, lifted the journalist Goswami in his arms.

The incident evokes sharp reaction on social media. Here are some:
