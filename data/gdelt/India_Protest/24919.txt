Home Minister blames Oppn for ‘misleading, instigating citizens’.Accusing the Opposition of misleading people and instigatingagainst the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, Union Home Ministeron Thursday asked voters in Delhi to ‘punish the tukde-tukde gang’ in the upcoming assembly elections.Addressing a gathering after laying the foundation stone ofHub — the country’s first transit-oriented development project, he trained his guns at the Congress and the Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP. Assembly polls are due in the national capital early next year. “The opposition led by the Congress created confusion about the Citizenship Amendment Bill (now an Act). Delhi saw people coming out on streets over it and the peaceful atmosphere of Delhi was spoiled after a long time,” Shah said.Exuding confidence about BJP’s performance in the coming polls, he said the time is up for the Kejriwal government in Delhi and “the lotus will bloom” here too.“Should you not choose a government that will bring peace to Delhi? When the CAB was discussed in Parliament, no one was ready to say anything... They started spreading confusion over it later and disturbed Delhi’s peace. The Congress-led tukde-tukde gang, who are responsible for this, time has come to punish them, people of Delhi should punish them,” he said, in an apparent reference to the Left-leaning intellectuals opposing the amended citizenship law.Several students ofwere injured as police entered their campus and lathi-charged them after protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in South Delhi turned violent on December 15.Violence broke out in Darya Ganj on December 20, when a group of protesters agitating against the Citizenship Amendment Act resorted to stone-pelting after police tried to forcefully evict them. In the melee, one car was set on fire and several vehicles were damaged.Taking on Chief Minister Kejriwal, he said the AAP dispensation has obstructed Centre’s schemes and urged people to choose a government in next election that will ensure peace in Delhi.“Kejriwal has not implemented the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana and Ayushman Bharat. All he only wants is to put his own name on our pet projects,” Shah said.“Delhi, you gave (us) all seven BJP MPs, now time to give BJP MLAs (a chance) in the next polls for development of the national capital,” Shah, also the BJP president, said.
