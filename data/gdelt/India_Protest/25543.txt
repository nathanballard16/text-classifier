‘Won’t tolerate edu institutions turning into politicking hubs’

KOLKATA: As anti-citizenship law protests in various universities showed no signs of stopping, Union human resource development minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on Sunday said the government will not tolerate educational institutions turning into hubs of politicking “at any cost”.He said that anyone is free to engage in political activities, but colleges and universities should be kept out of it, as many students come to study from far-off places. “The Modi government is not going to tolerate this at any cost,” he asserted.Scores of students from universities across the country, including Jawaharlal Nehru University, Jamia Millia Islamia , Delhi University, Jadavpur University and Presidency University, have been protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA). Pokhriyal accused the opposition parties of deliberately spreading misinformation over the CAA.“It is Congress, which is responsible for the country’s division on religious grounds, that is spreading misinformation about CAA,” he said.Taking a swipe at West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for opposing CAA, the minister said the TMC supremo was the one to protest against illegal immigration in the state in 2005. “She had vociferously demanded the Citizenship Amendment Bill back then,” Pokhriyal said.
