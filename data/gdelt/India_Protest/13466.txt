Pakistanis Rally in Islamabad to Show Support for Kashmir

Thousands of Pakistanis took to the streets of Islamabad on August 30 to take part in an organized “Solidarity Hour” with the restive Indian-administered region of Kashmir.

The rally involved numerous groups of Pakistanis chanting their support of Kashmir and the Kashmiri people. They held Pakistani and Kashmiri flags as they walked through the streets of Islamabad and stood chanting in front of the Pakistani Stock Exchange. Local media reported that the national anthems of Pakistan and Kashmir were played.

Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, led the rally and tweeted shortly afterwards that he was “so proud of our people in the way they came out today in solidarity with the Kashmiris.”

Tensions have been building between Pakistan and India regarding Kashmir since August 5 when India revoked the region’s special constitutional status. There has been a communications blackout in the region and Indian troops have been deployed. The countries both claim full control of the Muslim-majority region and have been feuding over ownership for the past six decades. Credit: Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty via Storyful
