Ex-official's app plumbs borewells, finds out water level

BENGALURU: A former director of Karnataka 's drought-monitoring cell has developed an app that will help farmers assess water level in their borewells.'Know your borewell', being improvised by VS Prakash, who is also the former registrar of International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIIT-B), is linked with an electric sensor that is to be installed 20m above the submersible water pump to get real-time data about water level in a well.The app provides details on the characteristics of the well and aquifers and helps assess its condition and the groundwater table. "Monitoring helps us in having better assessment, development and management of groundwater. Unfortunately, we do not have such information currently and people are using groundwater indiscriminately," said Prakash, former founder director of Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre."The health of a borewell does not depend on how much water you want to pump, but on the capacity of the aquifer and how wisely you extract groundwater. What is happening today is once they stop getting water from a borewell, farmers believe it is not working. They drill more borewells which also subsequently fail or over pump them and burn the motor," he added."Every borewell beneficiary needs to have an understanding of its depth to the groundwater level; changes in the groundwater table due to pumping from that well or a nearby one, or to know how much water to draw," he said.The sensor measures the depth of water in a well every 10 seconds. Utilising the data from several borewells in an area could help in micro-management of groundwater. While the sensor is already placed in a borewell at Prakash's HSR Layout house, another 20 will soon be installed in farmers' borewells across the state.
