HYDERABAD: A woman from the Kalri Nizamani village on Tuesday gave birth to a daughter, who, shortly afterwards, died, hospital officials confirmed.



The woman, Shahida, was brought from Kalri Nizamani to tehsil headquarters (THQ) hospital in Hala, Matiari — a town located 30KM north of Hyderabad — for delivery.



According to Medical Superintendent (MS) Dr Anwar Soomro, the woman went to the bathroom where she suddenly gave birth to the little girl. Unfortunately, however, the baby died afterwards.

The bereaved family of the late newborn, consequently, staged a protest against what they said was the hospital's incompetency for the birth in the bathroom and the child's death. They demanded action against the alleged negligence of the medical facility's staff.
