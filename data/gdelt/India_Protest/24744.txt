Digvijaya responds to Army Chief on CAA violence

New Delhi, Dec 26 (IANS) Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat's comments on the anti-CAA protests have led to the latest twist in the war of words over the controversial law.

General Rawat took a dig at the protests with his tweet on Thursday, which read: "Leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions, as we are witnessing in a large number of universities and college students...the way they are leading masses of crowds to carry out arson and violence in our cities and towns. This is not leadership."
