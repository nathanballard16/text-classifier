Youth must stay away from agitation: Assam CM

GUWAHATI: With Assam caught in a series of protests, largely led by students, against the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB), Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said that youth must stay away from agitations.Students waved black flags in Guwahati, while Sonowal was on his way to his official residence. Earlier in the day, protestors waved black flag while Sonowal attended a program in Koliabor.Student leader turned politican, Sonowal while laying the foundation stone of a double-lane flyover on the Guwahati-Shillong (GS) Road, said, "The young generation of the state must endeavour to put Assam strongly at the world stage with hardwork, dedication, honesty and sincerity and they must not (waste) away the most productive time of their lives in movements and agitations. Building a robust work culture in the state should be the prime objective of everyone and youths must not be misled to join agitations based on concocted and baseless grounds”, he asserted.Assuring the people that the present state Government, which was formed by indigenous people of the state, would not do anything to jeopardise the identity of the Assamese race, Sonowal urged the youth to follow the motto of ‘work is worship and duty is god’, and devote their time and energy in achieving excellence in all fields as the world has become very competitive. Positive change in the society would not come through agitations and movements but it would come through hardwork and dedication as demonstrated by the State Government in the last three and half years, he remarked.Public works department Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma asserted that after a long time Assam was going through a sustained period of peace and development and some forces inimical to the state’s interest were trying to create rifts between different communities and stall the development initiatives of the government.He urged the people not to allow these forces to succeed, as Assam witnessed lots of agitations and movements in the last 40-50 years which kept the state underdeveloped.On Sunday, protestors vandalised the office of Margherita BJP MLA Bhaskar Sharma and blocked the highway.Earlier, the state Government had asked the Headmaster of the school to ensure that students do not participate in the protest during school hours in school uniform.Meanwhile Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) has launched an house to house awareness campaign to generate views of CAB.APCC president Ripun Bora said the party has started reaching out to intellectuals and civil society groups to discuss the CAB. "We have and will continue to oppose CAB".Pro-talk group Ulfa, which is in ceasefire with the government of India, went on a hunger strike in Guwahati on Sunday. Ulfa leader Anup Chetia said the situation in Assam is similar to the days of Assam agitation (1979-1985).Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was also shown the black flag. Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) office in Dibrugarh was vandalised.AGP President Atul Bora was also targeted.
