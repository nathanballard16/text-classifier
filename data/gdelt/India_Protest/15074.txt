Sharad Pawar drops plan to visit ED office over cooperative bank scam case

Two days after announcing that he would be voluntarily visiting the Enforcement Directorate’s office in Mumbai to clear the air about a purported cooperative bank scam in which he has been named, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar on Friday cancelled his visit.

“I was informed by the ED that I am not required to come... and in order to maintain law and order in the city, I have decided not to go to the ED office,” Mr. Pawar said outside his residence in Mumbai.

Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Barve visited Mr. Pawar earlier in the day requested him not to visit the ED office as it may create a law and order situation. “I had been Home Minister in the past and do not want to disturb peace in the city and affect daily lives of people,” Mr. Pawar added.

Mr. Pawar thanked his party workers, ally Congress and its leaders Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi for their support. Mr. Pawar also thanked Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut, who had spoken in favour of him.

“I will be going to Pune, Baramati and Purandar areas, which was affected by floods and will monitor rescue work,” Mr. Pawar said.

Mr. Pawar’s decision would have given relief to the Mumbai Police, which had increased the security near Mulund since morning.

The workers of NCP and Congress were starting to gather outside ED office and Mr. Pawar’s residence since morning.
