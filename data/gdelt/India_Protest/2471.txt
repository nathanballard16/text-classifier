New Delhi, February 6

The Rajya Sabha continued to remain paralysed for the third straight day, as Samajwadi Party, BSP and RJD members created ruckus raising issues relating to changes in the appointment procedure for the university teachers and the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.

The House witnessed two adjournments before the proceedings were completely washed out. As soon as the House resumed at 2 pm, RJD, SP, BSP and TMC members trooped into the well protesting over various issues, including the introduction of roster system in higher educational institutions which they claim limits the scope of reservation for jobs.

The roster system provides that vacancies are considered according to department or wing in a college or university and not total number of posts available for recruitment in any institution. This results in limited seats available for recruitment by each department or wing under reserved categories.

Deputy Chairman Harivansh asked protesting members in the well to return to their seats. However, they did not relent. The Chair then requested SP leader Ramgopal Yadav to end the protest as he will be given a chance to speak during the Zero Hour. He said the government had deviated from its promise made on the issue. Minister Vijay Goel tried to pacify Yadav, but the protest continued. — TNS
