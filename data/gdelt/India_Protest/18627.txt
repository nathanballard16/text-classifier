Education cannot have a religion: UP Deputy CM Dr Dinesh Sharma

The Banaras Hindu University (BHU) is currently hogging the media headlines for appointing a Muslim professor Dr Firoz Khan to teach Sanskrit. This has infuriated the students who have been holding protests in Varanasi and other places in Uttar Pradesh claiming that a Muslim cannot teach Sanskrit.

Talking to India Today on this subject, Uttar Pradesh's Deputy Chief Minister Dr Dinesh Sharma said that education does not have a religion and a teacher cannot be viewed as per his religion or caste. He said that the students have the right to oppose a University appointment if they have some grievances about the appointment of a teacher on the basis of his qualifications, but not on the basis of his caste or religion.

Sharma said that he will go to Varanasi and talk to the students in BHU on this subject. He said that he himself was taught Sanskrit by a Muslim teacher and there was nothing objectionable in it.

The Deputy chief minister was in Agra to attend the national convention of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP). He said that ABVP is the world's largest student organization and this event was all about nationalism and discipline among the students. He himself started his political career through this organization and even today this organization is working towards giving leaders to India.

Asked about the rampant corruption in the Agra Municipal Corporation, Dr. Sharma said that he had read about the letters written by two ministers in India Today and this matter is being handled by the Minister of Urban Development.

Speaking on the issue of JNU students, he said that students who dishonor Swami Vivekanand could not be innocent. Action should be taken against the students who damaged the Vivekanand statue.
