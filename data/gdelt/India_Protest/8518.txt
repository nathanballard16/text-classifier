Failed Students Protest against BSEB; Clash with Police in Patna

Patna: It has almost become customary to have a protest rally and clash with the police after the declaration of each exam in Bihar. Thursday was no exception when hundreds of angry students, after flunking the Bihar School Examination Board (BSEB) Class XII exams, took to the streets of Patna alleging massive irregularity in the result while demanding re-evaluation of their test papers.

Chanting disparaging slogans against Bihar Education Minister Krishna Nandan Prasad Verma and BSEB chairperson Anand Kishore, protestors tried to break open the iron gate of the BSEB office.

When the police tried to stop them from storming the building, an all-out riot ensued as failed students, their parents and guardians pelted stones and other objects on the law enforcement officials.

Reacting forcefully, police ordered lathi-charge on the protesters and chased them away with batons to clear the area and allow normal traffic to resume.

Though better than the results of last year, almost half of the examinees across Bihar (47%) were declared fail in this year's exam.

Later, Kishore said that students who think their marks do not reflect their expectations then they could appeal for a second evaluation by filling out a form that is available on BSEB's website.

"They can fill out the form between June 9 and 16. This form is available on the BSEB's website or students can obtain it from the local BSEB offices in Patna, Gaya, Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur, Munger, Purnia, Chhapra and Saharsa. A group of teachers will re-evaluate the papers and if any anomaly or discrepancy is found, they would be properly corrected and the student would be duly notified," Kishore said.
