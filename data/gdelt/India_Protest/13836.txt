Popular Front Chairman E. Abubacker will preside over the function. Those who will address the convention include members of parliament, political party leaders, community leaders and civil rights activists.

The press release of PFI says, within just three months, the new government at the centre has shown that it is determined to implement the core Hindutva agenda at any cost. They were not bothered about democracy, constitution, and parliamentary procedures while making draconian changes in UAPA, NIA, RTI, etc. The controversial Triple Talaq law is also an act of discrimination against Muslims. Now the government is fully armed with powers to suppress all voices of dissent by declaring not only organizations but individuals also as terrorists.

The religious minorities are further threatened with announcements of implementing nationwide NRC, anti-conversion law and uniform civil code. The religious minorities and weaker sections, particularly Muslims are being kept under fear and insecurity.

The objective of this convention is to unite people in their endeavours for protecting fundamental rights and maintain an atmosphere free from fear and hatred.

The Popular Font next plans a grand public gathering in Delhi on 29th Sep 2019 called “People’s Rights Conference”.
