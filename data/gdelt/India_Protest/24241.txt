Arvind Kejriwal hopes to cash in, RJD eyes lift in Bihar

NEW DELHI: Coming in the midst of bitter protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act and the prospect of a pan-India National Register of Citizens, the opposition is hopeful that BJP’s loss in Jharkhand will further dent the saffron juggernaut’s air of invincibility.Jharkhand, the fifth state BJP has conceded to the opposition in the last 15 months, is also crucial because it comes close on the heels of the Delhi assembly polls, due early next year.While BJP is expected to go back to the drawing board over its electoral strategies, a resurgent opposition, especially Congress, AAP, RJD and TMC, are likely to double their efforts to limit the saffron party’s expansion plans in states like Bihar — due for election in 2020 — and Bengal, where Mamata Banerjee has led a pitched battle against BJP.In Delhi, where polls are likely in February, the shadow of violent protests over CAA-NRC and the police action in university campuses is likely to hang over BJP’s poll prospects. While Congress is expected to keep up its attack on PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah , AAP, with its focus on Delhi’s development issues, will hope that the increasing “negative” perception of BJP will boost the party’s prospects and help it win a second term in office.RJD’s single seat tally in Jharkhand must be disappointing for the party but it will hope for an electoral turnaround in Bihar. The party has already said that the Jharkhand outcome will be a ‘prelude’ to Bihar, which borders Jharkhand. In Bengal, TMC has led a loud and bitter campaign against the Modi government which is likely to gain momentum with the Jharkhand verdict.The BJP camp, however, has maintained that on the basis of vote share, it remains the largest party in both Jharkhand and Maharashtra, and it recaptured Haryana in alliance with the Dushyant Chautala-led Jannayak Janata Party.
