Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) has demanded action against officials of Shahpur depot of Northeastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), holding them as responsible for a bus accident in which three people, including the bus driver, were killed and 10 people were injured near Yevur village in Shahpur taluk recently.

SDPI workers, who staged a protest in Shahpur on Wednesday, claimed the bus had clocked 10 lakh km and officials continued to operate it in spite of this, leading to the accident.

The protesters claimed that 70 such buses were still operating and that officials were threatening drivers who refuse to drive such buses with notice. They demanded stern action against such officials.
