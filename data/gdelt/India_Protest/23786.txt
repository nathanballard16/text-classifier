Watch | Massive Crowd at Delhi's Jama Masjid, Bhim Army Chief Escapes Arrest

Following this afternoon’s namaaz, thousands gathered at Delhi’s historic Jama Masjid to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the proposed all-India National Register of Citizens (NRC)

Last night, news began circulating that Dalit rights leader Chandra Shekhar Aazad would be holding a protest at the 17th-century mosque. This morning, there were rumours that Aazad had already been arrested before the protest could begin.

At around 11 am, Aazad tweeted: “Don’t listen to news that I have been arrested. I am reaching Jama Masjid.”

True to his word, he reached the mosque and was identifiable in a blue jacket. At that time, people were filing into the mosque for prayers. As they were leaving the mosque, at around 1 pm, Aazad emerged on the steps of the mosque, took off his jacket, held up a copy of the constitution and amid loud cheers, addressed the crowd.

Several thousands had gathered around him, rendering his voice inaudible.

Soon, police made a move to detain the Ambedkarite leader, and a dramatic chase sequence followed where Aazad escaped amidst the thronging crowds.

According to an Indian Express reporter, “He ran from house to house and jumped over terraces to avoid getting caught.”
