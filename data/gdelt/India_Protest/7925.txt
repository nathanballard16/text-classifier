PM Modi to hold rallies in West Bengal

In order to woo the voters for the last time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday gave a final push to poll campaigning in West Bengal for which the Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi held rally in Mathurapur at around 4.30 pm and is scheduled to hold a rally at Dum Dum at 6:10 pm.

The poll campaigning in West Bengal will begin its silence period on Thursday night, a day before its scheduled deadline in view of the augmented violence in Kolkata recently.

“This would be the first time when EC has invoked Article 324 in this manner but it may not be the last in cases of repetition of lawlessness and violence which vitiate the conduct of polls in a peaceful and orderly manner,” remarked Deputy Election Commissioner Chandra Bhushan Kumar.

The nine constituencies are scheduled to undergo polling in the last phase of Lok Sabha elections on May 19.
