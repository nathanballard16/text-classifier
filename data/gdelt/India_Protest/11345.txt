Noida: Firm’s director first to be held in Bike Yatra scam

NOIDA: Following protests by over 100 investors, Noida police has made its first arrest in the multi-crore scam by Mapple Innovative Promoters (MIP) under its “Bike Yatra” scheme.The director of the firm, Rajesh Khantwal , was arrested on Saturday from Kotdwar in Uttarakhand, police said, adding that he had diverted the investors’ money for buying different properties, including a Rs 3.5 crore plot near the upcoming Jewar airport.As news of the arrest reached investors, scores of them gathered outside Sector 58 police station and demanded that the cops produce Khantwal before them. The investors claimed that police had on Saturday denied any arrest, but confirmed it on Sunday.The protesters held aloft cheques they had received from the company between June and August this year. Shamshul Haque, one of the investors, said the accused had issued a cheque for Rs 21 lakh in January, which was supposed to be returns for investing in “Bike Yatra”.“The cheques were issued in anticipation of money. We were promised that our money would be given back to us soon after the company gets its returns from its resources,” he said.Police have, however, found that though the company had around 5,000 investors in various schemes, it had bought only 10 bikes so far.“None of the bikes was on road. The accused had recently bought a 1,500 square yard plot near the upcoming Jewar airport worth around Rs 3.5 crore while the rest of the money was invested in other projects. So far, two bank accounts of the company have come to the fore, having transactions of Rs 25-26 crore. One of them had a transaction of Rs 11 lakh,” SP (city) Vineet Jaiswal said.After the arrest of Khantwal, a BCom graduate and former accountant, the investors demanded that the remaining accused, including co-owner Nitin Tyagi and director of e-saarthi (MIP Cabs was later renamed e-saarthi) Kapil Dhama, be nabbed too.“Both are residents of Ghaziabad and when we visited their houses, we were told that they are not in town. We suspect they may be around,” said Ravi, one of the investors.The investors have also met the SP (city) with their demands.
