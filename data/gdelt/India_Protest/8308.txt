Jamshedpur: An opinion that was voiced two years ago, brought back horrors for a teacher. A Facebook created a lot of trouble for the government school teacher. Jeetrai Hansda was arrested for posting his opinion in favour of beef party, two years after the actual incident.

The teacher was arrested because his post was deemed as 'objectionable'. Not only this, Hansda was also booked under several sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the IT Act because of favouring the beef party. The accused employed as a contractual faculty member at the Jamshedpur Co-operative College.

A resident of Parsudih, the teacher had penned down his support towards a beef party conducted by students of IIT Madras. Little did Hansda realise that he had angered another group of students, the members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vishwa Parishad (ABVP). The student wing of the RSS, ABVP lodged a complaint against the teacher. The teacher was accused of evading arrest.

The students at IIT Madras had organised the party to oppose the restriction put on cattle trade. After reading the post, the ABVP had initially demanded sacking of the teacher after which, the police was also deleted.

While talking to the news agency, PTI, Vice Chancellor of the Kolhan University, Shukla Mohanty stated that the accused was a guest faculty member of the Graduate School College for Women when he had made the infamous post. Hansda was later employed as a contractual faculty member at the college. Mohanty also stated that Hansda had apologised for the Facebook post after receiving a show-cause notice.
