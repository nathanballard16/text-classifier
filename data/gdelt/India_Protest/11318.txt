The family earlier identified the body as their child, but later refused. We have kept the body in the civil hospital for 72 hours. We are looking into all the possible theories. We have conducted a search at numerous places and the NDRF team has been called to carry out a search in a village pond.”Notably, the police have filed a complaint on the national tracking system for missing and vulnerable children and also issued an alert under which all the station house officers in the country have been requested to inform about missing children.Later, Preneet Kaur , MP, Patiala also met the parents of the missing children and assured them of tracing their children soon.
