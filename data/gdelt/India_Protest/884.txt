Opinion : The Modi government’s new affirmative action plan is absurd and unworkable

Seventy years on, not just has political reservation of seats not been phased out — quotas have been reduced to the worst sort of competitive populism. The constant expansion of the affirmative action policy to a wider and wider base has diluted the historicity of the prejudice that Indian Dalits and Adivasis have faced. A new blow came this week from the Narendra Modi government, which announced a 10 percent quota in government jobs and educational institutions for those who are “economically weak” and not entitled to reservations. Nearly 50 percent of positions in government-run higher educational institutions, public sector companies and government services are “reserved” or kept aside for candidates from caste groups that are seen to be marginalized or disadvantaged.
