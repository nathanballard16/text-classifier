Congress alleges a conspiracy to make peace-loving Arunachal Pradesh ‘second Kashmir’

New Delhi: The Congress on Monday alleged that law and order has collapsed in Arunachal Pradesh and demanded the immediate sacking of Chief Minister Pema Khandu, his deputy Chowna Mein and Union minister Kiren Rijiju. It also sought an inquiry by a sitting high court judge into the firing on “unarmed protesters” in the state.

Asking the central government to act immediately to control the situation, the Congress warned that Arunachal Pradesh “should not be made into another Jammu and Kashmir”.

Congress leaders Luizinho Faleiro, Nabam Tuki and Takam Sanjoy held Chief Minister Khandu and Rijiju responsible for the volatile situation arising out of protests on the issue of permanent residence certificates (PRCs) in the state and alleged that there was a complete collapse of law and order in Arunachal Pradesh.

It must be noted that violent protests broke out in Arunachal Pradesh, where assembly elections are due in April-May, over recommendations of granting PRCs to six communities.

Indian Express has quoted Faleiro as saying, “Why are you wanting to make Arunachal Pradesh into second Kashmir…. Don’t try to make Northeast into another Jammu and Kashmir. We have enough problems already….Don’t play with the sentiments of the people of Northeast.”
