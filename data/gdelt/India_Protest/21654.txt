Congress Party to hold Bharat Bachao demonstrations at overseas

Indian Overseas Congress (IOC) will organise a series of protests under the banner of 'Bharat Bachao' outside the Indian embassies across the world to highlight the problem of unemployment, slump in economy, and distressed farmers in the country on December 14.

These protests will coincide with Congress Party's rally at Ram Leela Maidan in the national capital on Saturday against farmer distress.

Sam Pitroda, a close confidant of Rahul Gandhi and head of the IOC will supervise these protests.

"Globally IOC units will be conducting a demonstration in front of the Indian Embassy/ Consulates to show our strength and solidarity to Bharat Bachao Rally in Delhi. So far, eight such demonstrations have been planned on Saturday," said IOC Chairman Sam Pitroda.

Protest meetings will be held at Indian Consulate in New York and Hamburg, Indian High Commission in London and Dublin.

The protest meetings are also planned in Sydney, Oman, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand.

"Sam Pitroda is supervising these protests to highlight the growing frustration among India diaspora settled overseas," told Secretary of IOC Virendra Vashishtha told India Today TV.

"The slump in the Indian economy and the falling value of the rupee is hurting the interests of millions of Indians due to wrong policies of the Modi Government. Our demonstrations will be peaceful to send out a meaningful message across," said Virendra Vashishtha.
