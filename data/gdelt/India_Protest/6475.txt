Vandalisation Of Ambedkar Statue: V Hanumantha Rao Arrested For Staging Dharna

Hyderabad: Senior Congress Leader and former PCC president V Hanumantha Rao staged a Dharna on Sunday protesting against the removal of BR Ambedkar’s statue near Panjagutta Circle in the city.

The Civic staff prevented the installation of a life-size statue of BR Ambedkar, a day ahead of his 128th birth anniversary since permission was not sought for the installation. The Ambedkar statue was allegedly carried in a garbage truck and found damaged which triggered protests by some Dalit organisations.

Two people including the truck driver was arrested on Sunday while the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) ordered an internal inquiry into the incident.

Meanwhile, Congress leader Hanumantha Rao took to protests in this regard. Describing the removal of Ambedkar’s statue as unfortunate, he along with several protestors held a Dharna on Sunday at Panjagutta X roads. However, he was arrested by the police along with several others and shifted to Amberpet Police Station. The police later released all of them.
