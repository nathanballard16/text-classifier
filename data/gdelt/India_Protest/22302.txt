Cops entered library, unleashed violence against unsuspecting students, alleges JMI

New Delhi: Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) in a five-page report submitted to the Union human resource development ministry has alleged that police personnel entered the old and new library buildings and unleashed violence against unsuspecting students who were studying there.The JMI executive council’s December 16 resolution seeking a highlevel/judicial inquiry into the Sunday’s events is also part of the report, which says that administration is planning to file an FIR over the incident. The administration has attached a list of affected/injured students who were hospitalised and those who were detained by Delhi Police and later released in the wee hours of December 16. In its submission, the university has recounted the events of Sunday on how amid protests outside the campus, policemen allegedly barged in without permission while reportedly ‘chasing’ some persons. The university has also sought medical assistance for students injured during the police action on campus and has demanded measures to protect campus access through the construction of a flyover/bypass at the main entry point.The ministry, it is learnt, will respond to the JMI communication and assess the demand for a high-level inquiry only after the Delhi High Court ’s instructions. An official said: “While the ministry has taken cognisance of university’s demand for an inquiry, it may have to wait for some time as high court is hearing the matter.” Before filing an FIR, the university administration is making an assessment of the damage on the campus premises. Vice Chancellor Najma Akhtar had told ET on Monday: “If the police had taken us into confidence, we would have ourselves cooperated with them. My objection is to them entering the campus without permission and inflicting such trauma on our student community. This is what we will also say in our report to the ministry.”
