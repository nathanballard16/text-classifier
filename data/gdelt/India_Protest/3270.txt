The 'Shah of Polls' at Conclave

BJP national president Amit Shah will attend the India Today Conclave in New Delhi, to be held on March 1 and 2.

He will speak at the session 'War Diaries: Victories. Defeats. And Notes From A Democratic Battlefield.' Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already confirmed his participation at the flagship event of the India Today Group, that assumes enormous significance as it comes just months before a crucial general election.

The Prime Minister is likely to speak on the 'India Story' under him -- the triumphs, challenges and future goals, apart from the battle plans for 2019. Every word the he utters at the India Today Conclave will be ingested, analysed and dissected as it comes at a juncture when 'choices' need to be made.

Appropriately enough, the theme of this year's India Today Conclave is 'Hard Choices'.

In the last year of this decade, also the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi, the country has to decide between continuing with a party whose message of 'Achche Din' enthused vast swathes of India to vote for it in 2014, and a group of strong federal powers who think the DNA of the nation is being tampered with.

Apart from the prime minister and Shah, a galaxy of eminent speakers would be addressing the Conclave. These include former British foreign secretary and Conservative Party leader Boris Johnson, Deputy Chief Minister of Rajasthan Sachin Pilot, former Union Finance Minister P Chidambaram, MP and former Union minister Kapil Sibal, Lok Sabha MPs Shashi Tharoor and Jyotiraditya Scindia, and National vice-president of BJP Vinay Sahasrabuddhe.
