Police on Tuesday detained Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) Bank depositors who were protesting outside the RBI office in Mumbai's Bandra Kurla Complex against Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman.

Nirmala Sitharaman is a chief guest at an event in NSE (National Stock Exchange) building in the complex.

The protesters gathered at the spot at 11 am and started raising slogans demanding they be allowed to withdraw money from their accounts above the limit prescribed by the Supreme Court, an official said.

At least nine protesters were taken into custody, he said.

In September, RBI had imposed restrictions on the withdrawal limit of the account-holders after it found alleged irregularities to the tune of Rs 4,355 crore.

Five persons, including HDIL promoters Rakesh and Sarang Wadhwan, were arrested by the police in the case.

Several protests have been held by the depositors since September.

At least seven depositors have died since the alleged scam came to light.
