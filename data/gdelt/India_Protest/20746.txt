Citizenship Amendment Act: India made Bangladesh happy in this way

New Delhi: The security of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission has been tightened in view of the ongoing protests against the Citizens Amendment Act. The governments of Tripura and Assam have tightened the security of Bangladesh Auxiliary High Commissions. Officials in Guwahati and Agartala have said that security at the offices of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission has been beefed up and additional security forces have been deployed around the two political building complexes.

On the other hand, Bangladesh media has reported that Acting Foreign Secretary Qamarul Ahsan held a meeting with Indian High Commissioner of Bangladesh Rewa Ganguly Das at the Ministry of External Affairs in Dhaka and urged the host government to protect building personnel and properties. The media quoted Bangladesh Foreign Ministry officials as saying that Rewa Ganguly assured that officials related to the Government of India were being alerted to enhance the security of the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission office and residential complex in Guwahati.

However, since the passing of the Citizenship Amendment bill, these violent protests that began at the beginning of the week have been declining and the situation is slowly returning to normal. Things are changing in Assam, while Tripura, Mizoram, Manipur, Meghalaya and other northeastern states are almost normal.
