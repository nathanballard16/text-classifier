Residents stage protest

Residents of Kalimangalam near Alandurai staged a protest on Thursday against the construction works undertaken by Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) there. The residents said the works were carried out close to the forest areas near Kalimangalam and that the area was frequented by elephants, leopards and deer.

The construction of nearly 600 houses would affect the agricultural activities in the areas. R. Kannadas, one of the residents who participated in the protest, said that a petition regarding this issue was submitted to the Collector, District Forest Officer and the Tahsildar, but there had been no response for more than 15 days.

The protest was called off after officials from the Perur taluk accepted the petition, he said. When contacted, a TNSCB official refused to comment on the issue. On Monday, V. Loganathan of the Vellingiri Hill Tribal Protection Society filed a public interest litigation in the Madras High Court to stop TNSCB from constructing buildings near the forest ranges.
