DK praises Justice Tahilramani

Dravidar Kazhagam president K. Veeramani on Sunday congratulated Madras High Court Chief Justice Vijaya Tahilramani for resigning in protest against her transfer to Meghalaya High Court and displaying ‘self-respect’.

In a statement, Mr. Veeramani said that Justice Tahilramani’s decision to quit was a bold one. “The transfer of judges creates a lot of issues in hearing of cases. This (procedure related to transfer by collegium) should be amended in the Constitution itself,” he said.

Mr. Veeramani recalled how former judge Justice M.M. Ismail had also resigned in protest against transfer to High Courts in other States.
