Activists from civil society groups, faculty members of educational institutions including the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) Ahmedabad, trade union leaders and students gathered at the site for staging a demonstration around 5 pm. “They were detained as the police had denied permission for the protest,” inspector H M Vyas of Gujarat University police station said.

The activists had sought permission to hold protest on a footpath between the gates of Kanoria Centre for Arts and Amdavad-ni-Gufa. The permission was not given for fear that it may create a law and order problem and disturb the traffic, the officer said. They were taken to the University police station and released, he added.
