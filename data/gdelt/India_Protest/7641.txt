Bengaluru: Vidhana Soudha police on Friday detained three persons of a family, including a class nine student for attempting to immolate themselves in front of Vidhana Soudha.

On Friday morning the family – Ashwatha Reddy, a farmer from Ragehalli, his wife Nagarathna and their son Sanjay Reddy protested in front of the Vidhana Soudha, demanding justice in connection with a 10-year-old case involving a senior retired official from the forest department.

As they threatened to immolate themselves, the security personnel posted stopped them and later handed over to the police.

During the questioning, Reddy said he and four others had sustained injuries in a mishap that took place when the former Assistant Conservator of Forest had ordered for cutting of a big tree near Bannerghatta without proper sanction. He said that one of the workers succumbed a few days later.

The incident had taken place 10 years ago and the ACF had promised to compensate them but had not kept his word. Hence out of frustration his family decided to commit suicide in protest on the Vidhan Soudha premises.

A case of attempt to suicide was registered against Reddy and his family.
