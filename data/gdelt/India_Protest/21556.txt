Jamia Violence: No bullets fired by Delhi Police at protersters, claims Home Ministry

New Delhi | Jagran News Desk: Two days after the violence at Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islami University during protests against the Citizenship Act, the Home Ministry officials on Tuesday said that no bullet was fired by police during the clashes.

The denial came amid allegations that Delhi Police personnel fired bullets on protesters during the agitation at JMI. Reports claimed that two students sustained bullet injuries and were admitted to Safdarjung Hospital.

The officials also said that 10 persons with criminal background have been detained in connection with the protests and more anti-social elements are being tracked.

"No bullet was fired by the Delhi Police during protests at Jamia.All 10 persons detained have criminal background. More anti-social elements are being tracked," the officials said, citing a Delhi Police report.

Several vehicles, including buses, were burnt down and public properties destroyed during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which was passed by Parliament last week.

On Monday, thousands of students across several universities of the country took to streets against the police crackdown with political parties also making their voices heard.

According to the Act, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan till December 31, 2014 and facing religious persecution there will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

The Act says refugees of six communities will be given Indian citizenship after residing in India for five years, instead of 11 years earlier.
