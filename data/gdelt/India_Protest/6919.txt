Students to resume protest over error in BCom exam paper

SURAT: In absence of an amicable solution by the authorities of Veer Narmad South Gujarat University (VNSGU) over the errors in BCom question paper, the aggrieved students plan to revive their agitation which was put on hold due to Lok Sabha elections.Students of third year BCom had protested at the VNSGU campus couple of weeks ago alleging serious errors in the management accountancy question paper of the sixth semester students. The students claimed that due to multiple errors many students were set to lose marks.Following the agitations VNSGU accepted errors in the question paper and offered relaxation. The university acknowledged that some questions had wrong figures. They also found that some questions were out of the syllabus, while a few were lengthy ones that could never be answered in limited time.University in an informal letter informed students that those who attempted those questions will be given full marks and some other relaxations were also announced.But the students are demanding that they be given more relaxations arguing that those who could not understand the erroneous questions, might have not attempted it at all.
