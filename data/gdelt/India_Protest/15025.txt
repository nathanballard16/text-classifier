Delhi Police catches thief who looted Rs 9 lakh from Central Bank customers at gunpoint

Delhi Police on Thursday caught one of the two robbers who looted around Rs 9 lakh from customers at a Central Bank's branch earlier in the day.

The incident took place at Farsh Bazar branch of the bank in East Delhi's Shahdara. The robbers entered the bank with firearms and looted Rs 8,89,000 from customers at gunpoint, before fleeing from the spot.

The police arrested one of the accused and recovered the entire loot money along with a country-made firearm with bullets and a knife. The motorcycle, used in the crime, has also been seized.

The preliminary inquiry has revealed the robbery was planned in Uttar Pradesh. The two accused had come to Delhi to commit the crime from Amroha.

They had boarded a train on the intervening night of September 24 and 25 but got off at Bhaita Railway station in Delhi's bordering area Loni. They spent the night there. Next day, they came to Delhi on a motorcycle to commit the crime.

It is, however, not known so far why they targetted Central Bank or that particular branch.

The accused, arrested by the police, has been identified as Vikas, a resident of Dhanora village in Uttar Pradesh's Amroha district.

Further investigation is on.
