The actor-turned-politician was campaigning for his party candidate P Sakthivel.Kamal started his campaign at 5pm from Thoppur, but his subsequent meetings at four spots — Periyar Nagar, Samanatham , Panaiyur and Chinthamani — were cancelled without prior announcement. He returned to campaign around 8pm at Villapuram where the cadres managed to gather a large crowd. There was a scuffle after a slipper was hurled around 8.30pm which fell on the crowd. Soon, a group of men started shouting slogans against the actor near his stage. Kamal looked unperturbed by the action and said, “we don’t have to worry about it, they (police) will take care of it,’’ and continued his speech.Police took away about ten people for questioning. Police sources said that the slipper had only fallen into the crowd and not on the stage or near Kamal Haasan.
