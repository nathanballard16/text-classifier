The protesters have come from different districts of Karnataka. The large group of protesters was to march to the Raj Bhawan to protest against Shivakumar's arrest in a money laundering case on September 3.

Moments after his arrest, Shivakumar wrote on Twitter, "I wholeheartedly thank leaders, supporters, well-wishers and friends who have organised a massive protest in my support tomorrow in Bengaluru. I humbly request that the protest be peaceful & doesn't cause any inconvenience to citizens. Please ensure public property isn't harmed."

However, protests have rocked Karnataka ever since the arrest with violence and clashes breaking in parts of the state.

A day after the arrest, Congress called for a statewide bandh in Karnataka that affected schools, colleges and normal life in many parts of the state.

Shops and business establishments by and large were closed in response to the bandh called by the local unit of the Congress and supported by its alliance partner in the previous coalition government - the JD(S).
