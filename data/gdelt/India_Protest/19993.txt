In Assam, students proceeded towards the state secretariat in large numbers, broke barricades and clashed with the police. The police resorted to lathi-charge and fired tear gas shells and rubber bullets at the demonstrators. In support of the same, students from Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) are holding a protest on their campus.
