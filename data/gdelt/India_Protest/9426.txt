Engaging in violence with doctors who are there to save lives isn't acceptable: Harsh Vardhan

New Delhi [India], June 17 (ANI): Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan on Monday said he was against violence on doctors and had conveyed the same to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other medical associations in a meeting in West Bengal.

"Being a doctor and health minister I have shared my views regularly with the doctors, Indian Medical Association (IMA) and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and other medical organisations.

Meanwhile, IMA held a pan-India doctors strike on Monday in solidarity with the doctors protesting in West Bengal. Healthcare services across the country continue to be disrupted due to the strike.

Talking about the deaths due to encephalitis in Bihar, Harsh Vardhan said the Centre wants to set up a specialized research unit in Bihar to find out the cause behind the disease and was going to send another specialized team to carry out the same.

"Our teams are already stationed there, I myself went there to meet the patients and doctors from AIIMS Patna to figure out the future course of action. We are again sending another team to research and find out the reason behind this strain of Encephalitis," Harshvardhan said.
