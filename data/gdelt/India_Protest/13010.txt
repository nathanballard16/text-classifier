Congress cadre stage protest

Cadre of the Congress staged demonstrations on Thursday in protest against the arrest of former Union Minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram.

About 200 Congress cadre, led by Sivaganga district president Sathyamoorthy and former MLAs Sundaram and Rajasekaran, blocked traffic in front the Periyar statue in Karaikudi and courted arrest. Shouting slogans against the BJP government at the Centre, they denounced the arrest saying it was a clear case of witch hunting and yet another example of the government misusing the central agency and Enforcement Directorate to settle political scores.

They condemned the CBI for scaling over the compound wall of Mr Chidambaram’s residence in Delhi when the leader returned to his house after addressing a press conference at party headquarters. When his petition for advanced bail was listed before the Supreme Court for Friday, the CBI had shown undue haste in arresting the leader, they said.

In Ramanathapuram, party men, led by Mudukulathur MLA S Pandi staged protest demonstration at the district headquarters. In the evening, party volunteers, on behalf of the town unit, staged protest and shouted slogans against the Centre and CBI for arresting Mr Chidambaram and demanded his immediate release.
