SFI activists attempt to stage protest at CEO’s office, held

COIMBATORE: Twenty members of the Students Federation of India ( SFI ), who tried to stage a protest in front of the Coimbatore Chief Education Office at Town Hall in the city, were detained by police on Thursday morning.The members, who started a march, wanted the government to protect government schools from being taken over by private organisations, regulate the fee structure of private schools and withdraw the new draft education policy. They also wanted the 25% reservation for students from economically weaker sections under the right to education Act to be implemented properly in private schools.Police personnel posted in front of the office denied them permission to hand over a memorandum to the chief education officer. Following this, a scuffle ensued. Police detained 20 SFI members, including seven girls.SFI members from the city had last month taken out a bicycle rally to Trichy where members from across the state had converged for a conference on protecting government schools and developing infrastructure.
