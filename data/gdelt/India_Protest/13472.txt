Supporters block road to save illegal Ashram

There was a bumper-to-bumper traffic on at least 20-kilometre of stretch during morning hours.

Mumbai: Traffic went for a toss on the busy Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway at Ghodbunder Friday morning after hundreds of followers of Sadanand Maharaj protested against the demolition of his illegal ashram, which is located inside the Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary.

There was a bumper-to-bumper traffic on at least 20-kilometre of stretch during morning hours. Movement of vehicles to and from Thane came to a standstill at Fountain Junction as the crowd quickly gathered at the place, which connects Thane, Mumbai and Virar.

Police officials said that the crowd squatted on the Mumbai-Ahmedabad highway to block traffic on the busy route.

“The protests blocked the traffic from the junction upto Gaimukh in the morning. The Thane city and rural traffic police started clearing the area after traffic was held up for some hours,” said a Thane traffic police officer.

While the traffic police began clearing the road for vehicular traffic, the reserve police force was despatched to control the situation and prevent any law and order problem. The police took the protestors into custody and they were released later.

The followers started protesting near the illegal ashram on Monday, even as the police continued to beef up its presence ahead of the demolition.

About three months ago, the Supreme Court had ordered demolition of the one-acre ashram citing environmental violations.

The demolition will continue as per the apex court’s order. Police presence will also continue, police officials said.
