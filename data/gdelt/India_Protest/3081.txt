However, no such aid has been released,” an anganwadi sevika said.The protest also saw overwhelming response to the demand for releasing pending Travelling Allowance (TA). Aurangabad: A large number of anganwadi workers from across the district staged an agitation on Wednesday to highlight various pending demands including revision of monthly honorarium and reforms in transfer policy.Standing united under the banner of Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC), over 2,000 people staged the protest outside Aurangabad zilla parishad. “The monthly honorarium of staffers is relatively low and they cannot afford expenses towards travelling far from their homes. “The government in the past had announced one-time retirement benefit of Rs1 lakh and Rs75,000 to anganwadi sevikas and assistants, respectively. There is a need to reform the existing anti-employee norms,” he said.Among other demands, protesters also raised the pitch for release of retirement benefits.
