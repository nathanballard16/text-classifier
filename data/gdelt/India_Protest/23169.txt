Pondicherry varsity students council to boycott convocation presided over by Prez Kovind

The Pondicherry University's student council on Friday said it will boycott the annual convocation, which will be presided over by President Ram Nath Kovind, to protest "state repression" against students.

The 27th annual convocation of the varsity is scheduled to take place on December 23.

The decision was taken to express solidarity with students across the country "facing state repression" and strongly protest against the implementation of unconstitutional legislations, a joint release by the council's president Parichay Yadav and secretary V Kuralanban stated.

It said the university's management had sought the cooperation of the council to facilitate holding of the convocation function.

The president is the Visitor of the university under provisions of the Central Act under which the varsity was set up in 1985.

The release said the management had asked the council to present names of students who would be volunteers. "But in the light of the ongoing protests against CAA (Citizenship (Amendment) Act) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) all over the country, the council refused to facilitate it and has decided to boycott the event," it said.

This is to mark the council's solidarity with students nationwide, currently facing state repression, the release said.

President Kovind will distribute the scrolls and deliver the convocation address on December 23.

Puducherry Lt Governor Kiran Bedi, Chief Minister V Narayanasamy, Members of Parliament from Puducherry V Vaithilingam and NGokulakrishnan and the University Vice Chancellor Gurmeet would be among those present at the convocation, a University release said.
