May Day: Alathur recollects the first protest of beedi labourers in Malabar region

Alathur: On International Labour Day, people in Alathur have a memoir that refreshes their minds; an account of a historic protest by beedi labourers in Alathur demanding a wage increase. What they all demanded for was an increment of half ‘anna’. Anna was a currency unit formerly used in India. One rupee comprises 16 annas. In 1930s, six anna was the wage for making 1000 beedies.

In those days, Alathur was the hub of beedi business in Malabar. There were three companies in Alathur; Pineapple Beedi, Poonaeli Beedi Company and Turkey Kodi Beedi Company. Demanding an increment of half anna, labourers of Pineapple Beedi Company sent a notice to owner Thambi Ravuthar.

Under the headship of Communist leader Alathur R Krishnan, ‘Alathur Beedi Thozhilali Union’ was formed. In the biography of R Krishnan titled ‘Veezhumalyude Thazhvarayil Ninnu’, it is said that even Congress supported the protest since the labour protest was part of Indian independence movement.

It was first protest by beedi labourers for wage increment in Malabar. Soon the protest turned volatile with daily picketing of company, police interference and so on. Later, owner Tambi Ravuther decided to dismiss 12 labourers after discussion. Those days, there were no labour laws and dismissed labourers wouldn’t get a job.

After discussions, Palakkad sub-collector Soraliyar put forward a recommendation. It said to begin a new beedi company by the 12 dismissed labourers with a share of Rs 10 each. Soraliyar gave the first share of the company. A S Muhammedkutty Sahib and R Krishnan collected a share of Rs 200 and began a company.

Later, when everyone decided to develop the company, one of the shareholder Uppi Sahib stepped back. Finally, A S Muhammedkutty Sahib mortgaged his property and bought the company for Rs 600 and registered it as ‘Apple Photo Beedi Company’.
