Chennai: Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president MK Stalin on Monday led a protest, calling for a solution to the acute water crisis in Chennai. As DMK supporters carried empty plastic pots in their hands as a mark of protest, Stalin attacked the Tamil Nadu's ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) government, blaming it for not working proactively when the lakes supplying water to Chennai started drying.

"The pot is here, but where is the water. The ruling government should solve the water crisis in the state. It has not done anything to resolve the issue," said Stalin.

"The one question being asked by people across Tamil Nadu is 'where is the water'? The AIADMK government has not completed any drinking water project in the state. Its party officials are holding yagnas in temples -- not for the rains, but to protect their own government," said Stalin.

If his party comes to power, the DMK chief has vowed an investigation into the irregularities in the ongoing desalination water project.

Meanwhile, Dayanidhi Maran, the DMK MP from Chennai Parliamentary constituency, said, "The city is out of the water and present Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edapadi Palanisamy blamed lack of rains behind the crisis."

Tamil Nadu has been facing acute water crisis for the past few months as Chennai's Porur Lake, one of the key sources of water, has reached its lowest level. Delayed monsoon has further aggravated the crisis.
