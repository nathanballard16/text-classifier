Hindutva groups using Pulwama attack to target Kashmiris and Muslims, says minorities panel

In the wake of killing of 49 CRPF men, the Delhi Commission for Minorities has raised the issue of right wing groups trying to incite hatred with the Delhi Police, The Wire report.

According to the report in a letter to commissioner Amulya Patnaik, the panel chairperson, Zafarul Islam Khan charged that there have been “attacks on Kashmiris, even on ordinary Muslims, in various parts of the country in the aftermath of the terrorist attack in Pulwama.”

Pointing out that “even in Delhi attempts are being made to vitiate the atmosphere and start riots,” Khan referred to the systematic manner in which these protests are being used to foment trouble.

“Hindutva crowds are taking out rallies in Muslim areas and in front of Muslim homes in mixed population areas, raising provocative slogans,” he said in a letter to the commissioner, demanding immediate action from the police.

Khan cautioned that “unless Delhi Police is alert and proactive, riots will erupt like those in Jammu city for instance.” He urged Patnaik to “order all police stations in Delhi to be alert, proactive and responsive to the need to keep peace and amity at all costs.”

In at least one locality of the capital, B.K. Dutt Colony, where a peaceful march was taken out by residents in memory of the slain CRPF men, The Wire’s reporter was witness to a handful of activists at the front shouting provocative communal slogans against “Babar ke auladon” – an anti-Muslim phrase popularised by the Hindutva groups during their campaign to demolish the Babri Masjid.

Incidentally, there have been sporadic incidents of violence and criminal intimidation that have been reported from across India.
