Patna: With the 2019 Lok Sabha elections getting closer by the passing of each day, opposition parties have begun to sharpen their claws against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cabinet as Congress leaders in Patna on Thursday took to the streets and burnt the effigy of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley amid news of him meeting with fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya just before he fled the country.

Led by Congress state chief Kaukab Qadri, party leaders and workers burnt the effigy of Jaitley at the busy Boring Road four-way intersection demanding the resignation of the Finance Minister.

"We have always known that Mallya had a dealing with Jaitley before fleeing the country. Now that the fugitive businessman has confirmed himself of meeting with the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader, he should be asked to resign from his post," Qadri said.

Those participating in today's effigy burning included former Congress state President Anil Kumar Sharma, Premchand Mishra, and Amita Bhushan, among others.
