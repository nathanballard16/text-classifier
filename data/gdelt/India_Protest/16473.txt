The TSRTC strike in Telangana completed 14 days and there are no signs of solutions found. Though the Telangana High Court asked the state government to initiate talks and solve the issue at the earliest, things of such sorts did not happen. TSRTC JAC called up for a state bandh today and the state came to a standstill all over. The intensity has been huge that several opposition parties, teacher unions, government officials, JACs, auto and cab unions came out to support TSRTC employees. The RTC buses had to be restricted to the depots after the RTC employees started protesting early in the morning all over the state.



The public transport crippled further in the state disrupting the lives of the people who depend on public transport. When it comes to Hyderabad city, MMTS and Metro will run in the city. The Gandhi Medical Hospital Doctors Association, the Cab Drivers' Association, State Taxi and Drivers Joint Action Committee, Auto Drivers Associations, Telangana Lecturers Joint Action Committee, the Telangana Deputy Collectors Association are participating in the bandh. Telangana government deployed cops in huge numbers to prevent any unexpected incidents.
