BJP plans Calcutta rally and ad blitz

Dilip Ghosh vowed to move court against Mamata Banerjee for opposing and refusing to implement the CAA

While state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh on Sunday announced that his party would bring out a “mega rally” in Calcutta on December 23 in support of the CAA and its implementation, Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said the Centre should carry out an extensive advertising campaign in Bengali.

The Bengal BJP is planning to counter the “propaganda” against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and allay the “confusion” among people over the new law.

“I had a talk with Union home minister Amit Shah, urging him to come up with an ad campaign against the Bengal government’s propaganda, as well as that of other political outfits who are misleading people over the CAA and its implementation,” Dasgupta told a news conference.

“He assured me that the Union government would launch extensive ad campaigns in Bengali in a couple of days,” added Dasgupta, a presidential nominee to the upper House.

At another news conference at the state BJP headquarters, Ghosh said rallies would be taken out in all 38 organisational districts of the party across the state to counter the “violent” anti-CAA protests since Saturday, for which he blamed “Bangladeshi infiltrators”. “We will hold a mega rally of one lakh people in Calcutta on December 23, after several rallies in the districts,” the Midnapore MP added.

Ghosh vowed to move court against chief minister Mamata Banerjee, accusing her of opposing and refusing to implement the CAA and the “spending taxpayers’ money by making statements opposing the CAA through state government ads”.

Modi briefed

A Bengal BJP team apprised Narendra Modi of the violence in the state over the CAA, during the Prime Minister’s brief stopover at Andal airport in West Burdwan on Sunday while going to Jharkhand to address an election rally.
