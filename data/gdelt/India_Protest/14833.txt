NLSIU protests called off after clarification on VC appointment by CJI Gogoi, Justice Bobde

Protests against the non-appointment of Prof Sudhir Krishnaswamy as the next VC of NLSIU began on Friday, when students decided to boycott classes. The sit-in protest was held in light of information that there was likely to be a change in the composition of the Executive Council (EC) of NLSIU, which would, in turn, have a bearing on the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor.
