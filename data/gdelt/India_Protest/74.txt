Efforts on to extradite 26/11 co-conspirator Tahawwur Hussain Rana from US: Govt tells Lok Sabha

Tahawwur Hussain Rana, long with David Headley, is accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

Ten years after the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, India may finally get David Coleman Headley's aide, Tahawwur Hussain Rana, to the country after years of persuading US prosecutors. In a written reply to a question on the extradition of the co-conspirators of 26/11 from the US, the Ministry of External Affairs told the Lok Sabha that a National Investigation Agency (NIA) team visited the US on December 13-15, 2018 to discuss the matter with American authorities.

The NIA has been pressing for Rana's extradition for years.





Tahawwur Hussain Rana, a former Pakistani Army doctor-turned-Chicago travel agent, is being held in federal prison for plotting overseas terror strikes. Rana, who along with Headley, is accused in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.

According to US and Indian law enforcement sources, Rana helped scout attack locations in India.

The NIA team to discuss the extradition was formed after the FBI invited the agency to the US to "resolve outstanding issues" in a letter to the NIA Director General.
