Opposition protests over min’s remark in assembly

Jaipur: The opposition BJP members stage dharna in the well of the House during Question Hour over tourism minister’s reply attributing motive behind a question.BJP MLA Kalicharan Saraf asked whether the govt plans to hand over the RTDC hotels to private operators.The minister replied in the negative. But Saraf said chief secretary held a meeting on this issue in April this year and the minister is misleading the House.The minister said that holding a meeting did not mean the government had taken a decision. A decision in this regard had to be taken by the cabinet and asked why he was asking this question. The Speaker then proceeded to the next question ignoring the objections by the opposition.Deputy leader of Opposition Rajendra Rathore and Kiran Maheshwari said the minister's comment attributing motive is objectionable, prompting other BJP MLAs too to join the issue.Maheshwari said, “If the ministers start attributing motive, it would difficult for the opposition members to raise questions in the assembly . The minister should clarify,” she demanded.Other BJP MLAs began shouting slogans against the government and stormed the well of the house demanding apology from the minister. The repeated request by the Speaker C P Joshi asking the members to return to their seats was ignored by the opposition.Amid the uproar, the speaker continued with listed questions. Since the opposition did not participate in the question hour, the question hour finished before schedule, speaker adjourned the house till 12noon.
