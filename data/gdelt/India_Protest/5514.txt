Will forgive the students who entered my house, says JNU V-C

Hoping that the students will reform themselves, Jawaharlal Nehru University VC M. Jagadesh Kumar has decided not to file a complaint against the students who forcibly entered his house.

The JNU Vice-Chancellor said he was attending an official meeting when he came to know that 400-500 students had gathered in front of his home & allegedly entered his home and confined his wife inside for several hours.

They pushed guards, broke the gate and entered the home, Jagadesh Kumar told India Today.

The JNU Vice-Chancellor called the incident unfortunate, and added, We respect the rights of students, but using unlawful means and behaving in a violent way isn’t something expected from JNU students. Kumar said he will forgive the JNU students being a teacher and head of JNU.

JNU students have been on a hunger strike to protest against various policies of the administration including the new prospectus which is exclusionary in nature, the online entrance examination, and scuttling of deprivation points and reservation.

JNU Students’ Union also released a statement following allegations. It is very unfortunate that at JNU a meet with our VC, to ask him a few questions, was misconstrued in a sinister ploy to defame the students of JNU, the statement said.
