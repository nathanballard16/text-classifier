AAP increases campaign pace, galaxy of National Leaders criss cross Maharashtra; appeal to the state’s electorate to give the party an opportunity to serve

As campaign frenzy increased across the state, AAP too amplified it’s efforts at voter outreach. Sr Leader and MP, Rajya Sabha- Shri Sanjay Singhji addressed packed rallies in Savli and Navargaon of Brahmapuri Vidhansabha, Chandrapur District where social activist and AAP Candidate Paromita Goswami, is poised for a win, given her body of work for women and tribal empowerment. It may be noted, that this is the first major consolidation of women voters in this election, supporting one of their own in the fray.

“AAP is not only, about ‘Clean Politics’ but also about ‘Good governance’. Our work in Delhi, is there for all to see especially in world-class education, healthcare, electricity, water and transport.

Maharashtra is a failing state and it’s masses have suffered due to vested interests in power and a lack of political will for the people’s welfare. Whether it is rising unemployment or agrarian distress due to crop failures and lack of adequate crop loans and insurance or the numerous scams or the state’s debt increasing by 2.91 lakh crores, Maharashtra deserves better. Given that opposition has abdicated it’s responsibility, please give AAP a chance and vote for Paromitaji, vote for the broom”, said Sanjay Singh addressing a mammoth rally at Savli, Brahmapuri Vidhan Sabha.

Vote for us. We have demonstrated what we can do in Delhi, let us become the people’s voice in Maharashtra.”, he said.
