Article 15: Karni Sena to protest against Ayushamnn Khurrana’s film in Mumbai today – read details

The Karni Sena that had in 2017 tried to ban the release of Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Padmaavat is now in news once again. This time around the Karni Sena seems to be having a problem with Ayushmann Khurrana’s upcoming film Article 15. Yes, on Friday (June 21) we told you that director Anubhav Sinha confirmed to us about receiving threats. Further, it was also said that a Brahmin group called the Parshuram Sena – who had expressed their displeasure on the portrayal of the Brahmin community in the film – went on to say that they would protest along with the Karni Sena to put a ban on the release of this film.

Now we have learnt that the Karni Sena is protesting against the release of Article 15 in Mumbai, today (June 24). Reports state that the reason behind this protest is because Ayushmann’s film is loosely based around Uttar Pradesh’s Badaun rape case where two girls were raped and hanged to death. The story is a hard-hitting one that brings to the forefront the horror of the caste system in India. What has upset Brahmin groups is that the story apparently shows the accused men hailing from that caste.

Earlier commenting on the issue Ayushamann had said to a daily that people shouldn’t judge the film without seeing it. He had also added that the CBFC who is quite strict with sensitive content also gave the film certification. Article 15 is slated to release on June 28, 2019. Till then let us see how things take a turn for the film, stay tuned to CineBlitz for more updates.
