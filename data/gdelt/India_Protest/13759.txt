Protests erupt across Karnataka over DKS arrest; Cong workers court arrest in Mangaluru

Mangaluru/ Bengaluru, Sept 4: Protests broke out in several parts of Karnataka on Wednesday following the arrest of senior Congress leader D K Shivakumar by the ED in New Delhi in connection with a money laundering case.

Demonstrations and attempts to block roads by burning tires were reported from Ramanagara, Chennapattana and few neighbouring towns, where a bandh has been called by Shivakumar's supporters.

In Mangaluru, congress leaders and activists including MLC Ivan D’Souza courted arrest after burning effigies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah during a protest organised by the DK District Congress Committee.

Shivakumar's Kanakapura assembly constituency falls under Ramanagara district. As a precautionary measure, the district administration has declared holiday to schools and colleges on Wednesday.

Incidents of stone-pelting on government buses were reported at Kanakapura last night following the Congress leader's arrest.

Shivakumar, the Congress troubleshooter from the state was arrested under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after he had appeared before the Enforcement Directorate for questioning for the fourth time on Tuesday at its headquarters in Delhi.

The arrest of Shivakumar by the ED has drawn condemnation from opposition leaders in the state with former chief ministers Siddaramaiah and H D Kumaraswamyaccusing the BJP of using central agencies to "oppress voices of dissent".

On his part, Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa has said the law will take its own course and that he would be more than happy than everyone if the former minister comes clear of the charges.
