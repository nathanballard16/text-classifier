Nursing orderly went on strike at Delhi's Baba Saheb Ambedkar hospital

The contract staff nurses of Delhi government's Baba Saheb Ambedkar (BSA) Hospital went on a strike on Monday demanding the payment of pending salaries, thus affecting patient care. The functioning of the hospital was affected by the strike by the contract staff nurses, with only minimal services being maintained. The BSA is a state-run government institution, and there are over 200 contract staff nurses working, most of whom have worked there for several years. With the hospital authorities negotiating with the striking nurses, the permanent staff nurses were severely overburdened. Their salary is not on par with the regular employees of BSA, and even maternity benefits are denied to them.
