For proof, see the large number of people attending this rally," he said amid loud applause from the gathering. Calling himself the nation''s ''chowkidar'', Modi said, "It was this chowkidar's government that had the courage to conduct surgical strikes on land, sky and space. India should develop, India should be secure from enemies." The country is, for the first time, witnessing a government that knows how to deliver, he said.
