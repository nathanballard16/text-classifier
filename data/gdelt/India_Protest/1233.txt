As CM tried my best to ensure justice was done: Mehbooba

SRINAGAR, Jan 17: PDP president Mehbooba Mufti today said that during her tenure as chief minister she tried her best to ensure justice in case of rape and murder of eight-year-old girl in Kathua.

Taking to Twitter, Mehbooba also criticised BJP and said that instead of condemning the gruesome incident, the party lawmakers staged protests in favour of the rapists.

“As a CM I tried my best to ensure justice was done. Can only hope that the accused are punished severely so that no other girl has to endure such pain and trauma,” Mehbooba tweeted.

"Today marks a year since the horrific rape & murder of an eight-year old girl in Kathua. Sadly, instead of condemning such a gruesome incident, BJP lawmakers staged protests in favour of the rapists. Even a crime like rape was communalised and passions were stoked to justify it,” she said.

Earlier addressing her party workers here, Mehbooba recounted her struggle for justice in the case. PDP president stated that she went to New Delhi and made it amply clear before the helmsmen that the PDP cannot remain a part of government until the two ministers who had openly supported the rapists are not sacked and until the investigation is not allowed to take place in a transparent manner.

“I remained in the forefront as chief minister to thwart any attempts aimed at the intimidation of Gujjars and Bakerwals in the state and took every measure to ensure these communities that no one is going to do any harm to them,” she said.

Mehbooba added that securing the secular character of the state has been the top most priority of the PDP since inception and that the party every time foiled the attempts of the fringe groups to create any communal wedge between the different religious communities living in the state with harmony and brotherhood for centuries.
