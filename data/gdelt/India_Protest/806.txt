FROM THE PAST PAGES OF DAWN: 1969: Fifty years ago: Kashmiris demonstrate

LONDON: The British newspaper, “Daily Express”, today [Jan 10] strongly denounced Indian imperialism in Kashmir as placard-carrying Kashmiris demonstrated outside Connaught Rooms where Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressed a press luncheon arranged by the Indian Journalists Association.

As a counterpart to NIBMAR (No Indepen­dence for Rhodesia Before Majority Rule) the “Daily Express” has coined the phrase KINID — Kashmir Independence Not Indian Domi­na­tion. In an editorial titled “KINID” the “Daily Express” declared: “Kashmir has been held captive by Indian arms for 20 years. Her six million Muslim people are denied self-determination. No wonder the moral preaching of Afro-Asians are treated with disdain.”

Some of the Kashmiri demonstrators threw themselves in front of Mrs Gandhi’s car when she arrived at Connaught Rooms. They were promptly picked up by British policemen guarding the entrance. Mrs Gandhi spoke to their leader, Mr Chisti, after she alighted from the car and was handed a petition protesting against India’s continued occupation of Kashmir.
