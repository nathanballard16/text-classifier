Manipuri Film Maker, Aribam Syam Sharma Returns Padma Shri In Protest Against Citizenship Bill

A renowned filmmaker from Manipur Aribam Syam Sharma on Sunday returned his Padmashree award in solidarity with the ongoing public protests against Citizenship Bill.

Late president Dr APJ Abdul Kalam had conferred the Padmashree award to the noted filmmaker for his contribution to Manipuri cinema and world of films in 2006.

He said that "the state has only one or two MPs in a house of 500 plus members, he questioned what voice can the northeast have in Parliament."

“They should respect us as a state - small or big. It should not be counted on the population basis. I raise this because the Union of India is made up of states,” he added.

He further said, “When the northeastern states jointly represent or present something in the government, they should consider it and if they do not consider, naturally we have to oppose.”

“So, as part of showing solidarity, I decided to return the award,” says the 83-year-old prominent filmmaker.
