New Delhi: As the political showdown between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress continues in the state, Union Minister Giriraj Singh on Sunday said that Mamata Banerjee is indulging in politics of violence out of frustration as "her countdown in Bengal politics has begun."

Accusing the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC for the violent clashes in the state that resulted in the death of four people - three BJP and one TMC worker, Giriraj said that Mamata has taken recourse to the same tactics as the Left Front which preceded her in power.

"In election after election, from the local bodies to the Lok Sabha - she has been facing people's wrath. Democracy has no place for violence, but she is using it out of frustration. Her countdown has begun," Singh told PTI.

Meanwhile, the BJP has announced a 12-hour bandh in West Bengal on June 10 against the Mamata government. This has come after the bodies of the deceased BJP workers, who were killed in yesterday's clash, were stopped from being taken to the party office, where an elaborate ceremony was planned.

"I have spoken to Governor Keshri Nath Tripathi, who has assured me that he will speak to senior officials. Police couldn't prevent the murders and are now stopping us from cremating the bodies,” BJP leader BJP general secretary Rahul Sinha told ANI.

After being stopped, the BJP state unit had prepared to cremate the bodies on the Basanti highway. However, it reversed the decision after mediation and announced a series of protests against the state government including the 'Black Day'.

Earlier in the day, Home Minister Amit Shah was apprised of the situation in the state and was given ground details of the violence of North 24 Parganas district.
