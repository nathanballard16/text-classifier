A Banaras Hindu University (BHU) student has refused to accept his degree in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and said he will oppose any law dividing the country.

Rajat Singh refused to accept his Masters (History of Arts) degree at the University's annual convocation programme in solidarity with students who were arrested for protesting against CAA.

Singh said he opposes the arrest of students protesting against CAA and also the law itself. "I oppose the arrest of students, I oppose this communal law, I oppose any law that attempts to divide the country," he said.

He also took a dig at the University administration saying that they ignored the jailed students, some of whom were supposed to get their degrees along with him. "This is why I will not accept my degree," he added.

In a similar incident from Kolkata, a Jadavpur University gold medallist tore up a copy of the controversial CAA when she was called on stage to receive her degree.

Debsmita Chowdhury from the Department of International Relations, went up on stage to receive her degree with a copy of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, looked at the audience and announced, "Hum Kagaz Nahin Dikhayenge (I will not show my papers)."

She then raised her fist shouting, "Inquilab Zindabaad!", bowed to the audience and then received her degree before leaving the stage.

That's not all. Another Pondicherry University student also rejected gold medal to express solidarity with anti-CAA and anti-NRC protesters.

Rabeeha Abdurehim took to Twitter and said, "I rejected the medal in solidarity with every student protesting against CAA and NRC. They kicked me out because they feared I would do that. #resistNRC #resistCAA."
