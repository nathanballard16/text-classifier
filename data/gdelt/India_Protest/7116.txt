New Delhi: The voters in Kannuaj are boycotting the polls citing lack of development work and changing of polling booths in the area.

The position of two booths – booth number 27 and 29 – has been shifted and only two votes have been cast since morning.

The voters in the area are upset over changing the location of the booths. They are also expressing their disillusionment over lack of development work in the area.

Dimple Yadav, the wife of Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, is contesting against Subrat Pathak of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Kannauj Lok Sabha constituency. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the SP chief held rallies in the constituency in the run-up to the polls.

In the 2014 general elections, Dimple Yadav outperformed Pathak by a close margin of over 19,000 votes. The Samajwadi Party has retained the seat since 1998. Mulayam Singh Yadav had emerged victorious from the seat in 1999. Akhilesh had won the election to the constituency thrice in 2000, 2004 and 2009.

The polling in 72 constituencies across nine states is underway today in the fourth phase of 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The election to 543 seats is being held in seven phases from April 11 to May 19. The counting of votes will take place on May 23.
