Speakers stress need to enhance society’s resilience against violence and extremism

HYDERABAD: Speakers at a series of seminars have stressed the need to enhance society’s resilience against violence and extremism and accelerate the process of rehabilitation and reintegration of disgruntled elements in order to ensure lasting peace and stability.

The first seminar in the series titled ‘Countering Violent Extremism under Paigham-e-Pakistan’ was arranged at Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences (LUMHS) Jamshoro on March 18.

While addressing the event as keynote speaker, LUMHS Vice Chancellor Prof Bikha Ram Devrajani opined that there is a dire need to evolve a strategy to counter violent extremism in the country. “Violent religious extremism is a global concern today. As governments prepare their counter-terrorism policies, many focus solely on reactive measures such as military action and surveillance measures applying hard power which are responsive to individuals who are already radicalized,” he said. “Education should be incorporated into such policies as a preventive measure that not only makes students resilient citizens but can also address the psychological, emotional and intellectual appeal of narratives applying the soft power which the terrorists purport,” he added.

“The soft power is meant to win hearts of people by applying nonviolent procedures … hence using soft power is the need of the hour to counter the extremist ideology. This will strengthen national integration process, enhance community resilience against extremism and accelerates the process of rehabilitation and reintegration of militants in the society,” he said. “We should also clarify the complexities among fundamentalism, extremism, radicalism and terrorism, and identify a variety of push and pull factors that trigger radicalization,” he observed.

The seminar was attended by a large number of students and members of faculty.

The second seminar of the series titled ‘Paigham-e-Pakistan: the National Peace Narrative’ was organized by the Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, on March 19. The speakers at the event agreed that Paigham-e-Pakistan narrative is a true omen of tolerance, justice, equality and protection of rights.

Sindh Agriculture University Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Mujeebuddin Memon Sahrai said that Islam has nothing to do with rigidity, violence, extremism and hatred as it is religion of love for humanity and peace.
