Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Misa Bharti on Wednesday confirmed that no Member of Parliament (MP) belonging to the party will attend a dinner meet called by Prime Minister Narendra Modi for all parliamentarians on Thursday. Bharti, daughter of RJD supremo and former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav, further explained that the RJD has decided to boycott the dinner to show its protest against the rising number of deaths in Bihar's Muzaffarpur due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES).

While speaking to ANI, Misa Bharti said that the RJD will not be going to dinner called by the Prime Minister on Wednesday because of deaths of children in Muzaffarpur. She went on to take a jibe at the Central government saying "medicines and live equipment can be procured from the amount that is being spent in organising this dinner."

According to reports, the dinner will take place at Ashoka Hotel in Delhi and the Prime Minister will chair a meeting of the presidents of all political parties to discuss the idea of "One Country, One Election" along with several other important issues.

Elsewhere in Bihar, at least 118 children have died due to encephalitis with a large majority of cases coming from Muzaffarpur district while more than a dozen of AES deaths have been reported from other districts in the last 24 hours. According to health officials here, the deaths have been reported from Patna, Bhagalpur, Banka, Sitamarhi, Samastipur, East Champaran and West Champaran.

Ever since the epidemic began wreaking havoc in the state, the RJD has been vociferously protesting against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) as it claims that the party being a key player in both Bihar and central government has failed to contain the rising death toll in the state.
