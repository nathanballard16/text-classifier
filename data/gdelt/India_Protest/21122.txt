Students protest across TN against CAA, police action in Jamia

Students across Tamil Nadu including at IIT, Madras here held protests against Citizenship Amendment Act, as well as the police action against their counterparts in Jamia Milia University in Delhi.

Activists of Students Federation of India (SFI) held protests in Chennai, Madurai and Coimbatore railway stations and were removed by the police.

At the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, students were seen carrying placards with pictures of Mahatma Gandhi and Babasaheb Ambedkar, condemning both the CAA as well as the police crackdown against students of Jamia Millia University on Sunday.

Further, a section of students of the city-based Loyola College staged a sit-in protest expressing solidarity with those from Jamia Milia.

On Sunday, protesters torched four public buses and two police vehicles as they clashed with the police near Jamia Millia Islamia in Delhi during a demonstration against the amended Citizenship Act, leaving nearly 60 people including students, cops and fire fighters injured.

Police used batons and teargas shells to disperse the violent mob, but denied firing at them.

However, videos of purported police firing, injured students in the university bathroom as well as footage of them bleeding emerged on the social media.

Following the arson on roads, police entered the Jamia university campus, where tension prevailed as several people were detained for alleged involvement in the violence.
