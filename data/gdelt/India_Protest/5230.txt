MoD nod for 10 lakh grenades in buys of Rs 2,355 crore

NEW DELHI: The defence ministry on Wednesday approved capital procurements for the armed forces worth Rs 2,355 crore, which included a Rs 530 crore project for an Indian private company to manufacture 10 lakh “multi-mode” hand grenades for the Army.Officials said the manufacturing contract for the grenades designed by DRDO will be inked with Economic Explosives Ltd of Nagpur soon. This project has been hanging fire since 2011 because the same grenades made by the ordnance factory board (OFB) repeatedly failed to clear DGQA tests.“There were differences over the design, manufacturing and technology transfer between DRDO and OFB for the last six-seven years. So, now a private sector company that demonstrated its expertise in manufacturing the grenades will get the contract,” said an official. The defence acquisitions council also cleared the procurement of the latest fire control systems for “improved accuracy and centralised control” for the Teg and Talwar-class of stealth frigates and Saryu-class of patrol vessels.
