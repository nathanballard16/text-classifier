The country is glued to their television screens to get all the latest updates on the ongoing protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Students have been protesting across the country and voicing their stance on social media. Celebrities have also been taking to their social media accounts to protest against the Act.

A peaceful protest was held in Mumbai earlier this week that was attended by B-Town actors including Farhan Akhtar, Zoya Akhtar, Jim Sarbh, Huma Qureshi and Swara Bhasker among others. The latest actor to speak against the CAA is Gully Boy's Siddhant Chaturvedi. In an exclusive interaction with Zoom TV, the actor opened up on standing with the students and why he couldn't make it to the protests.

He said, "I wrote on my social media too. I wanted to be there for the protests but I was shooting. If you will notice that I did not even put out the first look of Bunty aur Babli 2 till late evening. People told me you should put it out but I wasn’t feeling like it. Was affected by what's happening around me. I only put it out later. I am with the students."

On the work front, Siddhant has won the hearts of the critics as well as the audience with his portrayal as MC Sher in Gully Boy. He has now signed on Yash Raj's Bunty Aur Babli 2 alongside newcomer Sharvari. The film also stars Saif Ali Khan and Rani Mukerji in lead roles. He has also been signed on to work in Shakun Batra's next directorial venture that that also stars Deepika Padukone and Ananya Panday in lead roles.
