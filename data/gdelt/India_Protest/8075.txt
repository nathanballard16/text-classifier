UP Villagers Bribed To Stay Away From Voting

Lucknow: In a shocking case of rigging, voters in Tara Jivanpur village of Uttar Pradesh’s Chandauli Lok Sabha constituency were asked to stay away from voting by bribing them and forcibly marking their fingers with ink by local BJP workers. The particular Lok Sabha segment is a high-profile constituency represented by UP BJP chief and former minister Mahendra Nath Pandey.

The villagers and workers of grand alliance of Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samajwadi Party protested outside the local police station. The villagers alleged that BJP workers descended on their village on Saturday night and offered them Rs 500 each to skip the voting. The village is dominated by Dalits and backward classes’ voters.

The SP alleged that BJP was sending its workers to villages and threatening the poor and downtrodden from exercising their constitutional right in a free and fair manner. It demanded a probe and a case against BJP candidate Mahendra Nath Pandey.

Responding to the allegations Sub Divisional Magistrate Kumar Harsh said, "Some residents of village Tara Jivanpur are alleging that ink was put on their hands and money was given to them so that they would not be eligible to vote. I can assure that all people who are eligible to vote in the constituency will be able to cast their vote, action will be taken against those who are found guilty.”

Meanwhile, the BJP has downright denied the allegations leveled against their workers. “This is a ploy of our rivals to defame us. Why would the BJP do such things when we are already winning the seat by a huge margin?" BJP spokesperson Harish Srivastava said in Lucknow.

Sitting MP Mahendra Nath Pandey is facing a tough competition from SP-BSP joint candidate Sanjay Chauhan.
