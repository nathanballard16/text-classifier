"Disguised as Students' Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), the Popular Front of India (PFI) fanned protests in the state. Pursuant to the probe, the truth has come to the fore,' Maurya told the media persons.

Any anti- in the state and country would not be tolerated, the deputy chief minister said, adding that if SIMI comes out in a different form, it will be crushed.

The comments came in the backdrop of a letter written by Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) OP Singh to the Ministry of Home Affairs seeking a ban on PFI for its involvement in the violent protests against the CAA and Register of Citizens (NRC) that took place on December 19.

The PFI, which was founded on November 22, 2006, is based in Delhi.
