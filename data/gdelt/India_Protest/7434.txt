Protests outside SC against In House Committee clean chit to CJI Ranjan Gogoi in sexual harassment case

Several women lawyers and activists on Tuesday protested outside the Supreme Court, a day after a three-member in-house inquiry panel gave clean chit to Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi in sexual harassment case.

Amid noisy scenes, the Delhi police detained the protestors during the demonstration and imposed Section 144 in the area to prevent further escalation.

On Monday a Supreme Court in-house inquiry had given CJI Gogoi a clean chit in the matter. The in-house committee headed by Justice SA Bobde said that it did not find any substance in the allegations of a former employee of the Supreme Court who had accused CJI of sexual harassment.

The panel, which also includes, Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Indu Malhotra had said that the report of a committee constituted as part of the in-house inquiry was “not liable to be made public”.

The former woman apex court staffer had withdrawn from the in-house inquiry on April 30 after its third in-chamber hearing, saying that she felt she was unlikely to get justice from this committee.

She had raised concerns as she was not allowed to take her lawyer to the hearing. She also found the atmosphere of the committee ‘very frightening’.
