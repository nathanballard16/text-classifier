Jaipur: Top BJP leaders including former Rajasthan CM and BJP leader Vasundhara Raje, Union Minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat, BJP state president Satish Punia and Leader of Opposition Gulabchand Kataria on Friday held a rally here in support of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Removed. Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad also attended the event.

The rally was attended by more than 15,000 people, including state MPs, BJP leaders and Hindu immigrants from Pakistan, who also came from far-flung areas. During the rally, people shouted slogans in favor of citizenship law, along with Bharat Mata Ki Jai. The BJP rally started from the Shaheed Smarak and ended at the Civil Line Gate. Before the rally started, the leaders laid a wreath to the martyrs at the Shaheed memorial. This gathering of people gathered at the civil line gate turned into a demonstration.

Speaking on the occasion, Raje said, 'Modi government has brought this law for minorities coming from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. I have personally visited Hindu migrants from Pakistan and seen their plight. Hearing his painful story, I had tears in my eyes. It is a sad story of how they are living here without any facilities'.
