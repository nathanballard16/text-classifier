In seven phases

The decision by the Election Commission to not hold Assembly elections with parliamentary polls in Jammu and Kashmir “owing to the security situation” will deprive the people of the State, who are an integral part of India, of their democratic rights (Page 1, “Lok Sabha polls from April 11 to May 19”, March 11). Not holding simultaneous elections will widen the gulf with the rest of India. The Central government has virtually failed to usher in peace and tranquillity in the State. Democracy is the only barometer by which to measure the needs of the people.

The national election is an astonishing feat and democracy in action on a striking scale. Proof of this democratic tradition is the flawless way in which our elections take place and the smooth transition of power to the next government. The only disagreeable note is the increasing level of hostility in campaign speeches. Tolerance and respect for dissent are an important pillar of democracy.
