HYDERABAD, June 2 (UNI)—The Army was called out to maintain law and order in Hyderabad and Secunderabad as “Anti-Repression Day” called by the Telengana Praja Samiti took a violent turn today. This is the second time that the Army has been called out during the five-month-old agitation. The hartal to protest against repression of Telengana agitators was marred by violence, clashes between the agitators and the police, police lathi-charge and firings. One person was killed in police firing in Hyderabad while another was fatally stabbed. In Warangal the police firing claimed two lives. About 20 persons received bullet injuries both in Hyderabad and Warangal. The city, which was quiet and peaceful till about ten this morning, suddenly turned into a virtual battlefield, particularly in a busy shopping centre with stick-wielding protagonists of an integrated State and separate Telengana engaged in a “free for all” on the streets as the police looked on helplessly.
