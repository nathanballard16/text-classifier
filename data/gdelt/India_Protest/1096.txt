Jadavpur University students demand expulsion of professor Kanak Sarkar who compared women's virginity to bottle seals-India News , Firstpost

Students of Kolkata's Jadavpur University staged a protest at the university campus, demanding the expulsion of professor Kanak Sarkar over his Facebook remarks that compared a woman's virginity to a sealed bottle.

Kolkata: Students of Kolkata's Jadavpur University (JU) on Tuesday staged a protest at the university campus, demanding the expulsion of professor Kanak Sarkar over his remarks made in a Facebook post.

"We want his expulsion as he is influencing young minds and we don't want a misogynistic environment here. He's a repeat offender," a protester said.

The political science professor has been on the receiving end of the internet's outrage after he put up a Facebook post comparing a woman's virginity to the seal on a bottle or packet.

The post, which has since been deleted, said that to most boys a "virgin wife is like an angel" and thus, they should make sure that the women they marry are "biologically sealed from birth".

A former student has recounted on Facebook an incident where she was giving a presentation in class and Sarkar, then the head of the department, had interrupted her to ask her if she wanted to become a model, because she had "what men would enjoy",

Earlier in the day, the National Commission for Women (NCW) had taken suo motu cognisance of the objectionable statements.

The NCW team, led by Rekha Sharma, will meet the university Vice-Chancellor, to discuss the matter during their scheduled visit to West Bengal this week.

The Commission has also written to the West Bengal Director General of Police, directing him to investigate the matter and take appropriate action as per the relevant provisions of the Indian Penal Code.
