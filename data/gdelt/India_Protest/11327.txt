Missing brothers case: Parents, villagers announced reward of Rs 50,000

PATIALA: After all their attempts to find out two missing chidren remained futile, the villagers along with the parents on Sunday announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 for the person giving information about both the minors.It has been a week since the two boys aged 10 and 6 had gone missing on Monday night. The parents and the villagers also had blocked Patiala–Chandigarh highway in protest against the police for their failure in finding out the kids. The blockade was later lifted following an assurance from the police.On Saturday, the incident of two missing children took a twist after the body of a minor boy was recovered from Bhakhra canal near Sarala hed but the parents refused to identify the dead body as of their child.The police officials, including ADGP Law and order, IGP Patiala and SSP are investigating the matter but have failed to trace out the missing boys identified as Jashandeep and Hasandeep who were allegedly kidnapped from a shop in their village.Didar Singh, father of the missing boys said, “We, along with the village panchayat have annpounced a reward of Rs 50,000 for anyone who gives information about our children. The body fished out on Saturday was not of our son. We have not got any ransom call. We work as labourers and don’t have enough money too. Our children were kidnapped for some other reason and now we are scared.”Patiala senior superintendent of police Mandeep Singh Sidhu said that matter was under investigation and boys will be recovered soon. He said that the DNA test of the body of a child recovered recently from the canal will be carried out after 72 hours are completed.To crack the case police have also formed ten teams including Superintendent of Police City and SP (Investigation), six Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP), and In-charge Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Patiala.
