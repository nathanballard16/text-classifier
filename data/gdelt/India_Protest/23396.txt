The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) on Saturday called for a bandh in Bihar against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Earlier, RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav had announced about Bihar Bandh to demonstrate against the new law, that grants citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Parsis, Buddhists and Christians fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh and came to India on or before December 31, 2014.

Massive protests were staged in various cities to show their rage against the CAB which became a new legislator last week after Parliament passed the bill and it became an Act with presidential assent.

To show their support to RJD's Bandh and protest against Citizenship Act, VIP (Vikassheel Insaan Party) party workers break barricades during a demonstration in Patna. In another incident, protestors vandalised a bus in the capital city of Bihar.
