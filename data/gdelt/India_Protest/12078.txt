What does the government mean when it says ‘connected with modern scientific medical profession’? —Dr Suhas Pingale, IMA Maharashtra state secretary

The country’s medical fraternity fears that the new National Medical Commission (NMC) Act might bring practitioners of alternative medicine on a par with registered physicians.The Act empowers Community Health Providers with a “limited licence” to treat patients like those practising modern medicine while diluting the authority of the doctors in the Commission — the highest governing body for healthcare and medical education.An estimated 3.5 lakh people practise alternative medicine in India while there are 10 lakh registered doctors in the country.The other troublesome areas of the Act pertain to capitation fee in medical colleges, legalising quackery, an EXIT test for practising medicine, and giving little space to states in the Commission.Despite protests by doctors in several cities across the country, thegovernment ensured a smooth passage for the NMC Bill, which replaced the Medical Council of India, in both Houses of Parliament last week.Some provisions of the Act, many feel, offer quick-fix solutions instead of addressing long-term inadequacies in the healthcare system.Section 32 of the Act states: “The Commission may grant limited licence to practice medicine at midlevel as Community Health Provider to such a person connected with modern scientific medical profession…”Section 51 puts the onus on the state governments to take “necessary measures to enhance the capacity of healthcare professionals” in promoting primary healthcare in the rural areas.These two sections, the doctors suspect, will pave the way for “legalising quackery” in rural healthcare sector to compensate for the paucity of qualified physicians. The Act also specifies that the Commission will be working in tandem with the Central Council of Homoeopathy and the Central Council of Indian Medicine to improve the interface between, traditional Indian medicines and allopathy.“What exactly does the government mean when it says ‘connected with modern scientific medical profession?” asks Dr Suhas Pingale, secretary of the’s Maharashtra branch. “This could mean that nurses, pharmacists and even medical representatives — all those connected with modern medicine — can prescribe drugs. Even ayurvedic and homeopathic practitioners might be included. Why this insistence on involving them in rural healthcare? Are the lives of villagers inferior in any way from the urban folks?”The Act also allows Community Health Providers to “prescribe specified medicines independently” in primary and preventive healthcare without any supervision, which the doctors feel could have disastrous effects.Currently, anganwadi workers in rural areas are trained to administer specific seasonal drugs like anti-malarial drugs but aren’t allowed to hand out other medicines.The government had earlier proposed a six-month “bridge course” for para-medical professionals and practitioners of ayurveda, unani, homoeopathy and other forms of medicine except allopathy. After protests from doctors, it dropped the bridge course but other grey areas remain. For instance, the Act doesn’t specify how the process of granting licence will be undertaken.“There is a pool of qualified doctors who do not practice, like those dealing with forensic medicine or teaching, and can be included under the new Act,” says Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital in Mumbai.Medical students are unhappy with the National Exit Test for admission to post-graduate courses and obtaining licence to practice after MBBS degree.“What happens if someone clears the MBBS exams but fails in the Exit test? A medical student has to pass various subjects and then do a one-year internship to practice as a doctor. Where is the need for yet another hurdle?” asks a medical student.There is a growing apprehension that the cost of medical education will go up as the NMC will decide the fees for 50 per cent of the seats in private and deemed universities, thus legalising capitation fee.“This amounts to giving a free hand to private medical colleges. Is this the way to end corruption or encourage it?” asks Kalyani Dongre, president of the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors.“The government wants to exercise complete control over the medical fraternity and the medical education system,” says Dr Pravin Sanghvi, former state secretary of IMA Maharashtra. “There is a provision that the central government can supersede any decision of the Commission. Who exercises real control then? The central government, of course. This despite the fact that most members are handpicked by them,” he explains.Under the proposed structure of the NMC, the chairperson, 10 exofficio members and 14 part-time members will be chosen by a seven-member search committee comprising all government-nominated members.The new government has set up the NMC to rid the system of corruption.“The intent of the Act may be right but we are worried about the implementation and the implications,” says Dr Mukesh Gupta, president of the Mumbai chapter of association of medical consultants.“The states need representation because health is a state subject and cannot be controlled by the Centre,” says Dr Gupta.Maharashtra, which had five members in the Medical Council of India, will lose its clout under the new commission.India ranks poorly in international rankings on most health indices, faring worse than, Bhutan and Sri Lanka, according to Global Burden of Disease study. The new Act appears to have queered the pitch for healthcare even further.
