Citizenship Amendment Act: West Bengal Matua group thanks Narendra Modi govt

While Assam witnessed massive protests after the Citizenship Amendment Bill was passed in both the houses of the parliament, the Matua community, a Hindu refugee group who came to reside in India from Bangladesh, has welcomed the Modi government's move.

At Thakurnagar in Bongaon, about 80 km from Kolkata, the religious headquarters of the community, Matuas came out to celebrate on Thursday.

"This should have happened way back. It feels like a new life and it has been possible because of the Modi government," said Amulya Roy

Echoing his views, Alpana Das said her family came to India in1980. "I was born here, but my parents came from Bangladesh and they do not have any documents. So, a fear always prevailed in our minds regarding NRC. We feel relieved now," she said.

With their new found dignity in a foreign land, some say the government should now consider declaring India as a Hindu nation.

"There are many Muslim countries in the world but no such Hindu nation exists today. Now that we have got our citizenship, we want our country to be declared a Hindu state," said Ajit Sil.
