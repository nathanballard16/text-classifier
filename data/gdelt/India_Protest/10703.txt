India monitoring Anti-US sentiment in Sri Lanka

COLOMBO (News 1st): Indian media reported that India is keeping a close watch as protests grow in Sri Lanka over a proposed pact with the US, which could enable the setting up of an American military base in New Delhi’s southern neighbourhood. The Indian establishment is of the view that as a close neighbour, it would respect Colombo’s decision.

An informed source who did not wish to be named told Economic Times “Delhi will respect Colombo’s decision on the matter. We are keeping a close watch as this pertains to our neighbourhood that has strategic significance for India,” The Economic Times reported that last month, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cancelled the Lanka leg of his Asia trip following growing protest over the proposed military pact.
