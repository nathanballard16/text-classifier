UoH Students Take Out Protest March Against Kashmir Lockdown

Hyderabad: More than 200 students of the University of Hyderabad here participated in a candlelight march on Thursday to protest against the lockdown in the Kashmir Valley.

Kashmir has been under a severe lockdown for the 68th day on Friday as the Centre abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution, revoking the state of its special status and bifurcated Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. All shops, main markets and educational institutions continue to be shut down.

Over 70 members of the Jammu and Kashmir Students Association took part in the march. Hadif Nisar, President of Jammu and Kashmir Students Association, was quoted saying by a daily, “There is no normalcy in Kashmir and the media which is showing normalcy is spreading only fake news. I had been a month ago to meet my family in Anantnag and the trauma of the people is palpable. Without communication, how can you expect mothers to send their children to school? How will businessmen move out of their homes when they do not know whether they will come back or not?”

The students from the Valley studying in the varsity said that they are able to talk to their family members once only in 15 days.
