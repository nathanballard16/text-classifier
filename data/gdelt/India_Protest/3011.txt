Saradha scam: Rajeev Kumar appears before CBI, interrogation likely to end today

Shillong (Meghalaya) [India], Feb 13 (ANI): Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar on Wednesday appeared before the CBI here for the fifth day of interrogation in connection with the Saradha chit-fund scam.

According to sources, the CBI is likely to complete the interrogation today.

The Kolkata Police chief, who has been accused of withholding some documents related to Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund cases, was being questioned by the CBI since Saturday.

On Tuesday, Kumar was grilled by the CBI officials for over 10 hours.

On February 5, the Supreme Court had directed Kumar to appear before the central investigative agency in connection with the matter. It had also said that no coercive step should be taken against Kumar.

The top court's directive had come against the backdrop of a ‘dharna’ organised by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata earlier this month in protest against the CBI’s attempt to arrest the top cop.

Kumar has been serving as Kolkata’s Police Commissioner since January 2016. He is said to have not responded to the earlier summons from the CBI in connection with the probe into the Rose Valley and Saradha ponzi scams. (ANI)
