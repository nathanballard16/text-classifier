CM must resign, demands BJP

DHARWAD: BJP workers took out a rally here on Thursday and protested in front of the deputy commissioner's office against the state government’s decision to grant 3,667 acres of land in Ballari district to Jindal Steel Works.They also accused the government of adopting anti-farmer policies.The workers said the coalition government was involved in one or the other scam detrimental to the interest of people and farmers. “The government has decided to sell over 3,000 acres in Ballari district to Jindal for a very less price. The government has given land at a paltry sum of Rs 1.22 lakh per acre. For such a meagre amount, even a 30X40 site cannot be purchased,” the protesters said.They alleged that people at the helm have received kickbacks from private players to given away the land to Jindal at a throwaway price. “Along with the chief minister , some other ministers too have received kickbacks. Owning moral responsibility, H D Kumaraswamy should resign,” they urged.The protesters said the loan waiver scheme was another fraud by the government. “The government failed to keep its promises of waiving farm loans. Interestingly, during the Lok Sabha elections, the government had credited money to the accounts of a few farmers. But after the poll debacle, the government withdrew the money two days back. This is like cheating farmers,” they charged.“The coalition itself is unholy and has been formed just to loot the people and state exchequer. From day one of its formation, the coalition government has indulged in filling up its briefcase and in this run has forgotten the development of the state,” the protesters said.
