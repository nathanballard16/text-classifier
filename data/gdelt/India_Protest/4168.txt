Increase in taxes flayed

MADURAI

The Communist Party of India (Marxist), along with residents’ welfare associations of a few areas staged a demonstration in front of Madurai Corporation on Friday against the steep increase in taxes for houses and commercial buildings.

R. Vijayarajan, Madurai urban district secretary of the party, said that the Corporation had increased house tax by around 50 % and the tax for commercial buildings by 100 %. “This is unfair on the people,” he said.

Former MLA from the party N. Nanmaran said that apart from the increase in the tax, the Corporation was also levying unreasonable amount for disposing solid waste generated by commercial enterprises.

“At a time when elected representatives are not available in local bodies across the State, it is not right for officials to take such drastic decisions. It can be done only by elected representatives,” he said.

The party and members of the residents welfare association submitted petitions highlighting their demand to repeal the tax increase to Corporation officials. Mr. Vijayarajan said that the party will not hesitate to intensify protests if the Corporation failed to fulfil the demands.
