Opposition parties plan to protest against Citizenship Bill

NEW DELHI: With the Citizenship Bill slated to come up in Lok Sabha on Tuesday, the opposition parties are planning to protests against the Bill in Parliament.Interestingly, even Shiv Sena , an NDA ally has decided to join the opposition benches to protest against the government over the Bill. Meanwhile, another ally – Prafulla Mahanta’s Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), BJP’s partner in Assam on Monday announced the decision to break ties with the BJP over the Citizenship Bill.The Bill seeks to legitimise illegal immigrants from neighbouring countries belonging to religious groups other than Muslims.Trinamool Congress, one of the four parties – Congress, Left and SP being the other three -- that had submitted a dissent note on the JPC report on the Citizenship Bill, plans to stage a protest at the Gandhi statue in the Parliament premises on Tuesday morning. TMC will be protesting against the JPC which ignored all amendments suggested by opposition parties and submitted a report without holding any meetings in the last few months except three over the last two weeks.According to TMC MP Derek O’Brien, the party is opposing the Bill on the ground that, “no Indian citizen should be left out. This is a Bill which is anti-Bengali and also anti-citizens from all other states… this is an anti-citizen Bill. It is the dirtiest kind of politics of polarization that BJP is playing by dividing the people of Assam, Bengal and elsewhere.”In its dissent note on the JPC to both Houses, signed by Saugata Roy and O’Brien respectively, TMC made four essential points --- on how “out of the 40 lakh people whose citizenship are under threat, 28 lakh are Bengali Hindus, 10 lakh are Bengali Muslims, and 2 lakh Hindus from states other than Bengal and Assam. That 25 Bengali Hindus have committed suicide in the last six months over citizenship-related harassment and Hindu Bengalis are being targeted by vigilante groups in NDA-ruled states of Bihar, Jharkhand , Manipur and Meghalaya . Non-Bengali Hindus who failed to make it to the NRC are being assured they will be included in NRC.”
