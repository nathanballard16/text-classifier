Police recalling released associates to police stations: JI IOK

In occupied Kashmir, Jamaat-e-Islami has appealed to the world community, the United Nations and human rights bodies to use their influence to stop India’s suppressive policies in the territory.

In a statement in Srinagar, Jamaat-e-Islami said that police are recalling associates of the party to police stations and forcing them to express their disassociation with the Jamaat through newspapers.

The party said Indian government has restricted the activities of the party by alleging some grounds which are still unproved in courts should be contested democratically by New-Delhi in courts instead of employing repressive and coercive methods.

Meanwhile, President Anjuman Sharie Shian Agha Syed Hassan Al-Moosvi Al-Safvi has said that there are certain elements who are trying to create a sectarian wedge in the territory.

In a statement in Srinagar, while condemning the rape of a minor girl in Sumbal area of Bandipora, Agha Hassan Moosvi said that all segments of the society are protesting against this unfortunate incident.
