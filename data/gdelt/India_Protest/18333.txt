Protest in Hampi University against JNU fee increase

Hundreds of students and a few faculty members of Kannada University, Hampi, staged a demonstration in the campus on Wednesday condemning the “police brutalities” on the agitating students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), New Delhi.

Organised under the aegis of Bayalu Chintana Samshodhana Vidyarthi Balaga, they gathered at Tripadi Circle in the campus and formed a human chain to extend solidarity to the JNU students who were agitating against the fee hike.

They then marched to the university administrative complex raising slogans against the “police brutalities” on the agitating JNU students.

“JNU students and faculty members are in the forefront criticising the BJP’s divisive politics. The Union government is bent on closing down the premier institute by branding it as a breeding centre for urban Naxals,” Muniraju, a student leader said.

A. Subbanna Rai, Registrar of Hampi University, received the memorandum addressed to the President of India and assured the agitating students and faculty members of forwarding it to the concerned persons through the Vice-chancellor.

The main demand in the memorandum was the withdrawal of the cases filed against the JNU students and the immediate release of arrested students.

Sangamesh, Latha, Krishnamurthy and other students’ leaders were present.
