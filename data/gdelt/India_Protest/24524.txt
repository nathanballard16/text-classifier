CAA-NRC protests HIGHLIGHTS: Even as the government sought to delink the updation of the National Population Register (NPR) and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), there is no end in sight for the ongoing protests across the country. Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath lead a protest march against CAA today in Bhopal.

The protest, ‘Samvidhan Bachao Nyaya Shanti Yatra’, was attended by Congress leaders, workers, representatives from other parties, NGOs, ex-Army men, advocates and students.

The national capital will also witness at least three protests against the Citizenship law and NRC, including a speech by author Arundhati Roy at Delhi University’s North Campus.

The Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) became a law after receiving the President’s assent on December 12, and ever since then the protests, which started in Assam and Delhi, have spread to other parts of the country. The Bill seeks to grant citizenship to individuals who are Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Christian, Jain, or Parsi who entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan by the cut-off date of December 31, 2014.
