New Delhi [India], Dec 3 (ANI): Congress and Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) have given adjournment motion notice in Lok Sabha over "rising prices of onion and other vegetables throughout the country".

Congress has been protesting against the "rising onion prices" throughout the country.

The Congress party leaders and workers on Monday staged a protest against the rising price of onion in Bhubaneswar.

On Friday, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhpuesh Baghel had written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the hike on onion prices.

On November 29, Congress workers had sold onions at Rs 40 per kilogram outside the assembly in Lucknow to protest against the rising prices of onion in the country.

The adjournment motion is an extraordinary procedure which, if admitted, leads to setting aside the normal business of the House for discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance. (ANI)
