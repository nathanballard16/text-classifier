In Tamil Nadu, Chandrababu Naidu meets DMK leaders, flays I-T raids

Chennai: AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday slammed the Narendra Modi government over continuing income-tax raids, alleging the searches were targeted against those who opposed the BJP.

Addressing a press conference in the DMK’s headquarters here, he sought to know whether I-T raids were conducted in BJP-ruled states.

“Income-tax raids were conducted only against DMK, Telugu Desam and H.D. Kumaraswamy,” he said sharing the dais with DMK candidates for Thursday’s Lok Sabha elections.

“Today there is a raid in Karnataka. Are there any raids in BJP ruled states,” he asked. He was speaking before the I-T raids on DMK leader Kanimozhi.

“Democracy is in danger and at the same time Modi has just done so much injustice to the nation,” he alleged. Mr Naidu asked if Mr Modi had met the farmers of Tamil Nadu who had held 100-day protests when they were in Delhi.
