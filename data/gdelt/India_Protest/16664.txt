New Delhi: In a ‘Diwali gift’ for the people of Delhi, the Union Cabinet on Wednesday decided to award ownership rights to around 40 lakh people living in unauthorised colonies.

Announcing the move after a meeting of the Union Cabinet, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar said: “The Cabinet has taken historic decision to give ownership rights to 40 lakhs people living in unauthorised colonies in Delhi.”

"This has been an old demand of the people of Delhi. We welcome this decision & and would like to thank the Central government on behalf of the people," Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal said.

The vexed issue had been pending for long and the ruling Aam Aadmi Party government had held a protest last month blaming the Centre for a decision on the matter.

The Union government had in July this year said that it was likely to issue an order to regularise unauthorised colonies in the national capital.

The regularisation of unauthorised colonies has been a major election issue in Delhi and the Central government’s decision comes just months before the polls.

Kejriwal had claimed in the run-up to the Lok Sabha polls earlier this year that the Narendra Modi government at the Centre "planned to demolish" such colonies.

Both the AAP and the BJP have been accusing each other of delaying the regularisation of unauthorised colonies.

As per the government, Delhi has 1,797 unauthorised colonies where lakhs of people reside. The regularisation of these colonies would also aid in the development of these areas at par with regularised colonies.
