Key CPI (Maoist) member, wife surrender before Telangana police

Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], Feb 13 (ANI): Satwaji, a key member of the CPI (Maoist) Central Committee, and his wife, Vydugula Aruna alias Neelima, surrendered before the Director General of Police (DGP) of Telangana on Wednesday.

Satwaji worked as a courier from 1984 to 1985 under Venu, Adilabad District RSU president and Katakam Sudharsha, the then District Committee Secretary CPI (ML) PWG Adilabad district, according to an official release of the Telangana police.

While he was working in the Central Technical Team (CTC) network, he used to transport arms and ammunition from Bengaluru to different areas. During that time, he was introduced to Sadanala Ramakrishna, CTC in-charge, who put him in a den at Gulbarga.

In 1986, CTC couriers Tata and Madhu were arrested in Hyderabad. On basis of their information, Hyderabad police arrested Satwaji and seized arms and ammunition from his possession. He was lodged in jail from 1986 to 1989 and later released. Subsequently, he was responsible for planning and orchestrating many raids and ambushes.

During interrogation, Satwaji told police that the functioning of the leadership of CPI (Maoist) in Bihar and Jharkhand is “totally antagonistic to revolutionary ideology and is not people-centric".

“The party functioning has deteriorated and is more on the lines of criminal gangs who loot people and amass wealth for their development, using the party as a platform. Sensing the fast deteriorating standards in the functioning of the party due to lumpanisation trends in the cadre, many cadres are willing to give up the extremism,” read an official statement.

While Satwaji carries Rs 25 lakh bounty, Neelima carries a reward of Rs 10 lakh, which, the police said, will be paid to the duo in due course of time. (ANI)
