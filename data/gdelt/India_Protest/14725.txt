PMLA Tribunal slams ED for “inadequate investigation” & “mechanical” attachment of properties

NEW DELHI: The Prevention of Money Laundering Act ( PMLA ) Tribunal has slammed the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for “inadequate investigation” into the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scandal and attaching properties of consortium of banks on basis of “incomplete facts”.Ordering release of properties attached by ED, to the tune of Rs 323 crores, mortgaged/hypothecated with the consortium of banks led by ICICI, the Tribunal has held that “innocent banks have become victims of fraud perpetuated” by Mehul Choksi and his companies including Gitanjali gems and others which has been aggravated by “mechanical” attachment of properties which are not even proceeds of crime.Paving the way for recovery of dues by banks, the Tribunal has ruled “public Sectors banks money is the public money. The banks are in critical conditions as these alleged accused have cheated every citizen of this country”.The order reads “value of the properties …has depreciated significantly and is deteriorating on a daily basis, such that any delay in enforcement of recovery by the Appellant (banks) would be rendered meaningless”.Referring to Mehul Choksi and Nirav Modi , the Tribunal has held “banks money has been looted by these cheaters. No doubt, they should also be dealt with criminal liabilities, but recovery process cannot be stalled in this way. These joneys are always happy if their mortgage properties shall remain attached and should not be disposed of”.The order further reads “Most of the banks are public sector banks. Their valid and legal recovery cannot be blocked for years without valid reasons”.Opposing the application of ICICI bank, ED in its response had said “It is further submitted that during the course of investigation it was revealed that Shri Mehul Choksi was desperately trying to dispose of his entire properties.”Slamming the ED for making a “a malafide afterthought and desperate attempt to improve its case” at the appellate stage, the Tribunal dubbed ED’s claim as a “bald statement”. It has held that ED failed to place on record any material to corroborate and substantiate its claim.Coming down heavily on ED for citing “reason to believe” to attach properties under the statute, the Tribunal said “reason to believe cannot be subjective satisfaction of the officer concerned. It is not an arbitrary power which can be mechanically exercised”. The Tribunal recorded that ED failed to supply copy of any valid reason justifying the attachment of the properties which were mortgaged way back in 2004 whereas as per case made out by probe agencies the bank fraud was committed by Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and others between 2015-2017.The Tribunal has also rebuked the adjudicating authority of ED for taking a somersault from its own stand on the issue of attachment of properties.“ED whose finding found favour with the adjudicating authority, submitted that the proceeds of crime generated were layered out of the country and were accordingly not available in the country for attachment. Erroneously, the adjudicating authority then went ahead to take a diametrically opposite view”, the order passed last month reads.The adjudicating authority in its order said “There is considerable evidence regarding generation of proceeds of crime by commission of the scheduled offences. There is sufficient evidence of such proceeds of crime having been utilized by the defendants (banks). …It is concluded that the properties …… are all involved in money laundering”.Questioning the U-turn taken by the adjudicating authority, the Tribunal in its order has held “admittedly since the accused persons siphoned the proceeds of crime out of the country, the properties in question cannot be said to have been involved in the offence of Money laundering and hence be generated as a result of criminal activities. Furthermore, the immoveable properties were purchased prior to the commission of the predicate offence”.ED had submitted before the Tribunal that a total of Rs 6097.63 crores was generated by Choksi’s Gitanjali Group which siphoned off funds from Punjab National Bank and allegedly layered overseas for making payments to overseas suppliers. All proceeds of crime were generated and siphoned out of the country.
