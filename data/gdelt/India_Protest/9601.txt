No paper work was done in these offices as the staff remained on pen-down strike.

In Jalandhar district, work remained suspended in all tehsils, including Shahkot, Nakodar and Phillaur. Nearly 225 employees working in these offices held a gate rally against the government for not accepting their demand to recruit additional staff on vacant posts and clearing promotions.

In Bathinda, people visiting various offices at the mini-secretariat had to return home dejected, as they didn’t find any staffon seats. Almost all offices wore a deserted look.

Baldev Singh of Kotshamir village said, “I had landed here early in the morning to apply for arms licence so as to avoid long queues. But the staff members are on strike. I will have to come some other day again.” The scenario was no different in other offices.

In Ludhiana, employees carried out a gate rally to mark their protest and raised slogans against the government.

The employees have been demanding the release of dearness allowance pending for the past 23 months.

The employees in Patiala remained on strike for the second day over their demands of reinstating old pension scheme for workers hired after 2004, filling vacancies of superintendents and others.
