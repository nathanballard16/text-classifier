In an interview with Aaj Tak at the Aaj Tak Agenda, Union Home Minister Amit Shah's first-ever interview after Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), he talked about the controversial Act and the protests that soon followed.

Talking about students from across India protesting against the CAA, Amit Shah said that the students haven't read the Act thoroughly and are being mislead.

Amit Shah said that if the students resort to stonepelting then the police will be forced to take action.

Amit Shah said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Centre is ready to hold a dialogue with the protesting students.

Talking about the question that Delhi Police entered into Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University's library to take action against the protesting students Amit Shah said that the police had to take action.

"If students or someone with the protesting students tries to burn down public property or resort to violence and the police do not take action then I believe the police is not doing its duty. When a protest becomes violent then it is the duty of the police to contain the violence, and they did so - fulfilling their duty," Amit Shah said in the interview.

Amit Shah said that a time will come when the police will also clarify on what compelled them to go into the campus and library.

Amit Shah also talked about violent anti-CAA protest in East Delhi's Seelampur and put the blame on the Opposition. Amit Shah said, "The Opposition is misleading people."
