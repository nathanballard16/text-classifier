A group of NIFT housekeeping workers staged a protest over the alleged inaction against a professor, who has been accused of sexual harassment in Hyderabad. They shouted slogans and displayed placards against the management. The protesters claimed that neither the Internal Complaints Committee nor the police had taken any action against the accused faculty member. One the workers said that four members of his team have been sexually abused. They had filed a complaint against the perpetrator even seven months ago, but no action was taken. The police detained the demonstrators and Deputy Commissioner of Police Madhapur Venkateshwar said, “We are also looking into the aspect of a possible fake case as the faculty accused had pulled up the contractor last year for their poor performance.” The National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) had sacked 56 female workers for staging the protest. However, the institute reinstated them after drawing flak from every nook and corner. Following criticism from different quarters for sacking the workers for protesting over the alleged sexual harassment, NIFT Hyderabad restored the contract with a manpower agency employing them.
