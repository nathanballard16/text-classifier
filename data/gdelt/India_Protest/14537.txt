Anti-India protest held in Switzerland

Hundreds of people from across Europe assembled at Broken Chair, outside the United Nations (UN) Office in Geneva on Wednesday and held a protest rally against India.

People from all walks of life belonging to all faiths attended the protest demonstration. They included Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and people of other faiths.

The protestors demanded that India should stop killing minorities and setting Jews on fire. They said Assam was under siege while there was no place of another Indian spy in Nagaland. The protestors also said that India is known as the ‘land of oppression’ due to its continuous violence against minorities.
