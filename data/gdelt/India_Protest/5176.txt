No scams, no riots in two years: Yogi Adityanath

LUCKNOW: Chief minister Yogi Adityanath presented a report card on the completion of two years of his government on Tuesday and said not a single riot took place in the state after BJP came to power."My government has changed the perception about UP in two years," said Yogi while claiming that the law and order in UP has become a model for the country.Speaking to reporters, Yogi said, "When I assumed office in March 2017, debt-ridden farmers were committing suicides and UP had become synonymous with murder, loot and riots. Mafia was looting state's resources under political patronage. There was an era of scams. Our government has changed the perception about the state and improved its image. The better atmosphere has become a ' nazeer' (model) for the country." "People were forced to leave their home and migrate from places like Kairana because of communal tension during SP regime," he said, while recounting a number of communal incidents in the state under previous government.Yogi said that schemes like Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana - which is expected to benefit more than 1 crore farmers of UP - and farm loan waiver schemes benefited the debt-ridden farmers who were ignored by SP, BSP and Congress regimes. He also held previous governments responsible for the piling up of cane arrears over the years. The CM said the government rose above caste and religious lines to reach out to all people through various schemes which would eventually help BJP in getting a clear mandate in Lok Sabha elections.
