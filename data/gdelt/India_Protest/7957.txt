IkkJutt Jammu urges Govt of India to strengthen VDCs in erstwhile Doda - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

Excelsior Correspondent

JAMMU, May 16: IkkJutt Jammu has appealed the Government of India to not only increase the number of VDCs in the entire Doda, Bhaderwah, Kishtwar, Ramban belt but, also to equip them with sophisticated weapons so that they could defeat the evil game plan of the anti-national elements, who have been trying to cause migration of the nationalists from the areas since 1990.

“IkkJutt Jammu wants people to understand the ramifications of a Jihadi war in Jammu province and also be aware about the support which Jihadi forces are getting from segments of political class and administration. A United battle against Jihad will only save Jammu and IkkJutt Jammu is committed to fight it at all costs and defeat it,” said Ankur Sharma, Chairman of IkkJutt Jammu, while addressing a press conference, here today.

Expressing serious concern about safety and security of the minorities in erstwhile Doda, IkkJutt Jammu chief also lambasted the State BJP for taking the situation very lightly despite having four MLAs and one MP from the area.

“IkkJutt Jammu appeals to all patriotic citizens to stand as one people behind the minorities of Kishtwar, Bhaderwah, Ramban and Doda, who are facing an organised onslaught at the hands of fundamentalist forces,” he said and also extended unflinching support to Sanatana Dharma Sabha Kishtwar for its Kishtwar Bandh call.

“We will not hesitate to give a call for entire Jammu to march to the vulnerable areas and express solidarity with the people living there, who are resisting the onslaughts with full might and holding their own. We appreciate the role played by the organisations like Sanatan Dharma Sabha Kishtwar despite the fact that political parties in Jammu province are yet to register the gravity of the situation in Kishtwar, Bhaderwah, Ramban and Doda,” Ankur Sharma said.

Condemning the attack on minorities’ establishments and an attempt to vandalise the ancient religious place at Bhaderwah today, Ankur Sharma said that IkkJutt Jammu was aware not only about the radicalisation and militarisation of a section, but also of the spread of ISIS type ideology in the area. “We are baffled why mainstream political parties are even reluctant to protest peacefully against the developments in this area,” he exclaimed.
