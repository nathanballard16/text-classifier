Amit Shah: No going back on CAA Bill, govt firm like rock

Congress, TMC have misled people on CAA: Amit Shah

NEW DELHI: Unfazed by protests, home minister and BJP president Amit Shah on Tuesday asserted that the government was determined to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act and said police action at Jamia Millia University was necessitated to contain mob violence in which public property was damaged and the situation had to be brought under control.Addressing the India Economic Conclave, Shah also said one should not exaggerate protests against CAA as around 22 universities witnessed some reactions. Of these, only four campuses — Aligarh Muslim University , Jamia Millia, Lucknow and JNU — witnessed protests on a large scale.“One should know that there are over 400 universities in the country and reports of agitation have been reported from around 22,” Shah said. He said the police action in Jamia was taken against those engaging in vandalism and arson. “Violence in any form can’t be justified. However, do you think law and order can be ensured by waiting for things to worsen?” a combative Shah asked.He said incidents in Jamia showed that the situation was serious. “It is being probed from where the stones came from. There were a large number of outsiders other than students. Video footage is showing how many buses were burnt. How will violence be contained in such a situation?” the minister asked.Shah reiterated that there was no going back on the CAA and the government was firm like rock on its implementation even if it faced opposition from its political rivals.Earlier in the day, addressing a public meeting in West Delhi, Shah said the Modi government will give Indian citizenship to persecuted non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan so that they live with dignity.
