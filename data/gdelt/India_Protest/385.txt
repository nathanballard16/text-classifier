HMS to oppose new trade union Bill

The Hind Mazdoor Sabha (HMS) has decided to join the January 8 and 9 all-India trade union strike in protest against the anti-labour provisions in the new trade union Bill the Modi government is contemplating on introducing in Parliament.

In a statement here, HMS leader G. Suganan said various provisions contained in the draft Bill were a big let down to the working class as it takes away several hard-earned workers’ rights.

The HMS was strongly opposed to the provisions related to recognition of trade unions and the responsibility being thrust on labour to maintain industrial peace.

The proposed Bill gives enormous powers to the government, which aims at creating a trade union set up that would do its bidding.

Talks

Mr. Suganan noted that the Centre had held discussions only with the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS), a pro-BJP-RSS trade union.

The HMS, which has strong presence in several industrial sector as an independent union, will line up with other trade unions to protect workers’ rights that had been won through long-drawn struggles.

Legislations such as the Indian Trade Union Act, Bonus Act, Minimum Wages Act, Factories Act, Provident Fund Act and Gratuities Act were very important for the workers of the country and the move to codify the Acts under a single omnibus legislation would lead to the termination of hard-earned benefits, he said.
