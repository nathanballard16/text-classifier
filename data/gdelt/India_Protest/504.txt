Mumbai: Nurses in Nair Hospital protest against misbehaviour by patient's relatives

Some of the nursing staff of the BYL Nair Hospital complained about relatives of a patient misbehaving inside the hospital premises. While the staff complained and protested in the hospital, the authority settled the matter with the patient's relatives and the staff union. Trisila Kamble, nursing staff union leader, said, "This is not the first time that patients' relatives have misbehaved with us. But, we have spoken to both the parties — the nursing staff union and the patient's relatives. A 30-year-old Amrut Lokhande, a resident from Junnar village, was admitted in the Nair Hospital after his pancreas swelled up.
