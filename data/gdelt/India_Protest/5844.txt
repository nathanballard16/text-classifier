Hyderabad: Telangana Junior Doctors Association on Tuesday called an indefinite strike from April 3 demanding payment of pending stipends as well as to protest against the presence of health minister Etala Rajender at a meeting with quacks in Karimnagar.

In a representation submitted to the superintendent of Osmania General Hospital the junior doctors stated that the post graduates have not been paid for the past five months doctors in the super speciality have not been paid for seven months.

Dr H. Naresh, president of Osmania Medical College of TJUDA said, “The request to the higher officials had no results. It is also not proper for a health minister to chair a meeting with quacks. We had repeatedly pointed out that the government’s move to support PMP’s and RMP’s will be strongly objected. This is the reason for calling the indefinite.”

The doctors also protested outside the Osmania General Hospital on Tuesday evening.

Health minister Etela Rajender’s pictures of the Karminagar meeting has gone viral on social media groups as the banner in the background showed that it was a meeting of RMP's and PMP’s Welfare Association.
