New Delhi: To commemorate the jawans who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday, people on social media have urged everyone to light up three candles in their balcony on Friday.

“Kindly (light up) 3 candles in yr balcony today at 8pm to show our support n strength to Jawans n their family, full India will do it today night, pl spread this message to whole world Tks a lot , Jai Jawan Jai Bharat!!!,” the message, which is doing the rounds on social media, reads.

Meanwhile, security forces staged a protest and took out a candle march in Hyderabad against the attack.

On Thursday, at least 40 security personnel lost their lives and several others were injured after a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist rammed an explosive-laden car into a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Awantipora of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar. The Intelligence sources highlighted that the terrorists have been lying low after the attack.

Anti-Pakistan protests are being held across the nation to condemn the dastardly terror attack. While key leaders across the globe stood in support of India in the wake of the ghastly attack, anti-Pakistan slogans were raised in Uttar Pradesh.

Earlier today, a group of people congregated outside High Commission of Pakistan in New Delhi and staged a protest against the dastardly terror attack.

“You have seen what has happened yesterday. This is mass murder,” a protestor said on the killing of the CRPF personnel.
