Kolkata doctors' protest: DMA calls for complete medical bandh on Friday

Delhi Medical Association (DMA) on Thursday called for a statewide complete medical bandh on June 14 to protest against the recent assault on Kolkata resident doctors.

DMA executive, in its statement, strongly condemned the brutal violence at Nil Ratan Sarkar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata and announced that the entire medical fraternity has expressed solidarity to the seriously injured doctors.

The organisation is ready for agitation to press for strong legislation and strict action against hospital violence, the statement said.

Earlier in the day, it was reported that Resident Doctors Association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) has called for a strike on Friday in support of protesting doctors in West Bengal, following which hospital authorities issued a contingency plan for the smooth functioning of emergency healthcare services.

"Emergency services will function normally as the resident doctors will purportedly continue to work in the emergency services as per their scheduled duties," said AIIMS medical superintendent DK Sharma in an official statement.

This comes nearly four days after a junior doctor at the Kolkata hospital was allegedly attacked by the relative of a patient who died on June 10.

The incident has triggered protests from doctors in government hospitals across the country, demanding a safe working environment for medical practitioners.
