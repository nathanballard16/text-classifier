Fifteen Members of Parilaiment from the Telgu Desam Party are likely to tender their resignation from Lok Sabha on Wednesday as a token of protest against denial of special status to Andhra Pradesh.

The resignation can be termed as a political stunt as Wednesday marks the last day of the last session of 16th Lok Sabha, rendering their resignations meaningless.

Interestingly, the party's Rajya Sabha MPs will not tender their resignations.

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has been trying every trick in the bag to create some din about the demand of special status ahead of assembly elections in the state. The latest stunt by his party is yet another attempt to extend the issue and turn it into a poll agenda.

Last time such a stunt was pulled by Congress MPs over Bofors scam in 1989.

The sources told India TV Political Editor Jayanta Ghoshal that TDP chief had tried to convince others members of the anti-BJP front to join his party's legislators in tendering the resignation on the last day to stage a bigger drama.

Chandrababu Naidu is likely to use this token protest and his ongoing dharna in the national capital to stregthen his chances to be potrayed as Mahagathbandhan's prime ministerial candidate.
