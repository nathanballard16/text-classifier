BEd counselling gaffe: Ranchi University withdraws state merit list amid student protests

Ranchi: Ranchi University (RU) on Tuesday withdrew the first selection list of candidates published on Monday for admission into BEd courses across 126 colleges in the state through centralised state level counselling citing ‘technical error’.RU has been entrusted with the responsibility to conduct online counselling for admission into 12,500 BEd seats across the state through a state-level combined entrance test for subjects conducted by the Jharkhand Combined Entrance Competitive Examination Board (JCECEB), the results for which were declared on June 25.“After some of the students reported erroneous allotment of colleges to the university in the first round of counselling, we have withdrawn the first selection list for the time being. New selection lists will be announced shortly after we figure out the technical glitch in the computerised allotment process,” said Ranchi University’s public relations officer, Prakash Jha said.This is the first time that admission to BEd courses in Jharkhand is being conducted through a common entrance test, after the department of higher, technical education and skill development scrapped institution-level management quota reservations to provide fair chance to all the aspirants.Many students protested against the publication of the selection lists of colleges on Monday, alleging mismanagement in the automated allotment process.Priyanshu Mishra, a student from Hazaribag, said, “Students with lower ranks than me were allotted colleges which were my second and third choices. If I am not allotted my first choice, I should get preference for the second and third choice of colleges.”Another student from Dhanbad, Girish Kumar Singh, said: “I had planned to take admission in the college allotted to me on Wednesday. Since the admission window is so small, I planned ahead but now with the list withdrawn, I am at a loss for what to do.”Representatives of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) met the vice-chancellor on Tuesday.Ratnapriya, an aspirant who travelled to protest in front of RU from Jamshedpur, said, “I had given preferences for three colleges in Jamshedpur with merit rank 1,943. Students with ranks above 4,000 featured in the final selection list but I did not. This is completely unjust for students who have worked hard for the same.”
