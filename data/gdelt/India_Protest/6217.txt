PM Modi slams Congress for 'poll scam', sedition law repeal promise

JUNAGADH/SONGADH: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday accused the Congress of a "Tughlaq Road election scam" where money meant for poor, pregnant women was looted from people.At a poll rally, Modi also claimed that the Nehru-Gandhi family targeted leaders from Gujarat like Sardar Patel and Morarji Desai and was now targeting a 'chaiwala' like him.Notably, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath 's residence as an MP is at 1, Tughlaq Road in New Delhi, while Congress president Rahul Gandhi's residence as an MP is 12, Tughlak Lane in the national capital.The Income Tax Department recently conducted raids on close aides of Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Congress leader Kamal Nath and others in four states on Sunday.The CBDT, that frames policy for the I-T department, had said the department has also detected a trail of Rs 20 crore suspect cash allegedly being moved to the "headquarters of a major political party in Delhi" from the house of an important person who lives on Tughlaq Road, home to many VIPs."Searches in Madhya Pradesh have detected widespread and well-organised racket of collection of unaccounted cash of about Rs 281 crore through various persons in different walks of life, including business, politics and public service," it said.During a poll rally at Junagadh town in Gujarat, Modi, without naming Congress leaders, said in the last five years, he had brought them to the doorstep of jails and if he is elected again, they will be inside prisons.He took a swipe at the opposition party, saying it is known by many names as far as scams are concerned."Now, it has got a new name, but with proof. The Congress is indulging in a 'Tughlaq Road chunavi ghotala (election scam)', in which money meant for the poor is being usurped for their own leaders. Money meant for pregnant women is looted," Modi said.Referring to the raids, Modi said, "You have seen in the media in the last three to four days, how sacks full of cash were found from Congress leaders. It has not even been six months of the government in MP.""Initially, Karnataka was the ATM of the Congress, now Madhya Pradesh has become its new ATM," he said.Modi said the situation in Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh was no different and that the Congress was only interested to come to power to loot people.The developments in MP are just a "trailer" and "nothing will be left in our hands if the reins of the country are given in Congress's hands," he said, adding that the "story of Congress is a story of one family".Modi claimed that the Congress in its poll manifesto has said everybody should get bail even if they commit a serious crime."For whom is this provision, is it for your leaders? In last five years, I brought them to the doors of jails and if you give me next five years, they will be inside," he said.Taking a jibe at the Congress, Modi said while the air strikes were conducted against Pakistan, it affected the opposition party in India. "It was the Congress which got a stomach ache," he said."Modi wants to remove terrorism and they want to remove Modi. There is no abuse left which the Congress has not used against your son, your 'chowkidar' (watchman)," he added.Modi said the opposition party supports those who want to separate Jammu and Kashmir from India and a separate prime minister for the region.Recalling Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel's contribution during the freedom struggle, Modi said Patel asked the Army to bring the situation under control amidst mayhem while former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru "kept on looking"."Had he (Sardar Patel) not been there, India would not have even got Kashmir. He (Patel) merged hundreds of princely states ... and Nehru handled one princely state (Kashmir) by himself, because of which even today our soldiers are getting martyred," he said.History was witness to the Nehru-Gandhi family targeting political leaders from Gujarat like Sardar Patel and Morarji Desai, Modi claimed."Now my turn has come. They are worried that they managed Sardarsaheb, made Morarjibhai fall, but this chaiwala? He completed five years (tenure) with strength," he said.At another rally in Songadh in Gujarat, Modi targeted the Congress over its manifesto promise to repeal sedition law and reduce forces from Kashmir.The only "business" of Pakistan is to export terror, Modi said."Are people who want to break the country into tukde- tukde (pieces) not anti-nationals?... Congress is now saying that they will repeal the sedition law. Can we expect this from a 125-year-old party?," Modi said.The BJP began using the phrase "tukde tukde gang" to refer to students accused of raising anti-India slogans in Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) in 2016 and has generalised the phrase to attack those it accuses of sympathising with Maoists and separatists."The Congress manifesto is an attempt to fulfil the demands of Pakistan," Modi said.
