Woman TV journalist returns from Nilackal

Police refuse to give her security cover

Deepti Bajpai, a journalist working for the television network TV9 in Hyderabad, ended her journey to Sabarimala at Nilackal on Saturday, with the police refusing to provide security cover to her to proceed further.

Ms. Bajpai, who reached Pampa along with a cameraman on January 3, initially said she had no plans to go to Sabarimala.

However, she changed her mind and said on Friday that she would visit Sannidhanam and report from there. She sought police protection to go to the Sannidhanam, but the police refused, anticipating a backlash from the protesters at Sabarimala and on the trekking path.

Ms. Bajpai staged a protest, holding a placard, in front of the police control room at Nilackal, against the denial of security to her.

Swedish tourists return

Meanwhile, two Swedish women, Nadasa Uskov and Michael Morossa, who reached Nilackal on Saturday on their way to Sabarimala too dropped their plan and returned from the pilgrims’ base camp after they were briefed by the police on the women’s entry row.
