NCP Workers Release Crabs At Minister's Home Who Said Crabs Responsible For Tiware Dam Breach

In a response to Maharashtra minister’s bizarre comment, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) workers today staged protest outside his residence. The workers protested and threw crabs outside the residence of Maharashtra Water Conservation Minister Tanaji Sawant in Pune as against his statement on Ratnagiri’s Tiware dam breach.

The minister had said crabs were responsible for the breach in the dam located in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra.

The workers are wearing cloaks with pictures of crabs saying “What is my fault? I am not guilty.”

News agency ANI posted a video of the incident:

The dam breach in Ratnagiri on July 3 led to a flood-like situation in seven downstream villages. The death toll from the incident has reached 20 and three more people are missing.

On Thursday Sawant told reporters, “There were no leakages earlier. Leakage happened after a large number of crabs gathered around the dam. Locals brought the issue to our notice and our department acted on it. The incident is unfortunate.”

Reporters asked of the breach was a result of shoddy construction, Sawant said he only came to know about shoddy construction workers through workers.
