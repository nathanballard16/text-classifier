Congress to fly Rafale kites in Rajasthan

Congress workers will fly kites with images and messages of Rafale aircraft and the kites shall have four questions printed on them. These are the same questions that Rahul Gandhi has asking prime minister Narendra Modi in his speeches.

The idea has been initiated by Congress post holder Pankaj Sharma who met chief minister Ashok Gehlot in Jaipur on Thursday to get the kites released by him. Over twenty thousand kites would be distributed to Congress workers and public across the city to be flown during Makar Sankranti.

Congress had put up huge posters on the Rafale issue at the Rahul Gandhi farmers’ rally held in Jaipur on Wednesday. With the large number of kites now being used on the occasion of Makar sankranti, Congress has apparently found a lethal attack to take on BJP.

“We are seeking answers to questions from the Prime Minister and all BJP leaders. We dare them to answer our questions,” said Pankaj Sharma. He flayed the government of misusing ED and CBI to supress the opposition.

Sharma said that the message of corruption related to Rafale would be spread among the public. He expressed confidence that a government led by Rahul Gandhi would be formed at the Centre.

The Congress has been aggressively pushing the Rafale deal as its politcial pitch against the BJP-led government under prime minister Narendra Modi at the Centre. The party has continued with its stand that the deal reeks of corruption and that the PM is at the centre of it.

The Congress stand is inspite of the the Supreme Court giving clean chit to the deal in its hearing.

Rahul Gandhi, the Congress president, is still building the poll plank for general elections around the fighter jet procurement by the NDA government. The Congress had even put up hoardings at the recently held rally in Jaipur attended by Rahul Gandhi and a bevy of Congress leaders.
