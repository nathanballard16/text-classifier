New Delhi, November 20

The HRD Ministry-appointed committee met JNU Students’ Union (JNUSU) members on Wednesday with an assurance to visit the campus on Friday, even as visually-challenged students of the university staged a protest outside the police headquarters here against the alleged lathicharge by the force on those protesting against a recent hostel fee hike.

“The high-power committee of the Human Resource Development (HRD) Ministry met students from the JNU on Wednesday and took stock of their views at a cordial meeting at Shastri Bhawan. They agreed to meet the students again on Friday at the JNU campus to find solutions to the current issue,” a senior official of the ministry said.

“The committee appealed to the students to restore normalcy on the campus immediately, to which the students responded positively,” he added. When the meeting was underway, visually-challenged students of JNU staged a stir outside the old police headquarters here against the alleged lathicharge by the force on the differently-abled students of the university taking part in the protest against the hostel fee hike.

The students met Delhi Police Public Relations Officer (PRO) and Deputy Commissioner of Police (Central) Mandeep Singh Randhawa and apprised him of the alleged instances of “lathicharge and manhandling” of differently-abled students during the protests on Monday.

The students have been agitating for over three weeks, demanding a rollback of the hostel fee hike. The HRD Ministry constituted the three-member committee on Monday to recommend ways to restore normal functioning at the JNU. —PTI
