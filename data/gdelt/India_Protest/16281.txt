800 Of 1,800 Trees Transplanted From Aarey Forest By Mumbai Metro Are Dead

Continuing with the destruction that BMC had caused recently in the Aarey Colony for the construction of metro shed, 800 of the 1,800 trees that were transplanted have died.

An order allowed the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Ltd (MMRCL) to cut down trees for the construction of a car shed in Aarey Colony. The initial order allowed the MMRCL to cut more than 3,000 trees. However, protests by environmentalists and activists prompted the Supreme Court to intervene which led to a stay order.

Still, more than 2,100 trees were cut overnight by BMC officials at the site.

Shifting in to damage control mode, the MMRCL claimed that they were also transplanting some trees.

Reports suggest that so far 1,800 trees have been transplanted.

A report by India Today says that trees were transplanted at various locations in Mumbai, especially the Aarey and Sanjay Gandhi National Park.

“The trees were tagged with laminated paper, numbered and it was mentioned from where the trees were brought. Some of the trees were in good condition but many of the trees were in extremely poor condition,” said the report.

It said that many of the trees had died while some were only left with stems. The trees transplanted at other locations were also found to be in similar condition.

On October 9, MMRCL claimed that it has permanently saved 1,089 trees from metro car shed plot in the Aarey Colony “while 2,141 trees were felled per the tree authority order upheld by Bombay High Court.” It noted that 461 trees are to be transplanted subsequently.

The MRRCL additionally claimed that they have planted around 24,000 trees across Mumbai including Aarey Colony and other degraded areas of the Sanjay Gandhi National Park. “"Sturdy native species like Behada, Kadamb, Karanj 6-12 inch girth & 12-15 ft height planted," it tweeted.
