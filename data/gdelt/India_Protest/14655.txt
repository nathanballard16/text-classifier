Doles being handed to corporates at expense of farmers, claim Left parties

NEW DELHI: Left parties on Friday slammed the BJP government for the “deepening crisis” in the Indian economy and said concessions and doles were being handed out to corporates at the expense of farmers.Referring to the government’s decision as a “definite fascist trend” in the country, CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said Modi government provided relief of over Rs 2.25 lakh crore to the rich in India but shied away from helping farmers forced to commit suicide due to farm distress.The Left convention, attended by all Left parties including CPM, CPI, All India Forward Bloc and Revolutionary Socialist Party, also announced that they will hold nationwide protests against the government from October 10 to 16.“Unemployment is at its highest level in 50 years. Industries and businesses are ruined and people are suffering job losses,” Yechury claimed.CPI general secretary D Raja stressed the need to save the working class people and deprived sections of the society. “The Indian economy is in shambles. Instead of retrieving it, the RSS-BJP combine have plunged the country in a political-social crisis,” Raja said, referring to the government’s decision to scrap Article 370 , impose NRC in Assam and the rise in instances of mob lynchings..A joint statement from the five Left parties also said the protests were being held to demand from the government that public investment be increased to generate employment, an unemployment allowance be given to youth and monthly minimum wage be fixed at Rs 18,000.
