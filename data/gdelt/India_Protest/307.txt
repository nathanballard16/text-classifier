"You'll Be Finished": Chandrababu Naidu After BJP Leaders Block Convoy

Chandrababu Naidus convoy was blocked by BJP leaders in Kakinada.

Highlights BJP men had blocked Mr Naidu's convoy to protest his comments against PM

He has been criticising PM for not granting special status to Andhra

Chandrababu Naidu's party walked out of the NDA alliance last year

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Friday vented his anger at a group of BJP workers after they blocked his convoy to protest his comments against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Mr Naidu was in East Godavari district for the 'Janmabhoomi maa vooru' event in Kakinada when BJP leaders, including some corporators, raised slogans against the chief minister saying 'CM go back'.

"You will get beaten up. Don't invite unnecessary trouble. You will be finished. Do you support the injustice meted out to AP? If you go on the streets, people will teach you a lesson," he said.

Mr Naidu has been constantly criticising PM Modi and the BJP, accusing them of betraying the people of Andhra Pradesh by not granting special status to the state.

On Tuesday, Mr Naidu had claimed that he bowed down to satisfy the ego of Prime Minister Modi for getting things done for his state, yet the central government did not cooperate in the last four years.

Chandrababu Naidu's party, TDP, walked out of the NDA alliance in March last year, claiming that the promises made by the centre during the bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh were not kept.

Since then he has constantly flayed the central government over denial of Special Category Status or SCS to the state and 'failure' to implement provisions of the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014 and accused the Prime Minister of seeking to create a wedge between the two Telugu states.

PM Modi was scheduled to visit the state on January 6 but subsequently postponed his visit to later this month.
