Shimla, June 18

It was a momentous day for BJP workers who celebrated the appointment of senior party leader JP Nadda as the party’s working president.

Jubilant workers gathered at the headquarters in Shimla, burst crackers, distributed sweets and danced in ecstasy.

Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur, Health Minister Vipin Parmar, state BJP chief Satpal Singh Satti and other leaders joined the celebrations in the BJP office.

Hailing the appointment of Nadda, the Chief Minister said, “The BJP will continue to win trust of people and serve society by building a strong, developed and inclusive India under his able leadership.”

Addressing party workers, he said Nadda had a vast experience of serving the government and the party at different levels. Starting from the president of the Students Central Association of the HPU, national president of the BJYM, leader of Opposition, Cabinet Minister in the state, national general secretary of the party, Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare and member of the BJP parliamentary board, Nadda had a long journey to reach the top.

Satti said it was indeed a moment of pride for the people that Nadda rose from a party worker to the top post of the world’s biggest political party.

Former CM Shanta Kumar thanked PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah for reposing trust in him.
