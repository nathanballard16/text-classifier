WB Congress unit to hold protest rally demanding immediate conclusion in Saradha, Rose valley probe

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], Feb 4 (ANI): The West Bengal unit of Congress party will hold a protest rally on February 6 demanding the immediate conclusion in the investigation of Saradha, Rose valley and other chit fund scams.

The state unit is also demanding immediate arrest of the accused persons in Narada scam.

Saradha financial scandal was a major scam which trapped the poor and the marginalized people by promising them huge returns in lieu of their investment. According to reports, the group was successful in raising Rs 200 to 300 billion from millions of depositors before collapsing in April 2013.

It is believed that Rose Valley scam was even bigger than the Saradha scam and according to Enforcement Directorate estimates more than Rs 15,000 crore was reportedly collected from depositors across India mainly from West Bengal, Assam and Bihar.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has been on dharna in Kolkata since Sunday evening protesting against the CBI questioning of the Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar in the Rose Valley and Saradha ponzi scams.

The CBI team had come to question Rajeev Kumar after he allegedly ignored summons from the investigative agency on the two Ponzi schemes. The Saradha and Rose Valley scams were exposed to Bengal in 2013. (ANI)
