Pulwama attack: Anti-Pak protest held in London

London [UK], Feb 17 (ANI): Hundreds of Indians living in the UK on Saturday staged a protest outside the Pakistan High Commission in London against the ghastly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district that claimed the lives of about 40 CRPF personnel.

Chanting ‘Pakistan Murdabad’ (down with Pakistan) slogans, the protesters accused Islamabad of providing sanctuary to several terrorist outfits who are responsible for carrying out terror activities in India.

Waving Indian flags, the demonstrators raised slogans of ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Kashmir Hamara Hai’. They urged the UK government to stop any military cooperation or aid with Pakistan.

The Pulwama terror attack that took place on Thursday was orchestrated by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) outfit. The convoy comprised of 78 buses in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

Around 42 martyred jawans were in a bus, into which the suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle. It was the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir.

Following the assault, India on Friday withdrew the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan. The international community too has expressed support to India in the wake of the attack. (ANI)
