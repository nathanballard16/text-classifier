Opinion : The Modi government’s new citizenship law puts India at war with itself

Yes, the causes driving youth rage are not uniform. In the east of India, where there are more than 200 indigenous tribes, the citizenship law is reviled for allowing migrants in at all, whether Hindu, Muslim or Buddhist. In the north, the student movement is calling out the law for being blatantly tilted against Muslims. Once the NRC is implemented, the fear is that it will be primarily Muslims, especially the poorer among them, who will be asked to prove their citizenship. It would not be an exaggeration to say that these twin projects of prejudice could see only Muslims end up in deportation centers or before so-called foreigners tribunals.
