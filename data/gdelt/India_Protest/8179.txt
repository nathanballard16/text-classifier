Farmers stage protest

Members of Left-oriented outfits staged a protest near Sengipatti on Wednesday in protest against the move by GAIL to lay pipelines across agricultural fields.

Thanjavur district unit vice-president of All India Agricultural Workers Union V.Jeevakumar and representatives of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), Budalur, demanded an explanation from officials about the stocking of pipes near the fields at Ayodhipatti and Ayyasamypatti near Sengipatti on Tuesday night.

Led by them, the public gathered at the location where pipes were stocked and prevented unloading of pipes brought in a goods carrier. They relented after officials of revenue and police departments assured to remove the pipes within two days.

Representatives of the outfits assailed the Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palanisamy saying the AIADMK government’s consent for laying pipes across farm lands in 75 villages in Thanjavur, Tiruvarur, Nagapattinam, Pudukottai and Tiruchi was against the stand taken by the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa.

They condemned the Union and State governments for proceeding with the hydrocarbon, Shale Gas and other “anti-environment projects” which were shelved in 2012-13 in view of stiff resistance from farmers.
