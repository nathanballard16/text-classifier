Cooked-up medical records, a well-oiled racket

Dr Manish Hadiya had given his lab for Rs 10,000 per month

Vadodara: Preparing fake medical test reports at a pathological laboratory in Vadu, which was exposed last month, was a well-oiled system run by members from within the medical science fraternity.

Investigations have revealed that the Swara Path Lab was owned by a homoeopath named Dr Manish Hadiya while Jaimin Shah, who was arrested earlier, was only managing operations for part of the profits.

Hadiya, who runs a clinic at Dabhasa, had opened the path laboratory in his daughter’s name along with lab technician Vipul Rathod and Shah. Since none of them were qualified, they allegedly met Dr Sunil Surve who works as pathologist at GMERS Medical College and Hospital in Gotri. Shah and another lab technician Sachin Joshi knew Surve as they used to work together at a laboratory in Dandia Bazaar. Surve allowed the trio to use his degree and signature to run the laboratory and authorize the test reports.

“As per Surve’s direction, Rathod used to forge his signature on the reports. But when Rathod decided to stop working, Hadiya handed over the operations to Shah,” said a police official.

“Hadiya used to keep 50% of the money earned and the remaining was being shared by Joshi and Shah while Surve was being paid Rs 10,000 every month,” the police official added.

Police said that during probe it also came to light Surve is a partner in a pathological laboratory at Mujmahuda. Surve has given oral consent to use his digital signature on the reports, cops said.

While the role of Surve, Shah, Joshi and Rathod has been revealed in police records and documents, cops are tight-lipped about Hadiya as he is absconding.

Meanwhile, both Surve and Hadiya have sought anticipatory bail from court. The hearing in their bail pleas got over on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively and the orders will be declared on Thursday and Friday.
