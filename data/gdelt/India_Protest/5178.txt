White supremacist threat:Canadian Sikhs seek removal of Khalistani reference from safety report

The report also mentions the 1985 Air India bombing which claimed 331 lives stating that there were some individuals in Canada who continued to support Sikh (Khalistan) extremist ideologies and movements. AMRITSAR: Fearing attack by white supremacist groups, Sikhs in Canada have urged the Canadian government to immediately remove Sikh (Khalistani) component from Canada’s 2018 report on the terrorism threat to Canada.Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Khalistan exponent Sukhminder Singh Hansra, who is also president of SAD (A), Canada East, said after the recent incident in New Zealand, Sikhs in Canada feared an attack of white supremacist groups since the report could incite violence against immigrant communities. Sikhs, Muslims (Shia and Sunni) could be the target of hate crime, he said.Hansra claimed that ‘2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada’ was promoting hate against immigrant communities and they could be subject to an attack as in Christchurch, New Zealand, where “50 Muslims were gunned down by a white supremacist who claims to be racist against immigrants”.Canadian Khalistani Sikhs who want to separate Punjab and adjoining areas from India to form Khalistan had protested after the Canadian government added a separate component of Khalistani extremism in its ‘2018 Public Report on the Terrorism Threat to Canada’.
