Kolkata: Doctors all across the country are resorting to protests to express their solidarity against the recent attack on a junior doctor. In wake of the recent events, the doctors also announced that they will abstain from providing routine services from 8 am to 5 pm on Friday, June 14.

The lives of several people are at stake as the doctors are refusing to resume their operations. Left at the mercy of the furious doctors, a newborn died on Thursday, June 13 in Agarpara.

The father of the newborn, Abhijit Mallik told news agency ANI," It is my bad luck. My child died due to lack of treatment. He was not attended by any doctor because of their strike."

The newborn was born on Tuesday, June 11 and was suffering with a breathing problem. When the condition of the newborn worsened, the doctors asked the parents to take him to a child-specialist hospital. Mallik said that even though they took the newborn to several hospitals, all the doctors refused to tend to him. Mallik further alleged that the health department of the state did not respond to his call.

Doctors resorted to protests after a junior doctor of the Nil Ratan Sarkar (NRS) Medical College and Hospital, West Bengal was attacked. Allegedly, the relative of a patient attacked the doctor after the patient died. The incident took place on Monday, June 10. The doctors are demanding adequate security in medical colleges and hospital. The protests have now spread to Hyderabad, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Cuttack and Delhi.
