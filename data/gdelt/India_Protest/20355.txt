Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's Visit Postponed as India Witnesses Violent Protests Over Citizenship Law

As violent protests against the Citizenship Law spread to more areas of northeast India, including Assam state, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's visit has been deferred.

He was due to be in India to participate in a crucial annual summit scheduled for next week. Since this is a yearly summit, it effectively means that India and Japan would have to skip it in 2019 - unless the meeting is held in the next 15 days.

The Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that "both sides have decided to defer the visit to a mutually convenient date in the near future".

The summit was planned to take place in Guwahati, the capital city of the northeastern state of Assam. But it has been witnessing violent protests since 9 December.
