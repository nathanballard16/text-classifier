Ramulu Naik demands CM’s explanation on 9% ST quota

Hyderabad: Former MLC Ramulu Naik on Wednesday demanded that Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao explain about his much talked-about promise of 9 percent reservation to STs in the State. He said it was not good to keep the reservations issue in cold storage on pretext of Chellappa Commission report.

Talking to mediapersons here today, Ramulu Naik said several ST students were losing a lot due to lack of reservations in the State. He also alleged that KCR, who had promised to hold a protest in Delhi on the issue, has forgotten about it. He said they would chalk out an action plan if the CM continues to keep calm on the issue. Naik also said they would hold a round table on the issue and storm the residence of the Chief Minister.
