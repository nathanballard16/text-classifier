Cong says PM attacked India’s cultural diversity calling oppn alliance an ‘adulteration’

NEW DELHI: With prime minister Narendra Modi dubbing the multi-party opposition alliance as “maha milawat” (adulteration), Congress accused the BJP mascot of attacking the country’s cultural diversity by questioning the political participation of regional parties.Senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel said, “From Kolkata to Chennai, from Jammu and Kashmir to Kanyakumari – it is not called adulteration, it is called country’s diversity. The people of India will teach a lesson to those who mock it out of arrogance.”The Congress response highlighted that it would use Modi’s “mocking description” of the opposition parties to corner the BJP in states on the issue of regional pride. Trinamool Congress, Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, RJD, RLSP, SP, BSP, DMK, TDP are among the parties that joined the opposition rally in Kolkata.AICC spokesman Manish Tewari asked if Modi thinks that Atal Bihari Vajpayee government was a “milawati” regime, referring to NDA regimes which were multi-party coalitions. He said the BJP also supported the V P Singh government as part of coalition.Since he started his election campaign, PM Modi has repeatedly attacked the opposition by saying that a coalition government would result in chaos. Earlier, Ahmed Patel had challenged the PM to declare that he would not try to form the government if BJP failed to score a majority in the coming Lok Sabha polls.
