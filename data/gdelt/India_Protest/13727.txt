Asomiya Muslim Kalyan Parishad (AMKP) Says NRC Incomplete

STAFF REPORTER

GUWAHATI: The Asomiya Muslim Kalyan Parishad (AMKP) raged that Imran Khan is not the guardian of Indian Muslims and should not interfere in internal matters of the State.

President of the parishad Rahamsha Ali, while addressing the media on Tuesday said, “After the scrapping of Article 370, the remarks against India made by Pakistan’s Prime Minister is highly suspicious. Imran Khan is not the guardian of Indian Muslims. Pakistan is India’s enemy, which makes it the enemy of all Indian Muslims.” Ali further alleged that the final NRC is incomplete and remains far from flawless with many indigenous names left out. “Until a single indigenous name is left out, we will never be satisfied. We are also suspicious that lakhs of Bangladeshis’ names have made the list. Due to the illegal immigrants, the identity of the indigenous Muslims of the State are now in danger,” said Rahamsha Ali.

After the press meet, the Asomiya Muslim Kalyan Parishad burned the effigy of Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan.
