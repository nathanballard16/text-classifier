BHU department reopens after days of protests over teacher's appointment

The Faculty of Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan at Banaras Hindu University (BHU) has reopened, the university announced, after days of protests by a section of students over the appointment of a Muslim professor at the department.

"The Faculty of Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan, Banaras Hindu University, has reopened," a tweet by the university said on Thursday.

A section of students have been demonstrating against Feroze Khan's appointment at the department. Although the BHU has backed him, Khan has been unable to take classes.

The protesters say only a Hindu can teach Sanskrit at the university in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi.
