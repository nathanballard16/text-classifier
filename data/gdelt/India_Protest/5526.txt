Work at Kabeli Corridor halted

Panchthar, March 26

Workers deployed along the Panchthar section of Kabeli Corridor have halted work saying that they were not paid their wages for the past four months.

Workers mobilised to erect towers and pillars and cable electricity wires from Chokmagu to Pallotar at Phidim headquarters stopped work from early morning today.

India’s Aster Private Limited had signed the contract for tower construction and cabling power wires.

Kamal Khabash, a worker, said they were forced to halt work as the contractor company had not paid workers, rent for vehicles hired and employees of vehicles for the past four months. “The company has to pay Rs 2.5 lakh to each worker,” said Khabash.

As many as 50 workers are involved in construction of this section of the road.

The company’s site in-charge Yagya Prasad Bhattarai expressed ignorance about the non-payment of wages as it was related to the finance department.

Another labourer Hari Basnet said that they had to stop work as the company had not paid them on a monthly basis as per the agreement.

“We shall resume work as soon as we receive remuneration,” Basnet said.
