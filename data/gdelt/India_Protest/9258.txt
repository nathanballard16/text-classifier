NEW DELHI: The medical fraternity and their supporters countrywide took to Twitter to show solidarity towards doctors in Bengal who are protesting against "murderous" attacks on them. The online protests, under the hashtag, Doctors Fight Back, trended in India through the evening, with many social media users, including politicians, emphasising the need to provide them proper security.The protests started at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital (NRSMCH) after two interns — Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani — were attacked on Monday by the family of a patient who passed away. Mukhopadhyay suffered serious injuries in the assault, setting the stage for a protest, which rapidly spread to other parts of the country.On Friday, the plea to save doctors and the medical fraternity's resolve to fight back took centrestage on social media platforms."Years of hard work to be just worthy of that WHITE COAT. Instead of saving the public’s blood, it got stained with MY OWN. #SaveTheSaviour #DoctorsFightBack #TREATUSASHUMANS," tweeted a user who goes by the handle @SandhuSurbhi.Another user, Mainak Mascharak, who claims to be a medical professional, wrote, "We don't toil for 5 yrs to get beaten up for no fault. This trend of attacking doctors should stop. #stand_with_NRS #SaveDoctors Don't forget doctors are humans too. The whole fraternity stands united. #DoctorsFightBack.""A white coat has no colour. Don’t divide doctors into political party #StopViolenceAgainstDoctors #DoctorsFightBack," tweeted another user, who goes by the handle @deephsoni.Politicians across the spectrum also condemned the attacks on doctors. Union minister Harsh Vardhan wrote, "Heinous repeated attacks on doctors across India esp WBengal have led to this situation. Govt must pass a Law to make any attack on Docs a non-bailable offence with min 12 yr jail. Draconian Clinical Establishment Act that treats Docs as criminals must be withdrawn."Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala also lent his support to the medical fraternity. "Violence of any kind calls for a blanket condemnation. But violence against doctors, who have dedicated their lives to save and cure others, is absolutely reprehensible & unacceptable... #DoctorsStrike," he wrote from his official handle @rssurjewala.Left leader Sitaram Yechury tweeted, " West Bengal govt must invite health workers & resolve this humanitarian crisis on a war footing. CM is trying to politicise instead of discharging basic responsibility. BJP wants to communalise by highlighting the religious identity of victims of a tragedy."
