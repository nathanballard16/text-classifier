TISS Hyderabad campus to remain closed indefinitely amid student protests

TISS Hyderabad: In a recent development, the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) has decided to keep its Hyderabad campus closed for an indefinite period. All the academic activities have been suspended with immediate effect until further orders are received from the administration. Apart from this, all the students have been asked to vacate the campus. This has been an outcome of an ongoing protest that the students have been involved in. The students have been on hunger strike as the fees for the hostel and mess have been increased by the institute.

In a conversation with a media house, Professor Vindhya, the Acting Deputy Director of the TISS said, "The students have been denying us entry from the past one week. We had a meeting with them and said that we can't have talks in this kind of atmosphere. So, our Mumbai administration has suspended academic activity indefinitely. Indefinite closure has been declared and the campus will reopen once normalcy is restored." It is important to know that the campus has been shifted to Turkayamjal from Rajendranagar. With the changes in the campus, there has been a change in the hostel fees and mess fees. The increase in the fee has given rise to the protest.

The students had complained of the safety and security measures in the campus. They had also blamed that the administration has said that the campus is non-residential from the current academic year. The students have been obstructing the entry of the faculty members in the academic block. Owing to this, the campus has been put on closure for an indefinite period.The students have been saying that they have been under trouble as they have questioned the decision of the institute of hiking the fees. The Students Action Committee is now thinking of the future course of action.
