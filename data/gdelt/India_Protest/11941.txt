Outfit to protest in Delhi on Aug 9 for enhanced pension

A pensioners' organisation here announced on Tuesday that it would hold a sit-in protest in Delhi on August 9 to press for enhanced monthly basic pension and dearness allowance.

The Employees' Pension Scheme -95 Rashtriya Sangharsh Samiti (EPS-95 RSS) coordinator RA Dharkar told PTI that basic pension and dearness allowance should be hiked to Rs 7,500 per month as the current amount, between Rs 200 and 2,500, is insufficient.

"We are going to stage a sit-in at Employees Provident Fund Organisation headquarters in New Delhi on August 9 for hike in pension. The pension should be a basic of Rs 7,500 and DA under EPS-95," Dharkar told PTI.

He said the Supreme Court had, in April, ruled that pensioners under EPS-95 should be given enhanced amounts.

He said pensioners and their spouses should get free medical facilities as well.

The protest will be led by the organisation's president Ashok Raut, he added.
