Protect me and punish those protested against me: Mudigere BJP MLA writes to Home Minister

Mudigere, Feb 22: BJP leader and Mudigere MLA M P Kumaraswamy has written to the Home Minister seeking protection in the wake of a recent protest against him by the local unit of the Communist Party of India.

The MLA, in his letter written on Tuesday, said in the year 2004 a few people under the leadership of Devavrunda Ravi assaulted him over the absence of doctors in a hospital. He had filed a case against him with Mudigere police, but withdrew the case later as per the advice of some people.

“The same people staged a protest at Balur on February 18 and made false allegations against me with regard to a land dispute. They made derogatory remarks against me because I belonged to the Scheduled Caste”, he said.

He also appealed to the Minister to register a case under the SC-ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against those named in his letter.

The local unit of CPI staged a protest on February 18 demanding that a case be registered against Mr. Kumaraswamy and his followers for allegedly stealing coffee beans from the farm belonging to Lokesh, a Dalit, at Kalmane village.

Lokesh had filed the complaint, which the police had refused to register. Lakshman Achar, CPI leader, said.
