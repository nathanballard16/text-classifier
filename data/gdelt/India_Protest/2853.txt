Irani takes jibe at Rahul, asks how those who "looted poor"

can target PM

Hyderabad, Feb 11 (PTI) Taking a jibe at Congress

President Rahul Gandhi, Union Minister Smriti Irani on Monday

sought to know how those who "looted the poor" could criticise

Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

She also asked how those who indulged in "corruption" and

"filled the coffers of Congress" target the "pradhan sevak"?.

Irani's comments came in the backdrop of Gandhi's

attack on Modi over the Rafale deal.

In a veiled reference to Gandhi's brother-in-law Robert

Vadra's alleged acquisition of properties in London, she said,

"Those who lived amidst the rich and looted the poor for

years.. whose brother-in-law purchases assets in London, have

the temerity to cast aspersions on the Prime Minister."

Irani was addressing a party meeting at Mahabubnagar, in

Hindi.

The meeting was organised as part of BJP's preparations

for the coming Lok Sabha elections.

Modi had announced the procurement of a batch of 36

Rafale jets after holding talks with then French president

Francois Hollande on April 10, 2015 in Paris.

Opposition Congress has accused the Centre of choosing

Reliance Defence over state-run Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.

(HAL) as offset partner to benefit the private firm though it

did not have any experience in the aerospace sector. PTI SJR
