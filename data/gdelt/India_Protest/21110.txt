More than 100 students protesting against a new Indian citizenship law were injured in New Delhi as they clashed with police who used tear gas and baton charges to disperse demonstrators at a major university.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government says the new law will save religious minorities such as Hindus and Christians from persecution in neighbouring Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan by offering them a path to Indian citizenship. But critics say the law, which does not make the same provision for Muslims, weakens India’s secular foundations.
