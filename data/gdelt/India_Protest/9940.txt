Diplomats harassed in Pakistan again

After guests at an iftar party hosted by the Indian High Commission were harassed earlier in this month, six cases of Indian diplomats being harassed in Pakistan have come to light.

In one case, Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria's car was aggressively tailed during his visit to Nathia gali on June 13. Nathia Gali is a hill station in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Paksitan. India sent a note verbale to Islamabad on June 20 the matter.

After the June 1 incident too, New Delhi had strongly protested against the harassment of guests invited for the iftar organised by the Indian High Commission at a hotel in Islamabad, asking the Pakistani government to investigate the "ugly" incident.

A release issued by the Indian mission in Islamabad had said, "India has strongly protested to Pakistan's gross intimidation of guests invited for an iftar event in Islamabad on Saturday... Guests faced unprecedented harassment and intimidation at the hands of security agencies". Harassment of Indian diplomats has been a continued affair since December, 2018 and despite repeated note verbales from New Delhi, Islamabad does not seem to change its behaviour.
