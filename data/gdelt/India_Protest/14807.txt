However, with new emission norms all set to kick in next year, TVS could have launched a BS6-compliant version with these new features and could have helped create a ripple in the 125cc scooter segment. Currently, only the new Activa 125 is BS6-compliant and it is priced from Rs 67,000 to Rs 75,000 (ex-showroom Delhi). In terms of rivals, the NTorq 125 goes up against the Aprilia SR 125.
