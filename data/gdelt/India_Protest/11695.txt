What substances are used to spike drinks?

Drugs used in drink-spiking are often referred to as date rape drugs, although they're not always used for sexual assault.

Some examples of drugs that have reportedly been used for drink spiking include:

gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)

gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)

tranquillisers, most often benzodiazepines, including Valium (diazepam) and Rohypnol

ketamine

Date rape drugs are particularly dangerous when mixed with alcohol because they combine to have a very powerful effect.

In extreme cases, it can lead to a coma or even death.

Date rape drugs may come in powder, tablet or liquid form, and don't always have a noticeable taste or smell.
