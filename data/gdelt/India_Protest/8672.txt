Residents take to the streets for drinking water

Residents of north Chennai took to the streets at three places protesting the shortage of water supply in their areas. As they blocked roads, traffic went out of gear on the main roads from 8.30 a.m on Thursday.

Acute water scarcity is prevailing in places like New Washermanpet, Old Washermanpet, Kasimedu, Royapuram and Tiruvottiyur. Meanwhile, water supply by water tankers was stopped to residents in Poondi Thangammal Nagar, Pujjammal Nagar and Avoor Muthiah Street for one week.

In protest, over 200 women gathered on Suryanarayanan Road with empty pots and blocked the road. At the same time, another group of women conducted a road blockade on Irusappan Street.

Residents of Raghavan Road and Ashok Nagar joined in the protests, leading to traffic congestion.

The protesters dispersed only after officials concerned held talks with them and assured them the resumption of water supply, the police said.
