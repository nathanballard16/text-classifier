Ahead of Oppositionâ€™s mega Jantar Mantar rally, poster war plays out on Delhi streets

New Delhi:

Jantar Mantar, the epicentre of countless protests, will see top Opposition leaders rallying against the Narendra Modi government in New Delhi today. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had reached the National Capital on Tuesday night itself. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu will also be part of the protest. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal took to Twitter and invited general public to join the ‘Satyagraha’. “Countless freedom fighters laid down their lives for our freedom and democracy. We cannot forget their sacrifices and remain silent to the tyranny of any dictator. Join us for the Save Democracy Satyagraha at the historic Jantar Mantar today afternoon,” Kejriwal said on tweeted.

But what stole the limelight were the posters put up by the ‘Youth For Democracy’ take a swipe at the West Bengal Chief Minister. “Welcome to Delhi, where democracy is alive and kicking, Didi,” said one of the poster. “Didi, no one is going to prevent you from address people,” read another poster. The message was an obvious reference to the ongoing tussle between the Modi government and the Trinamool Congress government over BJP’s ‘rath yatras’ in Bengal.

Banerjee has emerged as one of the most formidable voices of the opposition and her visit to Delhi assumes significance after the protest she led in Kolkata over CBI's attempt to interrogate the city police chief in chit fund scam cases created a political storm.

She has been at loggerheads with the ruling BJP, which is eyeing to garner at least 22 of 42 seats from Bengal in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Last month, Banerjee organised a rally of opposition parties in Kolkata, where she called to oust the Narendra Modi government at the Centre, claiming its "expiry date" has passed.
