In the wake of anti-Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) stir, that spread like a bushfire across the country, thousands of citizens are welcoming the New Year by holding protests against the amended citizenship law that aims to grant non-Muslim immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, who entered India on or before 31 December 2014.

Combined with opposition to a proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC) many fear that the move will discriminate against the Muslim community and chip away at the country’s secular fabric.

Protesters have planned at least three demonstrations in Delhi, including the area of Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of residents have blocked a major highway for 18 days, despite direction to end their agitation.
