To back or not to back? Congress divided on Citizenship Bill

NEW DELHI: Congress may look for a tightrope balancing act over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, after its members from the NorthEast said the bill had to be opposed in view of the hostile popular sentiment in the region while saying that imperatives of national politics could be different.The bill, which seeks to grant citizenship to refugees from neighbouring countries would cater to Hindu settlers. While the Northeast has erupted in protest, with BJP’s own allies raising red flags, there are concerns in Congress over implications on the national scene for opposing it.A Congress discussion of the issue, presided over by party chief Rahul Gandhi , brought out a split view. Besides the possible national implications of being seen as opposing citizenship for Hindu refugees, even the Bengali-dominated constituencies of Northeast region are in favour of the legislation pending in Parliament.At the strategy session, Rahul Gandhi sought the views of party MPs on the bill, resulting in many members speaking freely about their preferences and concerns. Later, a party MP told TOI, “The leadership only heard the views of members. A strategy will be worked out… it seems the party would look for balancing.”While BJP is faced with strong backlash over the bill, it is regularly employing it in its campaign speeches as part of its Hindutva plank. It may push the contentious bill in Parliament for passage in the last session of the Modi government’s tenure, if only to once again try painting the rivals as opposing citizenship for Hindus.The dilemma in the Congress ranks underscores concern the bill could be a political trap in the run-up to the 2019 polls. BJP has unveiled triple talaq and citizenship bills as part of its Hindutva plank, and is looking to force “secular” political rivals to take a stand.
