‘Students Didn’t Call For Any Protest, Outsiders Entered The Jamia Campus And Clashed With Police’: Reveals Jamia VC

Vice-Chancellor of the Delhi based university Jamia Millia Islamia, Nazma Akhtar revealed on Sunday (15 December) night that the students of the university had not called for any protests against the amended Citizenship Act, reports Asian News International (ANI).

Akhtar further added that call for protests had been given by the members of the colonies surrounding the university. Thereafter, outsiders protesting against the amended law entered the university's campus, hostel and library by breaking the gate, after a clash with Delhi Police.

Akhtar also added that university students were already sitting in the library when outsiders protesting against the new law rushed in, owing to which the Police forces could not differentiate who the real culprits were, leading to some students getting injured.

She also added that apart from the students, guards and some staff members of the university had also been left injured, while some damage had been caused to the property of the university.
