New Delhi: Ahead of Haryana and Maharashtra Assembly elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday urged the people to go out and cast their vote in record numbers. He specially called upon all the youngsters in the poll-bound state to exercise their franchise.

Just ahead of the elections, PM Modi took to his official Twitter handle and said, "Elections are taking place for Haryana and Maharashtra assemblies. There are also by-polls taking place in various parts of India. I urge voters in these states and seats to turn out in record numbers and enrich the festival of democracy. I hope youngsters vote in large numbers."

During the electioneering phase in Haryana and Maharashtra, the Prime Minister sounded the poll bugle by holding multiple rallies across the two states. The BJP is once again rooting for its old guard - Devendra Fadnavis in Maharashtra and Manohar Lal Khattar in Haryana.

The elections for 90-seat Assembly in Haryana and 288 seats in Maharashtra are being held in a single phase today. The fate of the contesting candidates and parties will be declared three days later on October 24.

Currently, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) sits firmly in Haryana with Khattar leading the government while the saffron party is in alliance with Shiv Sena once again in Maharashtra.
