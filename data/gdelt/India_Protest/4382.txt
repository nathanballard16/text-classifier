Ahmedabad: Parents of Global Indian International School protest over FRC order violation

Parents of Global Indian International School (GIIS) on Tuesday staged a protest outside the school located at Gota, Ahmedabad for violating the order of the Fee Regulatory Committee (FRC). While the FRC had fixed Rs 50,000 as school fees, the school charged Rs 70,000 from the parents for the year 2017-18 and 2018-19. Those who followed the FRC order and paid accordingly have been suspended for non-payment of fees, alleged a parent requesting anonymity.



"While the FRC order says that the schools cannot charge beyond the amount fixed by the FRC, the school has been pressurizing us for extra fees," said a protesting parent.



Denying the allegations, a spokesperson from the school said, "GIIS has followed the due process for fixing of school fees and is in full compliance of the guidelines, directed by the Supreme Court order dated February 1, 2018."



As per the Gujarat Self-Financed (Regulation of Fees), Act, the lower cut-off set by the state government is at Rs 15000 for primary, Rs 25000 for secondary and Rs 30000 for higher secondary schools. Schools that propose to charge beyond the cut-off were asked to approach the FRC justifying their fees. As per the Act, the FRC has to give its order within 90 days of the schools submitting their documents. Once the FRC order is issued, schools can file an appeal with the revision committee within 21 days.
