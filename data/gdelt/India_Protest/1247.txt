Farmers stage protest against power transmission project

Farmers in and around Pollachi staged a protest at Zamin Kaliapuram village on Friday against the Power Grid Corporation of India's project to erect high power transmission towers on their lands.

The farmers had gathered in the village in the morning anticipating that the workers the Corporation had engaged would be there to take up tower erection works. Though the workers did not turn up, the farmers staged a protest.

The police removed more than 90 farmers from the place.

Police personnel posted

The farmers had been opposing the project saying that their cultivable lands would be affected if the Corporation were to dig earth to erect the towers. As the situation continued to remain tense in the area, the Coimbatore Rural Police have posted personnel in the village to prevent untoward incidents.
