Phagwara, August 24

Tension prevailed in Phagwara when hundreds of Dalit activists led by Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leaders Simarjit Singh Bains and Jarnail Nangal held a march from Guru Ravidas Mandir to the residence of Union Minister of State Som Parkash in the local Urban Estate area today.

Demanding minister’s resignation, the leaders said either he should declare the date for the reconstruction of the Ravidas Temple in Delhi or resign from the Centre.

The police had to face a tough time in controlling the protesters who were stopped around 200 metres away from the minister’s residence.

A scuffle followed by heated arguments between protesters and policemen were witnessed as the latter installed barricades to stop them. They later submitted a memorandum to local SDM Jai Inder Singh before ending the stir.

LIP chief Simarjit Bains lost consciousness due to exhaustion after taking part in a 7-km march. He was taken to the PWD rest house, where a team of doctors of the Civil Hospital administered him first aid. After recovering, he addressed the media and left for Ludhiana. —OC
