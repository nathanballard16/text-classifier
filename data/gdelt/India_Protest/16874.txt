Lathi Charge on RJD Rally in Patna

Patna: Patna police have been extremely busy controlling angry mobs these days and Sunday was no exception when it resorted to lathi charge on a Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) rally that was adamant on defying police barricades at the Income Tax Roundabout and again near the Hartali Chowk forcing the police to jump into action.

When it arrived at the Income Tax Roundabout on Bailey Road, police tried to stop it but the rally continued to march ahead despite warnings from senior police officers.

When the crowd arrived at the Hartali Chowk, police tried to stop it again. Instead, RJD workers broke the barricade and moved forward towards the Raj Bhawan.

At this point, police jumped into action and showered batons on the rowdy mob.

This led to some harsh words against the Nitish administration by Tejaswi Yadav who sat in the middle of the road to protest against the lathi charge.

Demanding an apology from the police department, Yadav accused the Chief Minister of spending all his time on figuring out seat-sharing with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) while the entire state was running at the mercy of the God.

"There was no need for the lathi charge; our protest was peaceful. It is obvious Nitish Kumar is unable to do his job now. Bihar is completely in the grip of criminals but no one in the government seems to care," the former Deputy Chief Minister said.

Senior party leaders, including party state president Ram Chandra Purvey, state vice president Raghuvansh Prasad Singh, and general secretary Alok Mehta, were among many who were present in the protest rally today.
