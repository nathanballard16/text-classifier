West Bengal govt declines permission for UP CM Adityanath’s rally in state

LUCKNOW: Almost two months after the Mamata Banerjee-led TMC government in West Bengal denied permission to BJP chief Amit Shah to carry out a 'Rath Yatra' saying that it could lead to communal tensions, it was Yogi Adityanath 's turn to face a similar situation on Sunday when West Bengal government denied permission to the UP chief minister's chopper to land in the state.The UP chief minister and state BJP president Dilip Ghosh were scheduled to address 'Ganatantra Bacaho rallies' at Balurghat in South Dinajpur district and Raiganj in North Dinajpur district.The incident kicked off a political storm with the BJP accusing the West Bengal chief minister and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee of being politically vindictive and scared of the party's saffron mascot.Condemning TMC government of denying permission for Yogi's rally, BJP's West Bengal in charge Kailash Vijayvargiya said that no state government can deny permission to a political party to carry out its activities.Vijayvargiya claimed that the permission for landing of chopper has been pending for the past three days. The TMC government though gave permission for the rally since they were being organised on railways grounds, but denying permission was a clear case of political vindictiveness. Back home in UP, Yogi's media in charge Mrityunjay Kumar said: "Didi (Mamata) has got scared of CM Yogi's popularity."
