SJM calls PM's attention into Monsanto's unfair trade practices

Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), a sangh parivar outfit, on Wednesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention to make a report on investigation into abuse of dominance and anti-competitive practices of Monsanto in selling its Bt cotton seeds.

In a letter written to Modi, SJM All India Co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan said despite a section of the media reporting that the investigations proved that the US seeds giant and its Indian subsidiaries violated provisions of the Competition Act and thus are guilty and punishable with penalties up to 10 per cent of their revenues, the report is not available to public for discussion.

He charged that the Competition Commission of India (CCI), allegedly influenced by Monsanto, ordered the Agriculture Ministry or the farmer groups cannot share even the non-confidential portions of the report. “This amounts to helping the culprit to loot people,” he said in a statement

The delaying tactics of Monsanto have allegedly led to the investigation taking more than three and a half years, Mahajan said.

He alleged that the abuse of dominance by Monsanto subsidiaries MMBL and MAHYCO continued unabated all these years and they collected more than Rs 8,000 crore from farmers using licence agreements violative of the Act.
