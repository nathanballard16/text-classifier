What is May Day or International Labour Day?

Labour Day began in Chicago as a protest campaign to support eight-hour workday. On May 1, 1886, workers took to the streets across the United States to reduce the workday to eight-hour shifts.

Labour Day annually celebrates the achievements of the workers. While the day has a different story for different countries, the main reason for Labour Day is unfair treatment of the labour class.

In India, the first Labour day or May Day was celebrated in the year 1923. It was the Labour Kisan Party who had organised the May Day celebrations in Chennai (then Madras). One of these was organised at Triplicane Beach and the other one was arranged at the beach opposite Madras High Court.
