Chennai: The Porur Lake in Chennai has now reached its lowest level of water. One of the major sources of water for the people of Tamil Nadu, the depleting level of water has set off alarm bells all across the state. The state of Tamil Nadu has been struggling in the clutches of a water crisis over the past one year.

In an attempt to carry out their daily chores, the locals installed hand-pumps near the Marina Beach. The hand-pumps seemed to be of little help as the water extracted through them was full of pollutants and hence, unfit for use.

The locals rely on packaged water to quench their thirst in the scorching heat. A local told ANI,"We have to stand in a queue for hours under this scorching heat to fetch some water as borewells in the area have gone dry."

Even though the depleting levels of water hold testimony to the ensuing water crisis, the administration seems to have turned a blind eye to the same. Earlier this week, DMK leaders criticised the AIADMK government for their inability in ending the water woes of the locals.

As a result of the water crisis in Tamil Nadu, the villagers of the Madurantakkam district took to the streets in May and staged a protest. The villagers also detained a government bus between the Selaiyur and Madurantakkam area during the protest.

The protest started from Thachur a village where the officials had allegedly failed to help the villagers during the water crisis. With two of the borewells running dry and three tanks non-functional, the villagers in Thachur were deprived of drinking water for days. Furious at the officials, the villagers decided to stage the protest.
