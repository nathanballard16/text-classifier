“Qualitative research works on the principles of psychology and human understanding. However often our enquiry is limited to consumer understanding and not on deeply personal human issues and emotions. Hence, we thought of extending the principles of qualitative research and specifically counselling techniques to develop a framework for understanding deeply personal, sensitive and emotional issues,” elaborated Sirsikar.

Further, Ipsos also presented a research paper jointly with Coca Cola, titled, ‘Together we can move Mountains’. Neetu Bansal, Client Officer, Ipsos India and Ankita Mahana from Coca Cola – for Coca Cola’s ‘Share a Coke’ campaign using Ipsos Duel (using key attributes of Appeal & Passion) for shortlisting, was lauded by the audience.
