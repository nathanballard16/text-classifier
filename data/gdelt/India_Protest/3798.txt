BENGALURU: A mob in Bengaluru gathered outside an outlet of 'Karachi Bakery' and forced it to cover up the 'Karachi' part in its signboard in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack.

The mob gathered outside the bakery located in Indrinagar, Bengaluru thinking it was owned by a Pakistani company and demanded that the Karachi part on the signboard be covered.

Indian journalist Nagarjun Dwarakanath tweeted pictures of the protest and wrote: Protesters thronged Karachi Bakery in Indiranagar, Bangalore and demanded that Karachi part on sign board must be covered because of Pulwama attack. Protesters thought bakery was owned by a Pakistani company.

Bengaluru police confirmed they received a distress call from the bakery late Friday night.



The already sour relations between India and Pakistan have worsened as New Delhi piled blame on Islamabad for the Pulwama attack in which at least 40 Indian paramilitaries were killed. Pakistan's leadership has strongly refuted the allegations.



India's Supreme Court on Friday ordered bolstered protection for Kashmiris who have faced a violent backlash in the aftermath of the attack.
