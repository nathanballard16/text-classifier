EC Rules Out Ballot Papers For Nizamabad, Mandates EVM

Hyderabad: Polling in Telangana's Nizamabad Lok Sabha constituency, where 185 candidates including Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao's daughter K. Kavitha are in fray, will be conducted with EVMs only, the Election Commission announced on Sunday.

It has also issued orders to Electronics Corporation of India Ltd (ECIL) for immediate supply of 26,820 ballot units, 2240 control units and 2,600 VVPATs of M3 make to CEO Telangana.
