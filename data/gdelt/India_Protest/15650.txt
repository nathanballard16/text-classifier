Stir against cutting of trees in Mumbai

Hyderabad: Aghast at the cutting down of 2,600 trees at Mumbai’s Aarey Park, a group of about 50 activists on Sunday gathered at the KBR Park to mark their protest.

“The government has hastily cut down thousands of trees in the Aarey forest area. It was like a surgical strike on the environment. Our constitutional right to breathing was violated when the government chopped down the trees,” said Ms Kaajal Maheshwari, who had organised the protest.

She said that Mumbai had lost Aarey and hundreds of people would be displaced due to the deforestation. “When the Mumbaikars were protesting for their constitutional right, why did the government impose Section 144 in the area? Is that how democracy works?” she asked.

Holding placards, the demonstrators also raised slogans against the government.
