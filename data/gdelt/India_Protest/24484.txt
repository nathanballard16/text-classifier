Anti-CAA protest: 50 students arrested for picketing BSNL office

Coimbatore: The city police arrested more than 50 students for picketing the BSNL office near the district collectorate in the city on Tuesday. The students demanded the central government to withdraw Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

Students of several associations – the Students Federation of India (SFI), the Campus Front of India (CFI), the Students Islamic Organization of India (SIO) and the All India Student Federation (AISF) –came together to protest against the act.

J Abuthahir, district president of CFI, said, “The central government claims this act is not against the minorities living in the country. But both CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC) are unconstitutional and thus should be withdrawn immediately.”

The students also condemned the police officials who were misusing their powers and attacking the student protesters across the country.

“Stringent action should be taken against these officials. Just like any other Indian citizen, the students have the right to express their views. Students’ participation is not a new thing and has been present since the Independence struggle,” said M Dinesh Raja, the district president of SFI. He said protests would continue until the act is withdrawn.
