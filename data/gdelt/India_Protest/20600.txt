New Delhi, Dec 14: The Preparations of the Congress' 'Bharat Bachao' rally is underway at Ramlila Maidan in Delhi on Saturday. Former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Congress leaders, party's interim president Sonia Gandhi, and Rahul Gandhi will participate in the event today.

The 'Bharat Bachao' rally comes after the massive agitation across the Northeast states and West Bengal over the amended Citizenship act and atrocities against women across the country.

Earlier, UP Congress chief Ajay Kumar Lallu told to media that lakhs of party workers from Uttar Pradesh will reach the Ram Lila ground in New Delhi on December 14 to take part in the Bharat Bachao rally to protest the 'murder of democracy, curb on freedom of expression, economic loot and corruption under the BJP government'.

The UP Congress president told to PTI, "The crime against women in the state had been on the rise. The state has set a record in the cases relating to rape, murder, loot, kidnapping and cybercrimes."
