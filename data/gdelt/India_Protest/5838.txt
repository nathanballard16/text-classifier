NOIDA: The Noida police on Tuesday night recovered a Swift Dzire (DL5CP2442) looted from an OSD of Union minister JP Nadda within less than half an hour of the incident.

The white car which was looted from Aditya Trivedi from the Barapulla area was recovered in minutes as teams of Noida police chased the four assailants who apparently looted the car from Trivedi from near Barapulla flyover at gunpoint.

According to Gautam Buddha Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna, at around 10pm, information was received that a white Swift Dzire car being driven by OSD to JP Nadda, Union minister, has been looted.

“The OSD shared the GPS live location of the vehicle. Four crime teams of Noida Police immediately rushed to spot and the car was recovered from Sector 2, PS Sector 20,” he said.

Yatindra Yadav, sub-inspector of the Star II team, told TOI that Aditya had got down from the Barapulla flyover towards the DND Flyway when he stopped near some vendors to buy a water bottle.

“It seems that around four assailants took him at gunpoint and fled with the Dzire. As we got information, teams of about eight police officers started the chase,” he said.

The chase was led by inspector Dinesh Sharma of the Star -II team and the team included Kumar and about six junior police officers.

The SSP said that as the chase began, the location of the car was found near Sector 2.

However, as cops gave a hard chase, the robbers escaped leaving the car near the Sector 19 red light.

The assailants, however, could not be nabbed despite joint combing by both Delhi and Noida cops.

Meanwhile, a team of Delhi police’s Sunlight police station reached near the DND Flyway and Noida cops briefed them about the incident.

“An FIR will be lodged in Barapulla police station,” Kumar said.

The Swift has been registered in Sunil Sharma’s name who is a friend of Trivedi.
