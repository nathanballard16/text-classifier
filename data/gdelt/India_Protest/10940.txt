Citizens Protest Against Indian Government Order to Cull 'Vermin' Monkeys in Himachal Pradesh-Report

Acting on a complaint lodged by the Himachal Pradesh government that monkeys (Rhesus Macaques) are extensively damaging property and harming people, the ministry's order is aimed at bringing the population of this species down, according to a report in the English language newspaper Times of India.

Earlier this week, it was reported that a plan was put into place to sterilise 1000 monkeys in the town of Almora, in the neighbouring state of Uttarakhand. According to the report, the local forest department has set up a sterilisation centre in the town's zoo, with 92 monkeys already sterilised.

Predictably, wildlife activists and some netizens reacted with horror and anger at the latest government order and demanded that it should be withdrawn immediately.
