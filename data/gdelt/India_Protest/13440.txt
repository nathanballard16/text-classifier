Teen dies a month after she was gangraped at her 19th birthday party in India

A teenager has died of multiple internal injuries a month after she was allegedly gangraped by four guests at her 19th birthday party in India.

Officials announced today the girl had died on Wednesday in her hometown of Aurangabad after she was attacked in July in the suburbs of Mumbai.

She had come to Mumbai, around a seven hour train journey, to celebrate her birthday and after cutting her cake, four of her friends allegedly raped her, NDTV reported.

She returned home but did not report the incident until more than two weeks later on July 25, when she went to hospital complaining of pain in her genitals.

The party's chief spokesman told the Hindustan Times: 'The victim has died. It has been one month (since the alleged gangrape), yet the accused have not been arrested.

'To condemn it, we will take out a protest march from Lal Dongar in Chembur to Chunabhatti police station tomorrow.'

According to India's National Crime Record's Bureau, around 100 sexual assaults are reported to police every day despite attempts from government and local law enforcement to curtail the epidemic.
