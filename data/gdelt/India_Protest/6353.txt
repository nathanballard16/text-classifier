Kisan Sabha leader questions Cong. ‘hypocrisy’

Ashok Dhawale says Left strength will come to the fore in Wayanad

The candidature of Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the Wayanad Lok Sabha constituency against Left Democratic Front (LDF) candidate P.P. Suneer shows the hypocrisy of the Congress, Ashok Dhawale, president of the All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS), which spearheaded the Kisan Long March in Maharashtra this year, has said.

He was inaugurating a district farmer parliament organised by the AIKS here on Friday in protest against the anti-farmer policies of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) governments. Mr. Dhawale said the Congress claimed its main opponent in this election was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). But in Wayanad, the national leader of the party himself was contesting against the LDF candidate, Mr. Dhawale said.

“Who is your real enemy, the BJP or the LDF,” Mr. Dhawale asked the Congress. The stance of the Congress exemplified its two-facedness, he said, adding that the might of the Left would come to the fore in Wayanad. Communist Party of India (CPI) State secretary Kanam Rajendran inaugurated a public meeting held in connection with farmer parliament. Delivering the keynote address, journalist P. Sainath said the successive governments of the UPA and the NDA had failed to protect farmers’ interests.

The NDA government had held a special joint session of Parliament at midnight to enact the GST Bill for corporates and passed it in four hours.

No discussion

But the reports of the National Commission of Farmers had been lying in Parliament for 16 years, he said. The successive governments could not find an hour for a dedicated discussion on the plight of the farmers.

A rally was held in connection with the programme and close to 3,000 farmers participated in it.
