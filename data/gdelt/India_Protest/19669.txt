Security upped around JNU ahead of students' march to Rashtrapati Bhavan

Security has been beefed up around the Jawaharlal Nehru University on Monday ahead of the JNU students' long march to Rashtrapati Bhavan against the hostel fee hike.

The students circulated photos claiming that the police closed all the gates of the JNU.

Roads leading to the JNU have also been closed for the traffic, the traffic police said.

Baba Gangnath Marg is closed for vehicular traffic due to students' protest and the long march, the Delhi Traffic Police said.
