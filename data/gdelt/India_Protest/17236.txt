Senior BJP leader Vijay Goel on Monday drove an odd-numbered car to register protest against the odd-even scheme, labelling it a “natak” by the Arvind Kejriwal government. Goel was fined by the traffic police for violating the rule.

“Please ask him what he (Kejriwal) has done to curb pollution for past five years,” Goel said.

“Kejriwal cannot misguide the people of Delhi with his drama. I respect the law. This is a symbolic protest so that the people of Delhi come to know about the politics behind the move. He has done nothing to curb pollution in Delhi for the past five years. He is implementing odd-even now because elections are around the corner,” Goel said, likening his protest to “satyagrah”.

“I am fighting for the people of Delhi,” Goel said, trashing observation that he was “setting a bad example by breaking the law”.
