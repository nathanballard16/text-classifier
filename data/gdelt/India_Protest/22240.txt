Northern California Indian Americans Protest India’s New Citizenship Bill

Indian Americans in Santa Clara, California, protested Dec. 15 against India’s new Citizenship Amendment Bill, saying the measure is ‘anti-Muslim.’ “The Citizenship Amendment Bill passed this week foretells a fatal blow to a secular society in India,” warned Arvin Valmuci of Organization for Minorities of India, one of the organizations coordinating the protest.
