No road, no vote: 2 tribal villages boycott election

Coimbatore: Over 200 families in two tribal villages in the Karamadai block on the city outskirts boycotted the rural local body election that took place on Monday, blaming the state government for failing to develop roads.

The villagers had been demanding bitumen road at Arakkadavu and Moonukuttai, situated on the Gopanari beat of reserved forest, for the last five years. “Though we decided to boycott the general election that took place earlier this year, block-level officials assured to take immediate steps to lay roads. It has been over seven months since the assurance was made and no step was taken to fulfil the promise,” said K Sathish Kumar, a resident.

Block-level officials again tried their best to persuade the villagers on Monday, but to no avail.

“Without proper roads, it is difficult to even get out of the villages. How are we supposed to go to schools, hospitals and workplaces? We have been walking or renting vehicles to reach the bus stop on the main road, which 4.5 kilometres away,” Sathish said. “The vehicles often get stuck in mud when they hit potholes. Because of that, drivers refuse to conduct services during the night hours”

Even the mobile ration shops refuse to enter the villages and the villagers have to carry grocery including rice and pulses on their heads, Sathish added.
