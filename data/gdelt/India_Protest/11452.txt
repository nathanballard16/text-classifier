Minority communities need reassurance

Minority communities need reassurance

The number of incidents involving religious intolerance in India have been on the rise lately. And sadly, people who question or protest against the violence towards minorities are trolled, abused, and threatened with laws/ complaints. I am one among the many belonging to a minority community in India and we have always felt proud of the country's constitution and its secular fabric. Law and order should be tightened to ensure safety and security of life for all. It is good to promote business, but a nation cannot make good of the economic gains if there is friction among the communities.
