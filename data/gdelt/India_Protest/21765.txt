Delhi police accused of shooting protesters as Imran Khan warns of potential refugee crisis

Delhi police have denied shooting three people as protests against a new ‘anti-Muslim’ citizenship law continued for a sixth day.

They claim the injuries were caused by broken-tear gas canisters as officers tried to contain protesters at Jamia Millia Islamia University (JMIU).

However, medical professionals in Safdarjung Hospital told the media three people had been admitted with bullet wounds.

Two were allegedly studying at the university where thousands of students took to the streets on Sunday to accuse the ruling Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party of suppressing India’s 193 million Muslims.

At least 100 others were injured after police fired tear gas at protesters and beat them with batons. A third person claims he was shot in the crossfire between police and JMIU students.

The Indian Government passed the Citizenship Amendment Act on Wednesday.

The legislation permits followers of six religions from neighbouring Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh – including Christians, Sikhs and Hindus – to become Indian citizens if they are fleeing faith-based persecution. Muslims are not included in the legislation.

Imran Khan, the Pakistani Prime Minister, warned the omission and four-month long curfew in Kashmir could create a Muslim exodus from India and a "refugee crisis that would dwarf other crises."
