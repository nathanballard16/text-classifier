If murderers are not caught we will stage massive protest against MP govt: Shivraj Singh Chouhan

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh), Jan 21 (ANI): Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan commenting on the current law and order situation in the state said that if the murderers of BJP leaders are not caught. Speaking to ANI Shivraj Singh Chohan said, “Murders and lootings have started after the new government came to power. BJP leaders are being looted and murdered. Murders that took place in Indore, Mandsaur, Badwani and Guna show that the law and order situation in the state is in crisis. It is a matter of concern.” Shivraj Singh Chohan also said, “I want to tell them that now you are not just Congress leaders. You are now government ministers. Small leader can say whatever but minister is for the whole state. It will degrade the whole system, because as the ministers behave the same way the officer will behave. Ministers should fulfill their duties rather than indulging in irresponsible politics. I will go and pay my tribute to Manoj Thackeray in Badwani. And if the murders are not caught then we will protest against the government.”
