New Delhi: The list of billionaire promoters of India Inc has shrunk to a three-year low of 71 from an all-time high of 90 at the end of March 2018 amid the ongoing correction in stock prices. The list that grew steadily for five years till March 2018, has declined sharply over the last 16 months. At the end of March 2019, this count was at 81.

According to a report in a business daily, the 71 billionaire promoters are worth $326 billion now as against $353 billion at the end of March 2018. However, market correction has impacted small promoters more than large promoters. Holding value of India's richest promoters like Mukesh Ambani, Gautam Adani, Azim Premji has increased in the last 16 months while the 24 promoters (excluding new entrants), who exited from the Billionaire club suffered a combined loss of $14.7 billion in their net worth in the same period, the report said citing data from Capitalline.

Anil Ambani, Yes Bank's Rana Kapoor, Ajit Isaac of Quess Corp, Dillip Suryavanshi of Dilip Buildcon and Motilal Oswal and Ramdeo Agarwal of Motilal Oswal Financial Services are the top exits from the billionaire promoter club. Anil Ambani's net worth has fallen by 92% in the last 16 months while Rana Kapoor's net worth plunged by 70%. Dilip Suryavanshi, Motilal Oswal and Ramdeo Agarwal's net worth has seen 58% and 42.5% dip respectively in the same timeframe.

Anil Ambani's holding in ADAG group is now worth Rs 1,981 crore, as against Rs 25,271 crore on March 31, 2018. Similarly, Rana Kapoor's holding in Yes Bank is now worth Rs 4,185 crore, as against Rs 14,000 crore at the end of March 2018. In comparison, Mukesh Ambani, promoter of Reliance Industries, who tops the billionaire promoter chart, witnessed 45.1% rise in the value of his stake since March 2018. Holding value of top 10 promoters in India is worth around $158 billion, as against $132 billion on March 31, 2018.

Promoters of non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), auto companies, real estate, pharma, private banks have seen a massive fall in their net worth due to the correction in stock prices.

The above analysis is based on the promoter's stake and market capitalisation of 822 companies that are either a part of BSE500, BSE Midcap or BSE SmallCap Index, the business daily said adding that the value of promoter's stake is net of the cross-holding of various listed group companies in each other.
