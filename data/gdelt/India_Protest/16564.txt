SRR students protest over lack of basic facilities

The students of the SRR & CVR government college in the city, under the aegis of the Students Federation of India (SFI), staged protests over the lack of basic facilities such as clean drinking water and food in the college.

The students gathered inside the college and raised slogans in support of their demands.

“The water we get in the canteens stinks and we need to purchase water bottles, which we cannot afford on a daily basis,” said Sai Koushik, a first year intermediate student.

SFI State assistant secretary K. Prasanna Kumar said that the students have not been receiving free and clean drinking water and food from the college for long despite repeated requests to the authorities. He said that the protests would continue if their demands were not met.

The college lacks a water treatment plant due to which students are forced to drink untreated water, they said. The college authorities, however, claimed that they were awaiting funds from the government in order to provide better facilities for the students.

The students also demanded free bus passes for them as most of them hailed from a poor economic background.
