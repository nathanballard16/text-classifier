Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani apologises for breastfeeding comment

Gujarat BJP chief Jitu Vaghani on Monday offered an apology for his statement about the Gandhi family. However, Congress chief in the state, Amit Chavda, dismissed the apology, regarding the statement as ‘unpardonable’. The Gujarat Congress has decided to hold a state-wide protest against Vaghani.

Vaghani, on Sunday, at a BJP youth meet in Radhanpur town of Patan district, had said that Gandhi family leaders are born into VIP culture and are guarded by commandos since birth. He took things a step further by saying that they must be breast-fed surrounded by commandos as well.

Offering an apology at a press conference held at party headquarters Shri Kamalam, Vaghani said, “Relations between mother and children are always sacred. I offer my apology, if any individual or group has been offended by statement. The Congress has been misinterpreting my statements and wrongfully creating a controversy.”

“My intention was to point out the VIP culture of the Gandhi family leaders of the Congress as they never connected to people at a grass-root level. They often used lowly words for our leader Narendra Modi and for my mother who has not even been a part of politics. But given my party’s moral values, I again apologise for my words,” Vaghani further added.

Reacting to the issue, Gujarat Congress chief Amit Chavda said, “Vaghani’s words are a revelation of the cheap mentality of BJP leaders. His words were abhorrent for all women in the world. He may have sought an apology, but his words are not pardonable.”

The Gujarat Congress has also decided that women workers of the party across the state would stage a protest against Vaghani and give memorandums against him to the district collectors at their offices.

The general secretary in Surat district’s Congress unit, Snehal Shah, in a social media post said that he would smear Vaghani’s face with black paint for his remarks.
