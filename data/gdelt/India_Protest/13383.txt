COAS General Qamar Bajwa visited on Thursday the formations of Strike Corps where he was apprised on Pakistan Army's state of operational preparedness, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said.“Strike Corps has critical and decisive role in war. Your state of preparedness, training standards and high morale are very encouraging which enhance the confidence,” Gen Qamar was quoted as saying.The visit comes amid tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours after New Delhi revoked Indian Occupied Kashmir's (IOK) special autonomy.The area is currently in its fourth week of a wide-ranging communications blackout with severe restrictions on movement. Thousands of people have been arrested.Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Imran Khan called for mass demonstrations across the country against New Delhi's strong-arm tactics."I want all Pakistanis to come out tomorrow [Friday] 12 noon-12:30 pm to show solidarity with the Kashmiri people," he tweeted, adding: "We must send a strong message to Kashmiris that our nation stands resolutely behind them."The prime minister has asked for weekly nationwide rallies until he leaves for New York next month to attend the United Nations General Assembly, where he vowed to raise the issue.
