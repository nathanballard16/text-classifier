Taking to Twitter, Surya claimed that the "rowdy elements" did not question the use of Arabic language in Bengaluru.

"Deeply hurt over attack on our Jain brothers in B'luru over Hindi on a banner of a temple by few rowdy elements. They however never question the use of `rb~ (Arabic) in Bengaluru. Assaulting peaceful Jains who contribute to Karnataka brings infamy to genuine Kannada lovers and activists," Surya, a lawmaker from Bangalore South said in a tweet.
