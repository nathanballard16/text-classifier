Pakistan foreign office spokesperson Mohammad Faisal's personal Twitter account suspended

New Delhi:

Twitter has suspended the personal account of Dr Mohammad Faisal, chief spokesperson of Pakistan foreign office. According to reports in Pakistani media, the decision was taken by the social media giant after India protested against Faisal’s belligerent Kashmir tweets from - @DrMFaisal. -his personal account. However, his official Twitter handle is still active. At the time of the latest development, Faisal was at The Hague, where India and Pakistan are locked in a protracted legal battle over former naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav.

The Indian subcontinent is witnessing one of the most tense period in the recent times after the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a powerful IED blast on the National Highway 1A on February 14. Exactly 7 days after the attack, both Pakistani and Indian leadership are engaged in war of words. Immediately after Pulwama attack, PM Narendra Modi had announced that the Indian armed forces have been given a ‘free hand.’ However, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan’s 6-minute-long speech has just added to the fire.

In a video message, five days after the Pulwama terror attack, Khan responded to the India's allegations on Pakistan's involvement in the suicide strike carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror group that left 40 CRPF personnel dead. He said that only a stupid person will think of war. Khan, in a nationally televised address on Tuesday, demanded India to give “actionable evidence” and that Pakistan would retaliate if attacked. He said that India is in habit of blaming Islamabad for everything. However, New Delhi slammed Khan for repeating the script written by the Pakistan Army.
