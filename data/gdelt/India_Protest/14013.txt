Maharashtra assembly elections: Sudhir Sawant protests against 'dictatorship', quits AAP

In a setback for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) before the Maharashtra assembly elections, its ex-state unit convenor and former MP, Brigadier (retired) Sudhir Sawant has quit the party protesting against the "dictatorship" of its Delhi-based leadership.

Sawant, a former Congress Lok Sabha MP, who later became a party MLC, had joined the AAP in the presence of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at Sindkhedraja in January 2018. Last month, the AAP had announced his removal from the state convenor's post. In his statement on Sunday, Sawant accused Kejriwal of diluting his party's anti-corruption stand to strike an alliance with the Congress and vented his ire at AAP leader Durgesh Pathak, who is the party's in-charge for Maharashtra. He also criticised the decision of the AAP to stay away from contesting the Lok Sabha elections.

Sawant, a former Indian Army officer and commando instructor, alleged that a section of the AAP leadership had opposed his petition seeking a probe into alleged corruption in the construction of the New Maharashtra Sadan in New Delhi.

In 2008, Sawant, who had defeated former Railway minister and socialist veteran Prof Madhu Dandavate (Janata Dal) from the erstwhile Rajapur constituency in the Konkan in 1991, quit the Congress, accusing it of corruption and joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). After a struggle with the BSP leadership in Maharashtra, he floated his own Bahujan Samaj Federation (BSF) and then joined the AAP after a stint in the Shivrajya Party.
