Chandra Babu to Take on Election Commission:- The Assembly and Parliament elections did not happen in a smooth manner and there is a lot of confusion among the people after 30% of the EVMs could not function during the elections. Though AP received record attendance, there are several questions about non-functioning of the EVMs. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister on Friday slammed the Election Commission for their poor planning of the polls. He said that the CEO could not cast his vote and this is sure a shame for the Election Commission. Chandra Babu decided to stage a protest before the poll panel's office today in New Delhi.

"Election Commission is making a mockery of democracy. They mishandled the elections in Andhra Pradesh. EC owes an explanation for the people of Andhra Pradesh and it is unfair. We are confident on winning the polls despite of large disturbance and malfunctioning of EVMs. Several senior officials have been transferred as per the instructions of YSRCP in the state. The Election Commission CEO himself could not cast his vote which is a clear indication of their poor planning. It is a shame for the Election Commission. We will protest before the poll panel's office in New Delhi and we are in plans to file a review petition in the Supreme Court on counting VVPATs" said Chandra Babu.
