Pune: Differently-abled protestors’ allege lathi charge, CM seeks report

Pune (Maharashtra) [India], Feb 25 (ANI): Differently-abled youth protesting here for a number of demands were allegedly subjected to baton charge by police here on Monday.

According to the organizers, over thousand differently-abled youth were protesting in front of the Social Welfare Commissionerate when they had to face police action.

The differently-abled youth are demanding for setting up of government school and colleges for deaf students to educate them in sign language and for employment opportunities for others.

One protestor, speaking to ANI through an interpreter said, "33 people are injured and one of them is very seriously hit in his leg. We have made no mistake but still, we are being treated like this."

Speaking about their demands he said, "Education with sign language, interpreters must be provided. Tests must be done to filter those who have made fake certificates. We have no communication with anyone, administration; police officials do not understand sign language. To whom and how shall we tell our problems."

He also alleged that as many as 400 people are detained at police headquarters.

Meanwhile, soon after the reports of police action, MNS chief Raj Thackery criticised the use of force and termed demanded accountability.

“It is very unfortunate that people, who could not speak, could not hear are lathi charged. It must be probed as to who has given those orders? Chief Minister must take resignation of the person who ordered this action. They are demanding an education; in sign language is it a wrong demand?

Thackeray also visited the differently abled people after the police action.

Late in the evening, Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis also took cognizance of the incident and sought a detailed report from Pune CP on use of baton on Divyang Morcha at Pune. The Chief Minister has also asked Minister Dilip Kamble to look into the issue. (ANI)
