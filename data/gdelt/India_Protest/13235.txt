Omar Abdullah, Mehbooba Mufti refuse Modi govt's offer for their release

Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah have been in detention since August 5.

SRINAGAR (Dunya News) - Former Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti on Tuesday refused to accept the Indian government’s conditions for their release.

According to the media reports, Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik offered to release the both political figures on the condition of staying silent and not rallying with their supporters against India‘s decision to scrap the special status of the occupied Kashmir.

The governor asserted that if they don’t mobilize people to protest against the abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A, they can go to their homes.

However, Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah rejected the offer in clear words. Both leaders have been in detention since August 5.
