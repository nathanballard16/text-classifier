The world's largest social organisation, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) celebrated its 94th foundation day on the occasion of Vijayadashami. The RSS organised several events and parades across the nation to commemorate the anniversary. The main programme was organised at Reshimbagh ground in Nagpur, in which billionaire industrialist and philanthropist Shiv Nadar was invited as a chief guest. Addressing the event, RSS Chief Mohan Bhagwat hailed the performance of Modi government. He backed the government for its "much-awaited" and "praiseworthy" step to abrogate Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. "The move of the re-elected regime to nullify Article 370 has once again proved that it has the courage to fulfil those expectations and respect people's sentiments and wishes in the interest of the country," Bhagwat said. He also lauded the Chandrayaan-2 project as one of the two great achievements of the government. As a chief guest Shiv Nadar said that India's demographic dividend has the potential to become a game-changer with the right education, training and skill sets. "The most important pillar on which a nation's growth depends is its education system. It is even more crucial in India because about 600 million people -- close to half of the country's population -- are under 25 years of age. No other country has more young people than India," he said. The RSS also held the "Path Sanchalan March" in Nagpur in which several dignitaries including Union Minister Nitin Gadkari, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and former Army chief General (retd) VK Singh took part.
