Reducing number of cash-lanes at toll-plazas will cause problems for casual users

Dear Editor,

It refers to Union Ministry of Road Transport considering idea of reducing number of cash-lanes at toll-plazas to encourage digital-mode of payment to pay toll-tax. But it will create problems for casual users of highways. Multiple number of toll-plazas at expressways and highways cause unnecessary hindrance in otherwise smooth fast traffic. Many unauthorised toll-plazas have also been set up in connivance with local politicians and police for unauthorizedly looting unaware public.

Best is to replace toll-system by charging one-time toll-tax on purchase of new vehicles like system exists for charging one-time road-tax on purchase of new vehicles. All concerned including vehicle-users and transport-authorities welcomed system of one-time payment of road-tax avoiding cumbersome procedure of paying and collecting road-tax.

Amount collected through one-time toll-tax on purchase of new vehicles can then be utilised for developing and maintaining highways without necessitating toll-plazas as big hurdles causing queues at toll-plazas. One-time toll-tax can be fixed according to ex-showroom price of new vehicles so that people having costly cars may have to contribute more than those purchasing economy cars. People paying extra clubbed with cost of new vehicle will never mind because of facility of toll-free movement in future.
