MP: Government college teachers to organise 3-phase protest over pending salary, to write over 5,000 letters to CM

As a part of their three-phased protest, government college teachers across Madhya Pradesh are planning to write over 5,000 letters every day starting from November 21 to Chief Minister Kamal Nath urging him to release their salaries.

The employees have not been paid their salaries for the month of October.

In the second phase, the teachers will tie black bands from November 24 to November 30. By December 1, we will start silent protests, professor Anand Sharma, secretary of the government teachers association told India Today TV.

However, the government initially denied that there was an issue on Monday saying no teacher had approached the government with their grievances.

But on Monday evening, the state higher education department sent across a message to the college teachers saying that their October salaries had been released with immediate effect.
