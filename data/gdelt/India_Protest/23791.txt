Delhi Court Refuses Bail, Sends Chandra Shekhar Aazad to 14-Day Judicial Custody

New Delhi: A Delhi court on Saturday sent Bhim Army chief Chandra Shekhar Aazad to 14 days of judicial custody. Azad had surrendered early on Saturday after police tried to detain him and failed to, on Friday.

He was held in connection with violence in Old Delhi’s Daryaganj area, during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

Aazad sought bail from the court on the ground that there was no evidence that he instigated the Jama Masjid crowd to go to Delhi Gate where the protesters had allegedly turned violent.

The police opposed his bail plea on the ground that he may “threaten witnesses” and his judicial remand is necessary for the sake of law and order.

The court dismissed his bail plea and sent him to 14 days’ judicial custody. LiveLaw has reported that reporters were barred from entering the courtroom, even though no such prohibitions had been spoken of earlier.

Earlier, a lawyer had requested the court to direct the investigating officer to give details of Aazad’s whereabouts.

The court also sent 15 people arrested in connection with the violence in Daryaganj to two days’ judicial custody.

Aazad had organised a march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar on Friday against the new citizenship law.

The protesters marching towards Jantar Mantar from Jama Masjid were stopped by police and paramilitary personnel near Delhi Gate. A car was set on fire. Police, in turn, unleashed violence on protesters, many of whom were minors. Several of them bore serious injuries as well.
