From the Archives (April 5, 1919): The Madras Tramway. End of the Strike.

The strike of the Tramway men [in Madras city] which was continued for over 25 days came to an end this morning [April 5]: the Company also after much vacillation had taken a sympathetic attitude. Public opinion is, however, that, if only the Company had adopted a reasonable attitude at a much earlier stage of the strike, things would have gone on very well, and much uneasiness on either side might have been averted. Hon’ble Mr. T. Rangachariar who had an interview with the leaders of the Tramway Union, last night, called at the Union premises this morning, and in a short speech paid a tribute to the men’s sacrificing spirit, forbearance all these days, and finally advised them to resume work to-day pending the decision of the arbitration. The men accordingly resumed work today at 11 A.M., and the full service of cars has now been restored much to the satisfaction of the tram-using public. Mr. Kumaraswami Chettiar, the President of the Union, has resigned, he being made a patron of the Union and Mr. T. Venkataramanjulu Naidu, the Personal Assistant of the Manager of the Tramway Company who has commanded the confidence of the men, was elected President.
