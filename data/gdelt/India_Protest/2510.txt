Actress Surbhi Tiwari, who became popular as Aradhana from SHAGUN, is all set to tie the knot with Delhi-based pilot and businessman, Praveen Kumar Sinha, on February 10. The pre-wedding functions will begin with haldi, mehndi and Mata ki chowkion February 8, and sangeet and cocktail the following day. While the wedding will take place in Mumbai, a reception will be held in Delhi on March 5.

Surbhi says, “At the sangeet, along with other songs, I will be performing to the title track of SHAGUN. My actor friends will perform, too.” Talking about how she met Praveen, the actress shares, “Some common friends arranged our meeting in October, 2018. Praveen is from Patna, but he has been working in Delhi for the past 18 years. He will shift base to Mumbai after marriage. Despite belonging to an affluent family, he is simple like me. Also, both of us hate partying.

However, unlike me, he is calm, and he has brought calmness to my life. He is the anchor I was looking for so long. He has been extremely supportive of my career and loves me the way I am. At a time when most people expect their suitors to be in shape, he didn’t mind me being overweight.”

Surbhi, who was last seen on AGNIPHERA, took a break from acting to focus on her personal life. She shares, “I had been wanting to marry for the past five years, but I didn’t want to tie the knot with an actor. All they talk about is their shows and ratings. I refused many proposals, as I wanted to talk about other things with my man. So, I took a break from acting to meet guys outside the profession. My mother told me to take up new work only after I got married”.
