Shocking: Journalist thrashed by GRP cop, goons in Shamli

MEERUT: Just a few hours after the Supreme Court ordered the release of Prashant Kanojia, another TV journalist in west UP's Shamli was brutally assaulted by the SHO of the government railway police (GRP) on Tuesday night. SHO Rakesh Kumar and GRP constable Sanjay Pawar were booked and suspended after videos of the attack went viral on Wednesday.In the clips, the SHO could be seen attacking journalist Amit Sharma when a group of reporters assembled in Dhimanpur after two bogeys of a goods train derailed at 9 pm.According to local journalists, following an argument, Sharma was thrashed, dragged to the local GRP station and locked up. Sharma claimed he was stripped and Kumar urinated in his mouth. Sharma was taken to hospital on Wednesday."He attacked me out of vengeance. I ran a story about encroachment by unauthorised vendors in connivance with GRP last month, which had upset him. He abused, assaulted, stripped me and urinated in my mouth," he said.Though scores of journalists assembled at the GRP station on Tuesday night to protest against the illegal detention of Sharma, he was released only on Wednesday morning. ADG (Railways) Sanjay Singhal confirmed to TOI that an FIR based on the complaint of the journalist had been registered.A departmental probe under DIG (Railways) Subash Chand Dubey, who reached Shamli on Wednesday afternoon, has also been ordered. "We have come across a video where a journalist has been beaten up and put up in a lock up. Strict punishment shall be accorded to policemen misbehaving with citizens," UP Police tweeted.
