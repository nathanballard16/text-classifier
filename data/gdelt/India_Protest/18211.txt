JNU protest: JNUSU says woman students manhandled by male cops, groped

Jawaharlal Nehru University's (JNU) student's union on Tuesday said woman students were manhandled by male police personnel during a protest on Monday.

They weren't just roughed up but also groped, the JNUSU said at a press conference.

The Union, represented by its president Aishe Ghosh, said the ongoing protests against increased hostel fees were for a just cause, and demanded that all notices served to students on and outside campus, FIRs included, be withdrawn immediately.

She said JNU students wouldn't relent without a complete rollback.

Students of JNU clashed with the police on Monday after they were stopped from marching to Parliament to protest a hostel fee hike.

Students also clashed with the police outside Safdurjung tomb near Jor Bagh.

According to the police, around 30 police personnel and 15 students were injured.

FIR FILED

The Delhi Police has filed an FIR at the Kishan Garh Police Station in connection with the ongoing protests.

The FIR was registered under Sections 186 (obstructing a public servant in the discharge of public functions) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty) of the Indian Penal Code.
