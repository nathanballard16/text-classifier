ABKS to hold protests against Congressrsquo betrayal of farmers

Jaipur: Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sabha (ABKS) will organize protests at district level on January 9, on the day of Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Jaipur to address farmers’ rally. In such a situation farm loan waiver is the only way out. ABKS alleged that the Modi government had failed to control the increasing input cost of farmers and to ensure remunerative price to farmers produce. It said instead of ridiculing the measure, the Modi and BJP governments need to study the Kerala model of loan waiver and provide relief to the farmers. The BJP governments in Maharashtra and Rajasthan also were forced to announce agriculture loan up to a certain limit after farmers’ agitation .
