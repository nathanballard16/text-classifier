Picanol, a leading textile machinery manufacturer, will be present with an information booth at Techtextil India, which will be held from 20-22 November in Mumbai. Amongst the company’s representatives will be product specialists, and the booth will be located in the Weaving Hall.

Driven by extensive investments in R&D, Picanol has grown into an industry leader for high-tech weaving machines in the sector of technical textiles. “Many recent developments clearly highlight this point,” the company says. “One is the growing success of the super-wide rapier machines, which can be equipped with positive guided grippers in widths up to 540 cm. Indeed, they are being considered as a valid alternative to projectile machines in such applications as agrotextiles, packaging, and carpet backings.”

Another innovation is the introduction of wasteless LHS in four colours (Ecofill 4) demonstrated during the last ITMA Barcelona for selected fabrics, such as para-aramids, where a significant cost savings in regard to waste can be obtained, according to the manufacturer. Furthermore, there is the new SmartShed technology, which was introduced on the most recent OmniPlus-i airjet machine and was also on display at ITMA, weaving car seat fabric with 14 harness frames at very high speeds. These introductions complete Picanol’s offerings for coated fabrics, conveyor belting, glass fibre, tire cords and airbags, among other things.

Picanol supplies weaving machines to weaving mills worldwide, and also offers its customers such products and services as weaving accessories, training, upgrade kits and spare parts. In India, Picanol operates three wholly-owned subsidiaries in New Delhi, Mumbai and Coimbatore. These subsidiaries offer sales support and a complete range of services for all Picanol products.
