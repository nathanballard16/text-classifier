A complaint was filed in the Chief Judicial Magistrate (CJM) court in Patna on Friday against the Congress party president Rahul Gandhi after he was shown as the avatar of Lord Ram in several banners and posters that were put up across the state capital.

The posters were put ahead of the Congress's Jan Akanksha rally in Patna on February 3.

The complainant Rakesh Dutt Mishra, also the general secretary of Bhartiya Jan Kranti Dal has filed a complaint in the court alleging that Rahul being shown in the avatar of Ram has hurt the sentiments of Hindus.

The complainant has also filed a case against state Congress president Madan Mohan Jha and party worker Vijay Kumar Singh whose pictures were also visible on the controversial poster.

On the poster showing Rahul Gandhi as Lord Ram, there were a couple of lines which were written attacking the BJP.

"Woh Ram naam japte rahe, tum bankar Ram jio re" [They keep chanting the name of Ram, you live like Ram]", the poster read.

The Congress party will be holding a rally on its own in Patna after a gap of 28 years and is leaving no stone unturned to ensure that the event becomes a huge success.

The Congress rally has already been embroiled in a lot of controversies in the last few days after notorious criminal-turned-politician Anant Singh was spotted in a Congress roadshow, garnering support for the rally.

The roadshow was done by Congress Rajya Sabha MP and chief of the campaign committee Akhilesh Prasad Singh.

The rally is also going to be a test of the unity of the mahagathbandhan in Bihar where RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav, Hindustani Awam Morcha chief Jitan Ram Manjhi, Loktantrik Janata Dal supremo Sharad Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Samta party president Upendra Kushwaha are expected to participate.
