Hundreds of Kashmiri politicians detained to quell protests over status

As many as 500 people have been rounded up in the latest crackdown in Indian Kashmir which has been on the edge since the right-wing government revoked its autonomy, reports said Thursday.

University professors, business leaders and activists were among the 560 people taken to makeshift detention centres - some during midnight raids - in the cities of Srinagar, Baramulla and Gurez, the Press Trust of India and the Indian Express reported.

Reuters estimated that 300 politicians and separatists had been detained to quell protests.

The detentions came as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was set to address the nation on the radio later Thursday to explain his Hindu nationalist government's decision to revoke the seven-decade long special status of the region through a presidential decree.

Parliament also passed legislation dividing the disputed region - which has experienced an armed rebellion against Indian rule since 1989 - into two territories to be governed directly by New Delhi.
