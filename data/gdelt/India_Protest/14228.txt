Left Front calls for Bengal bandh on Saturday after police clash with youth activists at rally

The Left Front has called for a state-wide bandh tomorrow in West Bengal in protest against the alleged assault of police forces on today's Left-wing students' procession in Howrah.

The West Bengal police on Friday resorted to using tear gas shells, water canons, and lathicharges on thousands of youth belonging to Left Front student organisations protesting against the snowballing job crisis in the state, injuring several present there.

The 'Nabanna Chalo' march called for a procession from Singur to the State Secretariat, Nabanna, in Howrah. It was organised by the Students' Federation of India (SFI), Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and ten other Left Front student and youth organisations.

According to reports, a police contingent comprising riot combat forces and RAF personnel was deployed as soon as the procession crossed Upper Foreshore Road in Howrah, where they clashed with the students in the Mallikfatak area. The student leaders also alleged Trinamool's goons of aiding the police in these clashes.

Several of the injured students have been admitted to the district and city hospitals, where they are now being provided urgent medical care, said Left Front chairman Biman Basu while condemning today's event. He backed the students' allegations and said that this was an assault planned by the ruling Trinamool Congress on a democratic protest.

Responding to the latest developments, Congress leader Somen Mitra has also said that they will support the CPI(M) in protest against the ruling party's 'autocratic rule' in the state. He added that a joint strategy for the opposition is in talks.
