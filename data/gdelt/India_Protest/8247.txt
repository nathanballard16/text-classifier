Curfew imposed in Occupied Kashmir

In occupied Kashmir, authorities have imposed curfew and strict restrictions and snapped internet service to prevent people from holding anti-India and pro-freedom demonstrations in the valley, Friday.

The authorities imposed curfew and restrictions in the valley after the martyrdom of a top mujahid commander, Zakir Musa, on Thursday evening.

Zakir Musa along with his associate was martyred by Indian troops during a cordon and search operation in Dadsara Tral area of Pulwama district.

The killing triggered massive protests in many parts of the valley last evening after which the authorities announced curfew and restrictions in Srinagar, Pulwama, Tral, Awantipora, Shopian, Islamabad and Badgam areas.

The authorities also ordered closure of all educational institutions across the valley to prevent students’ protests against the killing of Zakir Musa and his associate.

Meanwhile, heavy deployments of Indian troops and police personnel have been made in Srinagar, Badgam, Ganderbal, Pulwama, Islamabad, Shopian, Kulgam, Bandipora, Kupwara and Baramulla districts.

In wake of the prevailing situation, Kashmir University Srinagar and Islamic University of Science and Technology Awantipora Pulwama, have postponed all exams slated for today.
