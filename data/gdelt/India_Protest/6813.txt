More Protest against Shatrughan Sinha; Congress Says BJP Behind Them

Patna: Former Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Shatrughan Sinha is not catching any break from his own party members who have been up in arms against his candidacy from Patna Saheb seat on a Congress ticket going against his former party leader Ravi Shankar Prasad.

On Monday, over two dozen Congress workers protested outside Sadaqat Ashram where Sinha was supposed to be attending a meeting.

Chanting anti-Sinha slogans, Congress activists demanded removal of the former BJP MP from Patna Saheb saying he 'dropped from a parachute' at the behest of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) president Lalu Prasad Yadav and was given a ticket despite many senior party leaders in the waiting.

They also demanded his ouster from the party for campaigning for his wife Poonam Sinha who recently joined Samajwadi Party (SP). Sinha was by her side when she filed her nomination papers from Lucknow where she will be going against BJP stalwart Rajnath Singh.

As reported, Sinha faced a similar protest on Sunday when he arrived at the Congress headquarters in Patna to take part in a meeting.

The actor-turned-politician, who is largely relying on his 'Bihari Babu' image to woo the voters, is pitted against his former party colleague Ravi Shankar Prasad for the Patna Saheb seat from where he won twice in 2009 and 2014.

Sinha joined Congress Party a few weeks ago after Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP national president Amit Shah effectively sidelined him from the party because of his blistering and incessant verbal assault against the Modi-Shah duo.

Senior party leader Rajesh Rathore blamed the BJP for organizing protest against the former star.

"Except for one, none of the protesters was a Congress leader. We have reasons to believe these protests are being organized by the BJP that is afraid of losing the Patna Saheb seat," Rathore said.
