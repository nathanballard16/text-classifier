Congress dares KCR to stage anti-Modi protest

Gudur also ridiculed TRS party’s alliance with YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh. While Congress and other opposition parties are on people’s side, TRS is clearly on Modi’s side,” he said. Hyderabad: TPCC Treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy on Wednesday challenged Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao to hold a protest in Delhi or elsewhere against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the injustices meted out to Telangana State. He said the Congress has supported both the agitations and AICC president Rahul Gandhi addressed the day-long dharna held by AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. “When entire Opposition was raising its voice against the injustices being done by the BJP Government, the TRS wass aligning with PM Modi,” he alleged.
