In a historic move, the Andhra Pradesh legislative assembly on Friday passed "AP Disha Act 2019" to protect women and children in sexual offences cases by providing speedy investigation and justice to victims. Also known as the Andhra Pradesh Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2019, the bill provides for expediting the verdict in trials on rape and gang rape cases and also awarding death penalty within 21 days.

Maliwal has been on an indefinite hunger strike for 13 days seeking a 'fixed framework for punishment to rapists' and speedy deliverance of justice of a similar kind.
