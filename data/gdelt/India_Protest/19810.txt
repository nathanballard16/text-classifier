BHU professor Feroze Khan joins Arts faculty following protest over his appointment in SVDV department

ABVP students had said that only a Hindu can teach Sanskrit at the university

Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan department dean Bindeswari Prasad Mishra confirmed that Khan has joined the Arts faculty of the university where he will teach teach Sanskrit.

BHU professor Feroze Khan has resigned from his post at the Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vigyan (SVDV) department and joined the Arts faculty where he will teach Sanskrit, BHU sources said.

Khan was on November 8 appointed to the faculty of SVDV, whose curriculum includes Hindu religious texts.



Students, mostly belonging to the RSS' students wing Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), were protesting against Khan's appointment, saying that only a Hindu can teach Sanskrit at the university in Varanasi.

The group, comprising about 50 students, had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Ram Nath Kovind seeking cancellation of Khan's appointment.

Although the Benaras Hindu University backed Khan, he was unable to take classes for several days.

A few teachers, who did not reveal their identities, had earlier suggested that that Khan can alternatively be relocated to the university’s separate Sanskrit language and literature department that governs Sanskrit studies in the affiliated colleges.

Three weeks into AVBP's agitation, Khan on November 29 appeared for an interview to facilitate a transfer from SVDV to a different faculty.
