Muslims Have 150 Countries to Go, Hindus Have Only India: Gujarat CM

He said the Hindu population has shrunken to just 2 percent in Bangladesh.

"Out of 2 lakh Hindu and Sikh residents in Afghanistan some decades back, their number is just 500 today. Muslims can go to any of the 150 countries, but there is only [one] country for the Hindus, and that is India. So what is the problem if they want to come back?" asked Rupani.

Seeking to counter the protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in various parts of the country, Gujarat BJP leaders and government functionaries on Tuesday took part in pro-CAA rallies in all 33 districts of the state.

The rallies and demonstrations were organised by 'Nagrik Samitis' (citizen committees) having the support of the RSS.
