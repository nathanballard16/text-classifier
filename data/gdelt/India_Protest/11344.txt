Kerala Youth Congress workers purify PWD office with cow dung after Dalit MLA's protest, FIR lodged

A Kerala CPI MLA has alleged that Youth Congress activists "purified" the premises of a PWD officer with cow dung because she held a protest in front of it on Saturday.

The incident took place in Kerala's Thrissur district and the CPI MLA from Nattika constituency, Geetha Gopi has said that she was subjected to caste discrimination and abuse by the Youth Congress activists.

Dalit MLA Geetha Gopi was protesting in front of the Public Works Department (PWD) office to raise concerns against the poor condition of the roads in the area.

She later withdrew the protest after concerned officers assured her of taking action in the matter.

Once she left the premises of the PWD office, Youth Congress activists landed up at the site and started sprinkling water and cow dung to "purify" the area.

In a counter-protest against Geetha Gopi, Youth Congress activists took out a march against the Dalit MLA. Later they sprayed cow dung mixed water to purify the place. The Youth Congress workers said Geetha was trying to fool the people.

She also said that she will take up the matter with Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. State Ministers also came down on the Youth Congress workers and said such acts cannot be accepted.

Kerala Cultural Minister A K Balan lashed out at the Youth Congress activists and alleged such so-called purification ceremony was usually seen in north India.

"Such acts are normally seen in north India. It cannot be accepted," Balan told reporters.

MLA Geetha Gopi filed a complaint with the local police. Cherpur Police then lodged an FIR based on the MLA's complaint under provisions of the SC/ST Act.
