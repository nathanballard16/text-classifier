Anti-CAA protest: Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, Sandeep Dikshit detained in Delhi

Swaraj Abhiyan founder and activist Yogendra Yadav was detained at Delhi's Red Fort on Thursday morning during ongoing, nationwide protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

He then posted a selfie from the police van, and said a "thousand" others had been detained, too. "Am told we are being taken to Bawana," he wrote in a tweet.

"It is an honour to be detained on the 19th of December, a small tribute to Ashfakulla Khan and Ramprasad Bismil," Yadav added later.

Former student leader Umar Khalid and Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit were also detained in the capital.

I have just been detained from Lal Qila. About a thousand protesters already detained. Thousands on the way.

Am told we are being taken to Bawana.

Authorities in Delhi swung into action this morning to contain the fallout of the amended citizenship act, which critics say is anti-Muslim, following violent protests in recent days.

The law offers citizenship to Pakistani, Afghan and Bangladeshi illegal immigrants who fled their home countries to escape religious persecution.

It covers six minority religious groups, but not Islamic ones.

The government has pointed out that the law won't take citizenship away from Indians, denied the charge that it is anti-Muslim, and promised to protect locals' rights in the Northeast, where there are fears of a threat to their social and cultural identity.
