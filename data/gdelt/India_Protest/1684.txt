Robbers Use Google Maps To Identify Temples In Deserted Areas In Karnataka, Loot 11 Temples

Technology is the reason the world is progressing by leaps and bounds. It has made our lives simpler and easier but it has a flipside too. A gang of five used Google Maps to identify the temples located in deserted places in Karnataka and looted them.

According to Times Of India, the gang used Google Maps to rob temples in Karnataka’s Mysuru and Chamarajanagar districts. In the past five months, from September 2018 to January 2019, the gang robbed 11 temples in the area and took valuable items worth Rs 2.9 lakhs.

None of the gang members - all aged between 19 to 26 - have a criminal past record or are hardcore criminals, according to the report. They come from professional backgrounds and they joined hands to carry out these robberies.

The gang reportedly used Google Maps to search for temples in remote areas and then made the fool-proof plan to conduct the robbery.

After getting complaints about the series of robberies in Chamarajanagar district, the police investigated the matter and identified a pattern of the robbers. Their efforts soon paid off and they nabbed the gang.

According to the report, Chamarajanagar police told the publication that the gang looted two temples in Mysuru and nine temples in Chamarajanagar in past five months.
