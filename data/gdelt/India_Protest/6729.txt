Jain community seeks apology from govt

Ludhiana: Punjab government’s clarification following protest by the members of Jain community about an advertisement has failed to pacify the members of Jain community. The representatives of the community had recently complained to Punjab chief secretary Karan A Singh claiming that the government had wrongly used the picture of Gautam Buddha in place of Lord Mahavir on Mahavir Jayanti on April 17. Subsequently the government through a press release had clarified that the picture was a ‘creator’s imagination’.

Sandeep Jain , state Coordinator Vishwa Jain Sanghathan who has again taken up the issue with the chief secretary through a complaint said, “The clarification by Public relations Department as Published in media is false, unsatisfactory and evasive. Statement that the picture is imagination of an artist is lame excuse to cover their ignorance and casual attitude of the government in handling the affairs of Minorities. He also demanded that the government should calm down the sentiments of community.
