Ahmedabad: Banking and postal services continued to be affected in Gujarat on the second day of the two-day strike called by central trade unions Wednesday.

Unions also staged protest marches and demonstrations in major cities, said Arun Mehta, general secretary of the Gujarat unit of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU). Thousands of more Anganwadi (state-run child care centres) and ASHA (accredited social health activists) workers joined in the protest on the second day, taking out rallies in Anand, Morbi and Palanpur, he said.

Postal employees took part in the strike under the banner of the Postal Joint Council of Action. Staying away from work, they staged demonstrations, forcing post offices to down the shutters, he said.

"More Anganwadi and ASHA workers joined in the strike Wednesday, taking the number of striking workers beyond 10 lakh," claimed Mehta. Workers in industrial units at Ankleshwar in Bharuch and those at ports also joined in the shut-down, he said.

Banking services were partially hit, with around 40,000 employees of public sector banks except State Bank of India stayed away from work, said Janak Rawal, general secretary of the Mahagujarat Bank Employees Association.

As many as 10 central trade unions except the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh are protesting against the government's alleged anti-labour policies and unilateral labour reforms. They had given a call for a two-day Bharat Bandh on January 8 and 9.
