Narrating the incident on Twitter, Dhawan said that the miscreants came back to her after looting the money and threw the empty handbag on her face.

“I had a quite DISTURBING EXPERIENCE last evening on #DelhiRoad. It raises many questions in my mind. Least I expect is a thorough investigation to crackdown these organised looters,as I hear now is that this stretch being often used,” she said in a series of tweets.
