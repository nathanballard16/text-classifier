Maryam, Bilawal running ‘Save Father’ campaign, says Fawad

ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Fawad Chaudhry said on Thursday that Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Bhutto have initiated ‘save the father’ campaign as they face investigation under the National Accountability Bureau.

The federal minister said that Maryam Nawaz’s father has laundered Rs300 billion while Bilawal’s father has looted around Rs500 billion.

“The children will utilise the money to run a campaign for their fathers,” he said.

The Sharifs and former president Asif Ali Zardari’s family have no political future and even their children acknowledge it, Fawad Chaudhry said during a press conference.

The federal minister said that he had earlier predicted that it was the last election for the Sharifs and Zardari.

“The Sharif family is worried that there is a sale going on in London and they cannot go out of the country,” said Fawad Chaudhry.

He said that in the past 40 years only two families have fared well while the country kept on suffering.

In an indirect reference to Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto’s statements regarding banned outfits, the federal minister said that crackdown was carried out against extremists.

“No one will be allowed to conspire against the will of the state,” he said.

The federal information minister said that acquitting the suspects behind the Samjhota Express blast case was condemnable. “India’s judicial system has become a bry clean system for terrorists,” he said after an Indian court acquitted four suspects in the 2007 train bombing.
