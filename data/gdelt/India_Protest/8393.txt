Cong rules out division after LS poll setback

NPP’s Ferlin to take oath today

SHILLONG: The state Congress has ruled out any division within the party after it fared poorly in Garo Hills as its candidate and CLP leader Mukul Sangma was defeated by NPP’s Agatha Sangma.

Another setback was Congress losing Selsella seat which was earlier held by the party.

Ferlin Sangma, who emerged victorious after Selsella by-poll, will take oath on Wednesday afternoon.

Congress legislator and Opposition Chief Whip P T Sawkmie said on Tuesday that there was no question of division within the Congress.

“We are all united and there is no reason for any disunity”, he said.

Despite the defeat of the CLP leader in Garo Hills, there is a reason for rejoice in Khasi Hills as the Congress candidate Vincent Pala won the Shillong seat by a record margin.

Call for inner-party reforms

Former Congress leader John Kharshiing said a two- term limit for leadership will revive the Congress party post 2019 elections.

Kharshiing, in a statement, said as a former Meghalaya Pradesh Congress Committee office bearer, who resigned in protest against lack of transparency, he felt that the crisis within Congress can be solved only by inner party democracy nationally.

“Introducing a term limit and conducting primaries under a neutral election commission for electing all party officials and elected representatives would go a long way in reviving the congress party, so that capable state leaders have the opportunity to lead nationally and the people of India have voted out the concept of a high command”, he said.

According to the former Congress leader, the recent decision of leaders from various political parties such as INC, TMC and others to announce their desire to resign is only cosmetic in nature and what is more important is whether these parties will walk the talk on inner party reforms.
