BJP holds nationwide protest, demands apology from Rahul Gandhi, Arvind Kejriwal over Rafale remarks

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) staged a countrywide protest on Saturday seeking Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's apology on the Rafale issue after the Supreme Court gave a clean chit to the Modi government in the matter on Thursday and rejected the petitions for a review of its earlier order.

The BJP started a protest outside All India Congress Committee (AICC) office in Mumbai, demanding an apology from Gandhi over his remarks on Rafale verdict.

BJP working president JP Nadda said that the Congress raised questions on the transparency of defense deals in India.

BJP workers and leaders also held a protest outside the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) office, demanding an apology from Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal after Supreme Court dismissed Rafale review petitions.

While protesting in Kolkata, the saffron party supporters tore and deface posters of Rahul Gandhi demanding an apology from him after Supreme Court dismissed Rafale review petitions.

The Supreme Court on Thursday dismissed a review petition seeking a court-monitored criminal probe into the Rafale fighter jet deal between the Indian government and France's Dassault Aviation.

The three-judge bench of the Supreme Court comprising Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi, Justices SK Kaul and KM Joseph dismissed to review the petition in a unanimous judgment.

The bench also rejected a plea by former Union ministers Yashwant Sinha and Arun Shourie, and senior lawyer Prashant Bhushan to hold defence ministry officials liable for perjury i.e. giving false information to the court.
