The Editors Guild of India on Saturday "deplored the indefensible acts of violence" perpetrated on the employees of Assamese news channel Prag News by police.Demanding an inquiry to identify those who were involved in the violence against journalists, the Guild said it wants the guilty to be punished.The Editors Guild also expressed concern over the recent advisory issued by the ministry of information and broadcasting to all private TV channels asking them to desist from broadcasting content that could incite violence.Editors Guild issued a statement after its attention was drawn to a social media video that shows uniformed policemen running amok outside the Prag News offices, 'targeting cameramen belong to the channel with their batons'.Security personnel, including Central Reserve Police Force ( CRPF ) jawans, had on Thursday barged into the office of Prag News in Guwahati and beat up its staffers with batons during protests against the amended Citizenship Act, a senior official of the channel said.According to the channel official, the security forces entered the office building and beat up more employees at the reception area."It was completely unprovoked and there was no reason for them to enter a media office. We demand an unconditional apology from Assam police," Prag News managing editor Pranoy Bordoloi said on Friday.
