Preet Vihar residents protest against Ward 91 councillor

Ludhiana: Residents of Preet Vihar have hanged posters against the area councillor Gurpinder Kaur Sandhu and her husband Baljinder Singh Sandhu for not resolving the problem of water contamination.

The residents staged a protest against the councillor on Sunday stating that she has been missing since the time she was elected as the councillor from Ward 91.

“We have put up posters in the locality,” said the residents. The councilor, however, claimed that this was being done due to political agenda in order to defame her and her husband’s image.

Residents of Preet Vihar rue that whenever there is heavy rainfall in the area water contamination problem starts which adds to their woes.

The residents alleged that despite several complaints, their problem was not resolved. They claimed that the area councillor was missing and her husband acted as the councillor of the ward.

They said they did not require dummy councillor in their ward. “We will fall ill if the problem of water contamination is not solves at the earliest. Apart from this, not even a single issue has been redressed,” said the residents.

Meanwhile, when contacted area councillor Sandhu, she said the civic officials would visit the area on Monday and the problem of water contamination would be resolved. She said similar banners were put up in Chander Nagar a few days back and some miscreants in the area were trying to spoil her image.
