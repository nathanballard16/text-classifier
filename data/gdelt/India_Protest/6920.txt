Amit Shah warns against Opposition alliance, reminds Bihar of Lalu-Rabri’s ‘jungle raj’

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah on Wednesday launched a scathing attack on the Mahagathbandhan alliance, urging voters in Bihar to elect NDA candidates and ensure a "peaceful, prosperous and safe India".

Shah held four rallies in the state on Wednesday — at Munger, Begusarai and Samastipur — and said only two types of people were unhappy with the Balakot air strikes. "One is the Pakistan government, and the other is Rahul baba and company. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will give a befitting reply to all acts of cross-border terrorism," he said.

Shah also brought up the 15-year RJD rule in the state, calling it a "jungle raj". "The Lalu-Rabri regime did nothing for the poor and downtrodden people in the state. There was only lawlessness, and its memories send shivers down the spine of residents of Bihar."

He then targeted the Mahagathbandhan over its lack of leadership. "If they get a majority, there will be a different Prime Minister every day. Is that how a country should work?" he asked.

Listing out development work done by the NDA government at the Centre, Shah said, “In the five years of the Narendra Modi government, Bihar has already received more funds than what it got in the 10 years of UPA’s rule. Work has already started on different works under the special package promised to Bihar.”

Shah, flanked by a number of senior BJP leaders, including state president Nityanand Rai and deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, challenged Congress’s Rahul Gandhi to give an account of what his party and family had done in so many years of ruling the country.
