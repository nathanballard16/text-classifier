Protests were held in the northeast of India on Tuesday against a proposed legislation that would citizenship to non-Muslim minorities from neighboring countries of Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

The controversial religion-based citizenship bill, which goes against the country’s plural secular ethos, was passed by the Lok Sabha on Monday after hours of a heated debate in the lower house of the Indian parliament.
