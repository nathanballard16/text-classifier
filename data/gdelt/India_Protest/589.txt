Trade unions rope in kids for Bharat bandh

Bhubaneswar: In what can be termed as an appalling sight, Tuesday, many children were seen protesting against ‘anti-labour, anti-people and anti-national policies’ of the Centre during the two-day strike called by trade unions.

Young boys were seen taking part in protest rallies and shouting slogans. They also picketed main roads of the capital city holding red flags with the Communist symbol. Mimicking the actions of the adults, the children were also seen stopping cars and two-wheelers from reaching their destinations.

Some minors were also spotted roaming around with deflated cycle tyres and putting them as a ‘garland of shame’ around the necks of those who were driving around to reach their office.

While speculation is rife that the children have been paid a meagre amount to protest, many also rubbished the rumours and said that the kids are sons of daily wagers and are doing this willingly to support their parents’ demands. While holidays were declared for schools in view of the bandh, little did authorities know that the decision would prove to be counter-productive.

The 10 trade unions that have jointly called for the nationwide general strike are: INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, AICCTU, TUCC, UTUC, LPF and SEWA.

Farmers too joined the road blockades, demonstrations and protest meetings throughout the country to register their resentment against the government and its policies.
