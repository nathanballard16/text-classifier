During the clash, 17 vehicles were vandalised. The Delhi High Court ordered a judicial inquiry into the clash by one of its retired judges.

Following the court’s directions, Special Commissioner Sanjay Singh and Additional DCP Harinder Singh were also transferred. Four FIRs have been lodged in connection with the incident under relevant sections, including charges of attempt to murder.
