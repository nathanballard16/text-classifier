Upset over ED's notice to Raj Thackeray, MNS worker self-immolates, dies

The MNS worker has been identified as Praveen Chowgule, who took this extreme step of ending his life after party chief was summoned by the ED.

A worker of Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) has committed suicide after party's chief was summoned by the Enforcement Directorate (ED). The worker hails from Thane in Maharashtra.

The MNS worker has been identified as Praveen Chowgule, who took this extreme step of ending his life after party chief was summoned by the ED.

According to reports, before taking this extreme step, Praveen Chowgule had spoken against ED summoning Raj Thackeray and also discussed the matter with party's area chief in Thane.

The police is carrying further investigation in the matter.

Earlier on Thursday, the MNS had called for a shut down against the ED notice to its chief which was later withdrawn by the party.

The ED is probing the alleged irregularities pertaining to IL&FS Group's loan and equity investment in Kohinoor CTNL, which is one of the defaulters. Kohinoor CTNL is developing Kohinoor Square tower in Dadar (West) in Mumbai.

However, on Tuesday, Raj Thackeray had appealed party workers to respect the investigative agencies and not to gather outside the ED office in Mumbai on August 22.
