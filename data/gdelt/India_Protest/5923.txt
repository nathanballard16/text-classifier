Pro-freedom, pro-Pakistan slogans rock Ganderbal College

Srinagar, April 03, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the Government Degree College Ganderbal reverberated with pro-freedom, pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans as the pro-India National Conference President, Farooq Abdullah, arrived in Ganderbal to address a convention of party workers.

Eyewitnesses said that girls and boys in large numbers studying in the college gathered in the college campus shouting pro-freedom, pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans as soon as Farooq Abdullah arrived in the area.

The NC President and candidate for Srinagar constituency of Indian Parliamentary elections, Farooq Abdullah, was in Ganderbal with other leaders of the party. However the students did not give a warm welcome to the NC leaders, in fact raised slogans against India as the party members entered into the campus.

Similarly, a few days ago in Bandipora, the students of the Government Degree College had staged a strong protest against a function held by the Indian Army in the college. The army was forced to leave the college campus after strong resentment from the students.

It is to mention here that in April 2017, the Indian Army personnel thrashed almost a hundred students of Government Degree College in Pulwama, after which a series of protests by students rocked the Kashmir valley. Since then the student were continuing their protests. Demonstrations against India’s attempts to abrogate Article 35-A, killing of youth and other Indian atrocities have been held inside various colleges in occupied Kashmir. The Indian police have also arrested many students after barging inside the college campuses.
