Kashmiris have been betrayed, says IUML

Protesting against the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution that had given special rights to Jammu and Kashmir, the Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has accused the Centre of cheating the people of Kashmir.

In a release, IUML State general secretary K.P.A. Majeed said on Monday that the special rights were one of the conditions for merging the erstwhile princely State of Kashmir with the Indian Union. He alleged that the opinion of the people there or their elected representatives was not considered while abrogating Article 370. This act would only help turn the Kashmiris against India, he added.

IUML activists took out a march in Kozhikode city in the evening in protest against the Centre. Similar protests would be held in other parts of the State on Tuesday. The Indian National League termed it a challenge to the conscience of India. Party president A.P. Abdul Wahab and general secretary Kasim Irikkur said that the Article was a historical link connecting the Valley with the rest of the country.

Protest march

Activists of the district unit of the DYFI also took out a protest march on Monday evening. Revolutionary Marxist Party of India State secretary N. Venu said that the decision to bifurcate Jammu and Kashmir was an assault on democracy.
