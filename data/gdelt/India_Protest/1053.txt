BJP's rath halts in Bengal, Supreme Court puts ball in Mamata's court

The SC was hearing the BJP's plea to hold the rally led by Amit Shah that would cover 42 Parliamentary constituencies in the state.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday (January 15) rejected a plea by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to hold a rath yatra in West Bengal, saying it is up to the state government to grant permission for the event.

The Bengal government had earlier denied permission for holding rallies across 42 constituencies in the state citing law and order concerns.

The apex court was hearing the BJP's plea to hold the rath yatra that would cover 42 Parliamentary constituencies in the state ahead of the 2019 general elections. The BJP in its plea has said that its fundamental right to hold a peaceful yatra cannot be withheld.

The top court said that the "apprehension expressed by state government are not unfounded".

The Trinamool Congress (TMC) government at the state had earlier denied permission to BJP to hold the Amit Shah rally. The BJP had then approached Calcutta High Court seeking permission to hold the yatra, also known as 'Save Democracy Rally'.

However, a single-judge bench order at first granted them permission but a division bench later denied permission to hold the rally. The BJP then moved the Supreme Court challenging the Calcutta HC order, seeking permission to hold the 'Save Democracy Rally'.

The rallies, according to the original schedule, were supposed to be flagged off by BJP president Amit Shah from Bengal's Cooch Behar district on December 7, Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas on December 9, and from Tarapith temple in Birbhum on December 14.
