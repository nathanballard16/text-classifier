Spicejet to hire 2000 laid off Jet Airways staff

SpiceJet has said it will hire the laid off Jet Airways employees as part of its expansion.

SpiceJet has said it plans to hire up to 2,000 staff of the now-defunct Jet Airways. The absorption will include pilots and cabin crew. The hires are part of SpiceJet's push to expand its operations.

Not just staff, SpiceJet has also taken in at least 22 planes that were earlier used by Jet Airways, which temporarily shuttered its operations due to cash crunch in April.

"We have taken a significant number of people from Jet Airways. They were well qualified ad professional people. We will continue to take more Jet staff in the times to come," SpiceJet Chairman and Managing Director Ajay Singh told news agency PTI.

"We have taken around 1,100 people so far. The expectation is that we will go up to 2,000 people. It will be pilots, cabin crew, (people) from airport services, security," he added.
