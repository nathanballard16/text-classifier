Delhi cops protest over violent clash with lawyers

The Delhi police on Tuesday launched protests outside the national capital Police headquarters to protest against Saturday’s violent clashes between cops and lawyers and the subsequent attack on policemen outside the Saket district court on Monday.

The Indian Police Service (IPS) in a tweet extended support to the Delhi police personnel.

“Incident involving police & lawyers unfortunate. All should take a balanced view of it based on facts in public domain. Countrywide, police stands in solidarity with those police personnel subjected to physical assault & humiliation. Condemn all attempts to break law, by anyone!,” IPS tweeted.

Many IPS officers took to Twitter to condemn the attack on policemen.

Former Jammu and Kashmir DGP Shesh Paul Vaid in a tweet said, “Saddened to see such treatment meted out to Police officers who spend their entire lives protecting civil society and maintaining law & order.”

The policemen in uniform were seen wearing black bands to condemn the attacks.

On Saturday, a scuffle broke out between police and the lawyers in Delhi’s Tis Hazari Court following a parking dispute.

Gunshots were heard and a lawyer was also injured in the incident.

The Opposition is now using the protest by policemen as an opportunity to attack the government.

Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala in a tweet said, “A new low in 72 years – Police on protest in ‘National Capital of Delhi’. Is this BJP’s ‘New India’? Where will BJP take the country? Where is India’s HM, Sh. Amit Shah?”
