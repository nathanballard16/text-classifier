Frustrated with police inaction, a 37-year-old businessman allegedly set himself afire within a police station compound in a west Delhi area on Wednesday, police said.

The police identified the accused as Rahul, who is into an e-rickshaw recharging business. He has received serious burns in his chest and face, police said.

The police said Rahul entered the police station with a can of petrol and set himself afire. Police said their men and locals saved him and rushed him to a nearby hospital.
