Students stir at Mumbai's Azad Maidan enters eighth day

Maratha students aspiring for admissions to postgraduate medical and dental courses continued their protest against the incumbent BJP-led government for the eighth day on Tuesday. The students are protesting against the government for not implementing the SEBC reservation.



Students representatives met medical education minister Girish Mahajan on Monday, who tried to convince the students to withdraw their stir and promised required action after polls once the model code of conduct is lifted.



"We will present the situation before the court and justice shall be done," Mahajan told the protesters.



Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar also met the protesters at Azad Maidan. It was Pawar, who took the delegation of students to meet Mahajan.



Various organisations of the Maratha community have also extended their support to these 250 medical students. The community feels neglected after recently, the Supreme Court upheld the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court's order of not implementing reservations for Maratha students for medical and dental admissions this year.



Dr Sonal Dhanawade, an undergraduate student of dental surgery is sad to know that her admission to the postgraduate course stands cancelled. "It has been more than ten days now. And on Monday, they cancelled the admission. The government is equally responsible for making a mess of our academic life. The government should have studied all legal aspects properly before introducing the quota into college admissions," Dhanawade said.



"The SEBC option was provided in the admission form. We diligently followed the entire procedure. We even got the caste validity certificate. Without any fault of ours, our career has been jeopardised. We are facing political injustice because we are Marathas", said Dr Sharad More, an MBBS doctor, who was also a part of this protest.
