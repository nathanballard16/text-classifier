Striking bank staff hold rally against proposed merger

Ludhiana: Employees of government banks who were on strike on Tuesday organised a rally outside Canara Bank in Bharat Nagar Chowk, and protested against the government against the proposed merger of public sector banks. DP Maur, general secretary of the Joint Trade Union Council (Ludhiana); and Naresh Gaur, secretary, Punjab Bank Employees Federation (PBEF) led the charge and addressed the gathering of bank employees.

Speaking on the occasion, Gaur said, “In a devastating announcement, the finance minister informed the nation that 10 public sector banks would be merged into four banks. Which means six banks will now get closed. The government may call it a merger, but in reality, it is a cold-blooded murder of six banks. Public sector banks have a very special and pivotal role to play. From a total deposit of Rs5,000 crore, public sector banks have today mobilized nearly Rs85 lakh crore as deposits, and from total loans and advances of Rs3,500 crore, today public sector banks have extended loans to the extent of Rs60 lakh crore. But unfortunately, in the name of new economic policies and liberalization, banking sector reforms are being pursued in the past 28 years by successive governments.”

According to DP Maur, “Universally, any process of merger, consolidation or amalgamation has resulted in reduction of staff. Hence, mergers will result in staff redundancy and threaten job security, besides drastically reducing future job potential. While the business of banks had gone up, and more number of branches have been opened, the number of employees are getting reduced in all banks. These vacancies are not being filled up.”

Meanwhile, city residents had a tough time getting their banking transactions done due to the strike of government banks.
