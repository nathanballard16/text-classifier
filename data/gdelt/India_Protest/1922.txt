AIBOC to hold ‘Maha Morcha’ to protest bank amalgamation

To protest the amalgamation of Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank with Bank of Baroda and delay in the industry-wide wage negotiation process, the All-India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) is planning to organise a ‘Maha Morcha’ (big rally) in Delhi on February 4.

The confederation, in a statement, said it strongly condemns the haste with which the government continues to defy all guidelines in trying to push through the merger of Vijaya Bank, Dena Bank and Bank of Baroda.

“The Delhi High Court has given notices to the Central Government on a writ filed by the AIBOC, and has called for the complete documents to be presented on February 13.

“The merger plans of regional rural banks are also equally condemnable with no perceptible gains to the economy, but will definitely pose hurdles/difficulties to ordinary farmers/artisans,” said Soumya Datta, General Secretary.

Deploring the stand adopted by the Indian Banks’ Association on bipartite wage negotiations, the confederation said the association has disregarded the majority member banks (15) that have submitted ‘unconditional mandate’ for the bipartite negotiations, and refuse to negotiate for the entire officer community stating that five banks have submitted only ‘fractured mandate’.

“We are aggrieved that the RBI, despite having powers to regulate and control private sector banks, and despite having two officials in the board of Catholic Syrian Bank, has so far been a mute spectator.”
