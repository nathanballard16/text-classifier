Hyderabad: The Sikh community has sought Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention in the case in Pakistan where a Sikh girl was allegedly abducted, converted to Islam and forcibly married to a Muslim.

The community staged a protest in Hyderabad against the Pakistan government’s inaction on the abduction of the Sikh girl in Lahore.

Shri Guru Singh Sabha president Guru Charan Singh said, “Pakistan is exposed as it cannot guarantee the safety and security of the Sikh community on its soil despite Pakistan Prime Min-ister Imran Khan’s claims of guaranteeing the rights of minorities. When Sikhs worldwide are celebrating the 550th birth anniversary of Baba Guru Nanak, Pakistan’s hypocrisy has been exposed.”

A protestor said “We will write to PM Modi to look into the matter. The protestors demanded stringent action against the gang that abducted the woman.

The protest was held under the aegis of the Gowliguda Gurudwara, a press release said.
