Thousands gather for anti-India demonstrations in Karachi amid Kashmir tensions

Protesters held signs, chanted slogans and displayed a large Kashmiri flag during Sunday's rally in Karachi, organised by political party Jamaat-e-Islami.

"We demand that the peace mission of the United Nations should visit Srinagar, like how they go to Uganda, East Timor, Djibouti and other countries of Africa," said Jamaat-e-Islami party chief Siraj ul Haq.



"There has been a curfew for around a month. People are being slaughtered and killed, and I ask, who would show solidarity with them? In the first stage, the government of Pakistan, UN and Security Council, OIC and other countries must take active measures to give Kashmiri's the right to freedom."

India's decision to strip the region of its special constitutional status on August 5 led to an unprecedented security lockdown and curfew in the disputed region.

After addressing the large crowd of protesters, Jamaat-e-Islami party chief Siraj ul Haq called on other nations to "take active measures to give Kashmiri's the right to freedom."
