Watch | Global Climate Strike: What happened around the world on September 20

On September 20, 2019, the world stood up and took notice of the millions of people across the world taking to the streets for the Global Climate Strike.

The signs and impacts of global heating are speeding up. World Meteorological Organization data says the five-year period from 2014 to 2019 has been the warmest on record. There has also been a significant rise in sea-levels and CO2 emissions.

The strike was a call for citizens and leaders to immediately address climate change.

A huge crowd of youngsters, led by 16-year-old Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, protested in New York. Hundreds of people rallied in the southwestern French city of Bordeaux to protest against climate change.

Islamabad saw hundreds of children demanding adults act to stop environmental disaster. Thousands of protesters hit Parisian streets to demonstrate against inaction on climate change.

Nearly 15,000 people marched through the streets of Brussels during the Global Climate Strike. Climate change protesters gathered at Millennium Square in Leeds city centre demanding immediate action to stop climate change. Australia saw an estimate of 300,000 people gathered at more than 100 rallies calling for action to guard against climate change.

Youngsters in India took to the streets of New Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai and several other cities for what could be the largest climate protest in history.
