Protest at India Gate against citizenship amendment bill

A motley group of protesters gathered at the India Gate here protesting against the "divisive" Citizenship Amendment Bill which passed the Rajya Sabha hurdle on Wednesday.

The protesters raised anti-BJP and anti-government slogans and asked the President not to sign the Bill into a law.

The police appealed the playcard-carrying protesters to disperse but to no avail.
