Congress steps in to rescue Ashu

LUDHIANA: With criticism of cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu for his alleged involvement in the CLU scam increasing with every passing day due to frequent protests by Opposition, the Congress leaders have stepped in to his rescue.On Tuesday as well, Aam Admi Party (AAP) held a massive protest against Ashu outside his residence where mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu, Congress leaders Sunny Bhalla and others tried to pacify protesters.Meanwhile, speaking to TOI on the issue, district president of Congress committee, Ashwani Sharma, said, “This is really unfortunate that the opposition parties are raking up an unnecessary issue and doing dirty politics over it. Staging protests in cases which are not even established is totally uncalled for and exposes the real face of these parties and their leaders. AAP is resorting to such cheap tactics because they have nothing better to do.”On the other hand, Balkar Singh Sandhu on Tuesday said the opposition parties should not politicise issues of which they have no knowledge. He said its sad that some political leaders are raising non-issues for the sake of their petty politics, which leads to wastage of everybody’s time. Meanwhile after the AAP leaders were detained by the Ludhiana police, mayor Balkar Singh Sandhu visited the police station and asked the senior officials to release the detained AAP leaders.
