Protest Across Bihar over Desecration of Marx, Lenin Statues

Patna: Enraged by the destruction of the idols of Lenin and Marx allegedly by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) activists in Tripura a couple of days ago, leftist parties in Bihar staged protest march across the state to condemn the act what they described as 'abhorrent' and 'dangerous for India as a nation'.

Joining hands to express their outrage, Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) state secretary Awadhesh Kumar, Communist Party of India-Marxist/Leninist (CPI-ML) state secretary Kunal, Communist Party of India (CPI) leader Janki Paswan, and Socialist Unity Center of India (SUCI) state secretary Arun Kumar, at a protest rally at Kargil Chowk in Patna on Wednesday said that the saffron brigade may be able to desecrate the statues of their heroes like Lenin and Marx but they will never be able to erase the ideals of these leaders.

"One cannot wipe off the ideas and philosophies of Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin and other left leaders who historically stood for the worker class and fought for their rights and privileges. What the BJP leaders are encouraging is akin to what the Taliban used to do in Afghanistan. We, as communists, will not allow this to happen and will continue to raise the flags of Marx and Lenin to protect the rights of poor, workers, farmers, and the oppressed class," Kunal said adding similar rallies were held across the state to express anger against the BJP high-handedness.

As reported, SUCI activists on Tuesday had burnt the effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after Sangh elements in Tripura toppled the statues of Lenin and Marx to signify the end of communism in the state following the victory of the BJP in the state Assembly elections late last week.
