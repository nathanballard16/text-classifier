Rights outfits slam Anand Teltumbde's arrest

A collective of civil rights organisations and advocates and academicians condemned the arrest of known academician and rights activist Anand Teltumbde in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence and for an alleged plot to assassinate Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Teltumbde was arrested by Pune police around 3.30am on Saturday from the Mumbai Airport even as the Supreme Court had provided him protection from arrest till February 11.

The rights organisations, under the banner of Campaign against state repression, said the arrest of activists from across the country have compounded and continued unabated under the auspices of draconian laws, ranging from UAPA, NSA, sedition law and other such states laws that ostensibly uphold national integrity.



Last year, on June 6, the Pune police had arrested five 'Urban Naxals' for alleged Maoist links and allegedly inciting riots in Bhima Koregaon, near Pune in January 2018. Sudhir Dhawale, member of the Republican Panther; Surendra Gadling, lawyer, Rona Jacob Wilson, activist, Mahesh Raut, activist and former Prime Minister rural development fellow and Soma Sen, retired Nagpur University professor were the five arrested.



"By invoking sections under draconian laws like UAPA, simply being charged is read as an indictment. The message is clear, this law is used to silence voices of dissent," a statement by the rights activists said. They also demanded the immediate release of the people arrested for their alleged links to the Koregaon violence and sought arrest of Sambhaji Bhide and Milind Ekbote, who they claimed were the real culprits of the violence.
