Bellary SP Arun Rangarajan tod news agency ANI that there are likely 4-5 people involved in it. Accused will be arrested and prosecuted. "I will not be able to give more information, will speed up inquiry," he said.

This year Hampi has emerged at the second spot in the list of '52 places to go in 2019' published by The New York Times. The report recommends Hampi as a favoured place, and talks about its archeological monuments, scenic vistas against the Tungabhadra river, and geological rock formations.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site figures behind Puerto Rico, which has grabbed the top place for its amazing recovery from Hurricane Maria to rebound as a tourist destination.
