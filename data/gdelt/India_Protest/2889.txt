The Opposition on Monday tried to send a message of strengthening its unity ahead of the General Election with Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and AAP head Arvind Kejriwal among others joining Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu in a daylong hunger strike against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

However, the CPM and CPI skipped the event. This comes on the heels of West Bengal CM and TMC chief Mamata Banerjee recent dharna in Kolkata in protest against Modi on the CBI issue, which got fulsome support from the Opposition spectrum.

Naidu's fast to press for special category status to Andhra Pradesh turned out to be a show of strength with Andhra Pradesh Bhawan —the venue of the agitation —assuming the look of a beehive of people. Andhraites residing here, turned up in large number, with Andhra pride versus the Centre writ large on their faces.

Two special trains were reserved to bring in people from the state to the national capital for the protest. The TDP MPs and MLAs and Naidu's Cabinet colleagues accompanied him.

Mualyam Singh Yadav, Sharad Yadav, and representatives of TMC, DMK, SP and BSP were among others who joined Naidu. “The PM made a commitment to the people of Andhra and this PM does not fulfil that commitment… Chowkidar Chor hai,” said Gandhi, who joined Naidu before leaving for Lucknow.
