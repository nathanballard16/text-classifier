Facing protests, Marathi literary meet withdraws invite to noted writer Nayantara Sehgal

Bowing down to the protests surrounding veteran author and known Modi-critic Nayantara Sehgal being invited to a literary meet, the organisers have now revoked the invitation for the January 11 event.

Sehgal was invited to inaugurate the 92nd All-India Marathi Sahitya Sabha and "some people" had allegedly threatened to disrupt the event in Yavatmal.

Sehgal, 91, was one of the first writers to have returned the Sahitya Akademi award in protest against the growing intolerance in the country in 2015, soon after the Modi government came to power. Her move was criticised by right-wing groups and the ruling BJP, who called it a political move.

According to the organisers, the decision was taken to avoid any untoward incidents.

Working president of the all-India Marathi literary meet, Ramakant Kolte has expressed regret that the committee had to withdraw the invitation to Sehgal.

The letter sent to Sehgal mentions that due to some unavoidable reasons, the invitation to inaugurate the literary meet has been withdrawn.

It was said the committee withdrew the invitation due to the threat of protests by the local MNS unit which objected to inviting an English writer for a Marathi event. But apparently the opposition was later withdrawn.

The guardian minister of Yavatmal district and BJP leader Madan Yerawar is also one of the organisers of the meet, which is very prestigious among the Marathi literary circle.
