Naidu, Mamata, Kejriwal to address joint rally in Vizag

Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu along with his West Bengal counterpart and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee and Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal will address an election rally as part their campaign against Prime Minister Naendra Modi, at Indira Priyadarshini Municipal Stadium on Sunday.

At the same venue, Mr. Naidu along with Mr. Modi and film actor Pawan Kalyan had addressed a joint rally five years ago seeking mandate for TDP rule in the State and formation of BJP-led NDA Government at the Centre in the 2014 elections.

HRD Minister Ganta Srinivasa Rao told The Hindu that they would hold a massive rally in the city on Sunday evening.

Earlier, party activists from various Assembly segments sought holding roadshows instead of a public meeting to enable them to have spare time for canvassing. However, sources said on security grounds, they could not get permission for road shows as Mr. Naidu and the visiting CMs were being provided Z-category security.

Mr. Kejriwal and former Jammu Kashmir Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah had already addressed a few meetings in the State. More leaders from non-BJP parties are expected to canvass in support of TDP candidates in next few days.
