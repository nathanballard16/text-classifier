The plan was to walk from Nashik to Mumbai from February 20. However, we were detained by the police and not allowed to move further. The talks with the police failed and we were restricted. We wanted to protest on drought, tribal land title transfer and employment issues," Kishor Dhamale, the leader of the Satyashodhak Kashtakari Shetkari Sabha said. Later, the tribal were released by the police."We were assured last time by Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil and Forest Ministeron our various demands. But nothing has moved further in the last three-four months. This time, the drought intensity is very high and there are issues related to water, crop loss, water of cattle, education expenditure of farmers' children etc. Also, There is an inordinate delay in transferring the land titles to the tribal. The government has conveniently forgotten about the completeassurance made in 2017 and the tribal have not benefited from it," Dhamale said.Their other demands include, the drought-stricken families should be given an allowance of Rs 5,000 a month, the government should repeal Prevention of Cow and Cow Progeny Slaughter Act, a complete loan waiver and electricity waiver, preventing wild animal menace in the farmlands etc.
