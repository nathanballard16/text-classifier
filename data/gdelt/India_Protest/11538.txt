NEW DELHI: Despite the Supreme Court ruling, many students are left disappointed as they have not got benefit in admissions under the 10 per cent reservation quota for the economically weaker sections (EWS) in the Delhi University’s Law Faculty.

Last year, the Faculty of Law offered 2658 total seats including CLC, LC 1 and LC 2 with distribution of 50.5 per cent to general category which gives 289 seats each in all three centres. Under OBC quota, 27 per cent (208 seats) got admissions in each of the three centres and 15 per cent was given to SC category where 116 seats were allotted in CLC and 115 seats for LC 1 and LC2. Under ST quota, 7.5 per cent seats were filled, with 57 seats in CLC and 58 each in LC 1 and LC 2.

According to the recently passed constitutional amendment bill and the Supreme Court order, 10 per cent reservation was given to the EWS category and the distribution of seats will be on the basis of total number of seats which is 2541 offered this year. It comes to 231 seats under 10 per cent EWS category but the faculty has issued only five per cent of the total seats which is 39 seats in each law centre, that is 117 seats in total were given to CLC, LC 1 and LC 2 under the EWS category.

The remaining five per cent which was for EWS category was distributed among OBC, SC and ST category. OBC category got 686 seats instead of 663, SC quota got 381 seats instead of 346 and 190 seats were given to ST category instead of 173.

The students coming under EWS category along with the members of ABVP staged a protest against the DU administration as there is no specific answer from the authorities for the miscalculation.

This time the blunder happened because the DU Law authorities divided the seat sharing without considering the additional 10 per cent quto of EWS which is separate from the existing 100 per cent quota that is 50.5 per cent to general, 27 per cent to OBC, 15 per cent to SC and 7.5 per cent to ST. The seats should have been shared by taking 110 per cent in consideration instead of using 100 per cent.
