New Delhi: Prashant Kishore, the national vice president of Janata Dal (United) and once the campaign manager for Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the run-up to the 2014 general elections, has said that Modi will return as Prime Minister following Lok Sabha elections 2019. He further said that through 'Nitish Kumar is a big leader in the NDA', it is 'not fair' to view him as a claimant for the top post even in case the BJP does not get a clear mandate.

Kishore, who joined the JD(U) in September 2018, was talking to reporters in response to queries after meeting Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray. Kishore's visit fueled speculations about alliances between his party, Shiv Sena and the BJP, given that Sena has been airing voices of dissent against its coalition partner BJP.

"I met the Shiv Sena chief upon his invitation. The party is an NDA constituent and so there is nothing out of place in both of us (Thackeray and Kishor) having discussions. The speculations of my helping them with poll strategy do not have any substance. I am now a member of a party and cannot offer such professional assistance," he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

"Narendra Modi is the NDA's prime ministerial candidate and he will return as the Prime Minister again. Nitish Kumar will have a role to play, of course. Among NDA constituents, the JD(U) is the third largest after the BJP and the Shiv Sena. But nothing more should be read into this," he further said. Kishore further said that the Kumar, who has ruled Bihar 15 years, is a tall leader, but added that "it would be unfair to him if we start considering him a claimant for the prime minister's post."
