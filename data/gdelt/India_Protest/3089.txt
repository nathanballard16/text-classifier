Congress dares KCR to stage anti-Modi protest

Hyderabad: TPCC Treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy on Wednesday challenged Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao to hold a protest in Delhi or elsewhere against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the injustices meted out to Telangana State.

Questioning the silence of KCR and other TRS leaders over two major protests held in Kolkata and Delhi by Trinamool Congress and Telugu Desam Party against the BJP Government, Narayana Reddy said by abstaining from anti-Modi protests, KCR has proved his loyalty to the BJP and Modi. He said the Congress has supported both the agitations and AICC president Rahul Gandhi addressed the day-long dharna held by AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu. “When entire Opposition was raising its voice against the injustices being done by the BJP Government, the TRS wass aligning with PM Modi,” he alleged.

Gudur also ridiculed TRS party’s alliance with YSR Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh. “KCR’s Federal Front is proving to be farce with forces inclined towards BJP joining it. The next elections are between Modi-led BJP versus people of India. While Congress and other opposition parties are on people’s side, TRS is clearly on Modi’s side,” he said.
