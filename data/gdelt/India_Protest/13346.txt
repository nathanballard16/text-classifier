Phagwara, August 28

Tension prevailed in the town today due to a protest by the Dalits against the demolition of Guru Ravidas Temple in Tuglqabad, Delhi, recently.

The protesters clashed with the police when the latter stopped them from heading towards the local residence of Union Minister of State Som Parkash. Several protesters tried to jump over the barricades put up by the police near the minister’s house. A few of them sustained minor bruises. The protest got political backing when former minister and senior Congress leader Joginder Singh Maan joined them.

The police had to face a tough time to control the situation as hundreds of activists belonging to the Bahujan Front assembled at Rest House and then took out a protest march.

A heavy police force, under the supervision of SP (Investigation) Manpreet Singh Dhillon, was deployed at various places.

The Dalits demanded resignation from Som Parkash and raised slogans against the Union Government. They said either the minister declared the date for reconstruction of the temple in Delhi or resign from the post.

They condemned the police action on Dalits in Delhi on August 21. The protesters submitted a memorandum to ADC Babita Kaler before lifting the dharna. They announced to gherao the residence of Union Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal at Badal village on August 31.
