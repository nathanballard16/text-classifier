Latur lawyers to protest against transfer of Chief Justice Vijaya K Tahilramani

Mumbai: Approximately 2,000 advocates in Latur district of Maharashtra will boycott court proceedings Friday to protest against the transfer of Chief Justice Vijaya K Tahilramani from Madras High Court to Meghalaya High Court by the Supreme Court Collegium. It should be stated here that Vijaya K Tahilramani hails from Latur in Marathwada region.

“Around 1,800 lawyers from the Latur Bar Association and others from district bar associations will abstain from attending court proceedings Friday,: said advocate Balaji Panchal, former vice-president of the Latur Bar Association.

Chief Justice Vijaya K Tahilramani last week tendered her resignation to the Chief Justice of India after the Collegium refused to reconsider its decision. Her resignation is yet to be accepted or rejected.

The advocates plan to appeal to the Supreme Court Collegium to reconsider its decision along with a simultaneous request to Chief Justice Tahilramani to withdraw her resignation.

Born in Latur on October 3, 1958, Chief Justice Tahilramani obtained her law degree and enrolled herself as an advocate with the Bar Council of Maharashtra and Goa in July 1982. She was appointed assistant government pleader and additional public prosecutor in February 1990.

Chief Justice Vijaya K Tahilramani was elevated as judge of the HC, June 26, 2001 and made acting Chief Justice of Bombay High Court in 2015.

In May 2017, a division bench headed by Chief Justice Tahilramani upheld the conviction and life imprisonment of 12 people in the Bilkis Bano gangrape case, while setting aside the acquittal of seven persons, including policemen and doctors. She was transferred as Chief Justice of the Madras High Court in August 2018.
