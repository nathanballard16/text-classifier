Chandrababu Naidu Starts Dharna Politics Days After Meeting Mamata; To Fast For Special Status For Andhra

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief N Chandrababu Naidu began his day-long hunger strike in Delhi on Monday (11 February).

Ahead of the strike, Naidu and his party members along with ministerial colleagues paid floral tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at Rajghat, as reported by ANI.

The Chief Minister is observing a Dharma Porata Deeksha (a day long protest for justice) against the central government over the issue of special category status to Andhra Pradesh.

Other opposition parties will also join Naidu’s protest and will demonstrate their unity against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Earlier, less than a month ago, leaders of various political parties participated in a “United India” rally in Kolkata that was organised by the West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress Chief Mamata Banerjee. The opposition leaders in the rally had pledged to oust Modi, reports The Tribune.

“The Chief Minister has been fighting with the Centre for a special category status,” former union minister in the Modi government YS Chowdary was quoted in the report as saying.

Naidu on Tuesday (12 February) would lead a delegation to President Ram Nath Kovind over the special status issue, TDP chief’s media advisor T Srinivas was quoted in the report as saying.
