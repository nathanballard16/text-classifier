Sangrur, May 13

Within sometime of the start of the roadshow of national convener of AAP and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal from Khanauri town, locals greeted him and other leaders of his party with black flags. He also faced black flags in Sunam.

Protesters alleged that Kejriwal defamed the state by dragging its name in drugs, while others alleged that the AAP’s Punjab chief and Sangrur MP Bhagwant Mann had failed to fulfil his promises.

“We wanted to question him, but he did not stop as he has no answer. He has defamed the state by dragging the name of Punjab in drugs. If he had levelled true allegations, then why did he apologise later? Kejriwal knows the mistakes of Mann, who has spoiled the AAP in Punjab, but he does not have guts to take action against him,” said Kultar Singh, a protester.

The police were caught napping as they didn’t expect immediate protest.

Punjab Campaign Committee chief of the AAP and Sunam MLA Aman Arora and Leader of Opposition Harpal Cheema accused the Congress leaders of organising protests against their leader without any valid reason.

“These are the hired protesters of the Congress to disrupt our roadshow and everyone knows it,” said Mann.

Kejriwal attacked PM Narendra Modi and CM Capt Amarinder Singh saying that both had not fulfilled even a single poll promise made to people.

“The Congress and SAD will face defeat in the coming General Election,” said Kejriwal.
