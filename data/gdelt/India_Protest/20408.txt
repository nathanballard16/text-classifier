Citizenship Bill: Police Fire Tear Gas At Jamia Milia Islamia Students As Protests Turn Violent

New Delhi:

Police and students clashed at Jamia Milia Islamia in Delhi during protests against Citizenship Amendment Act on Friday. The protests turned violent after police blocked the protest route by putting heavy barricades outside the campus, fearing violence, and detained those who tried to jump the barricades. According to reports, some of the students resorted to stone-pelting at the police.

Police resorted to lathicharge and use of tear gas shells to disperse protesters. More than 30 tear gas shells were fired. Several students were injured in the clashes. Two mediapersons also suffered injuries. Some policemen were also reported to be injured.

Students had earlier announced a march to Parliament to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill. However, they were stopped near the university where they clashed with the police.

Videos circulated by students on social media showed police caning the protestors.

The police had cordoned off the road and protestors were seen climbing onto the barricades. The University's gate was later closed.

As a precautionary measure, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) closed the entry and exit points at Patel Chowk and Janpath metro stations briefly following Delhi police's advisory. "As advised by Delhi Police, entry & exit at Patel Chowk and Janpath have been closed. Trains will not be halting at these stations," DMRC said on twitter. The services resumed after a short while.
