2 dead in India protest over citizenship law

GUWAHATI: Internet access has been cut in India’s northeastern city of Guwahati after violent protests over a new citizenship law saw two demonstrators shot dead by police, authorities said Friday.

The protests follow the approval of legislation that many in the far-flung northeast believe will give citizenship to large numbers of immigrants from neighboring Bangladesh.

On Thursday, police fired live and blank rounds as thousands of demonstrators in Guwahati and elsewhere took to the streets, some vandalising property and torching vehicles.

On Friday morning the streets of Guwahati, the main city in Assam state, were quiet but authorities were bracing for possible new protests later in the day.

A local government official said internet access in the city had been cut and an Agence France-Presse reporter confirmed that connections appeared to have been suspended.

The two demonstrators killed were among around 20 people being treated in hospital, “a few” of whom had gunshot wounds, said Ramen Talukdar, a doctor at a Guwahati hospital.

Several thousand troops have been drafted in to help police, who fired tear gas and charged demonstrators with batons as mobile internet access was cut and curfews declared.
