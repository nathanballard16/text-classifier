Amit Shah dares Mamata Banerjee to arrest him for chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’

BJP national president Amit Shah on Monday dared West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee to arrest him for chanting “Jai Shri Ram”.

Shah said “TMC supremo can stop me from attending rallies in Bengal but won’t be able to stop BJP’s victory march in the state.”

Earlier in the day, Amit Shah was allegedly denied permission to land his chopper for one of his three rallies in West Bengal.

“Since Mamata Banerjee Govt did not give permission for the 2nd rally which was to be held in Jadavpur, Kolkata, Shri @AmitShah is compelled to hold only 2 rallies. People of Bengal will give a befitting reply to this anarchy of Mamata Didi on 23rd May,” BJP Party said in a tweet.

Amit Shah addressing the remaining rallies launched a stinging offensive at Mamata Banerjee.

Addressing a rally at Canning, which comes under Joynagar Lok Sabha constituency, Shah said, “Mamata didi, I am chanting Jai Shri Ram here and will leave for Kolkata, arrest me if you have guts.”

Shah’s scheduled rally in Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat was cancelled today after the state government denied him permission to land his chopper.
