Student outfit protests against lack of books at MSU’s faculty of science

Students demanded that there should be enough books at Hansa Mehta Library

Vadodara: A student outfit on Friday staged a protest at M S University’s faculty of science demanding adequate books at two major libraries on the campus.

Members of Royal Club of Science raised slogans and later submitted a memorandum to the dean of faculty of science demanding that the faculty should ensure that there are enough books for students at Hansa Mehta Library.

“There are several books which are simply not available in the university library. Those books, which are available, are not enough in numbers considering the number of students who are enrolled in first, second and third year of bachelor’s of science programme,” said Yogesh Agrawal, faculty general secretary of faculty of science.

The group submitted a list of books which students have to rely on to pursue their studies but are not available in the university library.

“There are 120 students in each class. This makes things difficult for students, especially during the examination season, where the number of students is more and books miserably less,” he said.

Faculty dean professor Hari Kataria assured the students that their demand will be addressed at the earliest and the faculty will ensure that there are enough books in the library.
