Protesters in UP used guerrilla tactics, say cops

LUCKNOW: Small groups hiding in alleys mounting a sudden attack , illiterate children holding placards written in English, maximum mob mobilisation in areas with minimum police deployment — this seems to be the strategic blueprint of those protesting against the new citizenship law, say Uttar Pradesh police officers.Cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Meerut, Bahraich, Agra , Firozabad and Gorakhpur were all witness to planned violence, which has led to 18 deaths since Thursday.Inspector general of police (law and order) Praveen Kumar told TOI that based on reports sent by district police chiefs, the pattern of protests in the state resembled guerrilla tactics and the agitations were conducted with clinical precision.“We observed brick-batting was done during specific time periods, only in areas where deployment of forces was low,” Kumar said, adding that in many districts, police overheard protesters talking in Bengali and hurling stones at cops and media persons without provocation.Varanasi SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary told TOI that in Bhelupur, eight-year-olds were handed placards and made to protest on roads. “The children and their parents are mostly illiterate, how can they prepare placards in English,” he asked. The SSP said in Bajardiha area, some pamphlets were distributed two days ago with slogans against the Indian state, for which 70 persons have been arrested.He said in Madanpura, as many as 10,000 people assembled on Friday. “While children and teenagers were spotted, no elder person could be seen,” the SSP said, adding that a similar pattern was witnessed in Mau, Azamgarh , Jaunpur and Bhadohi when people returned from mosques after offering ‘namaz’. “Teenagers and boys remained at the forefront and indulged in brick-batting while the elderly stood several ranks behind,” said Braj Bhushan, additional director general of police, Varanasi.In Lucknow, additional SP (West) Vikas Tripathi said, “Those pelting stones and bricks were outsiders.” He said he had never seen such a form of protest where even after being pushed back, protesters kept hurling stones and torching police outposts and vehicles. Likewise, there was a method in the madness during protests in western UP too.Inspector general of police (Agra range) A Satish Ganesh told TOI, “We scanned footage in which some elders are seen talking to policemen and then suddenly moving to the crowd, giving some signal to young people before disappearing. Later, the younger lot takes policemen head on.”The officer further said that the attacks were organised by smaller groups. “They were hidden in alleys and lanes,” he said.
