Modi on Balakot strike: ‘By demanding proof they are demoralizing forces’

Prime Minister Narendra Modi lashing out Congress and its allies said that by demanding the proof of ‘air strike’, they are demoralizing the forces. He also claimed that such statements benefit “our enemies.”

Addressing a political rally in Patna, “Now they have even started asking for proof of the air strike. Why are Congress and its allies demoralizing our forces? Why are they giving statements which are benefiting our enemies?”

This is the first time when Chief Minister of Bihar, Nitish Kumar is sharing the stage with Mr. Modi since May 2009, and the first joint rally by the NDA in Bihar since November 2005.

In the initial reactions to Mr. Modi’s statement, former CM of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti tweeted, “As citizens of this country, we have every right to question the credibility of the Balakot operation. Esp due to GoIs ambiguity about the details. How does it help the enemies? Only puts GoI in a tight spot since they want to exploit this to reap electoral benefits.”
