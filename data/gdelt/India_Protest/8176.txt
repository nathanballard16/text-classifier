HDK will step down by Friday morning: Union minister

BENGALURU: Union minister D V Sadananda Gowda on Wednesday predicted that chief minister H D Kumaraswamy will step down by Thursday night or latest by Friday morning after the Lok Sabha results are announced.Former Karnataka CM D V Sadananda Gowda, who is also the Union minister for planning and statstics is seeking re-elections from Bengaluru north constituency,.Speaking to the media, Gowda expressed his confidence of retaining his seat and becoming a minister once again in a possible second term of Prime Minister Narendra Modi When questioned over the purposeful visits of Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu in bringing together the opposition parties, Gowda said the TDP chief was staring at defeat in his home state and does not have any other work but to tour the nation in his last days as the CM.Whether the same fate is likely to be that of Karnataka CM, Gowda in his usual sarcastic tone said: “Like minded people flock together. As is the case of Chandrababu Naidu, so is the case of H D Kumaraswamy. He also knows that by Thursday night he will have to vacate the chief minister post, if not then latest by Friday morning, considering he has to struggle the entire night to come to terms with the results.”Gowda attributed his forecast to the absence of JD(S) national president H D Deve Gowda and that of Kumaraswamy at the opposition leaders dinner meet held on March 21 in Delhi.“Both Deve Gowda and Kumaraswamy skipped the opposition parties meet in Delhi and stayed put in Karnataka. This shows that he will be the CM only till Thursday night,” he said.
