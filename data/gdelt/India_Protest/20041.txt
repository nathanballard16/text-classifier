The Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay students gathered at its campus on Wednesday in solidarity with the ongoing nation-wide protest against the controversial(CAB) 2019 after it was passed in the lower house last week.The students allege that the CAB outrightly promotes religion-based citizenship in India and violates Article 14 and Article 15 of the Indian Constitution which guarantees equal status and protection by law irrespective of any religion.The students held a rally inside the campus and gathered outside hostel number 10 and tore a copy of the Citizenship Amendment Bill as a sign of protest. A joint statement by various student’s body from IIT-B was also released demanding immediate withdrawal of the ‘anti-secular’ bill and renounce all plans to conduct citizenship registries across India.“We condemn BJP’s hate and partisan politics that threatens to push the nation to the polarised abyss and murder our democratic spirit to co-exist equally with all communities, irrespective of any categories. We stand in solidarity with all the peaceful democratic struggles of the people in North-East and other places of India in resisting the communal CAB and urge them to refrain from violence,” the statement read.“The NRC in the state ofhas cost Rs1200 crore and involvement of over 50,000 government employees. The cost born by the citizens to obtain documents and travel in short durations, and loss of man-hour have been humongous. The nation-wide NRC would be a disaster for an already troubled, in fact failing, Indian economy,” said, a PhD research scholar from IIT’s Centre for Policy Studies.Meanwhile, another student, on the condition of anonymity, said, “CAB will rip apart the foundational secular ethos of our nation. How can a nation that proclaims itself as a secular republic treat people from different religions differently? CAB will be the last nail in fulfilment of the ideological project of Hindu Rashtra in India.”
