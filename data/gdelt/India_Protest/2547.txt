Congress cracks whip: CLP meet today last chance for rebels

BJP protest black mark in legislature’s history: HDK

BENGALURU: Amid political uncertainty and continued efforts of the opposition BJP to topple the nine-month-old coalition government, chief minister HD Kumaraswamy will present the state budget for 2019-20 in the assembly on Friday at 12.30pm.Expectations on what the budget will offer have become secondary as all eyes are on the seven rebel Congress MLAs . Whether they will again defy a whip and abstain from the Congress legislature party meeting scheduled for 9am on Friday remained the talking point. Should they stay away, the Congress is expected to crack down by petitioning speaker KR Ramesh to disqualify them.With the exception of one Congress MLA — JN Ganesh, who is on the run after assaulting colleague Anand Singh at a resort on January 20 — Ramesh Jarakiholi, Mahesh Kumattalli, Umesh Jadhav, B Nagendra, BC Patil and D Sudhakar are upset over not having secured a cabinet berth.BJP, as one Congress minister put it, reacted to the situation and is trying to use it to its advantage to topple the government.Sources say core rebels Jarkiholi, Kumattalli, Jadhav and Nagendra, allegedly holed up in Mumbai, will reach Bengaluru on Friday. But there is no saying whether they will attend the CLP meet and the assembly.Concern in the Congress camp was palpable as chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, former CM Siddaramaiah, DyCM G Parameshwara, ministers DK Shivakumar and Krishna Byregowda went into a huddle inside the House for 40 minutes after it was adjourned.It’s learnt that opposition leader BS Yeddyurappa has been told that if his party continues with its din in the House, the government may move a motion requesting the speaker to suspend some of his party MLAs. This would bring down the number of BJP’s members in the House, since they cannot attend proceedings for the remainder of the session. sThe JD(S), which was confident that none of its MLAs will switch sides, has also been forced to issue a whip to its MLAs on Thursday, following the sudden disappearance of its KR Pet MLA, Narayana Gowda.“I don’t understand why the BJP is protesting. If they think I have lost majority in the House nothing prevents them from moving a no-trust motion. The BJP’s protest during governor Vajubhai R Vala’s address to the joint session is a black mark in the history of Karnataka legislature. Though there have been occasion in the past when members shouted slogans, they had a reason to do so,”said HD Kumaraswamy, chief minister.
