Farmers of 22 villages protest reinclusion in Suda

Surat: The re-inclusion of 22 villages in the preliminary approved development plan of Surat Urban Development Authority (Suda) has sparked anger among their residents who claim they would have to give up vast swathes of their fertile land.

The re-inclusion of 10 villages each of Olapad and Kamrej talukas and two of Palsana taluka was mandated for the proposed 120 metre Ring Road project proposed by the central government. Earlier in 2010, their inclusion within Suda limits had also caused resentment and subsequent agitation, which led to 56 villages being removed from the DP draft in 2016.

On Wednesday , nearly 150 farmers from 10 affected villages of Olpad and Kamrej talukas gathered in Sandhiyer village to voice their protest.

Darshan Nayak, a farmer in Sandhiyer and Surat district panchayat member said, “There is a lot of difference in what government declared in 2010, 2016 and 2019 notifications. First, they included 56 villages, then removed 22 and then re-included these 22 without any consultation with local farmers.”

“Government also formed a local level planning committee consisting of elected members but not a single meeting has been called in three years. This is a very fertile stretch of land and farmers can’t afford to lose it,” Nayak said.

Farmers said that a case regarding this issue is pending in Gujarat High court and unless the court gives any judgement, government can’t implement this DP of 2035.
