Checking unaccounted cash in polls

Checking unaccounted cash in polls

Dear Editor,

It refers to media-reports wherein it is analysed that maximum poll-expenditure in cash is done on holding rallies and road-shows. Otherwise ruling parties are always blamed for large-scale misuse of public-resources in holding rallies and road-shows for their candidates. There is otherwise huge loss of man-hours and unnecessary disruption in public-life at places and surrounding areas where these political rallies and road-shows are held.

Election Commission of India ECI should impose a total ban on holding political rallies and road-shows. Instead ECI can co-ordinate with Press Information Bureau PIB to conduct live TV debates between spokespersons and key-leaders of rival political parties. ECI and PIB can also co-ordinate live press-conferences of top political leaders.

Such proper utilisation of electronic media for poll-purposes is quite common in advanced countries which needs to be followed by India to effectively check poll-related evils including misuse of unaccounted cash. It may be recalled that similar ban on unproductive campaign-items like posters and banners has already been successful in India.
