Twitterati Furious Over Students Celebrating Resignation of Muslim Teacher in India’s Top University

Netizens, including celebrities, took to Twitter to express disappointment over students of India’s leading university celebrating the resignation of a Muslim Assistant Professor from the Faculty of Sanskrit on Tuesday.

Appointed as an assistant professor in the Literature Department of the Sanskrit Vidya Dharma Vijnan (SVDV) of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU), Assistant Professor Feroze Khan resigned after a month-long protest against his selection, an official said on Tuesday.

The students in a video can be seen sharing sweets and dancing over the exit of the teacher whom they termed as ineligible to teach the subject because he was a Muslim.
