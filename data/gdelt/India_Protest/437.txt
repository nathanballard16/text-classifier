Banking services are likely to be hit on January 8-9 (Tuesday and Wednesday) as a large section of PSU bank employees are expected to go on a two-day strike to back a nationwide protest called by 10 central trade unions.

The strike has been called to protest against the government’s alleged anti-worker policy. Many public sector banks including IDBI Bank announced in their stock exchange filing that operations are likely to be disrupted in case employees join the strike.

The All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees Federation of India have already informed the Indian Banks'’Association (IBA) of the nationwide strike on January 8-9, 2019.

Allahabad Bank also said that the issues and demands are of industry level, implying that banks services will be affected if employees take part in the strike.

"Therefore, if the strike takes place, the functioning of branches of the bank may be affected. The bank is taking all the necessary steps in terms of the existing guidelines for smooth functioning of bank's branches/offices on the day of strike(s), in the event the strike materialises," it said.

A number of central trade unions INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, AICCTU, UTUC, TUCC, LPF and SEWA had earlier termed many policies of the government as anti-people and there are high chances that public bank services will be hit tomorrow.

Bank of Baroda, which is another public sector bank, said, In the event of AlBEA and BEFI proceeding on strike on January 8-9, 2019, the functioning of bank's branches/offices in some of the zones may be affected.

In fact, some private sector banks also fear that their employees will take part in the strike tomorrow to support the demands and normal working at such banks could also be affected.

Banking services were earlier affected twice in December 2018 when a similar strike was called. At least 10 lakh bank employees took part in the nationwide strikes on December 26.
