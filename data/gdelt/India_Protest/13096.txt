Organisers cancel Brickfields rally after Anwar's phone call

PETALING JAYA: Organisers have called off a rally in Brickfields on Saturday (Aug 24) to protest against the introduction of khat lessons in Tamil schools, reported Malaysiakini.

Its organiser Shankar Ganesh said the planned rally, which was dubbed "Voice for the Voiceless" was cancelled due to two main reasons.
