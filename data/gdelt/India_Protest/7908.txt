The local people are struggling to get basic civic facilities, including drinking water." She further said poverty and unemployment are major problems of the locality.Karat added, "The result of Rajmahal seat would be a surprise as the contest has now become triangular with CPI(M) candidate Gopin Soren also emerging as a strong contender."Prakash Viplav, the party's election in-charge, said that so far Karat has addressed election rallies at Lalmatia, Borio, Barhet, Sundarpahari and Maheshpur. "She is reaching out to the people of the tribal community in remote forest areas and seeking their support," he added.Viplav said his party is also gearing up to ensure that supporters exercise their franchise in the elections scheduled on May 19.
