As Bambhania is a history-sheeter, having been booked in several loot cases earlier, police traced his cellphone location which was traced to the crime spot. Then the cops nabbed him. During his interrogation Bambhania confessed to the crime.“Bambhania said he knew that Sarvaiya used to carry hefty cash with him, and hence he decided to rob him. His three co-accused, who were not involved in the actual loot, had done a recce of Sarvaiya, keenly monitoring his daily schedule. Then he executed the loot,” added the official.Bambhania said his gang members had also made a plan to loot another milk agency owner in Jesar of Bhavnagar district, of whom they had done a recce.
