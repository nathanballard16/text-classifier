Article content The recent articles in the Edmonton Journal regarding conversion/reparative therapy for homosexuals (transgenders) and the fact the current government does not support making this illegal in Alberta greatly concerns me. A historical review of this subject will illustrate why.

Article content Conversion therapy is an older term referring to any attempt to change a person’s sexual orientation. Reparative therapy refers to the approach that was started in the mid-1980s. Both terms have become synonymous. We apologize, but this video has failed to load.

There have even been reports of therapists having sex with their patients as “treatment.” Many notable psychiatrists in the late 19 th and early 20th centuries such as Magnus Hirschfeld, Havelock Ellis, Karl Ulrich and Sigmund Freud all stated very clearly that homosexuality was an expression of normal human sexuality and not an illness.

Article content The American Psychiatric Association formed a nine-member scientific advisory committee chaired by Evelyn Hooker that provided a report to the Association in 1967 that stated that homosexuality was not an illness. This resulted in homosexuality being delisted from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual in 1973. In response to this, psychologist/psychoanalyst Joseph Nicolosi started an organization called the National Association for the Research and Treatment of Homosexuality (NARTH) in 1983 and developed what he called reparative therapy for homosexuality. This was based on his view that “psychological trauma” due to an absent or hostile father or an over-nurturing mother caused homosexuality and that there was a need to re-masculinize the gay male and re-feminize the gay female. Reparative therapy became widely accepted by various religious organizations and spread worldwide.

Article content The biggest organization was Exodus International, that had over 250 ministries in the U.S. and Canada and 150 worldwide. It disbanded in 2013 following some internal scandals. There were many other organizations promoting reparative therapy as well. Reparative-therapy techniques basically involved brainwashing. Individuals are harassed in the form of humiliation, degradation, and invoking guilt about being a sinner. This can include physical abuse. There is no evidence that this treatment was effective in changing an individual’s sexual orientation. Individuals who went through reparative therapy have eight times the national rate for suicide and suicide attempts, six times the rate for depression, three times the rate for drug abuse, plus have many other difficulties.

Article content It has been estimated that about 700,000 individuals in the U.S. and Canada have been subjected to reparative therapy, half this number being 18 or younger. The negative impact this has had on young lives is a major tragedy. As far back as 1993, reparative therapy was considered unethical by the American Pediatric Association Committee on Adolescence, followed by other professional associations. In spite of professional organizations declaring it to be unethical, reparative therapy continued under the banner of various religious organizations. It was then declared illegal, initially in California, then in several other states. At the moment 15 states have declared reparative therapy to be illegal with legislation being proposed in 20 others. This movement continues. Reparative therapy has been declared illegal in Britain, Germany, India and there are protests against it in China.

Article content In Canada, reparative therapy was declared illegal in Manitoba in 2015 followed by Ontario and Nova Scotia. The City of Vancouver has also declared it to be illegal. The previous government drafted legislation to declare it illegal in Alberta but the current government has disbanded the working committee and has suggested that this proposed legislation will be stopped. The fact that the UCP government has taken this stance reflects that homophobic and transgenderphobic attitudes still exist within this party. If the current government agrees that reparative therapy is wrong, then making it illegal would only guarantee greater protection for young gay, lesbian and transgender individuals in our province.

Article content Reparative therapy continues to be available by various religious organizations, utilizing the approach that they are treating a “sin” rather than an illness. The current government has also reversed legislation that protects transgender students in schools, and alters how gay-straight alliances can be formed and conducted. It is disheartening to see progress made in the area of human rights with respect to sexual orientation and gender identity and then have it reversed.
