Sheila Dikshit Leads Congress Workers To Protest Power And Water Cuts In Delhi; AAP Hits Back On Her Own Track Record

Led by president of the Delhi unit of the Indian National Congress (INC), Shiela Dikshit, the party on Tuesday (18 June) staged protests in all the 70 assembly seats of the national capital against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government of NCT of Delhi, reports The Hindu.

The protests were held to highlight the water and electricity scarcity in the city, with Dikshit calling it a matter of life and death. Senior Congress party leader and former chief minister of Delhi also targeted the AAP government over its inability to come up with a contingency plan.

Dikshit claimed that the residents had been reeling under “frequent power cuts and water shortage during peak summers.” She also stressed that the water shortage has affected the women, the elderly and the poor the most.

The working president of the INC in Delhi, Haroon Yusuf claimed that the drinking water supplied in many of the areas was unfit for consumption, even though senior AAP leader Gopal Rai riposted to the attacks saying, "I would like Sheila ji to compare what she did to deal with the water crisis in her 15-year-rule with what the AAP has done in just four and a half years."
