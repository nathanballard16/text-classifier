Narendra Modi rally in New Delhi: Live Updates

Modi makes a plea to New Delhi to go out and vote for him and his party at the polling booths on Sunday.

"You have to blossom the lotus on every polling booth," he said. "All your votes will come to Modi’s account."

The lotus is the symbol of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party and, on polling day, voters press the button next to the symbol of their preferred party.

"I ask you, you go to each and every house, meet the voters, you’ll spread my vote to them and you’ll take them out to vote and inspire them to press the button."

"Bothers and sisters, keep you blessings on us and I ask that everyone say with me 'Bharat Mata Ki Jai' (hail Mother India.)"
