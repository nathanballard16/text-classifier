Two reportedly killed in citizenship bill protests in NE India

At least two civilians were shot dead in an alleged police shooting in northeastern India on Thursday during massive protests against the controversial citizenship bill, local media reported.

“At least two persons died due to bullet injuries on Thursday after police opened fire on protesters in Assam's Guwahati,” the news agency Press Trust of India (PTI) reported, citing officials.

Police told PTI that they had to open fire in Lalung Gaon area in Guwahati after protestors pelted stones.

However, the local broadcaster NDTV reported: “At least three protesters were killed and many others injured in police firing in Assam's Guwahati amid a raging agitation against the Citizenship [Amendment] Bill on Thursday evening.”

Indian parliament on Wednesday passed a new bill which will grant citizenship to six minorities from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh -- all Muslim-majority nations in South Asia.

The new bill triggered massive condemnation and protests in many parts of India, especially in its northeastern provinces.

The people defied curfew in Assam state on Thursday morning to stage protests as the situation remained tense with the army conducting flag march in Guwahati.

Guwahati, the epicentre of protests, was placed under indefinite curfew on Wednesday night while the army was called in at four places and paramilitary personnel were deployed in Tripura on Wednesday as the two northeastern states plunged into chaos.

Train services to Assam and Tripura provinces have been halted while many air flights have been cancelled.

Neighboring Meghalaya also withdrew the mobile internet and messaging services across the province for the next 48 hours due to the deteriorating law and order situation triggered by protests over the controversial bill.
