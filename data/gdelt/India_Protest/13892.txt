These IAS officers’ function directly come under the Central government. That’s the reason that he (Senthil) has resigned,” Kharge claimed while talking reporters.He also alleged that institutions like the Income Tax, Central Bureau of Investigation, Central Vigilance Commission and the judiciary were losing their “independence” due to the “interference” of the Central government.BJP leader and rural development and panchayat raj minister KS Eshwarappa sought “clarity” from Senthil on his resignation.“I want to ask (from the officer) in clear terms, make your intentions clear. Please don’t give confusing statements,” Eshwarappa told reporters when his reaction was sought.
