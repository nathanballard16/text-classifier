Qureshi criticises opposition’s march

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s Azadi march has diverted people’s attention from the issue of Kashmir.“We have taken a principled stand on Kashmir issue. India thought that Pakistan is busy in internal conflicts so India planned and executed its plot in Kashmir.”Qureshi made these remarks while speaking to media after meeting Punjab Governor Chaudhry Sarwar at the Governor House on Thursday.Both leaders discussed matters of mutual interest and the Kashmir issue. They strongly condemned Indian oppression in Kashmir and demanded of the Indian government to immediately lift curfew in the occupied valley. They also offered prayers and condolences for victims of the Liaqatpur Train accident.Responding to a question about opposition parties ‘Azadi march’, Qureshi said there was ambiguity in Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) demands. No hurdle was created for Maulana’s march.“We hope the way we allowed the opposition to hold a long march, now opposition must act reciprocally. We are democratic in nature and tolerance is part of democracy.”While responding to a question, Qureshi said some people used to say that the sit-in would derail democracy and we used to say that we don’t want to derail democracy. “Provisions are there in the Constitution to form and dissolve a government.”Published in The Express Tribune, November 1, 2019.
