"We hope you understand that you were manipulated into warmongering. Let better sense prevail; isolate the people who are desperate to win an election. War is in no nation's interest and its soldiers and civilians who are the collateral damage. Don't let one man use it for political mileage", PTI tweeted on 28 February.

In a follow-up tweet, PTI went further in its straight-up attacks against Modi again. Their tweet read "… a desperate bid to win an election by one man is gripping an entire nation in war hysteria". Naming Modi again, it added that "war is no one's interest except Narendra Modi; whose escalating ego is reminiscent of dictators who started world wars". The tweet was also tagged with the #SayNoToWars hashtag.

Indian Prime Minister Modi and his party leaders have been talking about air strikes conducted on 26 February in Balakot inside Pakistan at every election rally and have launched sharp attacks on opposition parties for demanding evidence on the said strikes.

"At a time when our army is engaged in crushing terrorism, inside the country and outside, there are some people within the country who are trying to break their morale, which is cheering our enemy," Modi said at an election rally on Monday. "I want to know from (the opposition) Congress and its partners why they are making statements that are benefiting the enemies", added Modi.
