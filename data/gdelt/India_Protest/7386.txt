No grounds to deny admit cards to us, say students of DU

The students, led by the university students’ union and members of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, also submitted a memorandum with the vice-chancellor, dean of students and dean of colleges, requesting relaxation in attendance.

Students at Delhi University (DU) Sunday complained about several colleges not issuing admit cards to students and "detaining" them on grounds of "short attendance" ahead of the semester exams starting May 8.

The students, led by the university students' union and members of the Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad, also submitted a memorandum with the vice-chancellor, dean of students and dean of colleges, requesting relaxation in attendance.

Some students at a south campus college held a strike on Saturday, demanding the admit cards be issued. "Around 100 students in our college are denied admit cards citing the fact that we have not fulfilled 75% mandatory attendance criteria as per the University Grants Commission (UGC) 2003 regulations," a student, requesting anonymity, said.

The UGC 2003 regulation mandates that the number of teaching days should not be less than 180 per year. In the memorandum, students said, "Due to strikes by teachers' organisations, the number of minimum classes have not been conducted and hence the imposition of minimum attendance criteria for students is unfair. The university has seen several days of suspended classes."

Rajiv Ray, president of the Delhi University Teachers' Association, denied the allegations and said, "Despite strikes, teachers did take regular remedial classes for students to cover up their attendance. Those who are being detained must be irregular from the beginning."

Dean of students Rajeev Gupta said that he has received the memorandum. "The university administration will look into the matter," he said.
