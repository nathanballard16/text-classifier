Weather, protestors trying to rain on Modi-Trump parade

WASHINGTON: Massive flooding that has put parts of Houston underwater is expected to recede by Sunday morning in time for the “HowdyModi” rally, although predictions for “scattered thunderstorms” over the weekend is far from comforting for organisers more worried about the weather than protestors.Houston is reeling from its third “historic” flooding in three years, this time from torrential rains of anywhere from 10 inches to 40 inches in the region falling from Hurricane Imelda. The flooding is not only a grim precursor to the climate change meeting that is on top of Prime Minister Modi’s program at the United Nations next week but also a stark reminder of similar apocalyptic flooding in India cities in recent years.The fact that Modi’s partner in time at the Houston rally – US President Donald Trump -- is a climate change denialist adds another dimension to a complex US-India dynamic that contains many broad agreements and narrow differences. Trump has signaled there will be some major announcements, but Indian officials, far more circumspect, are tightlipped about what it could be, the caution understandable given the U.S President’s penchant for hyperbole.Even if the rain holds off and weather improves, protestors backed by Pakistan, whose outreach now extends to all disaffected Indians such as separatist “Khalistanis,” are itching to rain the Modi-Trump parade.On Friday, Modi critics exulted over a purported $100m lawsuit filed by a US relative of victims of India’s Kashmir policy, claiming that "a Houston Court Summons PM Modi In 100 Million Dollar Lawsuit Over Torture in Kashmir."The purported lawsuit, initiated by an organization claiming to be “human rights NGO Kashmir Khalistan Referendum Front (KKRF) which is aiming to hold unofficial referendum in the Indian held regions of Kashmir and Punjab,” is similar to similar efforts by a separatist activist named Gurpatwant Pannun aimed mainly at embarrassing visiting India ministers and officials regardless of party affiliation.Pannun’s past efforts include initiating legal challenges against Sonia Gandhi and Kamal Nath in US courts, and his moves are generally regarded as frivolous by Indian officials, and which don’t go anywhere except forcing the Indian side to incur legal fees.The bigger challenge for the Indian side is to counter the propaganda blizzard by Pakistani partisans and a few Americans borrowing from Imran Khan ’s playbook of comparing Modi to Hitler and BJP/RSS to Nazis, a description that some Indian liberals also embrace.Fortunately for India, Pakistan’s own dismal record of military rule and its long association with terrorists and terror attacks, including attacks in United States by its nationals, makes New Delhi’s task so much easier.Besides the infamous 9/11 strikes masterminded by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and conducted by terrorists such as Mohammed Atta who routinely traveled in and out of Pakistan, Pakistani-Americans (Syed Rizwan Farooq, Tashfeen Malik, and Faisal Shahzad ) also struck in San Bernardino and New York City, the latter case involving the son of a Pakistani Air Vice Marshal.Despite the stigma – and after lying low for many years after 9/11 – many Pakistani-Americans are coming out to demonstrate against India’s alleged excesses in Jammu and Kashmir, inviting taunts from Indians.“While the "rich" Indian diaspora have lavishly spent 2 organize the Howdy Modi event, the "4th class labors" frm Pakistan r finding it hard 2 even arrange the fare for the buses that will ferry them 2 the venue for the protest,” sneered one partisan.
