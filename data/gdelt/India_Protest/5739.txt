Karnataka coalition model will be replicated in Delhi: Rahul

The Congress will demonstrate the functioning of a smooth coalition government in New Delhi while forming the government at the Centre, party President Rahul Gandhi has said.

Addressing a Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) [JD(S)] rally on the outskirts of Bengaluru, Rahul said: “ Our formation of a coalition government in Karnataka, and its smooth functioning is an example which we will demonstrate again in Delhi.”

Appealing to both, the Congress and the JD(S) workers, Rahul said: “I appeal to both parties’ workers to work harmoniously. Our goal is to defeat the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.”

Talking about farm-loan waivers, Rahul said: “When farmers across the country approached the Central government, Modi and Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said it cannot be done. We have no money.”

“Karnataka showed the country how it can be done with ease. It generated its own resources. When the Central government failed, it was the State which demonstrated its will. Similarly, governments of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chattisgarh are working towards it,” he said.

Relief for start-ups

Bengaluru is called “start-up capital”. Keeping with the spirit of this sector, the Congress President said the party is working out a plan to allow new businesses three years to get permissions and licences. “This is being done to encourage entrepreneurs to create jobs.”

Rahul explained that this is being done to remove the draconian and ill-conceived Angel Tax.

Earlier, at the rally, JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda said: “Since May 23, 2018, we have been workings towards formation of the Mahagathbandhan (Grand Alliance). The BJP has been taunting us that it is not the Mahagathbandhan but maha milawat (adulterated alliance).”

“Post-elections, we shall show them the strength of Mahagathbandhan and prove them wrong,” he added.
