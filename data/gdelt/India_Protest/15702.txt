India - Situation in Indian controlled Kashmir (ECHO Daily Flash of 07 October 2019) - India

Two months of lock down, security restrictions and communications blackouts have resulted in medicine shortages and patients going without urgent operations and treatment in Indian controlled Kashmir. Media report more than 4,000 arrests since 5 August, including 144 minors. Around 1,000 of them are still in custody.

The situation in Indian-controlled Kashmir continues to be tense, with frequent protests, particularly after Friday prayers, despite curfews and bans on public gatherings. On 5 October, 10 civilians were reportedly injured by a grenade attack in the city of Anantnag, the Jammu and Kashmir. According the authorities, the blast took place near a government office.
