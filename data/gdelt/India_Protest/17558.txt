Sony TV apologises over Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj remark on KBC

Sony TV has apologised after making an 'inaccurate reference' to Chhatrapati Shivaji during an episode earlier this week. This came after the channel used the term 'Shivaji' to address Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj during an episode of Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC).

The channel ran a scroll during the show on 7 November and also took to social media to apologise.

The channel stated, "There was an inaccurate reference to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj during Wednesday’s KBC episode, due to inadvertence. We deeply regret the same and being mindful of the sentiments of our viewers have carried a scroll expressing regret during our episode yesterday."

Despite that, protests continued on 8 November (today). NCP workers took to the streets to protest outside Sony's offices in Mumbai.
