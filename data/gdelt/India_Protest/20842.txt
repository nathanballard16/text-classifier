Protest outside Delhi Police HQ

Scores of people gathered outside the old Delhi Police Headquarters to protest the force's handling of the situation after an agitation against the new citizenship law near Jamia university on Sunday turned violent.

The protesters raised anti-police slogans outside the headquarters in ITO area, after a call for it was given by the Jawaharlal Nehru University Students Union. Other students' bodies endorsed the protest call.

Earlier Sunday, protestors torched several vehicles near Jamia university and clashed with police. Later, police entered Jamia Millia Islamia to control the situation and said they detained some of the people who allegedly indulged in violence.

But Jamia university administration said students did not participate in the violence.
