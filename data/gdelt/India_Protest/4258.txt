Bharat bandh 5 march 2019: Despite SC stay, tribal outfits stick to bandh call

NEW DELHI: Tribals groups have decided to go ahead with their ‘ Bharat Bandh ’ on March 5 to protest against a recent Supreme Court order on eviction of tribals and traditional forest dwellers from their habitat.Though the SC stayed its order following the Centre’s plea, Adivasis see it as a temporary reprieve and are wary that the order may be overturned in the absence of a proper law to protect them in keeping with the Forest Rights Act. Tribal groups are demanding that the Centre bring an ordinance to ensure that their rights are protected.While the strike is planned across states, Adivasi and Dalit groups have called upon political and civil society activists to join them for a march from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar in Delhi on Tuesday to highlight the issue of restoring the Forest Rights Act, along with Dalits’ demand to nullify the 13-point roster system in appointments in colleges, universities and other government organisations as it was constricting entry of SCs, STs and OBCs in these institutions.Adivasi Adhikar Andolan, All India Ambedkar Mahasabha and Samvidhan Bachao Sangharsh Samiti are among the groups which have called the march on Tuesday.Congress, RJD, SP, AAP and Sharad Yadav ’s party supported the movement.
