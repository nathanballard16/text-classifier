'India Has Stopped Working In A Routine, Bureaucratic Manner,' Modi Invites Thai Entrepreneurs For Investment

"You would be shocked to know that for years, money was spent on the poor but did not really reach the poor. Our government ended this culture thanks to DBT. DBT stands for direct benefit transfer. DBT has ended the culture of middlemen and inefficiency," he added.

Asserting that India had stopped working in a routine, bureaucratic manner, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday invited Thai entrepreneurs to invest in the country for easy business. Addressing a programme to mark 50 years of the global presence of the Aditya Birla Group, Modi said India is proud of all the enterprises that have ventured out and distinguished themselves globally and added that he was eager to give a picture of some positive changes happening in India. "India has seen many success stories in the last five years in various sectors. The reason for this is not only the governments. India has stopped working in a routine, bureaucratic manner," Modi said.
