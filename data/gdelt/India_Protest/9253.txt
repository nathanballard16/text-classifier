West Bengal doctors’ protest Highlights: Agitating medicos say no honest initiative by CM

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, in a press conference, Saturday said that she has accepted all the demands of the protesting junior doctors in the state, adding that her government is ready to accept more. “We have accepted all the demands of agitating doctors. We are ready to accept more, but they must rejoin service,” she said while addressing the media.

The press conference took place hours after agitating junior doctors turned down the invite for a closed-door meeting with Banerjee at the Secretariat, throwing a spanner in the resolution of the issue that has paralysed the state healthcare system for the past five days.

She also appealed to everyone and said, “I am not going to take any foolish action. If you think I’m not capable to listen to you, you can talk to the Governor or my Chief Secretary. Health services cannot go like this. I appeal to everyone, my Chief Secretary, media, police – please restore normalcy. I appeal to all doctors to resume work as thousands of people are awaiting medical treatment. I am not going to take any stringent action. Let good sense prevail.”

Banerjee said that the state was ready to bear all the expenses of the medical treatment of the junior doctor admitted in a private hospital, adding that the government is committed to resuming normal medical services at the soonest as many people in the state are getting affected.

The Chief Minister said she had cancelled all her programmes just to meet the agitating doctors and discuss their situation, but the junior doctors refused for the meeting. “One must show respect to a constitutional body,” she added.
