Farmers block traffic to condemn arrest of KRRS leader

Farmers staged a traffic-block protest on Bengaluru-Mysuru highway here on Friday condemning the Mysuru police for arresting a Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha (KRRS) leader on the charge of ‘misbehaving with a woman constable’.

The Bettadapura police, of Periyapatna taluk of Mysuru taluk, arrested KRRS vice-president Lokesh Raje Urs recently when he had gone to the police station to inquire about a complaint lodged by a woman. An altercation ensued between Mr. Urs and the woman constable at the station. Later, the police arrested the KRRS leader by filing a false case, the protesters said.

They blocked traffic on the highway for some time and demanded action against the police for arresting Mr. Urs under the false charges.

The agitators said they would intensify their protest if action was not taken against the personnel who arrested Mr. Urs.
