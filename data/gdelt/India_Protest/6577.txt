He is accused of supporting the event, a charge he has strongly denied.

Kanhaiya Kumar, who is contesting the 2019 Lok Sabha election from Begusarai, was holding an election campaign when the locals stopped his cavalcade and asked 'what kind of aazadi (freedom) is he demanding'?

After stopping his car, the locals confronted him and asked why he opposed reservation to economically backward class. They also asked him questions about slogans that were allegedly raised during an event in JNU in 2016.

"Slogans like Bharat tere tukde tukde honge inshallah inshallah won't help you," some of the locals said. To this, Kanhaiya Kumar asked, "Are you a BJP supporter"?
