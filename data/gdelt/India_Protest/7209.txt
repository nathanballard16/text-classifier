Coimbatore trade unions at the crossroads

COIMBATORE: Coimbatore was once a hotbed of trade unions and union activities owing to the abundance of mills in the region. But today, trade unions are in the doldrums say representatives. Because , big industries impose strictures on workers regarding the formation of unions, they said As a result, the strength of unionized workers from organized sectors in the district has gone down. However, as a parallel development, workers from unorganized sectors now increasingly involve in union activities, they said.This has been the trend in the district for the past 20 years, district president of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU) C Padmanabhan said.“The union activities among workers from organized industry have weakened considerably as big industries nowadays don’t allow workers to form unions. Though the production has gone up, the state of workers has not,” he said.The absence of unions has cost workers dearly, Padmanabhan said. “There are stark differences between the agreements made in the presence of unions and those done without them. Workers in Coimbatore don’t get even one-fourth of the benefits got by workers in Chennai or Mumbai, because of this reason,” he said.District secretary All India Central Council of Trade Unions (AICCTU) K Balasunbramanian echoes this opinion. He said post liberalization in 1991, the prospect of forming unions and involving in union activities dwindled drastically.“Today as there is an abundant human resource without proper employment, employers think if their workers strike, they can always find replacements,” he said.However, while the involvement of workers from organized sectors in union activities went down post 1990s, as a parallel trend, there was an increased activity from workers of unorganized sectors such as construction workers, auto drivers, loadmen, hotel workers and domestic workers, say union representatives.By the 1990s unions such as the All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) had started to gather workers from unorganized sectors to fight for their cause, state deputy general secretary of Tamil Nadu All India Trade Union Congress (AITUC) Construction Workers Association N Selvaraj said. The association was formed in 1991 and registered around 1994, he said.“We have fought for the rights of construction workers and have also been successful in bringing pension scheme for the workers,” Selvaraj said.The union members and their families staged a protest in March 2005. Two days later, the state announced the pension scheme, he said. “The state receives 1% of the project cost from builders and deposits it in the corpus fund of the Tamil Nadu Construction Workers Welfare Board, from which the workers receive their pension. This was possible because of the struggle by our union,” he said and added that right now they were asking for the pension amount to be increased.City historians say Coimbatore’s tryst with trade unions started as early as 1908 when freedom fighter V O Chidambaram Pillai was imprisoned in the Coimbatore prison for encouraging workers of Coral Mill in Tuticorin to protest.“There were only a few mills in the region then. By the 1930s, after electricity was brought to the region, mills proliferated and in parallel, unions took shape,” historian C R Elangovan said.While Justice Party led the unions in the beginning, Congress and Communist parties entered the fray later and strengthened the activities, he said.The major strike by mill workers union happened in 1945 when scores of them picketed a prominent mill in the district seeking benefits which led to firing by police.In recent times, a significant number of workers from the city participated in the first nation-wide general strike in 1992.Representatives of trade unions from the district say with respect to organized sectors they were at the crossroads now and had to reinvent and reorganize themselves.District general secretary of AITUC C Thangavel said as today big industries take their workers in buses and drop them back, there was little chance for union representatives to talk to them and form a connect.“While we have been conducting conventions and gate meetings, we have to do more and reach workers of organized sectors at their localities. All unions must come together for this,” he added.
