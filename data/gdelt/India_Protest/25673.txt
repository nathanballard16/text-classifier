People in two villages near Coimbatore boycott rural local body elections

COIMBATORE: More than 200 families in two tribal villages near Coimbatore boycotted the rural local body elections on Monday to protest what they called the Tamil Nadu government’s failure to lay a bitumen road in the area.People have been demanding that the government lay a bitumen road in Arakkadavu and Moonukuttai villages situated in the Karamadai forest range.“We had decided to boycott the general elections that took place earlier this year. But after block-level officials assured us that they would take immediate steps to lay the road and requested not to boycott the elections, we obliged and cast our votes. However, it has been over seven months since the assurance was given, and not a single step has been taken to fulfil the promise,” said K Sathish Kumar, a resident of Arakkadavu.“Why should we vote when none of our demands were even considered,” he asked.On Monday, officials held talks with the villagers. But the villagers did boycott the elections.“Without proper roads, it is extremely difficult to even get out of the villages to go to school, hospital and even to workplace,” he added.Stating that they had been either walking or hiring jeeps to reach the bus stop on the main road which is 4.5 km away, Sathish said jeeps either turned upside down or get struck in the mud. They were either forced to hire another jeep or push the stuck vehicle out of the potholes.“Without having a proper source of livelihood, how could we afford to spend Rs 400 per day to use the jeeps,” he asked. Jeep drivers refused to drive at night for fear of potholes, he added.Sathish said a couple of months ago, youngsters in the villages had tried to fill potholes with sand to prevent vehicle overturning. “But unless the government takes steps to lay a road to our villages, we would boycott the elections,” he added.
