India unsure over Kashmir

After India scrapped Article 370 of its constitution, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir ¬– both sides have been engaging in a bitter tirade on social media. Indians, however, are celebrating and taunting their counterparts in Pakistan over what they consider their victory. Pakistanis are retaliating by giving vent to their emotions by burning the Indian flag and by stomping on it. These are purely emotional response to Indian provocations. Doubtless, Pakistanis eagerly want their Kashmiri brethren to be free in their homeland. The Indian occupation forces have been committing brutalities against Kashmiris for the past many years. As a matter of fact Indian atrocities in Kashmir have been continuing since 1947. Now we should work at all levels to help the Kashmiris gain freedom from India. This time around Pakistan has achieved a great diplomatic success by taking the Kashmir issue to the United Nations Security Council. The UNSC has taken serious notice of the issue. Now India seems to be unsure about Kashmir. They have fully alienated the Kashmiris and the international community is also pressuring it to act sensibly. India appears to have become nervous with regard to Kashmir considering its international isolation over the issue, Kashmir’s geostrategic position and the resentment prevailing against India in East Punjab. India’s only land access is through East Punjab. Remember Operation Blue Star of June 1984. In the course of the operation the Golden Temple in Amritsar was badly damaged by the Indian army. The insurgents also gave a fitting reply to the Indian aggression. Around three thousand Indian soldiers were killed during Operation Blue Star. The figure is Indian prime minister Rajiv Gandhi’s.Munawar Abbas KanwalPublished in The Express Tribune, August 19, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
