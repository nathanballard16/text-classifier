Azam Khan Land Scam Issue Rocks Parliament

Lucknow: Samajwadi Party (SP) legislators on Tuesday registered a strong protest against the land encroachment cases being lodged against SP MP Mohd Azam Khan in both the Houses of the state legislature. While the SP MLAs entered the well of the House in the Vidhan Sabha demanding the withdrawal of cases against Azam Khan, in the Vidhan Parishad, the SP members walked out for the remainder of the day after the Chairperson turned down their request for an adjournment motion regarding the lodging of cases against Khan.

In the Vidhan Sabha, leader of opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary alleged that in the name of Azam Khan, the ruling BJP was humiliating the opposition parties and the minorities.

SP member Naresh Verma raised the matter during zero hour through an adjournment notice. Defending the district administration, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna alleged that in the name of a university, Azam Khan had encroached the land of the poor and the marginalised with the connivance of the then district administration.

Angry SP members then entered the well of the House and the day's business was hurriedly completed before the House was adjourned for the day. The leader of the opposition in Vidhan Parishad, Ahmad Hasan, raised the issue during zero hour and charged the state government of indulging in vendetta politics and harassing the senior SP leader by implicating him in false cases. SP MLC Udaivir Singh pointed out that since the BJP government assumed office in Lucknow in 2017, the process of lodging false cases against Azam Khan and the members of his family had started.
