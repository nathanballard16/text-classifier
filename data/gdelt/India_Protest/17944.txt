There must be Protest against Citizenship Amendment Bill, says Kanan Gopinathan

By A Hoda / Patna

Former IAS Kanan Gopinathan has said that instead of fearing the ‘catastrophic and dangerous consequences’ of ‘communal and anti-national’ laws like the Citizenship Amendment Bill, there was need protest against it.

“The way the current government has made people a victim of a conspiracy in the name of terrorism is dangerous not only for Muslims but also for the poorest people of the country, hence the citizens must protest against the black laws like the Amendment Bill and the NRC” he said at a seminar in Patna.

Instead of submitting a document to avoid the NRC, it should be strongly opposed, he stressed. The citizenship of the people cannot be determined by the government. We must make a determination that we will not allow our country to be divided on the basis of sectarianism and not allow any single community to be subjected to it.

Kanan Gopinathan, who resigned from the job against the unilateral decision of the central government in the case of Jammu and Kashmir, said that some of those who took power wanted to take the Ganga Jamani civilization of society on the path of destruction to impose Hindu Rashtra. They want to put the country on the brink of communalism based on the majority and minority population. The proposal of the Citizenship Amendment Bill and the NRC is part of the same conspiracy. Now, instead of waiting for its implementation, we should strongly oppose it. There is no other way for us but to protest against it.
