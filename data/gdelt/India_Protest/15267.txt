A non-profit organisation has alleged thatare violatingby forcing students to take part in the agitation.The National Commissioner for Protection of Child Rights () has asked the deputy director of education, Mumbai division, to inquire into a complaint that school students are forced to participate in the ongoing protest against the Metro 3 car shed at Aarey Colony.A letter from the NCPCR, prompted by an activist’s allegation, stated: “Pursual of the complaint indicates that school children are involved in various non-educational activities which not only seems to be a violation of child rights but also a matter of concern from the safety point of view of the children.”The NCPCR has taken cognizance of the matter under Section 13 of the CRPC Act, 2005, and sought a report from the education department in 20 days. The complaint was lodged by a nonprofit organisation, Legal Rights Observatory (LRO), which is demanding an FIR against these schools.An education department official confirmed that the letter from the NCPCR arrived last week and said that an inquiry has been initiated. “Once the inquiry is over, we will submit a report to the commissioner’s office,” he said. Activists and students from various parts of the city have been protesting for over a month over the decision of BMC’s Tree Authority to allow axing of over 2,700 trees for a metro car shed in the leafy Aarey Colony.Speaking to Mirror, LRO convener Vinay Joshi alleged that several private schools are forcing their students to distribute pamphlets in their neighbourhood and participate in the protests against the metro project.In response to the notice, Avkash Jadhav, head of the department of history at St Xavier’s College and an activist protesting against the felling of trees, said that most students who participated in the protests came voluntarily. Children took part in the agitation because they are concerned about nature, he said, adding that they were accompanied by parents and were not in school uniform.Mirror had earlier reported that St Stanislaus School, Bandra, had asked parents to sign a letter to register their protest against the felling of trees for the Metro-3 car shed in Aarey. Students were forced to get their parents’ signature on the letter, Joshi alleged. The principal of St Stanislaus School, Anna Correa, refused to comment.The LRO has sought proceedings under Section 23 of the Juvenile Justice Act. “Anybody entrusted with the care of children cannot expose them to any act that can create unnecessary mental or physical suffering,” Joshi said. Under the Act, the accused can be booked for up to six months.
