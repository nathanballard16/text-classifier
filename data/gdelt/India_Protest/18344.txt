Lucknow, November 20

Banaras Hindu University (BHU) students’ unconstitutional protest against the appointment of a Muslim, Firoz Khan, as an assistant professor at Sanskrit Vidya Dharam Vigyan (SVDV) appears to have succeeded as Khan has reportedly returned to his home town Jaipur.

According to sources, Khan returned to his home town on November 19 due to the “sense of insecurity” he had been feeling by the students protesting against a Muslim being appointed as an assistant professor of Sanskrit.

A section of the students had launched a “communal” and vicious protest since November 6, the day Khan went to take his first class, following the confirmation of his appointment on November 5, 2019.

Interestingly, despite the students open defiance of the central university’s rules and regulations and the Indian Constitution, the BHU Vice-Chancellor Rakesh Bhatnagar merely pleaded with them to withdraw their protest.

The university administration till now has not taken any punitive action against the students.

The Joint Action Committee, a group of students belonging to AISA, NSUI and other non-right wing student groups, took out a march on the BHU campus on Wednesday evening to express their solidarity with Khan.

Speaking to this reporter a JAC spokesperson regretted that Khan had to leave the campus due to security reasons.

He also pointed out that despite the Vice Chancellor’s open support for his appointment it was sad that Khan could not formally join duty.

“Nor did the VC take any disciplinary action against the students who were openly vitiating the atmosphere on the BHU campus on communal lines,” he alleged.
