Modi acting like PM of Pakistan: Kejriwal's shocking remark at Chandrababu Naidu's protest

Naidu is observing 'Dharma Porata Deeksha' (a day-long protest for justice) demanding special category status for Andhra and other promises made by the Centre under the AP Reorganisation Act, 2014.

The way Prime Minister Narendra Modi treats the governments of non-BJP ruled states seems like he is the Prime Minister of Pakistan, not India, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday.

“When a person becomes Prime Minister, he becomes Prime Minister of the entire country and not just of a particular party. The way Narendra Modi treats the governments of the non-BJP ruled states, it seems like he is Prime Minister of Pakistan, not India,” Kejriwal said while speaking at the day-long hunger strike called by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu at Andhra Pradesh Bhavan here.
