Help flood-affected via state disaster fund: Congress

The party also slammed Devendra Fadnavis’ Maha Janadesh Yatra.

Mumbai: The Congress on Sunday urged the state government to declare the flood situation across the state as ‘natural calamity.’ The party also asked the Devendra Fadnavis government to help flood-affected people through the state disaster response fund (SDRF).

Several parts of the state have drowned due to the unabeted rainfall. Many people and animals have lost their lives. Traffic at various places has come to a halt. Hence, the state government should declare the floods as ‘natural calamity’ and the affected people should be provided aid from the SDRF, as per the National Disaster Management Act, 2005, the Congress said.

While slamming the chief minister’s ongoing Maha Janadesh Yatra, the Congress criticised Mr Fadnavis for continuing with the campaign while leaving the state in misery. Moreover, the party threatened to take over the disaster management cell of Mantralaya if no immediate measures are taken to provide relief to people.

“The chief minister, who is also a designated chief of the state disaster management authority, has been holding rallies across the state. If he fails to take immediate measures, then we will take over the disaster management cell in Mantralaya,” said former parliamentarian Nana Patole, who is also a chairman of state Congress campaign committee. Maharashtra is expected to go to polls in September-October 2019.
