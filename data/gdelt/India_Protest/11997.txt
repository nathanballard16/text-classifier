Buddhist enclave jubilant at new Kashmir status but China angered

Mumbai: The Buddhist enclave of Ladakh has cheered India's move to hive it off from the Jammu and Kashmir state, a change that could spur tourism and help New Delhi counter China's influence in the contested western Himalayas.

Beijing, though, criticised the move by the Indian government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as part of a wider policy shift that also ended the state known as Jammu and Kashmir's right to set its own laws.

That move - a presidential decree passed as law overnight - strips statehood from the Indian-administered portion of Muslim-majority Kashmir, which remains under an indefinite security lockdown, actions that archrival Pakistan warned could lead to war.
