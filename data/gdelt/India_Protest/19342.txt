In another bizarre incident, a groom stopped to join a group of people who were on a hunger strike while going to the bride's home on his wedding day.

According to News18, the incident took place in Uttar Pradesh's Mahobda district where a group of people has been on a hunger strike from the past 10 days asking to set up a medical college in the district.

Reportedly, the incident took place on Sunday night. One of the protesters said, "We have been on an indefinite hunger strike for the past 10 days now. We demand that a medical college should be constructed here. A groom was heading out for his wedding and when he saw us and after inquiring about our demands, he joined us for about half an hour.”

The groom later left for his wedding. It is unusual that he stopped and inquired about the protest which also shocked the protesters. However, later on, the marriage was happily solemnised.
