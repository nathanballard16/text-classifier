New Delhi: Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar-led Janata Dal (United) will not be a part of BJP-led National Democratic Alliance outside the state of Bihar, the party decided during their National Executive meet on Sunday.

JD(U) will fight the upcoming elections in Jammu and Kashmir, Jharkhand, Haryana and Delhi alone.

This comes after the JD(U) opted out of the Cabinet in protest against getting just one ministry.
