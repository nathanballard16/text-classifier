Raids by Kolkata police a propaganda: Nageshwar Rao

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], Feb 8 (ANI): Additional CBI director M Nageshwar Rao on Friday said that the raids happening in Kolkata "appeared to be propaganda."

In a statement dated October 30, 2018, Rao had also refuted any link with M/s Angela Mercantile Pvt Ltd which was raided by Kolkata Police today. "All that is happening appears to be propaganda," he told ANI.

In response to the raids taking place in Kolkata, the additional CBI director said in a statement, "Further, complete details of all property of my family and mine have already been submitted in my annual property return submitted to the government which are available on Ministry of Home Affairs' website. I request the media to look into the facts mentioned in the press statement of 30.10.2018 which are also available in the public domain. I deny the linkage of this firm with my family members as reported by some media outlets today."

The raids were conducted a day after the Ministry of Home Affairs asked the West Bengal government to take action against five IPS officers in the state who had participated in state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s dharna in Kolkata on the night of February 3.

It was Rao under whose instruction officers of the central investigating agency landed at the doorstep of the Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar on Sunday evening to interrogate him. The CBI sleuths were later detained by the city police.

The incident later stirred a controversy in the capital city of West Bengal, where Banerjee went on a three-day strike against Centre accusing the latter of political vendetta. (ANI)
