Tejaswi Slams Nitish for Claiming Moral High Ground on Communal Issue

Patna: Former Deputy Chief Minister and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejaswi Yadav, talking to reporters outside Bihar Assembly in Patna on Tuesday mocked his former boss and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar for saying that he could not compromise with corruption and communal people when it was he who got corrupt and communal people into power through the 'back door'.

In an obvious reference to Kumar's decision to break away from the Lalu-led Grand Alliance in Bihar to go back to the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA coalition in the state, Yadav, who blames Kumar for his own political setback, asked the Chief Minister to explain who broke away from the secular alliance in favor of communal forces like BJP in Bihar.

Referring to the recent communal incidents in Darbhanga and Bhagalpur, the younger son of Lalu Prasad Yadav said that the recent setback of the NDA candidates at the polling booths in Bihar and other states had made its leaders very nervous forcing them to indulge in violent activities to hide their anger and frustration.

"It were BJP leaders Giriraj Singh and Nityanand Rai who incited people in Darbhanga while Ashwini Kumar Choubey's son was doing the same in Bhagalpur. Nitish Kumar needs to explain why no action has been taken against these people who clearly tried to disrupt communal harmony in Bihar," Yadav asked.

Meanwhile, RJD leaders in the state Assembly chanted anti-Nitish slogans demanding resignations of both Giriraj Singh and Ashwini Kumar Choubey followed by their arrest for fomenting communal unrest in Bihar.
