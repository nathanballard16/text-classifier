BHUBANESWAR: The commissionerate police on Friday said they suspect the involvement of an interstate robbers' gang behind the brazen loot in house of a couple, both bankers in Delhi, on Wednesday at Kanan Vihar here.

A gang of 10 miscreants held the couple's five-month-old baby at knifepoint and looted household articles worth more than Rs 10 lakh.

"We have got vital clue regarding the accused, who are interstate robbers. We have also traced their location. Efforts are on to arrest them," commissioner of police Satyajit Mohanty said without divulging much that may affect the investigation.

Mohanty, who was tightlipped about the state or states the suspected robbers belong to, admitted that they were assisted by a few local miscreants. tnn
