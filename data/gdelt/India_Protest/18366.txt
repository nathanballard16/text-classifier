Congmen protest against Anand Bhavan tax row

Allahabad: Congress leaders handed over a memorandum to municipal commissioner on Wednesday demanding that the historic Anand Bhavan — the ancestral home of former Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru — be exempted from a Rs 4.3-crore house tax bill.

Led by senior corporator Mukund Tiwari, the leaders also urged the administration to withdraw the tax directive. Tiwari said, “Anand Bhavan is a a part of our national heritage. We will be strongly opposing Prayagraj Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) move to slap a house tax notice on Anand Bhavan in the forthcoming sadan meet.”

Municipal commissioner and mayor assured Congress leaders and corporators that action would be initiated only after they go through the documents and records.
