VARANASI: Students of Shibli National PG College, Azamgarh on Monday staged a demonstration outside the campus as a mark of solidarity with the students of Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University , who are protesting against CAA and NRC.Openly defying Section 144 effective in the district, the students raised anti-BJP and RSS slogans while holding the national flag in their hands. Besides, they vehemently condemned the police action on students of Jamia. The students were supported by local units of the Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Ulema Council.According to reports, the police cordoned of the campus by barricading the area, but the frenzy was so high that in no time the agitators moved out of the campus to take out a procession in the city.Amidst the protest, BSP MLA Shah Alam and SP district president Hawaldar Yadav added fuel to the fire by condemning “government decision of imposing CAA and NRC on the people of India”.“The BJP is out to do what the British did with India... divide to rule. Their policies have been anti-Muslim and CAA will give them legal arm to execute their pledge of imposing hindutva on secular India,” said Nooral Huda Ansari of the Rashtriya Ulema Council.SP Azamgarh Triveni Singh said, “The students have submitted a charter of demands.”
