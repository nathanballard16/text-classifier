The two students met senior professors and their behaviour was demeaning. The two accused disrupted peace on the campus,” the registrar said in his complaint, adding that the department “always” had the required affiliation.Students of the physiotherapy department said they have only been demanding proof of the affiliation. “The matter started in February, when I went to the state medical faculty to get my registration number. I was told that the university’s courses are not affiliated with the board. I came back to the college and raised the matter with the professors. But nobody gave us satisfactory answers. This is when we staged the first protest,” said the former student. He claimed the university had asked them to wait for three months to complete the process of affiliation.The protests continued through May, with students alleging that the university had managed to register only 3 of its 10 courses.Noida police chief Vaibhav Krishna said: “We are investigating the matter. The two accused will be called to the police station for their statements. Meanwhile, they have been booked under sections 452 (trespass), 116 (abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment), 117 (abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons) of the Indian Penal Code.”
