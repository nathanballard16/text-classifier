Article content Millions of young people gathered in cities around the world on Friday to demand governments take action to address climate change and put an end to the age of fossil fuels, including hundreds of students in Vancouver who staged a “die-in” in a busy, downtown mall and on the steps of a high-profile company headquarters.

Article content What the Vancouver group lacked in overall numbers on Friday, they made up for by creating poignant images of what they see as a bleak future if there isn’t dramatic action to address climate change. They took these into a lunch-time food court at Pacific Centre to interrupt shoppers and diners and then into view of corporate Vancouver on the steps of the Bentall 5 building where resource company Teck Resources is located. At noon, over a hundred students who had been filing into Pacific Centre in small groups so as to not alert security guards lay down on the floor and pretended to be dead. As cameras snapped and passersby posted, they sprawled motionless for 11 minutes to symbolize the 11 years from now until 2030, which is the date the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has identified as a dire deadline if there isn’t urgent and unprecedented action.

Article content Some closed their eyes and held signs reading, “I died from air pollution” and “I died because you kept using oil.” “Essentially a ‘die-in’ is a staged protest where we conspicuously go to a target location and lie on the floor and act dead. It’s a signalling of the danger of inaction,” said Samantha Lin, a Grade 12 student and member of Sustainabiliteens, which is made up of “youth across Metro Vancouver, mostly teenagers in high school, coming together for a common goal.” Lin said they chose the Pacific Centre food court at lunch time to highlight consumerism and how it is driving the climate crisis.

Article content Photo by Jason Payne / PNG The group targeted Teck Resources because, in 2017, a Carbon Majors report identified it as being among 100 companies that have been the source of 71 per cent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions since 1988. The report gained attention for saying a relatively small number of companies and their investors could play significant roles in climate change action. Earlier this year, Teck was named as one of the 2019 Global 100 Most Sustainable Corporations by media and investment company Corporate Knights. Student Rebecca Hamilton, also of Sustainabiliteens, led one group of about 50 or so teens from the grounds outside the Vancouver Art Gallery into Pacific Centre. She shouted practical instructions into a megaphone that were evocative of a larger movement being inspired by Swedish activist Greta Thunberg: “Youth, you can head in now. If you are older, please stay behind and await other directions.”

Article content “We didn’t know how many people to expect. It’s hard to know. But the energy of what’s happening around the world is really exciting,” said Hamilton. Some 250,000 people gathered in New York City, according to tweets posted by Thunberg. The count for London and Melbourne was about 100,000. Dublin had 25,000, and there were some 270,000 in Berlin with over a million across Germany. Activists say, in total, some four million people in 150 countries participated. Outside the Bentall 5 building, some students dressed in white hazmat suits pretended to be carrying away dead bodies. Others played with stuffed animals and patty-cake games to symbolize their youth before also falling motionless. Many adults also came out to support the students in Vancouver. Anne Hansen held a placard that read, “The kids are the only adults in the room.” “I am just in awe of these young people and their maturity, and their concern, and their togetherness and ability to organize these things. They are way more mature than I was at their age,” she said. jlee-young@postmedia.com — with files from Tiffany Crawford and Mike Bell Photo by Jason Payne / PNG Photo by Jason Payne / PNG Hundreds of teens and others gathering and marching on Georgia St to art gallery with climate strike message pic.twitter.com/cBC4YjTEcu — Joanne Lee-Young (@joanneleeyoung) September 20, 2019
