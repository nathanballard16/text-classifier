The woman was injured Sunday afternoon when the car in which she, her lawyer and two aunts were travelling collided with a truck, which had one number plate blacked out, in Gurubakshganj. The truck owner and the driver have been detained on charges of conspiracy. The woman’s uncle has accused Sengar of planning the accident and alleged that the truck owner is an associate of the MLA. The woman was on her way to visit her uncle, who is in the Rae Bareli district jail, when the accident took place.

And as outrage mounted against the state government and BJP, with Opposition parties even disrupting Rajya Sabha proceedings over the incident, the BJP is yet to take visible action against its MLA. A BJP MP from Uttar Pradesh said: “The party has to take action against the MLA. There is no other way. The delay is damaging the image of the party and its leaders.”

While BJP state President Swatantra Dev Singh refused comment on why his party has not taken action against Sengar, party spokesperson Harish Srivastava said the BJP and the state government stands with the victim and not with the guilty.

He said that the accident is unfortunate and the government will look into all the aspects, irrespective of the status of anyone involved. “We have also agreed to recommend a CBI probe and are ready to give them all support. The party treats the common man and party functionary equally and would never stand with the guilty. The government is doing its job and even the CBI is conducting its probe and if anyone is guilty, they will not be spared,” he said.
