Cops beat up protesting farmers in Rajkot

Farmers from Gujarat CM Vijay Rupani’s home district Rajkot on Monday staged rigorous protest against the government over the issue of non payment of crop insurance claims.

The farmers claimed that over 90 percent of them face crop failure in the current year due to lesser rainfall and insurance was paid to 10% farmers out of them only.

More than one thousand farmers in Padadhari town had gathered near Mamlatdar(tehsildar) office of Padadhari taluka and had blocked the roads.

The police charged baton over the protesting farmers and detained them to stop the protest.

The agitation was led by Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, a sister organisation of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) working for farmers.

The farmers also warned the government that they would stage even bigger and rigorous protest in days to come, if their demands were not accepted.

They also said that they would stop the supply of food grains, vegetables and milk in market.
