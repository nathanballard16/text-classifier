Indian Supreme Court refuses to stall the implementation of the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act

COLOMBO (News 1st) – India’s top court refused to stall the implementation of a new law that lays out a path for non-Muslim minorities from some neighbouring countries for Indian citizenship, despite violent protests across the country.

The Supreme Court stated that it would hear petitions challenging the law on January 22nd, 2020. The petitioners argue that it violates India’s secular constitution.

The court refused to give a stay to the Act saying it has not been completely implemented yet and some guidelines were needed.

Protests against the law erupted in the northeastern state of Assam last week. They have since turned violent and spread to universities across the country.

Nationwide opposition to the Citizenship Amendment Act which offers a path to Indian citizenship for religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan – has grown since last week, but Modi’s government appears to have dug in its heels.

Critics say the law weakens India’s secular foundations.

Protests in Chennai, Hyderabad and in New Delhi’s university escalated as demonstrators in huge numbers raised slogans, carried posters and demanded the government to repeal the act.
