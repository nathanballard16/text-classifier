Protests continue in Kerala over temple controversy

The southern Indian state of Kerala, known for its calm backwaters and lush greenery, has continued to see violent protests over the entry of women to the Sabarimala temple, and 15,000 policemen have been put on duty.

Police said attackers yesterday hurled a home-made bomb at the home of a politician from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and set ablaze an office of its Hindu nationalist parent group Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

A bomb was also thrown at the home of a Communist Party of India (Marxist) legislator, according to Indian media reports.

The protests first erupted after two women in their 40s created history by becoming the first women between the ages of 10 and 50 to enter the Sabarimala temple, which is dedicated to the deity Ayyappa, on Jan 2.

The temple's traditional entry ban on women of menstruating age was overturned by the Supreme Court last September, but Hindu groups and other devotees managed to keep women from entering it for nearly three months.

Protests were further fuelled by reports of a third woman entering the temple. Sri Lankan national Sasikala, according to the police, entered Sabarimala and offered prayers. But police said the woman, who was scared of the repercussions, later denied being able to offer prayers at the temple.

Director-general of police Loknath Behera, the highest-ranking police official in Kerala, told The Sunday Times that police had arrested 3,178 people for offences ranging from disturbing the peace to stone-throwing and damaging public property, and that reports had been registered against 37,000 people over the last three days.
