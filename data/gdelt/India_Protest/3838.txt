Germany: Indians hold protests against Pulwama terror attack

Frankfurt [Germany], Feb 24 (ANI): Indians living in Germany on Saturday held anti-Pakistan protests here to condemn the Pulwama terror attack, the responsibility for which has been claimed by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

The demonstrators, who also rejected terrorism perpetrated from Pakistan, led the protests from Frankfurt Central Station to Römer. They were joined by members of Baloch, Pashtun and Sindhi community who also face state-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan.

Protesters chanted slogans like "jai hind," "veer jawan amar rahe" (or, the bravehearts will never be forgotten), "vishwa shanti ki jai" (or, all hail world peace), "terrorism - down, down," "vande mataram" and "bharat mata ki jai" during Saturday's march. They also held placards which read, "stop terrorism" and "our homage to the martyrs of Pulwama" amongst others while waving the tricolour on the streets of Frankfurt.

A few of the protesters could be seen wearing yellow vests at the demonstrations.

Protests by the Indian diaspora condemning the ghastly February 14 terrorist attack are taking place all across the globe, with demonstrations being held in the USA and Nepal, to name a few.

Around 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives when a JeM operative attacked their convoy in Pulwama's Awantipora in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

In the wake of the attack, the international community has extended its support to India in its fight against terrorism, including China which had previously stonewalled efforts to designate JeM chief Masood Azhar as a "global terrorist" at the United Nations Security Council. (ANI)
