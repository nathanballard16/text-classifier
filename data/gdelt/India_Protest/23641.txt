India's citizenship law: Young Bollywood speaks up

Bollywood heroes are adored for their tenacity on screen to outwit their opponents with quick retorts and beat their enemies into a pulp; what they are not known for is speaking up publicly against the authorities in real life.

But ongoing spirited demonstrations against a controversial citizenship law, led largely by students and other young people across India, have inspired many young Bollywood personalities to stand up against the government - and with the protesters.

This is a rare, widespread outburst from an industry that enjoys a cosy relationship with the political system in India and often churns out films that fit snugly with narratives the government espouses.

But their anger has been stoked by violent police excesses against student protesters as well as the introduction of religion as a factor in the offer of citizenship in India, a secular country.

Earlier this month, the government legislated the Citizenship Amendment Act that fast-tracks citizenship for non-Muslims from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, prompting citizen protests across the country.

"BARBARIC! UNDEMOCRATIC! UNSECULAR! That's what we are turning into! Not the India I was born in!" tweeted actor Pulkit Samrat on Dec 17, adding the hashtags "#UnityIsOurReligion" and "#IStandWithJamiaMilliaStudents".

The latter is a reference to Jamia Millia Islamia, a university in New Delhi that was the site of a large student mobilisation on Dec 15 against the Act.

Widely circulated videos of the protests showed students in a library seeking cover from tear gas fired by the police. At least one student is seen bloodied and another appears to have passed out.

Following a separate crackdown at the Aligarh Muslim University in Uttar Pradesh, the protesting students and their cause won support from many in Bollywood.
