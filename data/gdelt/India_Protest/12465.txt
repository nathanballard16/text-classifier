Special act advisory board drops charges

13 accused in 185-kg gold smuggling case



Supreme Court

Advisory Board

The 185-kg gold smuggling case has taken a turn. After the Supreme Court (SC) held that two of the 13 accused, who were arrested in March-April this year, must remain detained under provisions of the COFEPOSA (Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act), setting aside a Bombay High Court order, the Maharashtraunder the act has dropped charges against all 13 accused. The Union government has filed a Special Leave Petition in the SC against the board’s decision. The SLP pleads the SC to consider whether the “advisory board erred in exercising its jurisdiction”.The SLP contends that the advisory board opined that “there do not exist sufficient grounds for the detention” of the accused men, who had been detained as per a May 17, 2019, order issued by the Competent Authority under COFEPOSA. Earlier, on July 18, the SC had set aside a Bombay HC order, which quashed the preventive detentions under COFEPOSA of two key alleged members of the smuggling gang, from which the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence’s (DRI) Mumbai zonal unit had seized 185 kilos of foreign-origin gold in March and April.Defending the detentions, the SLP pointed out that based on material available, COFEPOSA’s ‘Competent Authority’ had arrived at a subjective satisfaction to conclude that the accused were allegedly involved in smuggling activities, which were prejudicial to the country’s economic interests. The May 17 detention orders were passed after the Competent Authority further concluded that accused allegedly “were likely to indulge in activities prejudicial to the state and with a view to prevent them from engaging in smuggling and transportation of goods”, as per the SLP.The SC had in July held that the HC ‘erred’ in quashing the detentions on grounds of non-compliance of procedural safeguards and non-application of mind by detaining authority.Stating that the advisory board had opined that there was no sufficient ground for the detentions, despite a copy of the SC’s July 18 order upholding the “same detention order dated May 17” having presented before it, the SLP raises key “questions of law”, including whether the board’s “order/report” is “in the teeth of the decision” of the apex court’s July decision.The SLP says the advisory board’s decision is open to judicial review based on the discretion provided to the SC under Article 136 of the Constitution.DRI had said that the gold had allegedly been smuggled from Dubai via Gujarat by sea route. It was also alleged that the syndicate had smuggled in 3,396 kg of gold from Dubai between July 2018 and March this year.Last week, a division bench in Bombay HC deferred a bunch of petitions filed by the remaining 11 accused, represented by Advocate Sujay Kantawala, to August 22. The accused are seeking to be released based on the advisory board’s order.
