LUCKNOW: Protests broke out at Nadwa College in Lucknow against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act on Monday, a day after violent demonstrations in the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University area.

The Citizenship Act seeks to grant Indian citizenship to refugees from Hindu, Christian, Sikh, Buddhist and Parsi communities fleeing religious persecution from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh and who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Parliament earlier this week and became an Act with President Ram Nath Kovind giving his assent on November 12.
