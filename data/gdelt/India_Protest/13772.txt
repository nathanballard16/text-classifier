India blames Pak-incited elements for 'unruly' protest at Indian Mission in London

NEW DELHI:

India on Wednesday urged the UK government to take action against those who vandalised the Indian High Commission in London . The attack was the second in less than a month.“We are deeply concerned by the reports of unruly demonstration by Pakistan-incited elements and consequent organised vandalism of the property of the High Commission of India in London,” said a spokesperson for India’s external affairs ministry in response to queries on anti-India demonstrations in London. “This is the second time in less than a month that such an incident has taken place, affecting the security and the normal functioning of our mission. We consider these incidents to be unacceptable and have strongly urged the government of UK to take action against those involved.”According to reports, two people have been arrested in connection with Tuesday’s incident, which saw some 10,000 protesters led by British Pakistani groups gather outside the Indian High Commission.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab condemned the violence, calling it “deplorable”. “Any violence is deplorable... What we now need to do is try and reduce those tensions but also, on a positive side, build up confidence-building measures to allow proper dialogue between the communities in Kashmir and also between India and Pakistan,” Raab said in parliament.The incident was raised in the British parliament by Shailesh Vara, MP for North West Cambridgeshire, who said: “The violence and abuse targeted towards the British Indian community on this occasion is completely unacceptable.” BJP’s foreign cell chairman Vijay Chauthaiwale told ET: “Second attack on Indian High Commission in London is a result of lawlessness, ineffective Metropolitan Police and silent support of London Mayor Sadiq Khan to anti-India elements. Is London turning into lawless sub-Saharan African country where goons rule?”
