New Delhi [India], Nov 13 (ANI): Due to the ongoing protest outside the Jawaharlal Nehru University Convention Center an ambulance was stuck for more than five minutes inside the premises of the campus as the gates were locked by the university administration.



A couple of protesters also expressed dissent against the locking of the gate and made efforts to break the locks with the help of the iron sticks

Minutes later, the ambulance was allowed by the authorities to exit from another gate of the campus.
