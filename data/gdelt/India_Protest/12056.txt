Hundreds protest in Dhaka over India's Kashmir stance

IAB leader said that move by India has "hurt and angered the global Muslim community".

DHAKA (Dunya News/Reuters) - Hundreds of Bangladeshi protesters took to the streets of Dhaka to protest neighbouring India’s decision to scrap special status for occupied Kashmir.

Many of those joining the protest outside Bangladesh’s national mosque were members of the Islamist political party Islami Andolan Bangladesh. Leading party member Maulana Zakaria addressed the crowd, saying the move by India has "hurt and angered the global Muslim community".

On August 5, amid escalating tension in occupied Kashmir following deployment of tens of thousands of additional troops, the Indian government ended special status of the valley while scrapping articles 35A and 370 of the Constitution.

In a malicious attempt to turn Muslim majority into minority in occupied Kashmir, the Indian president has signed a four-point amendment decree in this regard.

According to details, the announcement was made by Indian Home Minister Amit Shah during his address in Rajya Sabha, upper house of Indian parliament. Shah said, “Kashmir will no longer be a state. It will be divided into two union territories – Kashmir, which will have a legislature, and Ladakh, which will be without a legislature." He also told that the valley would be re-organized geographically.”

The revocation of the articles has allowed other non-Muslim Indian citizens to buy land in the valley while a separate legislative assembly will be established there for its own laws.

As India maintains a telecoms blackout to deter protests in Kashmir, COAS Bajwa said that the country’s military would "go to any extent" to support the people of the disputed region.
