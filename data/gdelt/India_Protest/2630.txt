PM In Assam LIVE Updates: "Rumours Being Spread About Citizenship Bill"

PM Modi in Assam: PM Modi said rumours were being spread about the Citizenship Bill

Prime Minister Narendra Modi kicked off his two-day tour of the Northeast last evening amid angry protests over the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill. Activists greeted the Prime Minister with black flags with several civil society groups across the Northeast, including the All Assam Students Union, deciding to intensify their ongoing agitation today. Slogans of "Narendra Modi, Go Back" were heard as activists stood by the roads waving black flags as PM Modi's motorcade was heading to Raj Bhawan from the airport last evening.

PM Modi kicked off his two-day tour of the Northeast by visiting Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Tripura. He laid the foundation of a greenfield airport at Hollongi in Arunachal Pradesh's Parum Pare district.

He will also inaugurate two key energy projects for Assam-Numaligarh Refinery's bio-diesel plant and the Barauni-Guwahati gas pipeline. In Arunachal Pradesh, the prime minister will launch a new, dedicated Door Darshan channel for the state, aptly named 'DD Arun Prabha'. PM Modi's last stop for the day will be in Tripura, where he is scheduled to arrive at around 3.30 pm.
