Water woes brim over, Cong threatens agitation

Congress councillor Chirag Zaveri squatted in VMC office on Tuesday

Vadodara: The water woes in southern parts of the city are now threatening to snowball into an agitation with opposition Congress taking up the issue aggressively. A senior leader of the party has threatened to start an agitation targeting civic officials if the woes did not end soon.

Congress corporator Chirag Zaveri on Tuesday surprised Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) functionaries by squatting on the floor of VMC commissioner’s chamber to protest against the water woes in the southern parts of the city. Zaveri said the area was getting contaminated and insufficient water since a long time now.

“There is water all around due to heavy rain. All water sources are brimming and yet the southern parts of the city are either not getting water or the water is contaminated. There are some areas that do not get any water. Diwali is around the corner and people need water,” said Zaveri.

Zaveri blamed VMC functionaries for the state of affairs and said they had no control over officials. He alleged that the officials were also involved in bitter infighting that had also contributed to the situation.

The veteran and heavyweight corporator from Manjalpur said he would intensify his agitation over the issue. He said the officials will be ‘gheraoed’ and their faces blackened if things did not improve.

In the wake of unexpected aggression, the civic chief called a meeting of officials. They were asked to look into the water problems at the earliest. Sources said some officials suspected that the supply of water from Ajwa is being miscalculated and may be below what was being shown. This and other issues will now be looked into.
