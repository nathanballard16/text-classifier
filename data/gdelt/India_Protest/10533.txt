Six held for Ranchi anti-lynching rally violence, three FIRs filed

RANCHI: Police have intensified their manhunt for persons responsible for Friday’s violence during an anti-lynching protest rally in Ranchi.Until now, at least six people have been detained for questioning.Ranchi SSP Anish Gupta on Tuesday said, “We have set up a special team to investigate the CCTV footage of the violence. Using whatever inputs we have gathered so far, we are searching for the people who had a role in the incident.”Three separate FIRs have been filed against 333 people (33 of the accused are named) in connection with the violence that erupted on Main Road, Doranda and at a place near the Birsa Munda international airport in the state capital.The violence broke out after a public meeting organised by Mutheda Muslim Mahaj in Doranda in protest against the June 17 mob attack on Tabrez Ansari in Seraikela-Kharsawan and his subsequent death in judicial custody four days later. The attackers accused Ansari and two of his companions of theft.The administration is on its feet ever since reports of the alleged CCTV footage of the violence surfaced. Police sources said they are trying to verify the authenticity of the video showing a mob attacking a bus and trying to set it on fire at Doranda.The video also shows some elderly Muslim men stopping the protesters from doing so. The bus belongs to Cambridge Institute of Technology, the sources said.The same day, three youngsters from the minority community were beaten up by villagers near the Birsa Munda international airport.This led to a protest by a group of people at Main Road, during which a Hindu youth was stabbed and another beaten up while they were returning home from their shops.On Monday, Jharkhand high court, while hearing a PIL and an interlocutory application regarding Ansari’s death and the violence in Ranchi, asked the government to submit a detailed report on the incidents by July 17.
