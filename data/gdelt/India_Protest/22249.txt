US' reticence on India's anti-Muslim acts

WASHINGTON • China's detention of one million ethnic Uighur Muslims has been described by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as Orwellian, a "gross human rights violation" and "one of the worst stains on the world of this century".

In Myanmar, the ethnic cleansing campaign against Rohingya Muslims is "deeply abhorrent to our way of life" and displayed "shocking and brutal violence", according to US State Department officials.

But American diplomats have offered only muted public criticism of India's moves against Muslims, seemingly wary of alienating an unpredictable ally as the US confronts China and Russia in the Indo-Pacific region.

The stark contrast over religious protections for Muslims reveals an undercurrent in high-level meetings this week between the US and India on a range of diplomatic and military issues.

The meetings in Washington are scheduled as protests rage across India over the country's new legislation to fast-track citizenship for migrants of all of South Asia's major religions except Islam.

The unrest follows months of high anxiety in Kashmir, a Muslim-majority region claimed by both India and Pakistan; in August, Kashmir was besieged by Indian security forces and saw its decades-long autonomy revoked.

Ms Alice Wells, the top State Department official for South Asia, last week said the Trump administration is closely watching the situation in Kashmir and continued to call for the release of detainees and for political and economic normalcy to be restored.

She noted concerns in Congress about India's citizenship Bill and said residents in Kashmir "are entitled to their full rights under the Indian Constitution, which enshrines the respect for religious freedom of all Indians".

Under Mr Pompeo, the State Department has elevated the issue of religious freedom and its role in foreign policy to include for the first time hosting annual meetings of senior foreign diplomats to discuss challenges to faith-based liberty.
