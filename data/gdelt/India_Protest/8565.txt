India: Govt's plan of mandatory Hindi teaching in schools sparks outrage

In India, the draft National Education Policy’s recommendation regarding mandatory Hindi teaching in schools has sparked outrage in Tamil Nadu and West Bangal states.

The opposition parties in Tamil Nadu warned against imposition of three language formula in non Hindi speaking states.

In Kolkata, hundreds of activists associated with the Bangla Pokkho civil society group took to the streets shouting slogans against the unfair imposition of Hindi and burning the pages of the draft policy.
