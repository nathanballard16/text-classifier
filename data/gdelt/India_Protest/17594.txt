Private doctors stage protest in Kalaburagi

Condemning the barbaric attack by Kannada activists on doctors on duty at Minto Eye Hospital in Bengaluru last week, the doctors of private hospitals, under the banner of Indian Medical Association (IMA), staged a protest in Kalaburagi on Friday

The doctors, sporting black ribbons on their arms, marched to the Deputy Commissioner’s office and submitted a memorandum demanding action against those responsible for the incident.

Kalaburagi IMA president Amul Patange said that the doctors attached to private hospitals registered protests peacefully without creating problems for patients. We cannot shut down hospitals as the patients from remote areas come to the district headquarters with serious cases. Moreover, dengue and paediatric cases are vulnerable and we cannot leave them unattended.

Doctors from Government Hospital did not join the protest, said District Surgeon Shivanand Surgali, who added that all the emergency and non-essential medical services including OPDs were functioning.

Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences (BRIMS) witnessed the highest out-patient registration in the morning hours as private hospitals were shut till afternoon.

Doctors from various private hospitals staged protests in the morning. OPDs at some hospitals were opened by afternoon as the doctors returned to work. However, services in emergency care, operation theatre and in-patient wards were not affected.
