CAA: When protests did not happen, Congress went to Mahatma Gandhi

New Delhi: Amidst the ongoing protests across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the Congress will stage a sit-in protest at Rajghat, the memorial site of the Father of the Nation, Mahatma Gandhi. Congress sources have said that all big leaders of the party, including the party's interim president Sonia Gandhi, former president Rahul Gandhi and party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, are expected to be present at the picket site.

Rahul Gandhi is visiting South Korea with an official delegation and he is returning home late tonight. He told that this strike will start around 2 pm and will go till late evening. The interim president of the Congress, Sonia Gandhi, on Friday night accused the government of crushing the agitation over this law.

Vadra also issued a statement today and accused the government of trying to suppress the protest by behaving ruthlessly with the protesters. Earlier on Sunday, PM Modi is addressing a rally at Ramlila ground near Rajghat. A large number of people are expected to participate in this and it is believed that PM Modi will also inform the people of the country about the national citizenship law.
