Why protest if blind: JNU forum claims horror jibe by Delhi Police against student

A Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) forum for visually impaired students has accused the Delhi Police of not only beating up a participant during ongoing protests, but also mocking his disability.

The student, Shashi Bhushan, was "inhumanely beaten up", and asked why he was protesting if he was "blind", the JNU Visually Challenged Students' Forum said.

When Shashi Bhushan "brought [to] the attention of the police personnel that he is [a] visually impaired student, then the Delhi police very insensitively reacted, saying, 'Andha hai to protest karne kyon aata hai [If you are blind, then why have you come for the protest]?'" the forum said.

He was then kicked on his chest and stomach and thrown on the ground, and the police didn't help him get his injuries treated, they said.

Students of JNU clashed with the police on Monday after they were stopped from marching to Parliament to protest a hostel fee hike.

Students also clashed with the police outside Safdurjung tomb near Jor Bagh.

According to the police, around 30 police personnel and 15 students were injured.

The Opposition in the Rajya Sabha was in uproar today over the alleged police action (and the detention of politicians in Jammu and Kashmir), and proceedings were adjourned till 2 pm.

Opposition members in the Lok Sabha described the alleged baton-charge by the police as the suppression of students' voices.

The Delhi Police has filed an FIR in connection with the ongoing protests.
