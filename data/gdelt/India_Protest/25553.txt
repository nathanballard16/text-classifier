Train resumes service in full route

Tirupur: After six months, the Palakkad-Tiruchendur passenger train resumed its routine route. The train services were earlier stopped at Dindigul due to maintenance works in the Madurai division.

For the past six months, the train would be stopped at Dindigul instead of reaching Palakkad. As the works were completed, the authorities have extended the service to Palakkad since Friday, said a railway official.“The short service had affected the passengers who travelled between Palakkad and Udumalpet,” said the railway official.

Meanwhile, the railway official said Southern Railway would start a reservation facility for Thiruvanathapuram-Madurai ‘Amirtha’ Express at the Udumalpet railway station. tnn
