Indian misadventure to get befitting response

RAWALPINDI: Director General Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor Thursday said the Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat’s recent statement was an effort, as usual, to divert the world attention from widespread protests in India against the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).

Gen Rawat said the situation at the Line of Control (LoC) could escalate any time.

DG Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor said India was passing provocative remarks and using tension along the LoC to drive the world attention away from its internal chaos over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Act. He said the armed forces of Pakistan will befittingly respond to any Indian misadventure or aggression.

Gen Rawat’s statement came two days after a teenage boy was martyred after the Indian troops shelled two different sectors along the LoC in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.

Two other civilians were injured in the indiscriminate shelling.

India is currently facing widespread protests after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) passed the controversial CAA.

The Act makes it easier for non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who settled in India prior to 2015, to gain citizenship.

Thousands of people have protested, saying the law is anti-Muslim and the latest in a series of measures by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist government to marginalise the community.
