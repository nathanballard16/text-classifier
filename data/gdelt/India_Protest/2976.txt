Protests erupt in state after action against SP president

In Allahabad, protesters damaged vehicles and indulged in arson

Allahabad/Varanasi/Gorakhpur: Hundreds of Samajwadi Party (SP) workers went on a rampage across several parts of the state on Tuesday after party president Akhilesh Yadav was prevented in Lucknow from boarding a plane to Allahabad to attend a function organised by the Allahabad University Students Union (AUSU).

In Allahabad, around a dozen SP workers, including party MP from Badaun, Dharmendra Yadav, leaders of the district unit, student leaders and about half-a-dozen security personnel were injured when the police used force to disperse them at Balson Crossing. The protesters also damaged some vehicles and indulged in arson.

Police said the situation took an ugly turn when a procession, led by Dharmendra Yadav, arrived at Balson Crossing from AU Union Hall. The MP, after addressing the students of AU at the event marking the annual function of AUSU, was leading the procession.
