AAP protests against Delhi Police at CEC office

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, MP Sanjay Singh and several Aam Aadmi Party MLAs protested outside the office of the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) here to denounce "atrocities" by Delhi Police.

The sit-in came hours after an AAP delegation led by Sisodia and Sanjay Singh met CEC Sunil Arora alleging that the police were harassing employees of a call centre hired by the party.

Sisodia later returned to the site after police allegedly continued its raid against the call centre and tweeted that he would remain standing outside Arora's office until the latter again met him.

AAP's Lok Sabha candidates in Delhi Raghav Chadha and Atishi Marlena joined Sisodia.

"Sisodia, Singh, Chadha, myself and MLAs are waiting outside Election Commission till CEC meets us! It is the responsibility of EC to ensure free and fair elections and not let BJP's 'Delhi Police' intimidate our call centres," Atishi tweeted.

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a tweet, asked the other MLAs to join the protest. He also denounced the Delhi Police.

"The Police has raided without any search warrant and is barging into server rooms and interrogating all call centre agents. What is this going on? What is the crime?" Kejriwal asked.

"Police reach another call centre. Asking for server details and our data," he said.
