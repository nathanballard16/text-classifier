The BJP has called a 12-hour bandh to protest against the killing of activists. Throughout Bengal, the day was being celebrated as a black day.

With this, Vijayvargiya said, "the responsibility of violence in Bengal is that of Mamata Banerjee. She is instigating people in a spirit of revenge. Mamata is telling her workers to target BJP workers from where their party is losing. All the hooligan are with the ruling Trinamool, they have pistols and bombs. Our workers have no weapons. The centre will have to intervene if there is similar violence in Bengal. If necessary, the president's rule in Bengal may apply.
