Allegation

“Anubhav Bhatter, Director, BMA Wealth, used client money to fund personal properties in Mumbai and even fund insurance business in the name of RDB and AB Insurance so that he could live happily from the annuity income,” the complainants have told SEBI and the police.

BMA Wealth was suspended in October by the NSE and SEBI following client default complaints. But investors are awaiting further action. Recently, many investors had gathered at the SEBI office to protest and demanded that the regulator take Karvy-like action against the broker.

Clients of BMA Wealth have provided SEBI and the police with a list of companies where BMA’s promoters diverted their money.

They said these companies had dummy directors but the monetary benefits flowed to BMA Wealth’s promoters.
