Bank Strike Day 2: Operations and services affected

The ongoing strike is the third consecutive strike by the central trade unions in a month.

The bank strike on wednesday has enetered in its second day. A section of PSU bank employees are on a two-day strike from January 8 in support of the nation-wide strike call given by 10 central trade unions against the government's alleged anti-worker policy.

The All India Bank Employees Association (AIBEA) and Bank Employees Federation of India had informed the Indian Banks' Association (IBA) of the two-day nationwide strike on January 8-9, 2019, IDBI Bank said in a filing to the BSE.
