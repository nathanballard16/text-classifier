English prof gets Environment Excellence award

Ludhiana: Lovleen Bains, associate professor in English, Guru Nanak National College, Doraha, has been conferred with the Environment Excellence Award for initiating and contributing towards environment protection efforts. She was conferred the award by Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh during a state-level function organized at Indian Institute of Technology, Ropar, on the occasion of World Environment Day to strengthen environment protection activities and spread awareness among masses.

Lovleen was conferred the award for adopting the villages of Samrala and Doraha block and making them free of stubble burning. She said: “The team of extension cell under the guidance of general secretary Harpratap Brar, finance secretary Pavittar Pal Singh Pangli, and principal Narinder Singh Sidhu, chalked out a plan of spreading awareness among farmers regarding environment conservation and crop residue management in September 2018. For the realization of this plan, I and Prof Harpreet Singh of Department of Sociology, Sompal Heera of Department of Punjabi, Jarnail Singh Lopon and the students initially conducted a survey of 61 villages of Doraha, Samrala, Macchiwara, Sahnewal, Khanna and Payal blocks. The major inference drawn from the study was that 86% of the respondent farmers are still resorting to stubble burning though 92.5% of the respondents are, at the same time, prepared to say a final no if provided adequate financial aid or machinery at cheaper rates'

“In order to meet the demand of the farmers, we initially identified 4 villages — Sultanpur, Lopon, Mehdoodan, and Khaira of Samrala block, and strived to make them burn free during wheat sowing season-2018. The farmers were acquainted with the latest techniques of sowing with two happy seeders, issued by GST Commissionerate Ludhiana through KVK Samrala to our college. The student volunteers successfully provided demonstration on 204 acres of land with happy seeders in seven villages, including Sultanpur, Lopon, Mehdoodan and Khaira, Chak, Balala and Pangalian,” she added.
