"Congress manifesto insults Army; uses language of separatists," says PM Modi

When ABP News quizzed Prime Minister Modi to know why he felt that the manifesto was more of blandishment, he said that he was expecting a mature manifesto from the grand old party that has governed the country for sixty years.

Congress has a track record of making tall electoral promises, PM Modi said while talking to ABP News.

PM lambasted the Congress party over failing to deliver on its electoral promises and said that it has a track record of making tall promises in manifesto.

He said their manifesto has brought a lot of disappointment.

PM said the “Congress party has insulted country\'s Army in its manifesto- which is in sync with the language that is used by the separatists for our country”
