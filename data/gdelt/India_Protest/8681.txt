Couple from KP files plaint against DTDC over package from Ambala

They claim users of this courier service routinely face such issues



Finding their package sent here from Haryana looted, a married couple in the city on Thursday filed a complaint against staffers of DTDC courier service in Pune.



The complainants are Koregaon Park residents Harshit Tiwari and Chandani Goyal, a software engineer and State Bank of India (SBI) employee, respectively. Goyal is a native of Ambala.



“The woman also claimed that she knows of five or six other people who have faced similar issues with DTDC deliveries in Pune. We are investigating the matter further,” informed Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police (DCP) for zone II, adding, “The package went to various locations between Ambala and Pune. We cannot be sure where the damage was sustained.”



For a wedding in a family friend’s household, the couple had bought things like dress materials, a mixer and more, and initiated a courier delivery of three boxes from Ambala on April 9 this year with the help of DTDC. The complaint states that DTDC initially provided the couple with an incorrect tracking number. When the three boxes were delivered, the package that originally had 22 dress materials worth Rs 52,288 in it was found empty, the couple claims, adding that when they first approached the courier service provider’s office in Dattawadi, they did not get a satisfactory answer. So, they went to the cops.



Two more people have recorded their statements in the matter, shared senior police inspector Madan Bahadarpure of KP police station. A case under sections 407 (criminal breach of trust by carrier, etc.), 379 (theft) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against the courier service. — PMB
