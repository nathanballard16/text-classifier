Kerala nun rape case: 4 Kerala nuns who stood up for rape survivor 'punished'

4 nuns, who protested against Bishop Franco Mulakkal, transferred

KOTTAYAM: Four nuns who had supported the survivor nun in the rape case against Jalandhar bishop Franco Mulackal have been asked by the Missionaries of Jesus congregation to leave the Kuravilangad convent in Kerala and rejoin their communities in other parts of the country.Sr Regina Kadamthottu, superior general of the Jalandhar-based congregation, in separate letters, said that the nuns - Sr Alphy Pallasseril, Sr Anupama Kelamangalathuveliyil, Sr Josephine Villoonnickal and Sr Ancitta Urumbil - had defied her repeated instructions to rejoin the communities to which they belong canonically as per their appointment.The nuns, who participated in the September 2018 protest demanding the arrest of Bishop Mulakkal, are now staying with the survivor nun. The superior general's letter to Sr Nina Rose, the fifth nun who participated in the protest, is also expected soon.The nuns have said that they would not obey the orders. "This is like a disciplinary action against us," Sr Anupama said. "We are preparing a reply to the superior general... This is a ploy to torpedo the case and isolate the survivor nun," she said.Sr Regina has urged these nuns not to make their legal obligations in the rape case an alibi to compromise the affirmed religious vows and principles of community life. There was a move to oust the survivor nun and her five associates from the Kuravilangad convent over security issues in November last year as well.
