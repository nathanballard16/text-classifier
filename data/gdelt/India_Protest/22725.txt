New Delhi: Massive protests rocked the country on Thursday against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019. Three people died - two in Mangaluru and one in Lucknow - during violent protests in the two cities. Massive traffic jams snarled the national capital, where eight Air India flights were disrupted due to heavy congestion on roads leading to the Indira Gandhi International Airport (IGIA). Section 144 was imposed in various parts of the country and internet services have been suspended in Ghaziabad, Bareilly, Mangaluru and Prayagraj.
