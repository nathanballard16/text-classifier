T. N. should be exempted from NEET : Subbarayan

‘CPI will continue to protest against NEET’

The Union Government should exempt Tamil Nadu from National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET), Tiruppur MP K. Subbarayan said here on Saturday.

Mr. Subbarayan told presspersons that three students had committed suicide in Tamil Nadu in the last few days as they were unable to clear NEET. “The culprit who instigated the suicide is the Union Government as it made NEET mandatory,” he said.

The number of students from Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe and Other Backward Classes categories who had cleared NEET was less compared to the number of students from the Forward Category, he claimed.

Tamil Nadu had unitedly opposed NEET and the party (Communist Party of India) will continue to protest against it.

The CPI has prepared a memorandum regarding lowering of GST rate for smaller units and this will be presented to the Union Government by the newly-elected MPs of Tamil Nadu.

Alleging that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was working against the interests of Tamil Nadu, he said the proposed hydrocarbon project would affect the delta areas. The Green Corridor project between Chennai and Salem was to favour a Corporate company and help it transport iron ore mined near Tiruvannamalai, he alleged.

The State Government has failed to manage the drinking water crisis across Tamil Nadu and there are no schemes to recharge the ground water table, he said.
