Now, NIT Kurukshetra's Ridiculous 'Curfew Timing' Notice To Girls Hostel Draws Flak Online

After hogging the spotlight for the strict warning issued to students asking them to stop gate crashing weddings, NIT Kurukshetra has yet again drawn attention for a blatantly sexist rule for girls.

You guessed it right, it's the hostel curfew timing.

NIT Kurukshetra's Kalpana Chawla Girl's hostel circular recently went viral for its sexist curfew timings. The circular signed by the chief warden states, 'After 6 pm heavy fine will be imposed on defaulters.'

The hostel deadline has been a topic of controversy across universities and institutions in India. For instance, Pinjra Tod, a women's collective of Delhi University staged multiple protests for the past three years demanding curfew-less nights for women's hostels.

Now, we all know that curfew timings are almost never imposed on boy's hostels and imposing this rule on the pretext of women's safety is more than just ridiculous.

The circular sparked a debate on Reddit and people just couldn't ignore the irony behind the rule and the name of the hostel.

One Reddit user wrote, "Yeah.. Just like Kalpana Chawla, who never dared to venture out!"

According to this Wire.in article, the University Grants Commission in 2016 explicitly stated that curfews cannot be imposed on women. Another report on Live Law clearly states that in one case High Court of Kerala came down heavily on the stipulation in Hostel Rules saying girls have equal freedom as boys.

The report adds that the 'curfew timing' almost seems to be the moral choice of the management more than anything else.
