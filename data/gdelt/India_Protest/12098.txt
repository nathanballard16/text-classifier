Brussels, August 07, 2019 (PPI-OT): Kashmir Council Europe (KCEU) is organizing three-day protests from today in different places in Brussels, the capital of Belgium, against abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A by India. A statement issued by the KCEU Chairman, Ali Raza Syed in Brussels said, the protest camps will be held from 10:30 (10:30 a.m.) to 17:30 (5 p.m.) local time at different places in the capital city, which is also EU’s headquarters. A camp against Indian decision will be held at Place de L’Albertine, today, at Place Schuman (In front of EU’s External Actions Service) on Thursday and at Place de L’Europe (In front of Central Station) on Friday.

Ali Raza Syed said, we shall raise our voice against the Indian decision for revoking special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Ali Raza Syed said, imposing new legislation by the Indian government for abolition of special status of Jammu and Kashmir cannot stop struggle of Kashmiri people for freedom.

Ali Raza Syed said, Jammu and Kashmir is not a part of India, it is an internationally recognized disputed territory. He said, India wants to change demographic situation of Jammu and Kashmir but this evil desire of New Delhi will not be materialized. The KCEU Chairman called the international community, US and EU to take serious notice of the severe situation in occupied Kashmir.
