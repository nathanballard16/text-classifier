Patiala: Four days on, unemployed teachers continue protest

PSPCL assures jobs, protesters call off strike

PATIALA: Demanding jobs from the state government, members of the ETT-TET-pass unemployed teachers' union have continued with their protest, which entered its fourth day here on Friday. The five unemployed teachers climbed a water tank in Patiala on Monday evening along with bottles filled with petrol in a protest against the state government.The protestors claimed that they were demanding jobs from the state government after clearing the mandatory exam of the Teacher Eligibility Test (TET) as the government promised to provide jobs to those who clear the test. They claimed that despite two years, candidates who cleared the TET exam were without jobs.Deepak Kamboj, president of the ETT-TET-pass unemployed union, said: "We have cleared the TET exam and the government assured us of jobs after we qualify the test. It has been two years and the government has not provided us with jobs. The government holds job fairs, but has been incapable of providing jobs to the unemployed youth. We meet all the requirements of the job and we will continue with our strike until the state government assures us of providing jobs."He said the five protestors, who climbed a water tank on Monday, did not come down. The agitation would be intensified if the government failed to pay heed to their genuine demands.A day after seven persons climbed a water tank in Patiala over their demand to get jobs on compassionate grounds, the protestors called off their strike on Friday after they were given assurance in writing by the PSPCL authorities.The protestors claimed that the authorities of the PSPCL had assured them of fulfilling their demands and considering their issues after which the protestors decided to call off their strike.As many as seven persons, including a 60-year-old woman, had climbed a water tank near the 66 KV grid at the Patiala-Rajpura road on Thursday.They demanded jobs on compassionate grounds for the kin of government employees, who had worked in the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) during 2000 to 2010.President of the union Gurpreet Singh said: "The PSPCL authorities have assured us in writing to fulfil our demands after looking into the documents of genuine cases. Following this, we have ended our strike."The protestors claimed that they lost their parents or kin during job in the Punjab State Electricity Board (PSEB) that was later dissolved and transformed into two separate boards, including PSPCL and PSTCL, in 2010.They said after 2010, the government started giving jobs on compassionate grounds to the kin of employees, who died during their job, but did not consider cases pending from 2000 to 2010.The protestors said there were around 6,000 persons across Punjab who demanded jobs on compassionate grounds from the PSPCL and the PSTCL.
