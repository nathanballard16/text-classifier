NEW DELHI: On the last day of campaigning for the 4th phase of the Lok Sabha elections , leaders across the spectrum made a strong pitch to woo voters.While PM Modi campaigned in Uttar Pradesh unleashing a strong attack on the Mahagathbandhan , BJP president Amit Shah spearheaded the campaign in Jharkhand and Odisha.The opposition also went all out with Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka leading the charge in Uttar Pradesh. Trinamool chief Mamata and other opposition leaders also campaigned aggressively.Here's a look at how the leaders tried to outscore their opponents:PM Modi held three rallies in Uttar Pradesh. The PM targeted the SP-BSP-RLD alliance, saying the tie-up of "opportunists" wants a helpless government because its mantra is "jaat, paat japna; janata ka maal apna" (play the caste card, loot public money). Modi addressed election rallies in Kannauj, a SP stronghold, Hardoi and Sitapur, a day after filing his nomination from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat for a second term.In Hardoi, he slammed the Congress, blaming it for showing scant regard for Babasaheb Bhimrao Ambedkar and pointed out that his government has dedicated cashless payments app BHIM in his name.Amit Shah, while addressing a rally in Jharkhand, slammed meek response to terror from across the border during Congress-led UPA era, and remorsefully recalled beheading of soldier Hemraj over which the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh "did not even say ohh!""But, now every bullet (fired from across the border) is responded with a bomb," Shah said.He also took potshots at Rahul Gandhi saying he is no match for PM Modi, who works 18 hours a day without taking a leave, whereas Rahul Gandhi takes a break from work every two months leaving even his mother clueless about his whereabouts.Hitting out at PM Modi for his strident criticism of the Congress, Rahul Gandhi said in the last 70 years, the "foolishness of demonetisation and Gabbar Singh Tax" was not done by anybody but PM Modi.Addressing an election meeting in Unchahar in Rabeareli, he said, "Chowkidar (watchman) has done 'chori' (theft) of factories and employment of people of Raebareli and Amethi (the Lok Sabha seat represented by the Congress chief)." Rahul Gandhi also accused Modi of not wanting to fill 22 lakh vacant posts in the government.West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee came down heavily on BJP, calling it "the greatest danger for the country like 440 volts" and asked people to prevent it from returning to power.Addressing a poll rally at Pandua in Hooghly district, Mamata Banerjee claimed that the Modi government had in the last five years failed completely to deliver for the people's welfare and the country's future.Congress general secretary and in-charge for east Uttar Pradesh, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the BJP has forgotten the people after coming to power. "The BJP governments at the Centre and in the state have forgotten the fact that who has given them power. When someone gets power, he forgets who has given him power. BJP has also forgotten those who have given them power," she said.Accusing the Modi government of halting construction of food park in Amethi - the constituency of her brother and party chief Rahul Gandhi, she asked people to question its "policy and intentions" when they vote.Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav gave a political twist to the "Avengers: Endgame" mania with a post: "Over the last five years, the BJP has destroyed every pillar of democracy. But the #Endgame has begun. #MahaGathbandhan Sarkar ... Coming soon".He also tweeted an image of the words "Mahagathbandhan Sarkar" against a blue background in the style used by Marvel Studios.BSP president Mayawati said people of the country do not want an "anti-poor" Narendra Modi government to return to power. "BJP's claims and promises - only 'hawa hawai'.Their announcements - for hoodwinking people, BJP's statistics - white lies, BJP governments - head of lies and dramatics," Mayawati said. Mayawati wondered why the problems of poverty, unemployment and backwardness of UP did not change even with the Centre and the state being ruled by the BJP.
