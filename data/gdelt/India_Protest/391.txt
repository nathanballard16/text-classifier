Dwarka Expressway homebuyers to go on indefinite hunger strike

Seek completion of facility, shifting of Kherki Daula toll plaza

Around a dozen DXP Welfare Association members have decided to go on an indefinite hunger strike from Thursday seeking immediate completion of the much-delayed Dwarka Expressway and the shifting of the Kherki Daula toll plaza.

In a press statement, DXP Welfare Association president Yashesh Yadav said, “We are only getting statements from Ministers on paper but there is no progress on ground, therefore, the association will sit on an indefinite hunger strike till we get assurance from senior government officials. We are fighting for two issues for the last few years. We are ready to sacrifice our lives so that the government understands the pain of the homebuyers on the Dwarka Expressway stretch.”

DXP Welfare Association, a group of homebuyers, who have stake in residential areas on the stretch said that they had raised their voices in a peaceful manner many a times but no concrete results were seen.

‘False promises’

The association’s general secretary Pradip Rahi said, “It is really sad that homebuyers, who had spent their lifetime earnings to buy dream homes across the Dwarka Expressway, now needed to sit on hunger strike. The residents had lost faith in the system after numerous false commitments from the Delhi and the Central governments. We had many expectations from the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party governments, but nothing much happened on the Dwarka Expressway and Kherki Dhaula toll plaza issues.”

He said the association wanted to send out a message to the governments that residents were ready to sacrifice their lives if issues were not resolved immediately.

New Gurugram resident Lokesh Yadav said, “Now, the CM grievance cell is also not accepting the application on these issues. This shows that neither the Central nor the State government is bothered to resolve the issues”.
