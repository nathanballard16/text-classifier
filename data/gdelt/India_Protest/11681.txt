Titu Bania detained for protesting against Pb speaker

Ludhiana: Titu Bania alias Jai Parkash Jain, recently contested MP elections from Ludhiana, was detained by Chandigarh police on Friday.

He was detained before he could reach the Vidhan Sabha to protest against the Punjab speaker, Rana K P Singh, and Mullanpur MLA H S Phoolka, who recently resigned.

Titu, along with four other residents of Mullanpur, were marching towards the Vidhan Sabha from Sector 10. They blew toy trumpets and tied flex hoardings around their neck with slogans against the Vidhan Sabha speaker and H S Phoolka.

Their plans to reach the Vidhan Sabha were foiled when Chandigarh police reached the spot and took all the protesters to a nearby police station.

Though, Titu and his associates tried their best to convince the police officials of not creating any law and order problem and should be allowed to go till the assembly, but the police did not budge in from their stand and released them after the session was over.

Titu said the police was already aware of his arrival in Chandigarh and this action clearly showed that the politicians were scared of common man.
