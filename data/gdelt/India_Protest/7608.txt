Whatsapp also warned that some features of the app may stop working at any time before the service is totally pulled off on Microsoft powered devices.

"You'll no longer be able to use all Windows Phone operating systems after December 31, 2019," they wrote.

"Because we no longer actively develop for these operating systems, some features might stop functioning at any time,” the company said.

The decision to shut down services on all window enabled mobile devices is coming after Microsoft announced in 2017, seven years after it launched its mobile operating system, that its work on Windows 10 mobile is almost coming to an end.

Meanwhile, Legit.ng previously reported that WhatsApp said it is set to put a strict measure to message shared across the messaging platform by users of the app in its effort to put a stop to fake news.

Speaking about the development at an event in Jakarta on Monday, January 21, the company’s vice-president for policy and communications, Victoria Grand, announced that with the new policy, users will be blocked from forwarding messages to more than five individuals or groups.

Legit.ng also gathered that a larger limit of 20 recipients was put in place globally before it was reduced to five-recipient limit in places like India last July 2018 due to excessive spreading of misleading information.
