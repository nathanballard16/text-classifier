ISLAMABAD, Sept 18 — Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said today that his government would try to revive Afghanistan peace talks that recently broke down between the United States and the Taliban militant group.

“I assure you that we will use full force so that these dialogues proceed further. It is unfortunate that these peace talks were suspended,” Khan said at a ceremony at Pakistan’s Torkham border crossing with Afghanistan.

“We will try our best to revive the Afghan peace process.”

US President Donald Trump abruptly cancelled secret talks with the Taliban at his Camp David retreat that were planned for September 8 and has since said the talks are “dead.”

Khan is scheduled to address the United Nations General Assembly this month.

Khan also said there was “no chance of talks” with India about its clampdown on the disputed territory of Kashmir until it lifted a curfew for people there. — Reuters
