HYDERABAD, July 5 (UNI, PTI)—Police fired four rounds in the air to disperse a violent mob of agitators which set fire to a Government office in the Khairabad area here this evening. Earlier, the police lathi-charged and tear-gassed the mob, which was erecting barricades with telephone poles and tying wires across the road. They mobilised a number of municipal garbage bins and barricaded one entrance of the road. The agitators also manhandled some passers-by whom they suspected to be opposed to their cause. No one was injured in the police firing. Shortly after 3 p.m. a large number of Telengana agitators gathered at Khairatabad railway station and refused to move out despite repeated police warnings. The agitators started stoning the police and a “pitched” battle ensued.

The police made several lathi-charges and finding them ineffective fired tear-gas shells. The crowds then withdrew into lanes and by-lanes but merged again in greater strength opposite the railway station. The police made a lathi-charge and followed the agitators into the lanes and by-lanes and burst tear-gas shells.
