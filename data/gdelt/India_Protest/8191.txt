Orissa HC running with half of sanctioned strength

Cuttack: With 13 judges working against its sanctioned strength of 27, the Orissa high court has nearly 52% judicial vacancy. The judges’ strength came down to 13 with the retirement of Justice JP Das on May 18.The huge backlog of cases in the high court is attributed to the absence of sanctioned judges for years owing to delay in appointment. The number of pending cases was 1,50,498 as on May 20 .The last appointment of a judge in the Orissa high court was done in November last year. In fact, Justice Akshaya Kumar Mishra, whose name was cleared by the Centre on November 17, was the sole candidate to have been found suitable by the Supreme Court collegium of the 12 names recommended by the Orissa high court collegium. The 12 candidates recommended by the Orissa HC collegium included four judicial officers and eight advocates.On October 31 last year, the Supreme Court collegium had declined the names of 11 candidates while recommending the name of Mishra, who was a judicial officer. He was sworn in on November 19.The HC collegium was expected to recommend the names of 12 candidates — four judicial officers and eight advocates — by May this year.However, the collegium has been embroiled in a controversy with the High Court Bar Association taking the agitation path over the recommendation of names.On May 17, the last working day before summer vacation, members of the association had worn black badges to court to show their “protest against the Chief Justice and the judges of the two collegiums for recommending the names of lawyers who are not regular practitioners of the high court for appointment as judges of the court”.The association has passed a resolution to resume the agitation by way of “remaining absent from the Courts of Chief Justice and the other two collegiums’ judges when the court reopens after summer vacation on June 17”.The collegium constitutes of Chief Justice KS Jhaveri and two the next seniormost judges – Justice Sanju Panda and Justice SK Mishra
