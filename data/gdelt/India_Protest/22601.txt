Bollywood: CAA protests: Violence against peaceful protesters is 'wrong' says Priyanka Chopra

Priyanka Chopra was the latest celebrity to react to the violence against students for protesting against the Indian government's Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The 37-year-old actor spoke out against the police crackdown on the students of Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University, saying in a thriving democracy, violence against peaceful protesters is "wrong".

The police entered the Jamia Millia campus after the protest against the citizenship law by the students turned violent.

"Education for every child is our dream. Education is what empowered them to think independently. We have raised them to have a voice," Priyanka Chopra said.

"In a thriving democracy, to raise one's voice peacefully and be met with violence is wrong. Every voice counts. And each voice will work towards changing India. #Havevoicewillraise #Havevoicemustraise" she said in a statement posted on Twitter.

Numerous Bollywood personalities including actors Hrithik Roshan, Farhan Akhtar, Siddharth Malhotra, Parineeti Chopra, popular screenwriter Javed Akhtar, noted filmmakers Anurag Kashyap and Vishal Bhardwaj as well as Hollywood star John Cusack have expressed solidarity with the youth over the police crackdown inside the campuses.
