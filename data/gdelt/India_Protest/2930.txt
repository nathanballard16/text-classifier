Ranchi, Feb 12: Jharkhand government has banned Popular Front of India (PFI) in the state under Section 16 of The Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908.

The Popular Front of India is an extremist and militant Islamic fundamentalist organisation in India formed as a successor to National Development Front (NDF) in 2006.

It acquired a multi-state dimension by merging with the National Development Front, Manitha Neethi Pasarai, Karnataka Forum for Dignity and other organisations. It is portrayed as a neo-social movement committed to empower people to ensure justice, freedom and security. The organisation has various wings to cater to different section of society, including the National Women's Front and the Campus Front of India.

In February of 2018, Raghubar Das' government had declared PFI as unlwaful and banned the outfit. But a few months later, the Jharkhand HC revoked state government's decision to ban the PFI. The court slammed the state government of not going ahead with the norms and revoked its February decision to ban the outfit.
