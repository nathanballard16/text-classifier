HAL Workers strike: Talks fail, HAL workers’ union to go ahead with indefinite strike on Monday

BENGALURU: The production at the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) might come to a standstill from Monday as the management failed to strike a deal with the miffed employees, who have been demanding a “fair and reasonable” wage hike since September 30. While the workers’ union are sticking to their plan to hold indefinite protest from October 14, the HAL management has maintained that it would make all-out efforts to avert the strike."The union appeals all the workmen of all the divisions to fully participate in the indefinite strike and make it historical success. All the workmen in all the HAL divisions will be commencing their indefinite strike from October 14," the All India HAL Trade Unions' Coordination Committee said, pointing out that the management refused to consider the fair and reasonable demands of the unions in regard to wage revision.The indefinite protest has been backed by all the recognised 9 unions, spread over different states.In the meanwhile, HAL management has commenced conciliation proceedings at all locations, asking the unions to desist from agitation and come to an amicable solution. “Despite Management’s concerted efforts towards bringing an amicable and early wage settlement, unions, unfortunately, have adopted a recalcitrant approach and did not accept the offer and decided to resort to indefinite Strike, in spite of management’s appeal not to resort to an indefinite Strike and resolve the issue in a spirit of accommodation."
