Yeddy's men get nod: Major takeaways from BJP’s Karnataka list for Lok Sabha 2019

1/4

Three Congress rebels who switched their colours have been given tickets. Umesh Jadhav, who was a minister in the JD(S)-Congress state government has been given the Gulbarga (SC) seat where he will take on Mallikarjun Kharge, Congress’ senior-most leader holding a post, who is currently the party’s leader in Lok Sabha.

Two other new entrants from the Congress A Manju, a former MLA, and his party colleague Devendrappa, both of whom joined the BJP recently, have been rewarded with tickets to contest from Hassan and Bellary, respectively.

The BJP had yielded Ballari seat to Congress in the November bypolls.

Jadhav, a former Minister, joined the BJP at a party rally in Kalaburagi on March 6, two days after he quit the Karnataka Assembly membership, at a rally addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Jadhav, who was sulking after being dropped as minister, had on March 4 submitted his resignation from the Assembly to Speaker Ramesh Kumar.

However, Jadhav's resignation as MLA has not yet been accepted by the Speaker, who is also yet to decide on the disqualification petitions filed by the Congress, against him.

Manju, joined BJP on Sunday, unhappy with Congress' decision to cede Hassan seat to its coalition partner JD(S).

He is likely to fight against former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda's grandson Prajwal Revanna. Gowda is the sitting MP from Hassan.

Manju was earlier with BJP before joining the Congress and becoming Minister in the previous Siddaramaiah led government and again returning back to the saffron party.
