Pakistan stands isolated on world stage post Balakot air strike: BJP leader

MANGALURU: Pakistan stands isolated on the world stage ‘post-surgical strike 2’. A few leaders of ‘Mahaghatbandhan’ and intellectuals in India are the only ray of hope for the neighbouring nation, noted Kota Srinivas Poojary, leader of the opposition in state legislative council. On the other hand, India’s action in levelling terror camps at Balakot has received global backing from the superpowers on its right to defend territorial sovereignty, he said.Addressing media on Monday, Poojary said the clamour from disparate voices seeking proof of air strike on Balakot notwithstanding an audio tape admission by Maulana Ammar, brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar that air strikes had taken toll of a training centre for jihadis, is misplaced. The political parties seeking proof for the strikes are seeking to politicise the bravery and valour of our armed forces who strike at the enemy, he said.In the same vein, reported a statement of CM H D Kumaraswamy decrying street celebrations following the Balakot air strikes in that it would hurt sentiments of a particular community is also sad, he said. “I can’t believe this statement has come from him,” Poojary said, adding this (statement) is now a sad reality. The CM must take back his words, Poojary demanded, noting that using caste and religious equations for the armed forces is wrong.On PM Krishi Samman Nidhi Yojana, he slammed the tepid reaction of the state government in receiving applications from farmer beneficiaries in Karnataka. Against 76-lakh-odd farmer beneficiaries, the state government thus far has received only 16-lakh beneficiaries, he said, adding government must extend the facility to obtain applications to the grassroots level. If the government fails to do so, BJP reserves the right to launch an agitation, he said.Slamming election eve announcement of the formation of new taluks in Karnataka, Poojary said the state government is yet to provide facilities and transfer government offices to taluks already formed by the previous government. Claiming a mood favouring the BJP-led NDA government in the centre, Poojary advised the Congress to get their doubts regarding EVMs cleared now rather than crib over it once the general elections are over.
