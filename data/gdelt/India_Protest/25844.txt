Silent Protest March against CAA, NRC in Navi Mumbai

Political parties, social organizations and religious groups from Navi Mumbai were at Shivaji chowk on Tuesday to protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC). A silent March was taken out from Vashi Station to Shivaji Chowk to protest against the CAA and NRC .

Many children participated in the protest, dressed as Sikh, Hindu, Muslim and Christian. The aim, said the organisers, was to show that there is unity among all the religions.

Rajeev Mishra, one of the organizer said, “The present government instead of giving attention to various important issues like unemployment, economic slowdown, declining gross domestic product (GDP) and many other developmental issues, is distracting people with Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens(NRC). The government can’t divide the people on the basis of religions.”

“Our main question to government is what will happen to those people who have been a part of the country, but do not have the requisite documents? Where will they go? The government should answer these queries as it has created a fear among the residents,” Cynthia Ghodke, General Secretary, Navi Mumbai Congress said.

The attendees protested by putting up black ribbons on their mouth as it was a silent protest and many participants also tied the black ribbons on their hands.
