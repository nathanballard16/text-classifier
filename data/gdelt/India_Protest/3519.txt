Puducherry CM suspends agitation

Holds marathon meeting with Kiran Bedi

After a six-day political stand-off that put the national spotlight on Puducherry, Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy late on Monday night announced that he has “temporarily suspended” his agitation.

Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi took to Twitter to announce that the Chief Minister has called off his agitation.

Earlier, Mr. Narayanasamy and his Cabinet colleagues held deliberations with Ms. Bedi on 39 contentious issues which the former raised in his letter to the Lieutenant Governor on February 7.

Accepting the invitation for talks from Ms. Bedi, the Chief Minister and Ministers took a break from the agitation in front of Raj Nivas. They went inside at 5 p.m. and the meeting lasted close to six hours.

Without any conditions

After Ms. Bedi refused to accept the condition of holding the meeting at the Chief Secretariat and keeping her Officer on Special Duty away, the Chief Minister wrote a letter on Sunday night expressing his desire to have deliberations without any conditions.

Earlier in the day, the Chief Minister told reporters that he had agreed for the meeting without conditions so that “people’s issues” are solved at the earliest.

He said senior Congress leaders met Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi and complained about Ms. Bedi’s style of functioning. Mr. Singh told them that he would look into it.

As part of parallel protests launched by the Congress, the DMK, the VCK, the Left parties and others, letters were sent to the President, Prime Minister and Home Minister seeking Ms. Bedi's recall.
