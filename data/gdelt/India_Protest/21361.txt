PM Modi Needs to Explain Police Brutality on Students, Opposition Party Leader Priyanka Gandhi Says

Priyanka Gandhi, a politician of India’s main opposition party Congress, on Monday staged a sit-in in India’s capital city against the use of force against Jamia university students when they were protesting against the citizenship law. She demanded that Prime Minister Narendra Modi explain the police action.

Gandhi termed the act as an “attack on the soul of the nation”.

She was soon joined by other Congress politicians of the city at the India Gate, where she protested for two hours.
