Police arrested three persons, all history sheeters, from Karelibaug in Vadodara on Thursday for allegedly attacking policemen to evade arrests. According to police, a team of police personnel had reached Kasmayala area of Karelibaug late Wednesday night to arrest 29-year-old Hussain Sunni, who is a wanted criminal in cases of loot, prohibition and gambling. However, when the police reached the locality, Hussain along with his brothers — Sikander Sunni (22) and Akbar Sunni — and their uncle Salim Sunni (47) began pelting stones at the officials to evade arrest.

In the commotion that ensued, Hussain scratched a police sub-inspector’s face with his nails and bit his hand. Two other constables accompanying the sub-inspector were also injured in the stone pelting. While the police arrested Hussain, Sikander and Salim, Akbar managed to flee.
