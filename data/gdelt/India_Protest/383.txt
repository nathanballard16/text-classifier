Naidu explores options on Jagan attack case probe

Approaching HC being considered

Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu has explored the options before the State government in the wake of the Central government asking the National Investigation Agency (NIA) to probe the alleged attack on YSR Congress president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy at the Visakhapatnam airport in October.

Mr. Naidu asked legal experts whether the Centre was empowered to direct the NIA to take up probe while the matter was pending with court. And also if the Law and Order was a State subject.

The options before the government include registering protest, writing a letter to the Central government and knock the doors of the court.

There were reports in a section of the media that the State government would write a letter to the Centre stressing that there was no need for an investigation by the NIA. But sources close to Mr. Naidu say the government is yet to take a decision.

The option of filing a petition in the High Court is also being considered actively.

The Centre had issued an order on December 31, 2018, handing over the investigation to the NIA which registered an FIR on January 1.

After the attack, the State government constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT) on the attack and murder conspiracy of the Opposition leader. Mr. Jagan, however, pleaded that the investigation be handed over to a Central agency as he had no faith in the State agencies.

Mr. Jagan was injured in the attack while he was on his way to Hyderabad.

The accused used a knife generally used in rooster fights.

The YSRCP leader, who sustained a bleeding cut on his left upper arm, continued his journey and got admitted to a hospital in Hyderabad.
