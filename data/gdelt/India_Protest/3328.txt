Tajashree Honda found ‘looting’ customers in the name of ‘servicing’

The customer suspected tampering with the vehicle’s parts by the servicing centre for ‘robbing’ the customers in the name of installing new parts. After facing so many problems, the customer again went to Tajashree Honda Showroom’s Servicing Centre at 12 noon on February 16 and apprised about the problems he faced. The fact of the matter is that a customer had purchased an Activa 125 moped from Tajashree Honda Showroom in Deonagar two years back. But when the customer again went for servicing of his Activa on February 14, the showroom had promised to return his vehicle in the evening after servicing. Nagpur: The tainted Tajashree Group, after grabbing headlines for one shabby controversy or another including Wasankar investment scam and automobile frauds, has now found duping automobile customers in the name of servicing.
