Retired CRPF troops march in New Delhi for pensions

NEW DELHI: Hundreds of retired paramilitary troops from across the country on Sunday held a protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar to demand One Rank One Pension (OROP) for all servicemen that will provide the same pension for the same rank, for the same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement.

The protest comes just weeks after 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers were killed in a suicide attack on a convoy in Pulwama on February 14. "If an Army man dies, his family gets his salary till the time he would have ideally served and his full pension also after that. But the family of a CRPF soldier who loses his life doesn't get that," 65-year-old Mohammad Sher of Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch, who served as a constable in the CRPF for 26 years, told NDTV.
