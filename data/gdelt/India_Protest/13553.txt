In A Move To Protect Trees, Uttar Pradesh To Give ‘Heritage’ Status To Trees Over 100 Years Old

While in Mumbai, people are on roads braving rains, protesting the order to cut down 2,700 trees in Aarey Forest for a metro project, the Uttar Pradesh government had decided to give “heritage” status trees that are over 100 years old.

The Principal Chief Conservator of forests (PCCF), Pawan Kumar, has directed the state's Forest Department to collaborate with gram sabhas to classify such trees in their respective village areas and ensure their conservation.

Once the identification of such trees is done, a display board will be put up near each tree giving details about its age, species and how it is beneficial to both man and animal.

The PCCF told IANS: "I have submitted guidelines on this project to the government and the approval will come in a week's time. Thereafter, all the DFO's will be officially informed to start working on this project."

"Approximately 60,000 trees will be identified in phase one of this project, which will be led by the biodiversity management committee. Directions will be sent to railways, cantonment boards and government residential colonies to share information about heritage trees in the area under their jurisdiction and allow the committee to start efforts for their conservation," he added.

"The government's move to identify and protect old trees is deep-rooted in our tradition of worshipping certain trees and groves," said Ramesh Pandey, Chief Conservator of Forest and Secretary, Uttar Pradesh Biodiversity Board.

He added that most trees that are more than a century old, are often from the Ficus family such as banyan and pipal, also known as the sacred fig.

Pandey added that a few century-old trees have already been identified.
