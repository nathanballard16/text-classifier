Pune man jumps from fifth floor of Mantralaya, lands in safety net

The State Secretariat witnessed high drama when a man jumped from the fifth floor on Monday afternoon, but landed in the safety net installed on the first floor.

The Mantralaya police claimed the man did not jump but had climbed onto the net in protest against the ‘anti-farmer’ policies of the government.

Eyewitnesses said he also demanded the State have a woman Chief Minister.

The 40-year-old man Laxman Chavan is a resident of Pune, who had come to Mumbai on Sunday. While he kept swinging on the net, a forest department official Rajesh Namdas jumped to save Mr. Chavan.

“I attempted to reach him but it was difficult on the net, which was just swinging in all directions from his weight,” he said.

For a few minutes before the Fire Brigade could rescue him, Mr. Chavan displayed two banners and kept raising slogans.

Shivaji Phadtare, senior inspector, Marine Drive police station, said Mr. Chavan’s statement is being recorded and further action will follow. This is not the first time an incident like this has taken place at Mantralaya. Following a slew of suicide attempts last year, the government had installed the safety net on the first floor.
