The Beauty of Humble Materials: Studio Mumbai at Maniera Gallery in Brussels

Indian architectural practice Studio Mumbai has forged a reputation for celebrating humble materials and astutely combining tradition and modernity in a body of work that draws from both Indian and Western cultures. For their second show at Maniera Gallery in Brussels, which opens on May 18th and runs until August 24, 2019, the practice has developed an eclectic collection of hand-made furniture and objects that was born as a result of researching materials not usually associated with the production of homeware.

Founded by Bijoy Jain in 2005, the Studio is a Mumbai-based practice consisting of architects, engineers, carpenters and masons who have all been trained in traditional techniques. Working collectively, the team pays enormous attention to detail with each project, large or small, instigating an explorative creative process where material, form and function are given equal importance. The Studio’s hands-on approach, which includes studying materials in depth and using scale models rather than plans as well as large-scale mock-ups, means that designing a furniture collection is not all that different from their architectural projects.
