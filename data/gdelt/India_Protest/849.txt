Youth Congress Workers Disrupt Accidental Prime Minister’s Screening In Kolkata Theatre

Screening of The Accidental Prime Minister starring Anupam Kher was cancelled at a cinema hall in Kolkata, on Friday (11 January), after Youth Congress workers caused disruption protesting outside the theatre.

About 50 workers from the Youth Congress starting shouting slogans and protesting outside Hind Cinema Hall in Kolkata. The police reached the spot and cleared the protesters from the area.

Deccan Herald quoted an official from Hind Cinema as saying, “We have cancelled the screening for the noon show due to law and order situation. We are yet to take a call on the other shows.”

A person who had been at the hall to watch the movie said, “The protesters were promptly removed by police. I can’t understand what kind of security threat the hall authorities were talking about.” All the movie goers were reportedly refunded post the cancellation.

A Congress leader was quoted by the report as saying that they are willing to hold protests at every cinema hall where the movie is being screened. They accuse it of being a propaganda showing distorted facts.
