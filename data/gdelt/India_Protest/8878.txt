DNA Edit: Hold your horses – Mamata is chief minister, not a professional agitator

West Bengal’s feisty Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee needs to get her act together. Her job as head of the state government is to restore peace and order and not ignite fire with the help of her Trinamool Congress cadres. Sadly, Mamata is still to come out of the poll campaign mode and the huge losses that she has suffered at the hands of the BJP. Since the poll results, West Bengal is in a state of disarray. The latest provocation is the death of two BJP supporters in a clash with Trinamool workers. After being stopped by the police, the BJP has opted for large scale protests and is observing Black Day across the state. It also has plans to hold a protest at the police headquarters on June 12. Clearly, the Centre is worried.

The state governor was summoned to Delhi, where he has held discussions with the PM and the Union Home Minister. The Centre has sent an advisory to the state asking it to keep a firm grip on the law and order situation. The home ministry also asked for a report on the violence, directing that action be taken in case of police laxity. In response, the state said there were only a few “stray post-poll clashes” and the situation was “under control”. As can be expected, TMC has accused the Centre of conspiring against the Mamata Banerjee government, drawing parallels with UP and Gujarat. Some leaders have dared the government to impose President’s Rule in the state. The constitutional position is very clear: the chief minister cannot be on a collision course with the PM, as it appears at the moment.
