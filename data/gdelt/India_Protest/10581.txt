Mumbai/Bengaluru: High profile drama was witnessed in Mumbai and Bengaluru on Wednesday as the political crisis in Karnataka continued, with two more Congress MLAs tendering their resignations and the Mumbai Police detaining Congress leader DK Shivakumar outside the Powai hotel where the rebel MLAs have been lodged.

Housing minister MTB Nagaraj and K Sudhakar gave their resignation letters to Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar, taking the total number of the rebel MLAs to 16.

With the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) coalition government in Karnataka is in crisis following the resignations of 16 legislators, senior Congress leader and state minister DK Shivakumar landed in Mumbai to convince the disgruntled MLAs to come back to the fold.

Earlier in the day, 10 rebel MLAs had written to Mumbai Police chief Sanjay Barve claiming that they did not want to meet their party leaders and that they felt threatened as they had heard that Shivakumar was planning to storm the hotel.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka Cabinet meeting will be held at Vidhan Soudha in Bengaluru on Thursday (July 11), news agency ANI reported.
