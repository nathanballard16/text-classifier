In Uttar Pradesh of India, at least 11 persons have been killed in clashes with the police during protests over Citizenship Amendment Bill for last three days, reports Indian Express.

Police said that over 600 people were taken into custody as part of “preventive action”.

Meanwhile, as protests against the citizenship law swelled nationwide and there was a pushback from state governments and even its allies, the ruling BJP was heard climbing down on the plan for a pan-India National Register for Citizens.

In a crackdown against protesters in India's capital Delhi, police on Saturday arrested 15 persons in connection with Friday’s Darya Ganj violence where a police vehicle set ablaze and detained five others in connection with the clashes that took place in East Delhi’s Seemapuri area.

At least 45 people, including 13 police officers, were injured as Walled City protests in the national capital that had largely remained peaceful, turned violent on Friday evening.

A constable’s car parked outside Darya Ganj police station was set on fire, and as stone pelting started, police used lathi charge and a water cannon to disperse the crowd at Delhi Gate.
