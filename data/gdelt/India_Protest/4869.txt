Traders’ body calls for boycott of Chinese goods

Traders’ union Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) on Thursday decided to launch a national campaign to boycott Chinese goods in the country.

The move comes after China, for the fourth time, blocked a bid in the UNSC to designate Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as a “global terrorist” by putting a technical hold on the proposal. CAIT Secretary General Praveen Khandelwal said that now the time has come when China should suffer due to its proximity to Pakistan. In its statement, the CAIT said that it would call on traders not to sell or buy Chinese goods and will also “make consumers aware not to purchase them.” The traders’ body also demanded that the government levy a custom duty of 300% to 500% on the import of Chinese goods to discourage them.
