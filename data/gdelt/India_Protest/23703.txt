GUWAHATI/ DIBRUGARH : Responding to a call given by the All Assam Students’ Union (Aasu) and 30 other indigenous organisations, thousands of women took to the streets of Guwahati on Saturday to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). This was part of a series of protest demonstrations held by women across several districts of Assam on Saturday, with various women’s organisations as well as women leaders, educationists and college girls taking part.Hundreds of housewives and elderly women demanded the Centre to repeal the CAA unconditionally to secure the future of the indigenous communities of the state. Holding placards and shouting anti-CAA slogans, the women groups said the CAA was an ‘unconstitutional’ and ‘communal’ law. The protesting women marched from various parts of the city to meet at the Latasil Playground.“Participation of women is the key to the success of any movement in the world. The women of this state had contributed immensely towards the success of the Assam Agitation. This relentless, non-violent and disciplined movement will continue till the CAA is scrapped,” said Aasu.On Monday, men and women from all walks of life will come together to stage a sit-in demonstration across the state against CAA.
