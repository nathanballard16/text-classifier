Mamata tried to obstruct Jhargram rally, alleges BJP

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], Jan 23 (ANI): The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has alleged that the West Bengal government tried to obstruct the party chief Amit Shah's rally in Jhargram amid reports that Shah's chopper was not allowed to land in the district.

"Mamata Banerjee has again tried to obstruct Amit Shah's rally in Jhargram," said BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya.

Shah was scheduled to address a rally in Jhargram on Wednesday. Owing to inadequate permission, he reportedly returned to Delhi last night.

Jhargram district observer Tushar K Ghosh said the BJP had sought permission for helicopter landing, but permission was not granted to the party.

"We had sought permission from DM for holding a rally and helicopter landing but till last night we had not got the permission. Today, we have got permission only for the rally," he said.

The West Bengal government had earlier denied permission for the BJP president's chopper to land in Malda district -- where he eventually held a rally on Tuesday.

In its defence, the Malda district administration had stated that it was not possible to grant permission to land VVIP helicopters that week owing to construction work.

While BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad claimed that the site at which Shah was to land in Malda was used by Mamata, the West Bengal chief minister said she too had to change her landing location on the request of the state police. (ANI)
