Amarinder Singh hits out at PM Narendra Modi over nationalism

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh attacked Narendra Modi over his nationalism narrative, wondering how could the prime minister "boast about" this when he and the BJP were "hell bent" upon "dividing the country on religious lines".

"He (Modi) is raising the issue of nationalism. How could you brag about it when you are trying to divide the country on religious and caste lines and destroy its strength of secularism and diversity," Amarinder Singh said.
