CPI stages protest against shortage of sand

Ban has rendered many labourers jobless, party says

The Communist Party of India, along with the Krishna District Building Workers’ Union, stage a protest against the shortage of sand available to the workers in the city.

The workers and the party members highlighted the shortage that was created due to the government’s decision to ban sand mining for 15 days throughout the State.

Donepudi Sankar, Secretary, CPI, Vijayawada, said the shortage of the sand as a consequence of the ban had rendered many daily wage labourers unemployed.

“The labourers have not been able to obtain jobs elsewhere due to the ban. Besides, the recent floods in the city have submerged the houses of most of these workers, further burdening them with their sustenance. The government should immediately act upon the issue,” he added.

There are 73 sand reaches in the district that cannot be touched due to the ban. The union said that over two lakh labourers engaged in sand mining had been severely affected by the ban as they were unable to seek jobs elsewhere. Moreover, the recent inundation has further added to their grief. They demanded that the State government resume the mining operations in these sand quarries under the supervision of the Mining Department.
