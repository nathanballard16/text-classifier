2000 street vendors protest at Civic Centre

New Delhi: Around 2,000 street vendors took to the street on Monday at the Civic Centre to protest against the atrocities of the Municipalities in Delhi. The vendors have been waiting to secure a meeting with the Municipal Authorities to discuss their issues with regard to the implementation of the Street Vendors Act, 2014. They also demand that the TVC must settle the cases referred by the Delhi High Court of the aggrieved vendors within a month. The North Delhi Municipal Commissioner, Varsha Joshi, refused to engage with the protesting vendors. The aggrieved vendors will hold a demonstration again on November 13 if no prompt action is taken by the authorities.
