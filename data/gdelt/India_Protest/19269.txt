Ruckus in Delhi Assembly, BJP's Gupta marshalled out

New Delhi, Dec 3 : The last day of the two-day Delhi Assembly session witnessed uproar on Tuesday after Speaker Ram Niwas Goel reprimanded the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislators for bringing women in the House to hold a protest and ordered removal of Leader of Opposition Vijender Gupta from the House.

According to security officials, around 25 women entered the Assembly premises to protest against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government for alleged supply of dirty water.

However, they were pushed out within minutes.

Expressing his sadness over the event, Goel said it is the "limit of hooliganism" as the "opposition is taking help of women to hold protest inside the Assembly".

"They brought 10-15 women in the House. I had agreed for a discussion. But I can't allow any hooliganism in the House. This was the last day of the session. I wanted a fruitful discussion. I condemn the act," Goel said.

While Goel expressed his sadness, the BJP legislators were demanding a discussion on surging onion prices.

Rebutting the Speaker's claim, Gupta said the BJP legislators went to "help and protect these women".

When the BJP continued its demand for a discussion on surging onion prices, Goel marshalled out Gupta, and other BJP MLAs walked out of the House.

The tenure of the AAP government will end in February 2020.
