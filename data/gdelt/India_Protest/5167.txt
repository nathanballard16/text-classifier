PM’s ‘chowkidar’ campaign meant to hide failures: Congress

Congress on Tuesday said PM Narendra Modi ’s “main bhi chowkidar” campaign was aimed at rebranding himself to take the national focus away from his previous claims and promises.Citing Modi’s claim of being a “chaiwala” and his promise on jobs, black money and development in 2014 election, AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “Modi baba and 40 thieves have added ‘ chowkidar ’ to their names to deceive the people of the country. To hide their failures, they are branding and re-branding their work.”He said PM Modi was ‘chowkidar’ (watchman) of thieves who allowed Vijay Mallya, Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and others to loot the banks and flee the country. “The chowkidar of thieves has stolen Rs 30,000 crore in Rafale deal, helped Jay Shah increase his income to Rs 80 crore, let Vijay Mallya escape, let Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi loot our banks,” Surjewala said.
