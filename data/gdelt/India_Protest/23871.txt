Police carried out their duty to protect the innocent: Yediyurappa on Mangaluru firing

BENGALURU: Seventy-two hours after the police opened firing in Mangaluru at an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) protest, chief minister B S Yediyurappa on Sunday said the police were only carrying out their duty by opening fire at the mob.Speaking to the media, Yediyurappa said the opposition was “misleading” the minorities over the police firing.“Police resorted to firing when the mob tried to storm the police station and loot the arms from bell of arms. When the mob tried to disturb peace and indulged in arson and looting could the police have kept quiet? Are police not duty bound to protect the innocents and property?” he said.Attacking his predecessor, former CM H D Kumaraswamy— who was in Mangaluru on Sunday charging the police of firing into an innocent crowd— Yediyurappa said the JD(S) functionary must remember the mob had defied the prohibitory orders by assembling unlawfully.“Kumaraswamy says mob had gathered to protest and not for war. But I ask, is the gathering against the prohibitory orders not a war against the constitution and law?” he retorted.The CM chided opposition leaders Siddaramaiah and Kumaraswamy of being quite when police fired on Mahadayi farmers and youngsters died at Mulki in Dakshina Kannada during their previous tenures.“I still recalled the 2014 statement of Siddaramaiah, on farmers committing suicide. He had said the farmers committed suicide by mistaking poison for liquor. This is the respect leaders showed for the farmers and people in general,” he said.Yediyurappa blamed the opposition of trying to whip up the emotions of the innocent minorities and that the CAA and NRC are national laws which will cause no harm to any Indian.The two persons died in police firing on December 19 in Mangaluru when thousands of protesters, defying the prohibitory orders, descended on the streets to protest against the CAA.At least 20 police personnel were injured in the violence.The dead were identified as Jaleel Bengre, 49, and Nauseen Kudroli, 23, who suffered bullet injuries when police personnel opened fire in “legitimate use of force” after a mob tried to set the Mangaluru North police station ablaze.
