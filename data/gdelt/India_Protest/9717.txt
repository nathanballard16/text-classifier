VADODARA: Protests against fee hike gained momentum at M S University campus when student leaders linked with the Nationalist Students Union of India ( NSUI ) burnt effigy of university officials at the main building of Faculty of Commerce here on Saturday.Raising slogans against university officials and demanding withdrawal of the fee hike, NSUI leaders threatened that if the university fail to roll back the fee hike, they will intensify the agitation.“If the university officials do not roll back the fee hike on June 29, we will resort to ‘chakka jams’ and if required we will call for university bandh,” said MSUSU general secretary Vraj Patel.“Without giving any justified reason, the university has increased over Rs 2,000 as fees in higher payment programme at Faculty of Commerce and over Rs 6,000 at Faculty of Social Work. Even as fees is being increased, students are not getting proper amenities and hence we are demanding a roll back,” he said.“Students who score less in HSc have no other option but to take admission in higher payment programme of bachelors of commerce where the fees has been hiked without proper justification,” said faculty general secretary Nitinsinh Barad.Earlier, NSUI linked student leaders had locked down the general education building of Faculty of Commerce at the time of on-the-spot admission process demanding that the university officials should personally visit the building to see the condition of classrooms and other infrastructure before introducing fee hike.A group of senators have also demanded withdrawal of fee hike decision and threatened to launch a mass agitation involving past and present students.
