CPI others protest against CAB

The CPI and various other organisations staged protests here on Friday against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.

CPI National Secretary K Naryanana, who took part in the protest here with former party MP Azeez Pasha, alleged that the BJP had brought in the anti constitutional bill as part of its 'Hindu agenda', a party press release said.

Various other outfits also staged protests, holding aloft placards that read "Save India, Withdraw CAB", "India is Home to All Religions", "India Needs Law & Order and not Citizenship Law", "CAB is Unconstitutional, Discriminatory and Regressive", among others.

The protestors also staged silent protests, wearing black bands against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill here.

According to the CAB, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, till December 31, 2014 facing religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

Both Houses of Parliament had passed the bill.
