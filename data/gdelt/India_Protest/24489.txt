War no solution to problems, says governor

LAHORE :Punjab Governor Ch Muhammad Sarwar has said that war is not a solution to problems; if India imposes war on us we will give India befitting response.

Firing on people along LoC by Indian army is aimed to divert world's attention from India's internal massive protests against newly-legislated Citizen Amendment Act.

The governor stated this while addressing the convocation of University of Central Punjab and later talking to media in Expo Centre here. Ch Sarwar said that Pakistan wanted to maintain close ties with neighbour countries and regional peace and stability was its priority but unfortunately India did not want regional stability and was continuously showing aggression and threatened peace in the region. After striping Kashmir special status and putting curfew in Held Kashmir India introduced a new citizenship amendment bill against Indian Muslims to extend Modi 'Hinduwta Agenda and marginalise Muslims of India. Today not only people in Kashmir but people in entire India are on roads against Modi’s policies. Defeat of BJP in five states of India within year is demonstration of Indian people’s hate for Modi. Nation is standing by our army who is securing our borders”, he added.
