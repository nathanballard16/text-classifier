Roughs worth Rs 8 crore sold in Panna mines auction

SURAT: Despite the ongoing recession in the diamond industry, small and medium diamantaires purchased Rs 7.50 crore worth of rough diamonds at the tender auction organised by the National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) at Surat International Diatrade Centre (SIDC) in Ichhapore jewellery park.At a time when the leading diamond mining companies including De Beers and Alrosa are struggling to sell their rough diamonds, the sale from Panna mines in Madhya Pradesh turned out to be big success.Babu Kathiriya, president of Surat Diamond Association (SDA) said, “The sale of rough diamonds from Panna mines was excellent. We had not expected such a response from the trade. This means that the market is slowly coming to normalcy.”In the recent times, a series of domestic and international factors such as trade war between US and China, protests in Hong Kong over anti-extradition bill protest, sharp fall in the polished diamond prices, banks squeezing finances to the diamond companies after multi-crore bank fraud by Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi, have hit the diamond sector hard.The purchase of rough diamonds by diamantaires in Surat and Mumbai between January-September-2019 has fallen to its lowest in the last 10 years. In the last six months, diamantaires have deferred purchase of roughs worth Rs 14,000 crore from mining giants Alrosa and De Beers.Industry sources said that diamantaires are sitting on polished diamond stockpiles of at least Rs70,000 crore, which is unbelievably high ever since the global economic meltdown hit the industry in 2009. Without clearing the inventory, the diamantaires won’t go for new purchases of rough diamonds to keep their factories running.A senior officer of NMDC asking anonymity said, “We had organised tender auction for two days and were able to sell 5,950 carats of rough diamonds in 110 packets worth Rs 7.50 crore. This is the highest sale achieved by us in the last few months.”
