Broken stairs in building bring back collapse fear in Shahberi

GREATER NOIDA: A year after a six-storey twin building collapsed in Greater Noida ’s Shahberi killing nine people, locals have raised an alarm over another under-construction building in Balaji Enclave that, according to them, may face a similar fate. The residents said the building has a broken staircase leading to the terrace.“Debris from the broken staircase came off on Saturday night and fell on the ground. This is extremely dangerous as this happened right after the first rain, similar to last year,” said Sachin Raghav, a resident of Shahberi.He added, “Even though buildings were sealed by GNIDA, there are a few such as APS Ashiyana, APS Ashiyana 2, APS heights and APS Gold Homes where construction continues despite the ban.While district magistrate BN Singh told TOI that no complaint of a building at risk in Shahberi was received by him on Sunday, he maintained “action will be taken if complaints come against errant builders/owners.”Earlier last month the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority (GNIDA) had dubbed all buildings in Shahberi area illegal with CEO Narendra Bhooshan maintaining that “eventually they have to be demolished." The Authority, however, is yet to decide whether people staying in these buildings would be relocated or those who have invested in projects in Shahberi compensated.This had led to around 500 residents staging a protest against the demolition move on June 10 and demanded maintenance of all civic infrastructures like road repair and sewage connection.On Sunday, some residents of Balaji Enclave staged a protest demanding ‘justice’.
