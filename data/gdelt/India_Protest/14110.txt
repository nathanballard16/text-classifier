Pak PM to lead Kashmir solidarity rally in PoK

Islamabad, Sep 11 : Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday announced holding of a Kashmir solidarity rally in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir's (PoK) capital Muzaffarabad on Friday.

"I am going to do a big jalsa in Muzzafarabad (sic) on Friday 13 Sept, to send a message to the world about the continuing siege of IOJK by Indian Occupation forces; and to show the Kashmiris that Pakistan stands resolutely with them," he said in a tweet.

The solidarity rally will come during Imran Khan's day-long official visit to Muzaffarabad on Friday.

After India scrapped ite Constitution's Articles 370 and 35A, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and divided the state into two union territories, Pakistan has been crying foul over India's move and continuously trying to highlight the issue on a global level.
