As members of JNU Students’ Union marched around CP’s Central Park, students from some institutes from across the country held demonstrations in response to the a call for a ‘national day of protest’.

The JNUSU had given out a call to students across institutes to participate in a ‘National Day of Protest in Defence of Affordable and Accessible Education’. “We realise that this movement is no longer restricted to JNU… While the central government proudly announces grand plans for the making of New India, it is the students of this country who will be the makers of a New India,” said the JNUSU in its appeal to students across the country.

This appeal was responded to by students from different institutions and associations, such as Presidency University in Kolkata, the All Assam Students’ Union in Dibrugarh, the Panjab University Students’ Union in Chandigarh, and Sikkim University in Gangtok.

Meanwhile, over 300 students gathered in the capital and marched around the Central Park. This was briefly disrupted by a group of around 10 people who raised slogans of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ and ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ in a counter-protest.
