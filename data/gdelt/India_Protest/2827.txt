Polls, and political optimism

Elections are here again! Political parties are holding parleys, trying to cobble ‘alternative alliances’; ‘huge rallies’ are being organised; and finally, regional satraps are bringing their battle to the capital.

Expect hectic activities this week. Monday, TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu is on a day’s fast in Delhi. Tuesday, several non-NDA party leaders will start landing. Wednesday, they will hold a rally against the Centre at Parliament Street. On Thursday, before dispersing the leaders are supposed to finalise their next agenda.

But Orissa’s Biju Janata Dal, Telangana Rashtra Samithi and Andhra Pradesh’ YSR Congress Party have stayed away from this ‘unity’.

The Left is also likely to skip, given Mamata Banerjee’s prominence. The Left Front recently held a huge rally in Kolkata where the slogan was “remove BJP, remove Trinamool Congress”. So they hold both in the same category – political opponent.

Top comrades want to remain and project ‘equidistance’ from BJP and Congress but look away when the Bengal unit enters an ‘informal’ seat arrangement with Congress.

In Kerala too, Left is fighting Congress, even as right-wing organisations are making inroads.

It’s now a question of survival for the red flag.

Among others, reports suggest Aam Admi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal isn’t averse to a tie-up to save his Delhi bastion, but the Congress is.

In this chaos, a senior leader of the CPI(M) opined: “all-party alliance against fascist forces” will happen post elections where he sees a chance of the Congress providing outside support unconditionally.

That indeed is political optimism!
