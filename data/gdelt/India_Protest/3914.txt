New Delhi: Two people reportedly died in Arunachal Pradesh’s capital Itanagar on Sunday amid the ongoing protests over the issue of Permanent Resident Certificate (PRC) to six communities in the state. As per reports, two persons succumbed to their injuries allegedly after police fired to control the protesters. The protests grew and spread through Itanagar despite state government’s assurance that the plan to give them PRC has been deferred.

“I would like to appeal to all those protesting that their demand had already been accepted by the government on 22nd itself. PRC issue is closed. I request them not to hold protests and dharna (sit-in) and cooperate with the government,” Arunachal Pradesh CM Pema Khandu said in a statement.

“On the night of 22 Feb, I had clarified through media and social media that the government won't hold further discussions over the matter. Today also, an order has been issued via Chief Secretary that we won't take up PRC matter,”

“I would like to assure the people in Arunachal Pradesh that government will not take up the matter even in future. This is a clear message,” CM Khandu added.

Angry protesters burned down the house of Arunachal Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein and ransacked the office of the deputy commissioner on Sunday to protest against permanent residence certificate (PRC) which grants permanent resident certificates to six communities, police said.

The mob also gathered at CM Khandu’s house later but they were dispersed by the Police. Home Minister Rajnath Singh told to CM Pema Khandu and Governor B D Mishra and necessary instructions have been given to the Army. The Ministry of Home Affairs is closely monitoring the situation.
