Visakhapatnam: Protesting against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy's decision to revoke Z+ security from former CM N Chandrababu Naidu, several Telugu Desam Party (TDP) workers, along with two MLAs, on Saturday took to roads in semi-naked condition demanding a reversal of the decision. The protesting leaders claimed that the TDP supremo is a target of Maoists and if anything happens to him, "the state will be burned".

While speaking to media, Vasupalli Ganesh Kumar and Velagapudumi Rama Krishna alleged that due to the removal of the Z+ security from him, Chandrababu Naidu was frisked at the airport like an ordinary citizen. He went to the airport without security and pilot vehicles, they said.

Kumar went on to add that Naidu has long been on the hit list of the Maoists due to his iron fist actions against them yet the ruling YSR Congress Party (YSRCP) government still decided to withdraw his security. He said that the government is taking revenge from Naidu and nothing else.

"He has served the state as Chief Minister for 14 years and remained under Z+ category security throughout. If anything happens to him, the state will be burned," he continued.

Chandrababu Naidu's TDP suffered a humiliating loss in the recently-held Assembly elections at the hands of Jagan Mohan Reddy-led YSRCP. The latter received an overwhelming majority (151 seats) in the 175-seat Assembly and formed the government in Andhra Pradesh. It was a similar picture in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well where the TDP could win just three seats while YSRCP reigned supreme with 22 seats.
