LUDHIANA: An emergency meeting of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association ( UCPMA ) was called on Monday evening against Punjab State Power Corporation Limited ( PSPCL ).At the meeting which was presided over by president of the association Inderjit Singh Navyug , office-bearers and members of UCPMA vented out their anger against PSPCL and Punjab government for rising rates of power. The association members have unanimously decided to stage a demonstration outside the office of PSPCL’s chief engineer on June 26 against the department and the government.Giving more information, Navyug said, “During the time of last assembly election chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh promised the industrialists that power will be supplied at Rs 5 per unit to the factories. But after coming into power day by day electricity rates are increasing and touching sky. On the other hand PSPCL officials are acting like dictators and whenever they want they are increasing the rates of the power without any reason or logic.”Navyug also added, “The main purpose of today’s meeting was to discuss our next course of action against the atrocities of PSPCL and government and we have decided to organise a protest outside the chief engineer's office on Wednesday June 26 at 11am. We request the presidents and office-bearers of all the business associations to join us in our fight against injustice. We also want to warn PSPCL to reduce the rates of power at the earliest, else our agitation will not remain limited to Ludhiana and we will protests outside all PSPCL offices in Punjab.”
