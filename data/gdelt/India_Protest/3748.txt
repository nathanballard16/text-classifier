Pulwama attack: Indian-American community protests outside Pakistan, Chinese consulate offices in US

A protest was organised by Indian-American community on Thursday outside the Pakistan and the Chinese Consulate offices in Chicago, US against the Pulwama attack.

The aim of the protest was to expose the barbaric nature of Pakistani terrorism, according to a flier by the Indian American Community Organisation.

The objective of the protest against Pakistan was for harbouring Jaish-e-Mohammed and allowing the terror outfit's chief Masood Azhar to operate freely.

The protest against China was for blocking attempts to declare Masood Azhar as a designated terrorist due to its alliance with Pakistan.

Further, around 58 nations condemned the Pulwama attack with the US mentioning Pakistan's name directly. In a White House statement, secretary of state Mike Pompeo and national security advisor John Bolton, called Pakistan to dismantle the terror infrastructure that exists in their country.

Even China condemned the Pulwama terror attack carried out by a Jaish suicide bomber but declined to back India's appeal to list the Pakistan-based terror group's chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN.
