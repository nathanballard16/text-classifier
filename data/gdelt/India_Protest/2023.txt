Uttar Pradesh farmers call off the protest

New Delhi: Hundreds of farmers gathered at DND flyway called off their protest on Saturday after the Uttar Pradesh government promised to look into their demands.

Farmer leader Manveer Singh Tevatiya said the protest was suspended for a week.

“Our demands about proper compensation have been pending for eight years. If the government does not resolve them in a week, we will resume our protest,” he told IANS.

On Friday, these farmers travelling in tractors had tried to enter the national capital via the DND flyway. However, they were stopped by police at the toll plaza, leading to a traffic jam for hours.
