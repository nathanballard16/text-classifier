Wild monkey brought to justice after going bananas in India, attacking 10 people and causing chaos

Officials reportedly took action, but not until concerned citizens got their attention by blocking a highway passing through the town and causing a “huge” traffic jam. The Times reports that the monkey was captured after a three-hour hunt. Authorities also were said to have addressed the town’s rabies vaccine inventory. The British news site Express posted video of angry protesters demanding action Wednesday.
