Mahul: 100 days of agitation

Residents, Medha Patkar mark day with silent candle march

As the protest demanding rehabilitation of Mahul residents entered its 100th day on Monday, residents led by social activist Medha Patkar held a silent candle march.

The march started from Vidyavihar and stopped at Mantralaya in south Mumbai where hundreds of people, including children, protested by covering their mouths with black ribbons.

“I am reminding the State government that 22 people have died within 100 days and they are solely responsible. We are covering our mouths to show we have no voice because the government has become deaf to people’s rights,” Ms. Patkar said.

A resident, Pooja Pandit, said, “We were promised we would be rehabilitated within 3 km of our previous homes but were dumped in Mahul, which doesn’t even have clean air for us to breathe.”

Before the march, the crowd protested through slogans and songs like Aye Malik tere bande hum, depicting the poor condition of the people in Mahul and seeking help from the government.

“Making tall buildings and offices will not serve the purpose of development. The government has to understand that Mahul has almost become a graveyard for people are on the verge of dying,” Ms. Patkar said.

In 2017, thousands living along the Tansa water pipeline were moved to the Mahul, an industrialised area with poor transport and other basic facilities. The Bombay High Court had ordered removal of slum settlements within 10 metre of the pipeline. Since then residents have been battling various ailments caused by the proximity of chemical companies to their houses and fires breaking out in these companies.
