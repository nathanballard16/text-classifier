Jitan Ram Manjhi Leads Anti-NDA 'Akrosh Rally' in Patna

Patna: Jitan Ram Manjhi, the former Chief Minister of Bihar and leader of the Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) on Thursday led a march to the Raj Bhawan to protest the NDA rule at the Center as well as in Bihar accusing them of allowing prices of essential items to skyrocket since the Narendra Modi government came into power four years ago.

Manjhi, who has been struggling to find his foot in the state politics after walking out of the NDA earlier this year only to join hands with the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), accompanied by other party leaders like Brishan Patel, Mahachandra Singh, and Danish Rizwan, led the 'Akrosh Rally', from Ram Ghoolam Chowk near Gandhi Maidan.

Despite attempt to stop the procession from moving forward at the Dak Bungalow Crossing and then again at the Income Tax Roundabout, the rally managed to reach the Governor's mansion where Manjhi handed a letter of his complaints to the Governor's Secretary Vivek Kumar Singh.

Talking to the reporters, Manjhi said that the entire nation was reeling over high prices of petrol and diesel that should have one price throughout the country and should be brought under the GST rules to stop dealers from price gouging.

"We are trying to save the people of India while the NDA leaders are busy trying to figure out a seat-sharing formula ahead of the next year's Parliamentary elections. If Chief Minister Nitish Kumar is even slightly concerned about the people of Bihar, he should join me in our protest against the Modi government at the Center. Amit Shah, instead of finding solutions for our struggling farmers, is only worried about strengthening the NDA," the former Chief Minister said.

Referring to today's NDA meet at Gyan Bhawan in Patna where members of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Janata Dal – U, Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), and Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) gathered to show unity within the alliance despite rumors of cracks, the HAM leader said that while the people of Bihar are starving in the need of two square meals, the NDA leaders were having a feast at the tax-payers' cost to strategize on how to retain power in the state.
