Security beefed up in old city areas

Policemen ensure peace is maintained in various sensitive areas of city

Vadodara: In wake of violence in Ahmedabad during protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), the city police tightened the security apparatus and picked up some history-sheeters late on Wednesday night.

Even as the old city areas witnessed a peaceful bandh, police have warned of strict action against those who try to foment trouble and spread rumours on social media.

Senior police officials said that over 2,000 cops have been deployed in different areas to ensure peace. Anupam Singh Gahlaut, city police commissioner, conducted a flag march with 15 vehicles in the old city while the same exercise was conducted in other areas.

“We held a meeting with the community leaders on Thursday and appealed them to maintain peace in their area. The locals had apprehensions after they received WhatsApp forwards regarding CAA and NRC, most of which were rumours,” said

“We explained them the basic points of CAB and showed videos of Shahi Imam who has said that the citizenship law does not pose any threat to the minority community here,” Gahlaut said.

On Thursday, a group of about 30 persons gathered on the Vasna Road to protest against CAB but dispersed after police spoke with them.

Five other persons were also picked up on the Raopura Road after they flashed posters and stickers regarding CAB and NRC on their motorbikes. They were let off after warning.

Minority-community dominated areas like Mandvi, Raopura and Fatehpura witnessed an uneasy calm even as most shops remained closed to support the bandh call.

However, the traffic flow remained normal amid tight police security. A large posse of policemen was also deployed in M S University campus to prevent any trouble.
