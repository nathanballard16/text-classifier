A 17-year-old boy is battling for life at’s National Burns Centre after he set himself on fire at his school on Friday morning. He has sustained 90 per cent burns. According to the police, the Class IX student was allegedly miffed with his father, who is incidentally a police naik, after he denied him permission to ride a motorcycle to school.On Friday morning, instead of going to class, the victim, reportedly, went straight to the bathroom on the second floor, locked the door, poured kerosene on his body and set himself ablaze. Moments later, he came out screaming in pain.Ashok Dudhe said the incident took place between 7.20 am and 7.25 am. The school staff rushed him to a hospital nearby from where he was taken to the National Burns Centre in Airoli.“He went to school in the morning at his usual time. There was no argument between us,” said the victim’s father who works with Nagpada police’s motor transport department. “He is in the ICU and not in a condition to speak. The doctors have not told us anything about his condition," he said.The boy’s neighbours and family members, who were at the hospital, said he had taken the bike to school even though his family had not allowed it.“He is still underage and we feared that he would get into trouble for riding a bike. In the morning he was asking for the keys. He took the keys and left with the bike. He did not have his breakfast, just drank some milk,” his grandmother said.Dr Sunil Keswani, medical director of the National Burns Centre, said the victim had inhaled a lot of smoke and was put on ventilator as a prophylactic measure.
