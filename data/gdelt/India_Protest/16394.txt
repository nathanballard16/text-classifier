Haryana Elections: PM adds three rallies in Jat Belt in Haryana amidst JJPs challenge

HISAR: Prime Minister Narendra Modi has added three more rallies to his campaign schedule for the Jat belt of Haryana, making it a total of seven for the state, in what appears to be BJP ’s determined attempt to build a base in a region where it had fared badly in the 2014 elections.Hectic preparations were underway in Sectors 1-4 of Hisar town for Modi’s Friday afternoon rally when it was confirmed that he will address supporters in Sonipat earlier in the day and also hold rallies in Sirsa and Rewari on Saturday, the last day of campaigning.Some analysts said this has been prompted by the decline of the Congress in this belt and the rise of the Dushyant Chautala-led JJP as the principal opposition. Senior BJP leaders Amit Shah and Rajnath Singh have, between them, addressed nearly 15 public gatherings in the state already.In comparison, Congress’ national leadership has been conspicuous by its near absence from Haryana—Rahul Gandhi has held a rally in Nuh and Sonia Gandhi's sole rally in Mahendargarh on Friday was cancelled. Rahul Gandhi may campaign in Mahendargarh in her place. Priyanka Gandhi has not joined the campaign as yet.Congress’ leaders have shunned campaigning in north Haryana's 27 seats where the party only won one seat, Kaithal, in 2014. In that election, 37 Congress candidates had lost their deposits, with most of them in north Haryana.The Rewari campaign on Saturday will be Modi’s second in the town in last seven years—he had held his first rally here as BJP's PM candidate in 2013 and promised benefits of ‘one rank, one pension’. The OROP rollout and scrapping of Article 370, which Modi often refers to in his speeches, could reverberate in this region dominated by ex-servicemen.Modi's rally in Sonipat is in the stronghold of Bhupinder Singh Hooda of Congress who is contesting from the nearby Garhi Sampla Kiloi seat. BJP leaders in Hisar hoped Modi's rallies in Hisar and Sirsa could give a fillip to BJP's chances here.The BJP has made a serious attempt to fight in 16 seats in the Jat belt, where its candidates had either lost their deposits in 2014 or did not lead in the assembly segment in 2019 despite the BJP winning all 10 Lok Sabha seats. Chief Minister Manohar Lal has made it a point to campaign in almost all of these 16 seats as well as across the Jat belt."These 16 seats are like a 'Mission Impossible' for us, but we are still giving them our best shot. That explains the 'Abki Baar 75-paar slogan'," a BJP leader said.16 seats in Jat belt where BJP either lost deposit in 2014 or did not lead in 2019 Lok Sabha polls were Garhi Sampla Kiloi, Baroda, Kharkhauda, Adampur, Nalwa, Narnaud, Fatehabad, Kalawali, Rania, Dabwali, Badli, Jhajjar, Beri, Tosham, Meham and Julana.
