Notably, the Delhi High Court on Friday granted interim protection to two suspended policemen who allegedly fired at a lawyer during the clashes at Tis Hazari court on November 2.

The court also directed that no coercive action should be taken against these cops till December 23, besides issuing notices to various bar associations which have to reply on the petition filed by Delhi police. The HC will hear the case again on December 23.
