Beef dropped from menu by Indian Embassy in Germany

A cultural organisation of Indian origin, Kerala Samajam, Frankfurt, an association of Malayalis in Germany did not include beef from the menu since they had received a directive from the Indian Embassy in Germany not to include it in the menu.

Sima Hindu, Germany-based Indian woman and also a member of Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) started an online petition titled, “Save culture of cow protection in Indian NRI circles and festivities”. The petition was against the KSF’s star food item, the beef curry.

“This will be a Cultural Festival to display Indian Culture. Beef is definitely NOT Indian. In fact, slaughter of Cows is absolutely unthinkable and unspeakable in Indian culture. There are strict laws against Cow Slaughter in India as a Cow has the respectful Place of a MOTHER in Indian Culture. Sale of meat of Holy Cow is a direct attack against Indian Culture. Please sign this petition to stop the sale of beef in personal cultural space of Indians (sic)”, the petition read.

Some people reportedly threatened to create a fuss at the cultural fest if the beef item was not removed from the KSF menu.

It is reported that this directive was issued by the Indian Embassy on receiving representation from the activists of VHP who had protested against the inclusion of beef items in the menu.
