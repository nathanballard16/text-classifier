Eyeing passage of key bills, govt keen to extend House session

NEW DELHI : Looking for early passage of more legislations, the government on Monday remained keen to extend the current session of Parliament by a week despite reservations expressed by the opposition . Sources confirmed that the current session will be extended and a formal decision in this regard will be taken on Tuesday ."The House will certainly be extended and it will be confirmed by Tuesday," a senior functionary said, adding that the length of the extension remained to be worked out.The assertion came in the face of the opposition's protests in the meeting of the business advisory committee when the government proposed the extension. Sources said representatives of Congress and Trinamool Congress protested against the move on the ground that they had already been away from their constituents long enough and they needed to be back among them. Some in the opposition felt the government's keenness had to do with its anxiety to get legislations passed without having to send them to standing committees whose constitution has been delayed as part of the plan to circumvent Parliament scrutiny.At least 17 crucial bills, including the triple talaq bill , are awaiting passage and the government plans to get most of them cleared before Parliament takes a break.The National Medical Commission Bill , the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill , Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill are among the pending bills.
