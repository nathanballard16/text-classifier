New Delhi: Although it is too early to write a political epitaph, the Narendra Modi tsunami across the country has put the left parties on their deathbeds. Early trends demonstrate that the communist party is leading in just two of the 542 Lok Sabha seats, both in Kerala.



Will the Left Front parties take this chance to transform themselves, beginning with a deliberate effort to bring in more democracy in their ranks and a culture of open debate over various issues? At present, it is too early to predict anything at this juncture.



In the former stronghold of West Bengal, the Left is unlikely to open its account in the state this time. Many analysts feel that it was tactical voting by the communist cadres in the state to put a spoke in Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s wheels. It was a natural grouse against the Trinamool supremo who ended their 34 years of uninterrupted rule in the state.



There was a buzz in corridors of power that CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury left no stone unturned to stitch an alliance with the Congress, but the Prakash Karat group played spoilsport. Their apprehension was that if Yechury manages to garner seats from Bengal, and Kerala adds a few more as a bonus, the CPM will have at least 15 seats and then the CPM boss could be a consensus candidate for Prime Minister, and the CPM would not repeat the same historical blunder twice.



Many believe that the Left in Kerala losing space to Right-wing factions. Arguably, the Left is reeling from the jolt of losing a considerable section of its Hindu vote and sizeable votes appear to have gravitated to the saffron party, which, however, is not in a position in more than a handful of seats at present.
