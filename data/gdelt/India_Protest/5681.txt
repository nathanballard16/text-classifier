‘Playing with lives’: Widow of pilot on doomed Lion Air flight says direct appeals made to ground Boeing model

Suneja’s colleagues also told Sethi the disturbing story of the previous flights of her husband’s plane. It had flown from Jakarta to Bali, where a malfunctioning angle-of-attack sensor was replaced. When the plane took off again to return to Jakarta, the pilots experienced problems controlling the plane and made a distress call. Only the intervention of a third pilot, who happened to be on the flight, allowed the pilots to disable the MCAS and restore manual control.
