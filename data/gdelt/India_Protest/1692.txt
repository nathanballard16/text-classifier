PM Modi to address NDA’s mega rally in Patna on March 3

Follow us on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Ahead of the crucial Lok Sabha polls, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will address a mega public rally under the aegis of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) at Patna’s iconic Gandhi Maidan on March 3.

At a time when regional players in the opposition are making all possible efforts to form a formidable “grand-alliance” to defeat the BJP in the upcoming polls and the Congress party upping its ante against the ruling party, the BJP and its allies- LJP and JD (U)- are leaving no stone unturned to retain power.

"The NDA will hold the biggest ever rally in Patna on March 3. It will be addressed by Modi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and BJP chief Amit Shah," Janata Dal-United (JD-U) state President Vashisht Narain Singh said.

Lok Janshakti Party'S Pasupati Kumar Paras and the Bharatiya Janata Party state President Nityanand Rai were also in attendance. He said the three allies of NDA in Bihar will work together to garner support for the coming Lok Sabha polls.

A month ahead of the proposed NDA rally, the Congress is scheduled to organise a mega rally in the same location, in which party president Rahul Gandhi will address the gathering.

Rahul is expected to be joined by RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav and Rashtriya Lok Samta Party (RLSP) leader Upendra Kushwaha.

Prime Minister Modi, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, and Union Minister Ram Vilas Paswan are expected to share the dais on March 3.
