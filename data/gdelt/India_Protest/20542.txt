Realtors’ path to UP’s ‘zero-period’ interest waivers just got tougher

GREATER NOIDA: Developers in Greater Noida applying for ‘ zero period’ interest waivers will have to prove, among other things, that they did not take EMIs from homebuyers whose flats were affected when regulatory or legal interventions stopped work in housing projects.They will also have to furnish evidence that during the ‘zero period ’, no construction work took place, no money was paid to labourers or vendors, and no penalty or interest was levied on homebuyers.The Greater Noida Industrial Development Agency (GNIDA), under whose jurisdiction are the housing projects in Noida Extension where land acquisition cases had stopped work, has spelt out these conditions.It has also issued a public notice, setting a deadline of February 4, 2020 for developers to apply for zero-period waivers.The UP government had on December 5 announced the ‘zero period’ benefit as an incentive for developers who complete their projects in 2021. ‘Zero period’ refers to any phase when a legal or regulatory intervention, or factors beyond a realtor ’s control like land not being fully handed over or an approach road not being there, stopped work on their projects.The Noida Authority and Yamuna Expressway Authority (YEIDA) are yet to set deadlines. “The UP government has taken a positive step. It is now up to the authorities to come up with a procedure to resolve the deadlock instead of complicating it,” said Amit Modi, president of realtors’ association Credai (West UP). Credai had earlier told TOI the stringent conditions would make most Noida developers ineligible for the ‘zero period’ interest waivers.GNIDA officials said projects would have to be completed by June 2021 to be eligible for the waivers, after which adherence to the other terms would be examined.“Developers availing the zero-period scheme benefits would have to complete projects by June 2021 and pass on the benefits to their buyers,” said Narendra Bhooshan, the GNIDA CEO.GNIDA will use satellite images to establish that no construction had taken place during the ‘zero period’.While allotting land, GNIDA took 10% of the total cost upfront. The remaining 90% was to be paid over seven to eight years in instalments.The authority charges a certain interest on instalments. But in cases of default, penal interest is imposed and it keeps compounding. Over time, 115 developers defaulted on payments and GNIDA has been struggling to recover close to Rs 7,000 crore from them.Among the other conditions set for ‘zero period’ waivers are that a developer will have to prove that no “unjust enrichment” of coffers took place during this phase and that benefits drawn from interest waivers would be passed on to buyers.The government had earlier announced that builders would not be automatically eligible for 100% interest waivers during the ‘zero period’.Builders who had over 30% of land “encroached” (unavailable) are eligible for a full interest waiver. If the quantum of land encroached was 20%, the interest waiver would come down to 50%, while those who had just about 10% land encroached are eligible for a 25% waiver.
