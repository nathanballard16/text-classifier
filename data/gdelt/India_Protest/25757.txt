BS Yediyurappa: No question of giving even an inch to Maharashtra

BENGALURU/BELAGAVI: Amid protests in Karnataka and Maharashtra over the Belagavi border row, chief minister BS Yediyurappa said on Monday that “not even an inch” of the state’s territory would be given away. He, however, made an appeal for peace, unity and brotherhood to people of both states.“The Mahajan Commission report, which says Belagavi is a part of Karnataka, is final. Maharashtra is unnecessarily creating confusion and I strongly condemn it,” Yediyurappa told reporters.The comments came days after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray raked up the issue of Belagavi, saying it should be returned to his state.On Sunday, there were protests on both sides of the border. Shiv Sena members demonstrated in Kolhapur and burned an effigy of Yediyurappa. In Belagavi, people burned an effigy of Uddhav, in a reaction to the Maharashtra government’s decision to appoint Eknath Shinde and Chhagan Bhujbal as coordinating ministers for the dispute.Maharashtra claims the border district of Belagavi was a part of the erstwhile Bombay Presidency, but was made a district of Karnataka on linguistic grounds. On December 7, Uddhav chaired a high-level meeting and it was decided that efforts would be made to get a fast-track hearing on the issue in the Supreme Court.Yediyurappa accused Uddhav of using the issue for political gains and creating a rift between Marathi- and Kannadaspeaking people. Revenue minister R Ashoka and Kannada and culture minister CT Ravi alleged Uddhav had brought up the 70-year-old issue to divert people’s attention from problems in the three-party coalition of Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress. “Whenever there is an internal dispute in Maharashtra, language emerges as a tool to do politics,” Ravi said.
