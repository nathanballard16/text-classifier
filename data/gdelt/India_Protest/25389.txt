Activists slam Indian govt’s move to strip minorities of citizenship

Showing its solidarity with the ongoing campaign against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in India, a large number of students and rights activists gathered on Saturday outside the Karachi Press Club to decry the Indian government over the move.

The Democratic Students Federation and the Democratic Youth Front organised the protest. Protesters condemned the fascist approach of the Indian government and questioned the Indian prime minister’s fear of citizens voicing their opinion.

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government’s such fascist policies are suppressing the rights of the minorities in India, including the Muslims, Dalits and Adivasis, they said. “The authoritarian regime of Narendra Modi cannot suppress the movement of youth and students in India,” Naghma Shaikh, a DYF’s central leader, said.

She said the youth and students in Pakistan were in solidarity with the youth and students of Indian, who had encountered police brutalities, and with the many other protesters in India who were taking to the streets, raising their voice against the CAA and the NRC.

They also condemned 21 deaths in the almost two weeks of protests and violence in India, with most reported in the Uttar Pardesh, where a sizeable Muslim population lives.
