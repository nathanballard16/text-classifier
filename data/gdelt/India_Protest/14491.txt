Malaika Arora serves up a sizzling look in athleisure in her latest pic; Take a look

If we don’t pap Malaika Arora outside the gym in Mumbai, then it’d be safe to assume that she is not in the city because come winter, summer or monsoon, this Chaiyya Chaiyya actress makes sure to hit the gym and shed all the weekend calories. And as we speak, 45-year-old Malaika Arora is not in the country as she jetted off to New York for work a few days back. And today, Malaika took to Instagram to post a photo wherein she is seen wearing a grey bralette paired with black joggers and tied up hair and as always, she looks hot and happening.



Prior to leaving for USA, Malaika Arora and boyfriend and Panipat actor Arjun Kapoor had jetted off to Austria for a romantic vacay, and from enjoying a swim in the Austrian lake to gorging on yummy good, Malaika did it all. Often, Malaika Arora is quizzed about her wedding plans and this actress always maintains that they are in no hurry to get married. Also, when Malaika Arora was quizzed about Amrita Arora’s rapport with Arjun Kapoor, little sister had said that they are still getting to know each other.

But amidst all their paparazzi pictures and vacay photos, what we love the most is Malaika Arora and Arjun Kapoor’s social media PDA. And although Malaika Arora is miles away from Arjun but that didn’t stop her from leaving a comment on Arjun’s picture that the actor posted on Instagram which had him flex his muscles while prepping up for Panipat. While sister Janhvi Kapoor was all praises for bade bhaiya, ladylove Malaika Arora too couldn’t stop praising the actor for his hard work and dedication.
