Agriculture students join nationwide protest

Dimapur, Jan. 28 (EMN): Students of School of Agricultural Sciences and Rural Development (SASRD) too participated in the nationwide candlelight protest organised by the All India Agricultural Students’ Association (Aiasa) in the evening, on January 28.

Updates on Monday from the students, stating to be from the Nagaland unit of the Aiasa, stated that the nationwide movement was carried out in a bid to protest against the appointment of an IAS officer as chairman of the Agricultural Scientists Recruitment Board.

The organization stated that Aiasa does not desire to put ‘any question mark over the capabilities of the IAS officer in administration, but as chairman of ASRB, which is a scientific board, the post of chairman should not be deputed to any IAS official and this must be assigned to the agricultural scientists who serve the farming community with research, education and extension activities.’

“In continuation, Aiasa is continuously giving the representations to the GOI since 2011 that the India needs Technical expertise (sic) administration in drawing good policies and immediate implementation of effective policies. Instead of keeping non-technical IAS officers in the agricultural administration immediate steps should be taken to create all India services for agriculture i.e., Indian Agriculture Services, the updates stated.
