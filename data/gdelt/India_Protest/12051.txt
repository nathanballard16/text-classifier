At the face of it from what we see on the TV channels and clippings circulating, it appears that the DCP's action is wrong even though he has his own explanation for it."It is learnt that the DGP had called for a report from the city police chief.President and leader of the opposition in the Assembly, N Chandrababu Naidu strongly condemned the DCP slapping the junior doctor.

Whichever section is staging agitations for solution to their problems is dealt with harshly. We strongly condemn all these acts of suppressing the voice of the people," he tweeted.Last week, a constable was placed under suspension in Hyderabad for touching and pinching a woman medico during a protest at Ayurveda college in Old City.
