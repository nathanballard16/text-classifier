After walking for around 14 km, the farmers had halted for lunch in Ambewada, where Mahajan and Rawal met them for negotiations.The farmers were represented by AIKS president Ashok Dhawale, CPI(M) MLA Jiva Pandu Gavit and general secretary of AIKS Ajit Navale.The leaders insisted on written assurances of fulfilment of their demands, which include minimum support price to agriculture produce, drought relief, loan waiver, a, and increased pensions, not to divert Maharashtra’s water share to Gujarat,of Rs 40,000 per acre, waiver of electricity bills and children’s school fees and implementation of theEarlier in the day, Dhawale had said, “The Kisan Long March of 50,000 farmers under AIKS’s Maharashtra leadership has begun from Nashik despite refusal of permission by the police. Will continue to agitate till the government gives written assurances on meeting demands. After media uproar, the government was forced to allow peasants from Thane-Palghar districts to join the protest.”Navale added, “The state government had made any promises in March last year, but did not implement any of it. The loan waiver programme worth Rs 34,000 crore was not implemented properly.”The farmers had launched the first phase of the long march last year, reaching the city on March 12. Their plight had moved the Mumbaikars, many of whom came forward to show solidarity. The government had then “accepted” a majority of their demands after which the agitation was called off.
