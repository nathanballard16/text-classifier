What has been done for lawyers who want to work in CJ’s court, SC asks Orissa HC

CUTTACK: The impasse in the Orissa high court caused by the boycott of court work by lawyers has taken a new turn, with the Supreme Court (SC) seeking a report on the availability of access for advocates willing to appear for proceedings.A two-judge bench of the apex court sought the report from the registrar of the high court on Wednesday on a transfer petition filed by a litigant company whose petition was pending before the court of chief justice K S Jhaveri.Members of Orissa High Court Bar Association have not attended Jhaveri’s court from August 22 to protest against a decision related to the designation of senior advocates. To make matters worse, the association has been boycotting all courts since October 14 to protest against the Supreme Court collegium’s October 3 resolution on the appointment of judges in the high court.The Hyderabad-based PLR Projects had filed a petition related to a dispute with the Mahanadi Coalfields in the high court on August 16. However, the court of the chief justice, before which it was listed, could not proceed with the case because of the lawyers’ protest. The company then filed a petition in the Supreme Court seeking transfer of its case to any other high court. The transfer petition came up for hearing on Wednesday.An apex court bench comprising justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and K M Joseph passed an order that said, “We consider it appropriate to call for a report from the registrar of the high court of Odisha on what measures have been made to ensure access to the court of the chief justice is available for advocates willing to appear.”Wednesday’s order, a copy of which is in possession of TOI, also says the counsel for the petitioner company had contended before the court that “lawyers of the local bar are not permitting the representation before the chief justice and even outside lawyers are not permitted to appear.”The Supreme Court expects the registrar to file the report on October 22, the day fixed for the next hearing of the transfer petition.The Supreme Court’s order came a day after a 14-judge bench of the high court registered a suo motu contempt case and issued notices to 68 bar associations, including that of the high court, on the lawyers’ strike. October 21 has been fixed as the next date of hearing of the matter. On the other hand, the high court bar association has also fixed October 21 to decide on its next course of action.
