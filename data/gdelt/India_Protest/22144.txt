New Delhi: Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of instigating violence in the national capital. He said that the saffron party is rattled at its potential defeat in the forthcoming Delhi Assembly elections and has resorted to fanning riots.

Manish Sisodia took to his official Twitter handle saying, "The people of Delhi want peace. Fearing its defeat in the elections, the BJP is frustrated and is up to instigating riots. Before 2015, this party instigated riots in Trilokpuri and Bawana. But the people of Delhi taught BJP a lesson for instigating riots, it will again do the same."

Sisodia's comments have come a day after violent clashes erupted between anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protesters and police in Delhi's Seelampur and Jafrabad areas. Protesters pelted stones at the police personnel while administration imposed Section 144 in the violence-prone areas. Eight people have been arrested so far in the case pertaining to yesterday's violence.

Earlier, the Delhi Deputy CM has accused the Central government of directing Delhi Police to carry out violence in the national capital. He shared a series of pictures and videos claiming Delhi Police is coordinating with miscreants to spread violence.
