Compulsorily retired IRS officer locks horns with Centre in unusual tussle in HC

NEW DELHI: The Delhi High Court is witnessing an unusual tussle between a compulsorily retired IRS officer and the Union government over listing of a contempt petition before a particular judge.On Monday, the officer, Ashok Kumar Aggarwal, moved the Delhi High Court with a petition seeking initiation of contempt proceedings against the Centre for deciding to compulsorily retire him, pending appeal proceedings initiated by the Centre challenging the Delhi HC’s decision to quash prosecution against him. Aggarwal has sought listing of the contempt petition before a bench headed by the same judge, which had quashed prosecution against him.When Aggarwal’s contempt petition was listed as per roster before Justice Vinod Goyal, the petitioner’s counsel mentioned and persistently requested listing of the matter before a bench headed by a particular judge. Justice Goyal acceeded to the request. Aggarwal is among the 27 IRS officers who have been recently compulsorily retired by the government.On coming to know of the development, additional solicitor general Maninder Acharya protested vociferously against the practice of mentioning matters by Aggarwal’s counsel without intimating the opposite side.She argued that the contempt petition was correctly listed before Justice Goyal as per the roster and it would be improper to direct its listing before the bench requested by Aggarwal’s counsel. Citing an earlier undertaking from Aggarwal, she said filing of contempt petition by him was an abuse of process. Justice Goyal recalled the order of listing before another bench and decided to hear submissions of Aggarwal’s counsel.The IRS officer’s counsel, senior advocate Vikas Singh, insisted the matter was required to be listed before the bench headed by the particular judge as it was seized of the matter relating to earlier attempts to dismiss his client. He said if the HC order to reinstate Aggarwal and consider him for promotion was not honoured, it would be “murder of justice”.But Acharya stuck to her stand that discipline of roster allocation of work, as done by the chief justice in his wisdom, be adhered to avoid chaos in listing of matters. Justice Goyal listed the contempt petition for further hearing on July 15. Meanwhile, the proceedings initiated by Aggarwal and pending before the other bench would come up for hearing on Friday.
