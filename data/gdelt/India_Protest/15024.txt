Chennai residents come together to fight climate change

“You are never too small to make a difference” — these words of Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg has touched thousands across the world, including an 11-year-old in Chennai. A Class VI student, R.V. Buvitha, took to the road along with a bunch of adults to silently register their protest, as part of the ‘Global Climate Strike Week’ near Madhya Kailash junction on Thursday.

“When Ms. Thunberg began her protest, she was alone outside the Swedish Parliament and people were mocking her. But now, she has become popular globally. So I’m here to say that people like me from the younger generation need to be more conscious of what we buy and what we use. For instance, we can stop buying too many toys and try to avoid using plastics as much as we can,” she says.

Vidya Mohankumar from Urban Design Collective, a Chennai-based collaborative platform of architects, urban designers and planners, says they already conducted about three such strikes in the city to bring in awareness on climate change in the city. She noted that the city and the country was bearing the brunt of climate change, just like the developed ones.

“In the city, we have already seen flooding and water scarcity. This call is to all stakeholders to come forward and play a collective role. Be it from planting trees to taking care of our waste, every action makes a difference,” she adds.
