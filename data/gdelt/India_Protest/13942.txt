JNU sedition: BJYM activists protest near Kejri’s residence

New Delhi, September 7Members of BJP’s youth wing Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha (BJYM) Saturday staged a protest near Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence demanding him to give prosecution sanction in the 2016 JNU sedition case. The Bharatiya Janta Yuva Morcha activists raised slogans against the Kejriwal government and tore down posters and banners outside the Chief Minister’s residence. “Kejriwal should clarify if he sides with anti-nationals, who raised slogans like ‘Bharat tere tukde honge’ in JNU. If not, he should give permission to prosecute the accused in the JNU sedition case of 2016,” the BJYM’s Delhi unit president said. On Friday, Kejriwal said the Delhi government had not yet taken any decision on the prosecution sanction against Kanhaiya Kumar and others in the sedition case.
