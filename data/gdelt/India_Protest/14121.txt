A Z-security vehicle in Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagawat’s cavalcade crashed into a two-wheeler in Rajasthan's Alwar district on Wednesday, killing a six-year-old boy and wounded his grandfather.

Bhagwat was returning from Tizara, where he had gone to meet a Hindu spiritual leader Kamalnath Maharaj, when one of the vehicles in his cavalcade hit a bike that Hetram and his grandson Sachin had been riding on Wednesday afternoon. The incident occurred near Mundavar town in Alwar district.

Sachin, who riding in front of the two-wheeler, died, while his grandfather, who was driving, was first taken to a local hospital and then to Japur’s SMS Hospital, and is believed to be serious, a police official said.

The driver was booked but later allowed to carry on with the rest of the caravan, the policeman said.

After the accident, angry villagers swarmed on to the road to block traffic until police took action.
