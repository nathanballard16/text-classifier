SpiceJet Q4 profit rises 22% despite Jet crisis due to Boeing 737 Max grounding

NEW DELHI: Low cost SpiceJet has reported a profit of Rs 56.3 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, up 22% from Rs 46.1 crore in Q4 FY-18. In full fiscal 2018-19, the airline lost Rs 316.1 crore, as opposed to a profit of Rs 566.6 crore in the previous financial year. The airline’s scrip closed 2.1% up at Rs 148.8 on BSE, before touching a new 52-week-high of Rs 153 during intra-day trade on Tuesday.Despite domestic airfares climbing sharply since February when Jet Airways started cancelling flights majorly (before suspending operations completely on April 17), SpiceJet — unlike IndiGo — could not fully capitalise on that in Q4 as 13 of its Boeing 737 Max were grounded on March 13 and still remain so due to a ban of flying of this aircraft globally. Still it saw its operational income in the January-March, 2019, quarter at Rs 2,571.8 crore, up 23.7% from Rs 2,079.5 crore in previous quarter last fiscal.However once Jet shut down, SpiceJet was the biggest beneficiary in terms of getting its slots, planes and today operates about 20 ex-Jet B737s and could double this number soon. The airline, which had 76 planes on March 31, 2019, plans to add 80% capacity by inducting 60 planes in FY2020.SpiceJet CMD Ajay Singh said the LCC “has posted a strong recovery in last two quarters after suffering a loss of Rs 427.5 crore in the first two quarters due to steep increase in fuel costs and sudden depreciation of the Rupee. This recovery comes despite the unprecedented challenges we faced during Q4 FY2019 which saw the grounding of as many as 13 of our MAX planes.”“With a massive fleet expansion this fiscal, a favourable operating environment, a likely return of the B737 Max in July, significant improvements in yields and prime slots at key airports, we are confident of a strong performance for FY2020,” Singh added.Once the March 13 order for grounding of B737 Max came, SpiceJet said it “swiftly moved by mounting additional frequencies, inducting planes on wet lease and rationalising and optimising the use of its existing fleet.” Fiscal 2018-19 year saw a 25% increase in aviation turbine fuel prices and 9% depreciation of the Indian rupee that resulted in cost escalations of Rs 695 crore and Rs 285 crore, respectively, it added.“Since April 1, 2019, the airline has announced 106 new flights including 73 flights connecting Mumbai, 16 flights connecting Delhi and eight flights connecting Mumbai and Delhi. The fleet size stands at 100 and the company has hired over 1,000 highly trained professionals to chart the next stage of its growth. The company has robust systems and processes to scale its operations, which was demonstrated as it added 25 airplanes in 30 days,” the airline said.The LCC’s average domestic load factor for the quarter was 92.58% while for fiscal 2019 it was 93%. “For 49 months in a row, SpiceJet has flown the highest load factors in the Indian aviation market, a feat unparalleled globally,” it added.
