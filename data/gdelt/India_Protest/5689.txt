BJP accuses Mamata govt of denying permission for venue of PM's rally

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], Mar 30 (ANI): Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government has not given permission for holding a rally of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a ground in Kawakhali of Darjeeling district on April 3, state BJP president Dilip Ghosh alleged on Saturday.

"Our first choice was a state government ground in Kawakhali. We gave an application one week back but the permission was not given. We have got permission for two railway grounds in Siliguri," Ghosh told reporters here.

"This led BJP to choose a railway ground," he said.

Accusing the West Bengal government of being partial towards BJP, Ghosh said, "The administration is not fair. We are used to these circumstances. We always keep options."

He said, "Earlier too, we had faced problems in connection with rallies of the Prime Minister and the party president (Amit Shah). No one can be stopped from holding a rally in a democracy." (ANI)
