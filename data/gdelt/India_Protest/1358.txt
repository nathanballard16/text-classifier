Shiv Sena takes dig at BJP, says why did 22 opposition parties' coming together tremble Modi's canon

The first glimpse of the proposed mahagathbandhan was witnessed at Mamata Banerjee’s ‘United India’ rally in Kolkata on Saturday as 25 seasoned leaders from over 20 political parties formally stitched a formal alliance with a common goal of defeating the BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Shiv Sena via its mouthpiece Saamna took a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday by stating that the BJP government wont stay in power for eternity and the citizens of the nation will decide who will form the next government. Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, its mouthpiece Saamna wrote why coming together of 22 opposition parties in opposition's United India rally scared PM Modi. "PM Modi inaugurated a howitzer while the opposition parties were holding United India Rally in Kolkata. So why did Modi's canon tremble by coming together of 22 opposition parties? The government should not be overconfident about winning the upcoming elections as people will decide its fate," wrote Saamna.
