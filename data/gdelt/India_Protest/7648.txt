A screengrab from the video of the scuffle between Congress veteran V Hanumantha Rao and a local party worker.

The Congress in Telangana faced an embarrassing situation on Saturday when Congress veteran V Hanumantha Rao and a local party leader entered into a scuffle and exchanged blows during a public event. They were fighting over seating arrangements during an Opposition protest.

The protest was called by opposition parties (Left, Telugu Desam Party, Congress and others) to protest against the K Chandrashekhar Rao-led Telangana Rashtra Samithi government. The event was organised to protest against alleged irregularity in the state board examination results.

At least 22 students have reportedly committed suicide in Telangana ever since board results were announced.
