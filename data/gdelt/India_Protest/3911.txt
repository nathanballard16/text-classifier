Bodies of two missing siblings found in canal

GHAZIABAD: The bodies of two siblings — a six-year-old boy and a five-year-old girl — were fished out from the Behta canal in Loni Border on Sunday morning. The siblings had gone missing from outside their house in Jawahar Nagar on Monday evening and a missing persons’ complaint was lodged the same day. Their grandfather Pawan said the family, along with locals, made attempts to locate the missing children but could not find them. The bodies were subsequently fished out of the canal as hundreds of locals gathered at the spot. As soon as the bodies were identified to be of Raju’s children, an agitated mob took over the bodies and marched on the Delhi-Saharanpur road, raising slogans against police.
