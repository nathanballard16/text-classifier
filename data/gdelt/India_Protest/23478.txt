NEW DELHI: India on Saturday summoned Malaysian Chargé d’Affaires to the MEA and lodged a solemn protest over the remarks made by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in Kuala Lumpur, according to official sources.

After visiting the media centre at the Kuala Lumpur Summit on Friday, Mohamad had reportedly said,"I am sorry to see that India, which claims to be a secular state, is now taking action to deprive some Muslims of their citizenship."

It was conveyed to the Malaysian Chargé d’Affaires that such remarks are neither in keeping with accepted diplomatic practice of non-interference in each other's internal affairs, nor with the state of bilateral relations.

Malaysia was told that such remarks were "both ill-informed and insensitive" and has been urged to take a long-term strategic view of the bilateral relations, sources said.

On Friday, the external affairs ministry had termed as "factually incorrect" remarks reportedly made by Mahathir Mohamad.

The ministry had also said that Malaysia should refrain from commenting on the internal developments of India, especially without a right understanding of the facts.
