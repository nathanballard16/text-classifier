Kidney removed sans patient consent?

Hyderabad (ANI): The family members of a patient, Shiva Prasad Goud, staged a protest at Yashoda Hospital in Malakpet on Tuesday alleging that the kidney of the patient was removed without their knowledge by the doctors while operating on a tumour in his stomach.

"On February 26, we admitted my brother Shiva Prasad Goud in Yashoda Hospital after he was diagnosed of having a tumour in his stomach. A team of doctors said the tumour can be removed from his stomach and he will be fine. On Tuesday around 11am, Dr Uma Shankar and his team operated my brother and they said they have removed the tumour and he will get conscious in a few hours. But, on Wednesday morning he was kept on life support machine as his condition was critical," brother of the patient said.

He added, "When we asked the doctor about the condition of my brother then we were told that one kidney was also removed as it got infected due to the tumour." "How can they remove kidney without informing us. We demand justice," the patient's brother added.

According to police officials, a few visitors of the patient Shiva Prasad staged a protest at Yashoda Hospital stating that the patient’s kidney was removed by doctors without prior information.

"Immediately we reached the spot and brought the situation under control. As of now, we have not received any official complaint from the family of the patient. If they file a complaint with us, we will register a case and take up the investigation," the police said.
