SIT arrests Senior Punjab police officer in Behbal Kalan firing case

The Special Investigation Team (SIT) investigating the Behbal Kalan firing incident on Monday arrested a senior Punjab police officer Paramraj Singh Umranangal from Chandigarh.

SIT member Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh confirmed the arrest of Umranangal.

SIT had last month arrested former Moga district police chief SSP Charanjit Singh Sharma.

Umranangal who was IGP of Ludhiana range at the time of incident was summoned by the SIT for questioning a few days back along with other officials. All these officers were on duty when police firing incidents at Kotkapura and Behbal Kalan village in Faridkot took place.

Two young people protesting against the sacrilege incidents were killed in the police firing at Behbal Kalan.

Charanjit Singh Sharma was leading the police party that purportedly opened fire at the people protesting against anti-sacrilege incidents at Behbal Kalan.
