Lawyers burning an effigy of police outside the court on Monday

Vadodara: Lawyers in Vadodara stayed away from court proceedings on Monday to protest against registration of an FIR against the president of Baroda Bar Association (BBA) Hasmukh Bhatt and a female advocate.

The office-bearers of BBA stood at the gates of the district court complex from the morning stopping others from entering the campus. Later in the afternoon the lawyers also burnt effigy of Vadodara rural police alleging that they are harming the image of lawyers by filing wrong complaint.

A resolution was also passed during a meeting of the office-bearers to continue the protest and stay away from the court proceedings until the police file a summary report to close the FIR registered against Bhatt and the female advocate.

A case of alleged robbery was registered against Bhatt and the female advocate at Vadodara Taluka police station by her daughter’s in-laws after she registered a similar case against them.
