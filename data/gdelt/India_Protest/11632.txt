2 August 2019, 12:50 PM Chidambaram on UAPA Bill in RS: "UAPA deals with two different kind of activities - unlawful activities and terrorist acts. They are not the same. They are defined separately. Even before this Amendment, individuals were covered under this Act, punishable under this Act. Individuals are covered in this Act, then why this amendment? "What is the purpose of this Act. It gives an impression that the purpose is to empower the NIA. We are not opposing UAPA or empowering NIA or fight against terrorism.We are opposing the mischief - to power to empower the Central government to name an individual. "If the Central government believes, it can name an individual without an FIR - no case, no charges framed, no conviction. The same power applies for terrorist organisation. You name an organisation, but do not name an individual. It is hopelessly unconstitutional. Refer it to select committee."
