Remark has been misinterpreted: Vijay Goel on MCD chor hai comment

Union minister Vijay Goel's alleged "MCD chor hai" remark has created a controversy and the BJP leader said his statement was misinterpreted. Goel said: "The remark has been misinterpreted...it means general corruption...faced by Delhiites not only in MCD, but other departments of Delhi government also."

Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia tweeted the video clip of Vijay Goel reciting 'MCD chor hai' and wrote on his Twitter handle. Goel should clarify who is chor, the politician or BJP neta? In reply, Goel said: "Sisodia is politicising the issue. What about the Jal board scam, onion scam of the Delhi government?"

In a detailed interview, Goel said: "There is still corruption in the MCD. My remark was only for corrupt bureaucrats. The BJP leadership has decided to wipe out corrupt practices. There was corruption in the attendance system, mutation work and in regularisation but when we came to power, we eradicated all of these in MCD."

Goel added: "Which party leader or bureaucrat is corrupt Sisodia ji knows well. Many AAP MLAs are facing trial on corruption charges. In Delhi government and MCD, corruption will increase if there is no action on it."

"The Delhi government is not giving money to the MCD and wherever there is corruption, the BJP government will eradicate it. You (AAP) do not want to have any kind of development," Goel said. "We have asked our leadership to eliminate the corrupt practices in MCD, Bhaiya Kejriwal Bhaiya Manish Sisodia, come together and fight against corruption. Do not take advantage of it," Goel added.

"Even the common people had raised a voice against illegal construction. There is also corruption in Jal Board, Mohalla Clinic and millions of people speak against these but Manish Sisodia is speaking for his political advantage. I am hurt," Goel said. The BJP leader said that they will stage a protest at Jantar Mantar against the AAP government on Sunday.
