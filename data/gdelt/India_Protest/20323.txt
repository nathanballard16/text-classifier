In a special conversation in his statement, Rahman said, 'It will divide the country on the basis of caste and religion. It is most damaging for the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes as well as the poor and deprived, so I have called upon the secular and tolerant people of India to oppose this bill democratically.
