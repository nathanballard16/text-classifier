New Delhi, May 13: The Supreme Court agreed to hear on Tuesday the plea of a woman BJP activist challenging her arrest by the West Bengal police for allegedly sharing a morphed photo of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on social media.

A vacation Bench, comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, on Monday took note of the plea of advocate N K Kaul, representing the activist, that the issue of her arrest be accorded urgent hearing.

The senior lawyer submitted that there had been a complete strike in West Bengal and it had forced the woman to challenge her arrest in the apex court. He said the activist was in judicial custody.
