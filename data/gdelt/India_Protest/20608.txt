Jamia Milia Islamia postpones exams following protests against Citizenship law

In the wake of violent clashes between students of Jamia Milia Islamia and Delhi police over the Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 (CAA), the university administration postponed the examinations scheduled for Saturday.

"All students of Odd semester of UG & PG programmes are hereby informed that the examination scheduled on 14th December 2019 stands postponed. The date of postponed papers shall be notified in due course of time," said a statement from the Office of the Controller of Examinations.

Earlier in the day, scores of students protested against the Act, demanding it not to be implemented.

On Friday, violent clashes broke out between the police and students of Jamia Milia Islamia (JMI), who were marching towards the Parliament to protest against the Citizenship law. According to reports, police resorted to lathi-charge and teargas shells were fired to stop them. At least 50 protesters were said to detained by the police.

As a precautionary measure, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) closed the entry and exit points at Patel Chowk and Janpath metro stations.
