Karni Sena chief Kalvi seeks review of quotas

Nagpur: Shri Rajput Karni Sena chief Lokendra Singh Kalvi , who shot into national limelight when his organisation protested against the release of the movie Padmaavat in 2017, has stirred the hornet’s nest again. He was on a brief visit to the city for organisational networking.“In any case, time has come for an overall review of the reservation policy. The economic criterion may thus be applied in each community availing of the reservation so the benefits go to the really deserving. Sub-clause 6 of Article 16 of Constitution provides for streamlining quota among all categories in such a way that privileged in every communities are kept out. If this provision is implemented strictly, political leaders of some communities may not be able to contest elections from the reserved seats,” Kalvi claimed.The Rajput leader also claimed that though his outfit was politically aligned to the BJP, voters of his community were asked to vote against the BJP in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh state elections.
