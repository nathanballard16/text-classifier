CBI grills Rajeev Kumar, Kunal Ghosh for nearly 12 hours over Rose Valley, Saradha chit fund scams

Shillong (Meghalaya) [India], Feb 10 (ANI): The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) grilled Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar and former TMC MP Kunal Ghosh for nearly twelve hours here on Sunday in connection with the Rose Valley and Saradha chit fund scams.

Ghosh and Kumar were jointly interrogated by the CBI. Questioning is likely to continue on Monday as well, according to sources.

"I have been asked by the CBI to attend this office. So I’m here. I have cooperated with the investigating agency," Ghosh had said before entering the investigating agency's office earlier on Sunday.

Ghosh was arrested on November 23, 2013, and sent to custody by the CBI on September 4, 2014, after it took over the investigation on the orders of the Supreme Court. In 2016, the Calcutta High Court had granted Ghosh interim bail against a bail bond of Rs 2 lakh.

Meanwhile, Kumar, who has been accused of withholding some documents related to Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams, was questioned by the CBI in Shillong on Saturday as well.

On February 5, the Supreme Court had directed Kumar to appear before the CBI in connection with the scam. It had also said that no coercive step should be taken against Kumar.

The Supreme Court directive had come against the backdrop of a ‘dharna’ organised by West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in Kolkata in protest against the CBI’s attempt to arrest the top cop.

Kumar has been serving as Kolkata’s Police Commissioner since January 2016. He is said to have not responded to the earlier summons from the CBI in connection with the probe into the Rose Valley and Saradha ponzi scams. (ANI)
