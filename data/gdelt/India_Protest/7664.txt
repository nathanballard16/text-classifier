Congress leaders fight publicly for chair

Hyderabad: Causing huge embarrassment to the party, two senior leaders of Congress clashed with with each over sparing a chair for another senior leader.

The incident occurred during a dharna organised by the opposition parties at Indira Park on Saturday to protest against goof-up by the Telangana Board of Intermediate Examination in declaration of results. While former PCC President V. Hanumantha Rao was holding the mike, he invited AICC Incharge R.C. Khuntia onto the stage and wanted TPCC Spokesperson M. Nagesh to vacate the chair on which he was seated. Angered over this, Nagesh entered into an argument with VHR which later turned into a physical assault with both leaders pushing each other.

All senior leaders of Congress and other parties were shocked over the behaviour of VHR and Nagesh and tried to in vain to pacify them. Parents of 22 students who committed suicide over the failure in exams were also shocked.

Later in the day, TPCC leader G. Niranjan wrote a letter to Congress president Rahul Gandhi informing him about the incident. RC Khuntia and TPCC President Uttam Kumar Reddy who witnessed the incident themselves also took a serious view of behaviour of both the leaders.
