Uproar in Rajya Sabha over roster system

Rajya Sabha was adjourned on Wednesday after convening post-lunch without transacting any meaningful business for a third consecutive day amid protests by Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and Rashtriya Janata Dal members over watering down of the reservation procedure for SC/ST and OBC candidates in faculty positions of educational institutes.

The procedure is known as the 13-point roster system in universities. The proceedings were also adjourned in the morning over the National Register of Citizens (NRC) issue.

Protests over the 13-point roster system were in the backdrop of Supreme Court's decision to uphold a 2017 Allahabad High Court judgment that ordered that each department must be considered as a unit for reservation process, instead of the university.

Members of the SP, BSP and RJD trooped into the well of the House and protested over the government's inaction over the issue. Rajya Sabha deputy chairman Harivansh requested members to return to their seats but the protests continued. Senior SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav said that the government had not fulfilled its assurance of not appointing teachers to faculty positions as per the new roster system.

Union Minister for Human Resource Development Prakash Javadekar sought to assuage the opposition and said, "The government had moved a Special Leave Petition (SLP) on the court's decision but that was quashed. But we will move a review petition on this issue and we will not allow dilution of reservations of SC, ST and OBC's in any manner. We are confident that we will get justice and the government is well prepared."

The protests continued though and the deputy chairman adjourned the House till Thursday.
