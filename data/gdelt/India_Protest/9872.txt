AISF protests against high fee in private schools

Demands include filling up of teacher posts in govt. schools

Members of the All India Students Federation (AISF) and All India Youth Federation (AIYF) affiliated to the Communist Party of India (CPI) on Tuesday picketed the Directorate of School Education on 100-feet road demanding that the government put an end to the exorbitant collection of fees by private schools.

The protesters, led by S. Ezhilan, secretary of AISF, said that several private schools were collecting fees in excess ignoring the fee committee recommendation.

Streamline functioning

The government should streamline the functioning of private schools and ensure that they followed the fees structure fixed by the committee. Their other demands included filling up of vacant posts of teachers in government schools, creation of a separate education board for Puducherry and to expedite renovation of Calve College and V.O.C. Government schools.

They also raised slogans against the government’s decision to privatise the mid-day meal programme in the Union Territory.
