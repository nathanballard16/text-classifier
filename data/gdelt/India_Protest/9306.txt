NSUI leaders lock down MSU building to protest against fee hike

VADODARA: Unit building of M S University’s biggest faculty – the Faculty of Commerce – witnessed quite a drama as student leaders linked with the Nationalist Students Union of India ( NSUI ) locked down the entrance gate to protest against fee hike on Saturday morning .Before on-the-spot admission process could start at the building, the student leaders led by MSU Students Union general secretary Vraj Patel stood at the gate of the building, demanding that in-charge registrar should personally visit the building to see the lack of basic amenities even as university has decided to hike the fees.The student leaders first entered into heated arguments with members of the vigilance squad and demanded that in-charge registrar N K Ojha should pay a personal visit to the building to see the condition of classrooms, lack of drinking water facilities among others.When Ojha arrived at the building, he questioned the student leaders on timings of staging such a protest alleging that it was defaming the university. The student leaders however countered him stating that the authorities should provide proper amenities before deciding to hike the fees.The university had increased the fees of higher payment programme by Rs 2,230 from this academic year.On persistence of Ojha, student leaders made way for first timers and their parents who later entered the building for on-the-spot admission process. Later, Ojha visited the building along with commerce faculty’s dean professor Dinkar Nayak and other officials.“We have been assured by the registrar that amenities at the unit building will be improved. We have withdrawn the protest for now but if things don’t improve, we will continue our protest,” said Patel.
