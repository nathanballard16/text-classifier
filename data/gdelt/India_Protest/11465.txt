Mumbai: Seven given 8 years in jail for stealing Rs 1.9 cr from cash van

A sessions court on Tuesday sentenced seven people to eight years in prison for looting nearly Rs 2 crore from a cash van that was on its way to fill an ATM in 2015.

Among the convicts are van driver Tariq Khan, 34, and a guard, Sadr-e-Alam Khan, who was in the vehicle.

Tariq had initially told the police that Sadr-e-Alam, 34, had served him and others in the van with spiked tea which rendered them unconscious. Some men who had overtaken the cash van in a car had then committed the crime, Tariq had claimed. He had also told the police that Alam had driven away with those men. But his story fell apart in the court.

Special Public Prosecutor Ashwini Rayakar said that an employee of the cash management agency who was present in the van said Alam had asked to stop the van saying he needed to return money to someone. Alam returned with tea after 10 minutes and offered the beverage to those in the van. The witness said he did not see either Tariq or Alam drink the tea before he passed out. The police found that Tariq was intoxicated only to a small extent and it was the their modus operandi.
