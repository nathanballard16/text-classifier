Modi Blames 'Vested Interest Groups' for Violent Protests Against Citizenship Law Across India

The prime minister emphasised that the law illustrates India’s centuries-old culture of acceptance, harmony, compassion and brotherhood.

Indian Prime Minister who is facing the wrath from the Muslim community for targeting them through the law said that “We cannot allow vested interest groups to divide us and create disturbances”.

Violent protests against the new citizenship law for last five days have taken the lives of six persons in the northeastern state of Assam, with scores injured in Delhi, Aligarh and Uttar Pradesh and damaged public property in several places including the national capital.

In Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia, police lobbed tear gas shells and allegedly dragged students out of campus. More than 100 activists and 35 policemen, including some senior officers were injured in the incident.

Protests have also spread to several universities across India. In eastern West Bengal and southern Kerala, the ruling parties have hit the streets to register their protest over the bill.

Three opposition-ruled states – Kerala, Punjab and West Bengal, have announced their decision not to implement the new law.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act enacted last week, grants citizenship to illegal immigrants from six religious minorities – Hindus, Parsis, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Sikhs from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, if they arrived in India prior to 2015 but excludes these rights for Muslims.
