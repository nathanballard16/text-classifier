Supporters of Assembly aspirant ransack YSRCP offices in Vizag

Vamsi Krishna Yadav had contested unsuccessfully against present incumbent V. Ramakrishna Babu of TDP in 2014

Supporters of Vamsi Krishna Yadav on March 17 ransacked the offices of Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party(YSRCP) in the city to register their protest against denial of Visakhapatnam East Assembly ticket to him.

Furious supporters of Mr. Yadav broke windowpanes and furniture at the city and central party offices of YSRCP near Dr. V.S. Krishna Government College and MVP Double Road respectively and raised slogans against party president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy. Some of them also removed party flags and put lock to the two offices.

Police forces were deployed at the two offices as tempers ran high among the supporters of Mr. Yadav.

Branding himself as a die-hard supporter of Mr. Krishna Yadav, Kasi Yadav, a local youth, said their leader had served YSRCP from the beginning and the party leadership finally ditched him after promising ticket to him. He said expecting his re-nomination their leader had also launched campaign way ahead of others in various parts of the constituency.

Sangeeta, another supporter of Mr. Krishna Yadav said they were confident of his victory this time as he had been nursing the constituency continuously with his services like supply of water tankers to the slums.

YSRCP has nominated Bhimili Assembly party coordinator Vijaya Nirmala. She was an aspirant for Bhimili ticket. To accommodate Muttamsetti Srinivasa Rao, who migrated from TDP to YSRCP as he was keen on contesting from Bheemili, which had won earlier as PRP candidate, Ms. Nirmala was fielded from Visakha East, party sources said.

Sources said Mr. Yadav lost the elections twice from Visakha East and was known for his failure to mobilise resources.

Mr. Yadav had contested unsuccessfully against present incumbent V. Ramakrishna Babu of TDP in 2014 on YSRCP and in 2009 on Praja Rajyam Party ticket.
