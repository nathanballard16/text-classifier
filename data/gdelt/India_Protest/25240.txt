Chennai: The Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath on Saturday took out a protest march against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Chennai. The TNTJ is a non-political Islamic organisation.

Holding an extended national flag over their heads, a huge crowd shouted slogans against the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government.

People assembled in Alandur and marched towards the house of Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit, i.e. the Raj Bhavan in Chennai.

The Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath march in Chennai today came amid huge opposition and major protests against the amended citizenship law across the country.

Similar protests took place outside the Chennai collectorate by some other Muslim organisations.



The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, grants citizenship to Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, who came to India on or before December 31, 2014.
