Complaint filed against Sunny Deol for mistakenly 'touching feet with Lord Shiva's picture' during roadshow

The party workers also protested against Deol over the same. No response has come from BJP or Deol so far.

Deol, who was holding a roadshow on a truck with lord Shiva’s picture on it, sat in a way that Shiva’s picture was touching his feet. The same spurred a massive row as Congress has filed a police complaint against the actor-turned politician. As per the complaint filed with the police, Congress has alleged that Deol has hurt the religious sentiments of the people by stepping on Hindu god’s picture.
