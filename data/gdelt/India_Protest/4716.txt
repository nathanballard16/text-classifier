See Tibetan girl's amazing protest leap outside Chinese embassy in New Delhi

Hair of flaming colour fell across the girl's face as she rode a thick bed of hands like a rockstar being ferried by ecstatic fans.

On the other side of the barricade, police converged at the tipping point and raised their own palms.

But it was clear, from the Tibetan flags and their snow lions, that this was no concert.

Sixty years ago, in 1959, a failed Tibetan uprising against Chinese rule resulted in the Dalai Lama fleeing into exile in India.

On Tuesday, Tibetans protested outside the Chinese Embassy and the UN office in New Delhi to mark the anniversary of the uprising.

Photos taken by Reuters showed Tibetans young and old, their faces painted in red and blue or foreheads covered with "Free Tibet" bandanas. Some were detained.

China says it "peacefully liberated" Tibet in 1950.

Rights groups and overseas activists say ethnic Tibetans face widespread restrictions under Chinese rule and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in June conditions were "fast deteriorating".

Beijing routinely denies such accusations. It says its rule of Tibet ended serfdom and brought prosperity to what was a backward region, and that it fully respects the rights of the Tibetan people.

As well, it views the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist. But the spiritual leader, who is a Nobel Peace Prize winner, denies espousing violence and says he only wants genuine autonomy for Tibet.
