Muslim outfit stages protest over reservation issue

The All India United Muslim Morcha, which works for the rights of Dalit Muslims, staged a demonstration at Mandi House here demanding a “rapid hearing” of the issue of reservation for those belonging to the community.

The body, in a statement, said the protest was yet another “reminder” to the Chief Justice of India for an early hearing on a specific PIL, 180/2004.

“The plea challenging the validity of Para-III of the Presidential Order 1950 is pending in the Supreme Court since 2004 and has been put in cold storage even after its ‘issue framing’ in 2011,” Kamal Ashraf, the outfit’s national vice-president, said.
