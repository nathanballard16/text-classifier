Security has been tightened in North East Delhi. Apart from Delhi Police personnel, CRPF and RAF troops have also been deployed in the area to prevent any untoward incident. Meanwhile, entry and exit gates of Chawri Bazar, Lal Quila and Jama Masjid stations have been closed as a precautionary measure.
