JNU sedition case: Politically motivated move for 2019 polls, says Waheed Parra

Srinagar

Peoples Democratic Party youth leader Waheed-ur-Rehman Parra on Tuesday reacting on the filing of charge sheet in the 2016 JNU sedition case, in which seven Kashmiris have been named, said that this is clearly a politically motivated move for upcoming elections.

These seven are among the ten students, including former Jawaharlal Nehru University Students’ Union (JNUSU) president Kanhaiya Kumar, charged by the Delhi Police for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans during an event on the university campus on February 9, 2016, to commemorate the hanging of Afzal Guru.

Taking to social networking site Twitter, Parra wrote: “We have lost so many lives to satisfy the so-called collective conscience of people. We won’t allow the trend to go & keep losing our people. This is clearly a politically motivated move for upcoming elections @HMOIndia should drop the charges against Kashmiri students.”

“There is neither an act nor any intention mentioned. Just presence of students in a campus protest can’t make them anti-national & can’t be sufficient proof to file charge sheet against the students,” Parra wrote on Twitter.
