SURAT: Incidents of layoffs of diamond workers in factories here are on the rise despite Diwali festival being round the corner. In the latest case, about 300 diamond workers were allegedly asked to leave a diamond factory in Katargam Sources said the workers of the diamond company located on Sumul Dairy Road gathered at Gajera Circle in Katargam to protest against the factory owner’s decision to relieve them without giving prior notices on Tuesday. Most of the diamond workers have been working in the company for over six years.The workers under the aegis of Gujarat Diamond Workers’ Union (GDWU) submitted a memorandum to district collector demanding that the company owner pay them minimum wages for three months as per the labour Act.In the last two months, over 1,500 diamond workers have been laid off by various diamond units in Katargam and Varachha, industry sources said.GDWU vice-president Bhavesh Tank said, “The owners of diamond company have to follow standard procedure as per factories and labour Acts before relieving the workers. In the fresh case, the workers were asked to leave without any prior intimation.”He further said, “The workers are liable to get three months’ wages as per the labour Act. The other benefits like provident fund and gratuity also have to be given to the workers by the diamond factory owner.”Tank said cases of diamond workers losing jobs are on the rise in the city. Many more companies are likely to down their shutters by September-end because of unfavourable conditions prevailing the market, he added.Shrish Godhani, director of Godhani Impex, told TOI, “We are closing the factory due to heavy losses due to recession. We have not relieved the workers but asked them to find jobs elsewhere. We have stock of rough diamonds that would only last up to 20 days. We have also given them assurance of helping them find jobs in other units.”
