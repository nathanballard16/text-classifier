NIT Uttarakhand students soon to get permanent campus: HRD Minister

The students of NIT-Uttarkhand will soon get a permanent campus, Union Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' announced on Monday.

The HRD Ministry had in December last year decided to shift around 600 students of NIT-Uttarakhand to the institute's Jaipur campus, following protests by students who were demanding a "safer" premises.

Pokhriyal on Monday held a meeting with Uttarakhand Minister of Higher Education Dhan Singh Rawat and Pauri-Garhwal MP Tirath Singh Rawat regarding the same.

After the meeting, Pokhriyal told reporters that the permanent campus will be established in Sumari village in Srinagar, Uttarakhand.

The minister said the foundation stone of the permanent campus will be laid in the first week of September.

He said 203 acres of land has been identified for building the new campus.

The upcoming session of the institute will be started in the temporary campus itself and a high-level committee will be formed to transfer students from NIT, Jaipur campus, he said.

Admission process for NIT Uttarakhand

For the next session, the process of admission will start from the permanent campus, he added.

The infrastructure development of the new campus will be done in a mission mode, he said.

NIT Uttarakhand's temporary campus

The institute's temporary campus in Uttarakhand had two clusters.

The hostels and classes were located on the government polytechnic campus while the administrative buildings and laboratories were at the government Industrial Training Institute (ITI) situated 400 metres away.

The students staged protests last year demanding the institute be shifted from its current location along the NH 58 in the town after three BTech students had met with accidents while commuting from one cluster to another along the highway.
