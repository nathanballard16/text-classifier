Lok Sabha elections 2019 HIGHLIGHTS: New India gives befitting reply to terror, PM Modi says in Varanasi after roadshow

Lok Sabha elections 2019 HIGHLIGHTS: A day before filing his nomination from Varanasi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday held a mega roadshow in the city. The prime minister began the roadshow by garlanding the statue of Pandit Madan Mohan Malviya outside the gate of Banaras Hindu University. The roadshow will stretch over six kilometres from the Lanka area to Dashashwamedh Ghat via Godoliya.

Earlier in the day, the suspense over Priyanka Gandhi’s candidature from Varanasi ended with the Congress fielding its 2014 candidate Ajay Rai against PM Modi. In 2014, when Modi won the seat with 5.81 lakh votes, Rai polled 75,614 votes. Varanasi goes to polls on May 19.

AAP convener and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the party will do everything it takes to stop the “Modi-Shah duo” from returning to power. If Modi returns to power, Kejriwal said, “Rahul Gandhi will be responsible.” The manifesto, the CM said, assures full statehood to Delhi.
