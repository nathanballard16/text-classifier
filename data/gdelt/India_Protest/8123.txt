Goalpara: The Goalpara district chapter of Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) on Monday staged a sit-in in front of the DC’s office demanding the continuation of recognition of Goalpara BT College. The recognition was withdrawn by the National Council of Teacher Education (NCTE) recently.

The NCTE had withdrawn the recognition in the last week of April as the college failed to submit a report as per NCTE pro forma, detailing the building plan, building completion certificate and lack of permanent principal and faculty staff.

“As per the NCTE regulation, 2014, one principal and 15 full-time faculties are required for 100 intake in B.Ed course,” stated the NCTE circular published after its meeting in Bhubaneswar, Odisha on April 24-April 25.

However, the Goalpara BT College, established in 1974, has at present 15 faculties and among them, only four are permanent while the rest are engaged in a part-time basis.

“In view of the above, the East Regional Committee (ERC) of NCTE is of the opinion that recognition granted to B.Ed course of the applicant bearing Code No. AS-S/N-12/99 is withdrawn under Section 17(1) of NCTE Act 1993 from the academic session 2019-20,” read the circular.

The matter was hushed up by the college and came to light lately. On Monday, the DYFI in a memorandum addressed to the Governor as well as the Chief Minister, demanded to retain of the recognition, the appointment of permanent principal and required teachers and infrastructure development.

“What will happen to the students of West Assam districts as this is the second government B.Ed college after the one in Kokrajhar district? We want immediate government interference as appointing teachers and building infrastructure are State Government subjects,” said Parvez Ali, secretary of Goalpara district DYFI.
