Delhi Police names former Congress MLA Asif Khan, 6 others in FIR on Jamia violence

Delhi Police has named former Congress MLA Asif Khan as one of the accused in its FIR related to the violence that broke out in Jamia University on Sunday.

Six people including four local politicians and the former Congress MLA have been named as suspects in the Delhi Police FIR related to Jamia violence on Sunday.

The other six accused persons have been identified as local politicians Ashu Khan, Mustafa and Haider, AISA member Chandan Kumar, SIO member Asif Tanha, and CYSS member Kasim Usmani, police said.

Police said that around 3 pm on Sunday, a few local politicians along with a few members of student unions were leading a protest march. "In the last two to three days, an ex-MLA and local politician were seen instigating local protesters. These two men were raising slogans against the NRC and CAA," an official said.

A Delhi court Tuesday sent 10 people, arrested in connection with protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) near Jamia Millia Islamia University here, to judicial custody till December 31.

Metropolitan Magistrate Kamran Khan earlier sent 10 arrested people -- Mohammad Hanif, Danish alias Jafar, Sameer Ahmed, Dilshad, Shareef Ahmed, Mohd Danish, Yunus Khan, Jumman, Anal Hassan, Anwar Kala -- to judicial custody.

Police arrested them on Monday for alleged involvement in violence near JMI University and said that none of them were students.

The university had virtually turned into a battlefield on Sunday as police entered the campus and also used force following the protest that led to violence and arson in which four DTC buses, 100 private vehicles and 10 police bikes were damaged.

The situation remained tense in the university premises on Tuesday as protesters, including students and local residents, converged outside the varsity holding tricolour and placards to continue their demonstration against CAA and NRC.
