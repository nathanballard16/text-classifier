IndiGo Coimbatore flight returns to city due to engine failure

A Coimbatore-bound IndiGo A320 neo plane made an air turn back to the city airport within an hour of its take-off from here after one of its engines stalled mid-way with high vibrations, a source said.

The pilot, however, managed to land the aircraft safely with the help of other engine, the source said.

The number of passengers was not known immediately.

A senior DGCA official confirmed the incident and attributed it to the low-pressure turbine (LPT) while a response from IndiGo spokesperson was awaited.

"IndiGo flight 6E-375 operating on the Mumbai- Coimbatore route was forced to return to Mumbai one of its engines stopped working mid-air," said the source.

The Pratt & Whitney-powered engine Airbus plane took off around 12.50 pm from the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj international Airport before landing back at around 1.55 pm, the source said.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation is probing the incident, adding damage to the LPT blades prima facie caused the engine to stop functioning.
