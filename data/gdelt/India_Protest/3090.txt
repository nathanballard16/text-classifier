Railway unions threaten to protest outside PM’s residence

Will go ahead with stir on March 13 and 23 if demands not met

The National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR), an umbrella body of railway unions, has threatened to stage a protest on March 13 and March 23 in front of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s residence in Delhi to press for their demands.

M. Raghavaiah, general secretary of NFIR, said, “The railway ministry has agreed to our demands, but they are yet to be implemented. We will hold a dharna in front of the Prime Minister’s bungalow if our demands are not met.” Mr. Raghavaiah said that they are yet to take a call on whether to stop train services in the country.

Charter of demands

The key demands of the unions include abolishing 12-hour duty; granting additional allowance to compensate for the risk to life faced by railway workers; increasing the grade pay of rail employees like loco pilots, track maintainers, loco inspectors; and upgrading Grade C workers to Grade B.

They also want the Railways to fill up around 2.50 lakh vacancies in various categories across the country and induct rail apprentices.

The unions also want the Railways to be exempted from National Pension System. They are also opposing the bullet train project and the demolition of railway staff quarters in Baroda and Palghar district to make way for the project.

J.G. Mahurkar, vice-president of NFIR, said, “Over 500 quarters are set to be demolished for the Mumbai-Ahmedabad bullet train project. What is the need for such a project when there is already good connectivity between these two cities?”
