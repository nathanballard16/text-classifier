TSRTC Strike Takes a Deadly Turn:- After the talks between Telangana Government and Telangana Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) failed badly, TSRTC employees went on an indefinite strike during the holiday season. Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) sacked 48,000 employees which turned out to be a huge shock. The TSRTC JAC took the agitation to the next level and tense situations arise across the state. 2 RTC staffers ended lives on Sunday which made the situations even worse. An RTC conductor D Srinivas Reddy from Hyderabad committed suicide and B Surendar Goud ended his life last evening after he could not pay his house loan EMI.

Goud recently lent a loan to construct a new home. With salaries unpaid, his EMI cheque bounced. Depressed with this, Goud committed suicide. Srinivas Reddy who doused himself with petrol said that his life is being sacrificed for the betterment of TSRTC employees. Telangana Government remained tightlipped about this and a meeting is staged to discuss about the further moves. Hundreds of employees paid their respect for the RTC employees who sacrificed their lives. On the other side, GHMC drivers joined RTC duties to earn more money. Telangana government agreed to pay Rs 2000 per day for these GHMC drivers.
