Bada Modi snoozed, Chhota Modi escaped: Congress attacks PM Modi

A UK-based newspaper had posted a video of their interaction with fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi in London.

On a day fugitive diamantaire Nirav Modi was arrested in London, the Congress accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of snoozing when he escaped from the country.

In a tweet, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said Nirav Modi, who he referred to as "Chhota Modi", was arrested after the Opposition party questioned "Bada Modi", a term he has been using to target the PM.

The reaction came after Nirav Modi, the main accused in the USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam case, was arrested in London and a court on Wednesday remanded him in custody till March 29, saying there are "substantial grounds" to believe that he would fail to surrender if granted bail.

"Nirav Deepak Modi, 48, was arrested on behalf of the Indian Authorities on Tuesday in Holborn," the Metropolitan Police said in a statement in London.
