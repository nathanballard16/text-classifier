SFI members detained for trying to stage protest in Coimbatore

COIMBATORE: Police detained around 20 members of the Students Federation of India ( SFI ) when they tried to stage a protest in front of the Coimbatore chief education officer’s office here on Thursday morning.SFI members started a march from Town Hall up to the CEO office. They said they were staging the protest to press for their demands like protecting government schools from being taken over by private organisations in the name of adoptions, regulating the fee structure of private schools and withdrawing the new draft education policy. They also demanded that the 25% reservation for students from economically weaker sections under the Right to Education Act be implemented properly in private schools.Police personnel had been posted in front of the office even before the march reached the spot. The protesters told police that they wanted to hand over a memorandum to the Coimbatore chief education officer, for which the police denied permission.Following this, a scuffle ensued between police and SFI members. Police detained 20 members, of which seven were girls.Last month, SFI members in the city took out a bicycle rally to Trichy where SFI members from across the state converged for a conference on protecting government schools and developing their infrastructure.
