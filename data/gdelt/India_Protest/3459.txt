British Indians pay homage to deceased CRPF jawans, demand strict action against Pak

London [UK]: To honour the martyrs of the Pulwama terror attack, hundreds of British Indians on Sunday staged a protest in the United Kingdom demanding strict action against Pakistan.

People from all walks of lives have been holding candlelight marches to express solidarity with the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) families.

Waving Indian flags and holding placards in hands, people chanted slogans like ‘Pakistan Murdabad’ (down with Pakistan) and ‘Hindustan Zindabad’.

Earlier in the day, the Indians living in the UK protested outside the Pakistani High Commission in London. The protesters accused Islamabad of providing sanctuary to several terrorist outfits who are responsible for carrying out terror activities in India.

The demonstrators raised slogans of ‘Vande Mataram’ and ‘Kashmir Hamara Hai’. They urged the UK government to stop any military cooperation or aid with Pakistan.

The Pulwama terror attack that took place on Thursday was orchestrated by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) outfit. The convoy comprised of 78 buses in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

Around 42 martyred jawans were in a bus, into which the suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle. It was the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir.

Following the assault, India on Friday withdrew the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status to Pakistan. The international community too has expressed support to India in the wake of the attack.
