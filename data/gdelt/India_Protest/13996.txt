Even as the Telangana Bar Association called off its strike, the Telangana State Bar Council on Sunday passed a unanimous resolution condemning the transfer of Justice Sanjay Kumar, who is the second-most senior judge in the Telangana High court.

In its resolution, the Bar Council protested the decision to transfer Justice Sanjay to the Punjab and Haryana High Court, where he will be relegated to the 12th position, and called it an 'unjust transfer'.

"We are condemning the transfer because this is unwarranted and against the principles of natural justice.We request the Supreme Court collegium to reconsider the issue and recall the transfer of Justice Sanjay to Punjab and Haryana High Court," Bar Council Chairman Narasimha Reddy was quoted as saying.

Earlier this week, protesting lawyers took out a rally and staged a protest at the main entrance of the High Court. The protest affected the proceedings of the court. Lawyers of some lower courts in Telangana also joined the protest against the transfer of the judge. Advocates of Andhra Pradesh High Court also extended solidarity with their Telangana counterparts by staying away from duties last week.

"It is a larger issue. What are the guidelines for these transfers? There is already a shortfall of judges in the Telangana High Court. When a person is due to be elevated, without citing any reason, why should he be transferred to a lower post? In that aspect, we are agitating," Telangana Bar Association president T Surya Karan Reddy had told TNM earlier.
