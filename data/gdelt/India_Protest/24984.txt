Bhagwaan banke aaye: UP cop thanks local, Hajji Qadir, who rescued him from mob

Hajji Qadir, left, said what he did for policeman Ajay Kumar, right, was "for humanity".

A Firozabad policemen says he owes his life to a local, Hajji Qadir, who rescued him from a violent mob during protests that took place last week.

"He came like a God," said Ajay Kumar, who suffered injuries to his head and a finger, in an interview with Aaj Tak. "If he hadn't come, they would have killed me."

Hajji Qadir, who also spoke to Aaj Tak, said he was reading namaz when learned that Kumar had been surrounded.

Ajay Kumar said Qadir brought him home, gave him water and clothes, and later took him to a police station.

"Aise log bahut kam milte hain, sahab", said Kumar -- there are very few people like him.

A modest Hajji Qadir said he didn't know who Kumar was when he intervened, and that what he did was "for humanity".

Uttar Pradesh has seen some of the worst violence linked to the ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which critics believe deliberately discriminates against Muslim illigal immigrants.

Protesters fear the CAA will shield non-Muslim illegal migrants identified by a pan-India NRC (the government now says there have been no talks on a nationwide register), and make a large number of Muslims stateless.

As many as 19 people have been killed in protests in Uttar Pradesh, a home department spokesperson said.
