Chandigarh, November 17

The Punjab Police have registered as many as 1,630 FIRs against farmers for stubble burning during this season so far. They have also arrested 1,327 farmers, who were let out on bail.

Nearly 10,000 policemen under 3,200 patrolling teams have spread out in the state to catch farmers resorting to burning of paddy stubble despite a ban by the state government.

Besides, the police were part of 1,375 joint teams with the Revenue Department to take action against fire farms.

This is the biggest ever police action against fire farms even as the state is facing strong criticism from the Supreme Court as well as the Centre and Delhi government for not checking the burning of stubble in time. Smoke emanating from the fires has seriously affected the air quality in Punjab which has remained under ‘severe harmful’ category. In Delhi, it was under ‘hazardous’ category.

Director General of Police Dinkar Gupta told The Tribune that till November 16 evening, the police had lodged 1,630 FIRs. He said: “We formed patrolling parties and joint teams with the Revenue Department to identify the farmers resorting to stubble burning despite the ban.”

“The police taking action against farmers was a highly sensitive matter. Even a minor argument had a potential of blowing into a major law and order problem as farmers gather swiftly to protest police action. We hardly used any force in any of the cases and strictly went as per law,” the DGP added.

Already, a number of farmers’ unions are protesting against the FIRs across the Malwa region.
