Kejriwal promises old pension system if voted to power in Hry

Delhi Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party supremo Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced that the old pension scheme will be implemented for employees within 15 days, if AAP is voted to power in Haryana.

Kejriwal lent support to the ongoing protest of Haryana Pension Restoration Sangharsh Samiti in Panchkula near here and promised implementation of old pension scheme.

While addressing the people at the protest, the Delhi CM said the AAP fully supports their demand.

The leaders of Haryana Pension Restoration Sangharsh Samiti has alleged that the existing pension scheme is totally dependent on share market and beneficiaries are not aware what amount they would receive, while in the previous system, an employee got a handsome amount at his/ her retirement.

Lashing out at the Haryana Government, he said that since the Manohar Lal Khattar Government took over charge in the state, employees have been less in their offices and more on roads to protest.

Kejriwal said that the never-ending protest of the guest teachers in Haryana, the roadways strike and the movement of the Asha Workers have become headlines of the newspapers during present regime in the state.

The employees have to resort to demonstrations to raise their justifiable demands and gain their rights, he added.

Notably, AAP is gearing up to contest upcoming Lok Sabha polls and assembly polls scheduled later this year in Haryana.

Kejriwal has been holding rallies in various constituencies to woo the voters in the state.
