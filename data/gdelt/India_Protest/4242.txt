The paramilitary forces on Sunday held a protest at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi against the Narendra Modi-led government. The protestors alleged that the paramilitary forces get treated like the poorest cousin of the Indian Army.

One of the protestors said, "Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been celebrating Diwali with paramilitary forces but what has he done for us?"

"We haven't got pension since 2004, there's no One Rank, One Pension (OROP) for us, our men are not even given the honour of martyrs."

The protestors said that if PM Narendra Modi does not complete the demands of the paramilitary forces, they will send him a strong message in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

"We always get step children treatment," one of the protestors said. They also asked what the Narendra Modi-led government has done for the paramilitary forces.
