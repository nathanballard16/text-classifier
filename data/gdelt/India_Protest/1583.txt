Polytechnic students stage protest over fee structure

Demand 25% reservation for students from U.T.

Students of the Government Women’s Polytechnic in Lawspet on Thursday abstained from classes and staged a protest in front of the college premises demanding that the administration follow the same fee structure for government and society colleges.

The agitating students led by Students Federation of India (SFI) vice-president Anand said the government was adopting a separate fee structure for the society-run colleges when compared with government run colleges. The government should end the discrimination and follow the same fee structure for all colleges.

They also demanded 25 % reservation for students from the Union Territory in all educational institutions among other demands.
