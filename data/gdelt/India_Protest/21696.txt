No question of linking CAA to NRC: Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad

Amid violent protests over amended Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Union Minister of Law Ravi Shankar Prasad has said the law is not for Indian citizens.

As he explained the amended Act, the Union minister reiterated that CAA and NRC are not related. "NRC hasn't been finalised yet. There is no question of joining CAA with NRC as the draft is yet to be completed," Ravi Shankar Prasad said at Agenda AajTak on Tuesday and added that the country belongs to Muslims as much as it belongs to Hindus.

"I can explain it to those who want to understand, but not those who don't want to. Their only work is to oppose PM Modi," added Ravi Shankar Prasad as he appealed for calm.

On students' protests across the country against the amended Act, Ravi Shankar Prasad said he will talk to those opposing the law, but won't spare 'tukde tukde' gang. At Agenda AajTak, the Union minister said action may be taken against those who speak against the country. "Under Article 19, you have the right to speak. But speak against the country's security, sovereignty and integrity and action may be taken against you," Ravi Shankar Prasad said.

JUDICIAL SERVICES EXAM SOON

At Agenda AajTak, the Union Minister of Law admitted to shortage of judges and said all India judicial services exam will be proposed soon. If IAS, IPS, then why not All India Judicial Service Examination, Ravi Shankar said.

NO MONOPOLY IN TELECOM SECTOR

No single company will be allowed to rule in the telecom sector, Ravi Shankar Prasad has said. "Nobody will allow monopoly in telecom sector. We are engaged in reviving BSNL and MTNL," Prasad said.
