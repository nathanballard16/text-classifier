NRC and NPR: Documents reveal Congress may have started NPR, NRC

NEW DELHI: Amid nationwide protests over the controversial National Register of Citizens ( NRC ) and Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ), the opposition has relentlessly trained its guns on the Modi government.They also claim the National Population Register (NPR) is a precursor to a pan-India National Register of Citizens, even as the Union Cabinet on December 24 approved funds for updating the NPR. Some opposition-ruled states such as West Bengal, Kerala and Rajasthan have even stopped work on the NPR in protest.However a look at government documents readily available in the public domain show that plans for NRC and NPR were afoot during the UPA regime itself, an argument repeatedly put forward by the NDA govt in its defence. The 2011 Census report details the objective and procedure for NPR. The section on FAQs for NPR on the website of Registrar General and Census Commissioner of the MHA, defines the NPR as 'a register of usual residents of the country,' being prepared with the objective to 'create a comprehensive identity database with full identification and other details by registering each and every usual resident in the country.'Further down, under Question no.5, the NPR is mentioned as 'the first step towards preparation of the NRIC,' and that it is compulsory for every citizen of the country to register.Even before this, the MHA Annual report of 2008-09 , when the UPA government was in power, clearly mentions that 'determination of citizenship is an involved and complicated matter and that creation of National Population Register (NPR) with a single reference date would be more feasible in the first instance.'The section NATIONAL POPULATION REGISTER (NPR) on page 146 of the report further says that 'After the NPR is created, it will engulf the UID database, being far more comprehensive and will become the mother database for identity purposes.In August 2012, in a written reply to a question raised by Yogi Adityanath (then an MP) in Lok Sabha, MoS Home Jitendra Singh (elected from Alwar, Rajasthan on a Congress ticket) shared details about the procedures to be adopted in the preparation of NPR and how local bodies will be involved. PIB release dated Dec 13, 2011 amply clarifies that detention camps in Assam are not a brainchild of the current dispensation, as is being claimed by some. It says that the government of Assam (then headed by Tarun Gogoi of the Congress) had set up three detention camps, at Goalpara, Kokrajhar and Silchar, to keep declared foreigners/illegal migrants till deportation to their place of origin.
