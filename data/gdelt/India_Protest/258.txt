Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh: Samajwadi Party leader and former Uttar Pradesh cabinet minister Azam Khan on Friday said he is ready to tend all the abandoned cows if UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath allows him to do so.

Responding to recent reports of an increased number of stray cattle on roads of UP, Khan said its disgusting how people who consider cow their mother turn her outside their homes. They should be penalised for this. He said he is ready to take care of all such abandoned cows from UP if CM Yogi allows him to do so.

On January 2, Adityanath government in UP unleashed a 'cow welfare cess' in order to build cow sheds to tackle the menace of a growing number of stray cattle across the state. After Western UP saw protests over stray cattle, Adityanath in a cabinet meeting decided to impose 0.5 cess on excise items including alcohol. A similar cess was imposed on toll roads which state agencies operate. UP government also doubled the one percent cess on mandi parishads across the state.

The government plans to use the money collected from this to build cow sheds, helping it to tackle the problem. The money collected will be used to construct sheds under the MNREGA scheme. The government has sanctioned Rs 100 crore to the local bodies for the same. The 'cow welfare cess', will facilitate construction of shelters for about 1000 stray animals in every district.

Last week people in two villages near Aligarh and Firozabad rounded up stray cows and bulls and locked them up in a government school refusing to let the school conduct classes until the government do something about the problem.
