Prime Minister Imran Khan, in a tweet on Thursday, shared an article of prominent Indian author and journalist Khushwant Singh, who foresaw where India was headed with its racial supremacist ideology.The premier termed Singh’s words as prophetic who “foresaw where India was headed with its racial supremacist ideology.”In the article, Singh said every fascist regime needs communities and groups it can demonise to thrive.“It starts one group or two but it never ends there. He said a movement built on hate can only sustain itself by continually creating fear and strife,” added the Indian author.Singh categorically said, “Those of us [Indians] today who feel secure because we are not Muslims or Christians are living in a fool's paradise.”The premier had time and again condemned his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi and the country’s Bharatiya Janata Party-led government over their illegal and unconstitutional moves aimed at minorities particularly Muslims.He had termed the Indian government “fascist” and “supremacist” when it removed the special status of Indian-occupied Kashmir (IOK), making it a part of India forcibly.Amid protests in India against a controversial new citizen bill, Prime Minister Imran said on December 11 that millions of Muslims could flee India due to the curfew in the disputed territory of Kashmir and India’s new citizenship law, creating “a refugee crisis that would dwarf other crises”.
