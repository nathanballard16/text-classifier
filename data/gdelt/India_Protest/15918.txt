Soldier martyred in Indian firing across LoC

A Pakistan Army soldier was martyred and two civilians were injured as Indian army resorted to ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC), according to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).

The army’s media wing said Sepoy Naimat Wali was martyred as Indian troops resorted to ceasefire violations in Baroh and Chirikot sector along the LoC, also injuring two women in Serian village. In response, Pakistan Army troops targeted Indian army posts which were ‘substantially damaged’. ISPR added that there were reports of casualties of Indian troops.

On Wednesday, two civilians had been injured in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in a ceasefire violation by Indian troops from across the LoC. A day earlier, the Foreign Office (FO) had summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia to record a strong protest against the unprovoked ceasefire violations by Indian forces along the LoC on Oct 6 and 7.

The LoC violations come as tensions remain high between India and Pakistan over the former’s move to revoke occupied Kashmir’s special autonomy on August 5.
