New Delhi: Two persons died while 80 others were injured in a police lathicharge and firing on protesters in Muzaffarabad city of Pakistan occupied Kashmir on Tuesday. It was a day of massive embarrassment for the Pakistani Army and government officials which had taken a small handful of foreign diplomats to the region to prove there are no terror camps being operated and no Indian Army attack had taken place on Sunday. As Pakistani Army took foreign diplomats to PoK, a major protest was organised on the streets of Muzaffarabad by common people demanding freedom. The protest, that had begun last night, was against illegal occupation of Jammu & Kashmir. People in large numbers had gathered on the streets to protest against Pakistan PM Imran Khan and Pakistan Army. Various political parties under the All independent parties alliance (AIPA) banner in PoK had called for a pro-freedom rally in Muzaffarabad on October 22, the day when Pakistani forces invaded Jammu and Kashmir in 1947.
