CBI summons former TMC MP Kunal Ghosh in Saradha scam

In a development which can have far reaching political implications, minutes after forming a team of 10 officers, the Central Bureau of Investigation has summoned former Trinamool Congress (TMC) MP Kunal Ghosh in connection with the Saradha scam.

According to sources, it was TMC MP Kunal Ghosh who had implicated Mukul Roy and 12 others for their role in the Saradha scam.

Mukul Roy was later arrested by the SIT but he has only been questioned by the CBI once ever since the case was transferred to the agency by the Supreme Court.

Sources told India Today that Kunal Ghosh will appear before CBI sleuths on Sunday in Shillong.

The CBI has formed a 10-member team to investigate chit fund scams in West Bengal. Sources in the CBI told India Today TV that the team will leave from New Delhi for Kolkata today.

The team comprises one SP-rank officer Jagroop Gusinha, two deputy SPs, three ASPs, and four inspectors.

Some of these officers will also go to Shillong and join Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar's interrogation.

Kumar has been accused of withholding some documents related to Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund scams.

Rajeev Kumar is expected to be summoned by CBI very soon.

On Sunday, the CBI had sent a team to interrogate Rajeev Kumar at his residence in Kolkata. However, in an unprecendented move, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee stormed to his residence and prevented the CBI from quizzing him.

Mamata Banerjee also ordered the West Bengal Police to surround Rajeev Kumar's residence and prevent the CBI team from entering it.

She then started a dharana--Save Democracy protest--against the Narendra Modi-led central government.
