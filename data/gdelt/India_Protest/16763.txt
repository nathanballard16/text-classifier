Maharashtra Election Results: BJP dips 17 in Maharashtra, alliance majority falls short of 220+ target

Pankaja among 8 Maharashtra ministers to taste defeat

Elections 2019: BJP ahead but falls short of majority in Maharashtra and Haryana

MUMBAI: The BJP-Shiv Sena alliance, which had set a stiff target for itself of winning more than 220 seats in the Maharashtra assembly elections out of the total 288, fell considerably short of its own expectations on Thursday.Though its combined tally of 161 meant it crossed the halfway mark comfortably, both the BJP and Sena had reason to feel dissatisfied that they had not only failed to completely bulldoze a depleted and apparently demoralised opposition but had come up with reduced numbers, the BJP score dropping from 122 in the 2014 polls to 105 and the Sena’s from 63 to 56.Sharad Pawar’s beleaguered NCP was chiefly responsible for slowing the saffron march — winning 54 seats as against just 41 in 2014.The Congress, which had been the senior partner in the secular front earlier with 42 seats, managed to add just two more to its tally despite the BJP-Sena’s five-year incumbency period.The BJP and Sena had fought the 2014 polls separately and later forged a post-poll alliance. This time, with the tie-up securely back in place, the BJP, fresh on the back of its thumping Lok Sabha victory and popular endorsement of the Modi government’s move to revoke Article 370, was hoping to reach the majority mark of 145 on its own, while the Sena was aiming at 100 seats for itself.Largescale defections from the NCP and Congress, leaders of the saffron combine hoped, would further cripple the opposition.The saffron allies, however, lost several seats that they held in the sugar belt of Western Maharashtra, where Pawar led the NCP to a comeback, and disappointingly for CM Devendra Fadnavis, in his Vidarbha region, where the Congress bagged 17 of 62 seats against all expectations.Most exit polls had given less than 100 seats to the opposition, with the best projection for BJP-Sena alliance at 243.Though cities such as Mumbai, Pune and Nashik favoured the saffron alliance more than the opposition, its defeat in nearly 50% of the seats in Fadnavis’ hometown Nagpur came as a setback for a combine that relies heavily on urban voters. A bigger setback was the defeat of eight ministers in the state cabinet, including the late Gopinath Munde’s daughter Pankaja Munde from Parli in Beed district.The BJP-Sena alliance had expected an unprecedented mandate, especially after NCP and Congress netas left their parties in significant numbers after the LS polls to be on the winning side. The results were a mixed bag for these turncoats, with those like Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil (Shirdi), Nitesh Rane (Kankavli) and Ganesh Naik (Airoli) winning and Harshwardhan Patil (Indapur), Vaibhav Pichad (Akole) and Jaydutta Kshirsagar (Beed) losing in their pocketboroughs.Fadnavis said the BJP-Sena tally had been hit more by rebels than by the opposition and claimed he was in touch with “15 rebels” who would soon return to the saffron camp.Of the smaller parties, Prakash Ambedkar’s Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi, which ended its alliance with the AIMIM after the LS polls, drew a blank. The VBA-MIM tie-up had cost the Congress-NCP front at least five seats in the LS polls. Asaduddin Owaisi ’s party lost both the seats it had won in 2014 (Byculla and Aurangabad) but made up for it with victories in two other seats, Malegaon and Dhule city. The Samajwadi Party too won two seats, while the MNS had to be content with one (Kalyan rural).
