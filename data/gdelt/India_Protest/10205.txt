Unable to loot cash, thieves make off with bank oven

Ludhiana: Thieves struck at a bank in Gahour village of Dakha on Monday and made off with a microwave oven after failing to get cash. Even as a case has been registered, police are yet to identify the miscreants.

In his police complaint, Namanpreet Singh, branch manager of the private bank, said the security guard called him up on Monday morning and informed that office locks were open. He said he rushed to the bank and also called up the police. The complainant told cops that on checking the bank, he found that somebody had stolen the microwave worth Rs 3,500.

Dakha DSP Gurbans Singh Bains said the accused couldn’t reach the cash room and ran away with the microwave. He added that they have got the CCTV footage and the accused would be identified and arrested soon.

Dakha police have registered a case under sections 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment), 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc) and 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the IPC.

Police officials said the Ludhiana rural police was facing acute shortage of staff and only three to four personnel on PCR duty carried out patrolling in 28 villages. They said given such low numbers, it was hard to provide foolproof security.

On June 3, thieves had tried to loot the ATM of a private bank on Heera Singh road in Jagraon.
