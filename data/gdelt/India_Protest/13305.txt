TIRUNELVELI

Employees of Employees’ Provident Fund Office here struck work and observed fast on Wednesday to highlight their demands, including immediate implementation of Anomaly Redressal-cum-Implementation Committee report for Group B,C and D cadres.

The protesters said the sanctioned strength of the staff in Group B, C and D cadres and the work norms should be reviewed based on the present workload. Time-bound promotions and allied benefits should be ensured. Vacancies in Group B, C and D cadres should be filled-up immediately to ensure quality service to EPFO members.

“Though we had sent more than 80 letters to the management explaining the problems being encountered by the EPFO, no reply has been received so far. Though the management in January last agreed to consider the demands of the employees, no step has been taken in this direction so far. Hence, we’ve been left with the only option of protesting against the management,” said M. Rajeswara Singh, Tirunelveli branch secretary of All India Employees’ Provident Fund Staff Federation.

He said the one-day token strike on Wednesday was organised after their black badge agitation from August 1 to 27 and the ‘lunch-hour demonstration’ between August 19 and 23 went unheeded.

“If the management is still adamant, the protesters would be forced to commence an indefinite strike in near future,” Mr. Rajeswara Singh said.
