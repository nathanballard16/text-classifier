New Delhi, July 29

With the Rajya Sabha giving its nod by voice vote, Parliament today passed the Banning of Unregulated Deposit Schemes Bill, 2019, which seeks to ensure that poor depositors do not get duped. The Lok Sabha passed the Bill on July 24, 2019.

Replying to the debate on the Bill, Minister of State for Finance Anurag Singh Thakur noted that the legislation would protect the hard-earned money of the poor people. He said, "I urge all members to pass the Bill."

The minister said the government had constituted an inter-ministerial group to address gaps in the existing legislation. The recommendations include a new central law to tackle unregulated deposit schemes and the Bill "is part of the government's effort to bring back money looted by some high and mighty people", he said.

The Bill provides that the first claim on the recovered money will be of depositors and it also has some exclusion, including money collected by real estate firms and from friends and relatives. The Bill will give power to both Central and state governments to frame rules, the minister said, adding 978 cases have been identified so far and of this 326 are in West Bengal.

The legislation contains a substantive banning clause which bans deposit takers from promoting, operating, issuing advertisements or accepting deposits in any unregulated deposit scheme.
