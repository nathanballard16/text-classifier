Tense moments were witnessed as members of two communities, brandishing swords, confronted each other in the old city area, near Chaura Bazaar, today. The trouble started after activists of one community tore some posters of Shiv Sena which featured pictures of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, CM Beant Singh, DGP KPS Gill and Army General AS Vaidya.

Shiv Sena workers led by their leader Rajiv Tandon gathered at Chaura Bazaar and raised slogans. They sat on a dharna and demanded the arrest of those who tore the posters.

Later, Sena men in large numbers gathered outside the historical temple, Sangla Wala Shivala, where members of the other community also turned up and confronted them. Both groups were carrying swords and challenged each other for a face-off.

Police Commissioner Dr Sukhchain Singh Gill, DCP Gaganajit Singh, DCP Ashwani Kapoor and other senior officers along with police force reached the spot to control the situation.

While Gill was trying to persuade Sena activists, members of the other community started hurling bottles and stones at them. This led to panic in the area.

The situation was brought under control after the police managed to disperse activists of both the communities and cordoned off the entire area. Fearing clashes, shopkeepers at Chaura Bazaar, Ghaa Mandi, Chauri Sadak, Bagh Wali Gali, Shivala road, Sadar Bazaar and Pindi Street shut their shops.

Earlier in the morning, Sikh activists held a march amid brandishing of swords and raising pro-Khalistan slogans in view of the Operation Bluestar anniversary.

When asked about the action being taken against those carrying swords openly, Gill said a probe had been ordered to identify such persons and efforts were also on to identify those who tore posters at Kalicharan chowk.
