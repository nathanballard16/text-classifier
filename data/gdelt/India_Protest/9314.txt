UDHAGAMANDALAM: A herd of nine elephants, including two tuskers and three calves, has been disrupting traffic on Coonoor-Mettupalayam road and the Nilgiri Moutain Railway track at Runnymede for the past two days. Forest officials have been taking measures to chase the animals away into the forest, but in vain.According to the residents of Kattery area, the elephant herd was seen near Kattery junction on Coonoor-Mettupalayam road two days ago. The elephants blocked traffic until forest officials came and chased them away.“We chased the elephants away into the forest area. But they came to Runnymede area the next day. We are monitoring their movement and taking measures to chase them deep inside the forest,” said a forest official.On Saturday, the same herd strayed into Nanjappa Chattiram in Coonoor. “The elephants are invading the town area and it is a cause for concern. The forest department should take a concrete measure to track their movement and prevent them from entering Coonoor town,” said a local resident.The forest official, meanwhile, said a team had been formed to monitor the movement of the herd.
