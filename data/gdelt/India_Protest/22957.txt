Bhim Army Chief Chandrashekhar Detained During Mega Citizenship Protests At Delhi's Jama Masjid

New Delhi:

Bhim Army chief Chandrashekar was detained by the Delhi Police during the mega protest against the citizenship law outside iconic Jama Masjid in Delhi on Friday. Several workers of the political outfit mingled with the crowd on the steps of the Jama Masjid. They assembled near gate number one of Jama Masjid as drones also kept a vigil on the large gathering which raised slogan 'Inquilab Zindabad' with some singing 'Saare Jahan Se Accha'. Some protesters were also carrying posters of Baba Saheb Ambedkar, Kanshi Ram and Bhagat Singh.

The massive protest march led by Bhim Army, despite the police denying permission to it, comes a day after thousands of students, activists and opposition leaders hit the streets in the national capital defying security clampdown and prohibitory orders.

Chandrashekar has been voicing his opinion against the contentious law. Soon after Jamia crackdown, Chandrashekar had slammed the Modi government stating that the Indian Constitution gives equal rights to all the communities to live in the country. He had said, “I do not need to take lessons on it from Sangh Parivar, it is in my blood.”

Hours after throwing open Jamia Millia Islamia and Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh metro stations in Delhi, the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has closed three metro stations in view of protest in the national capital against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. "Entry and exit gates of Chawri Bazar, Lal Quila, and Jama Masjid are closed. Trains will not halt at these stations," the DMRC tweeted.

Thousands of students, activists and opposition leaders hit the streets in the national capital on Thursday, defying heavy security clampdown and prohibitory orders even as authorities suspended mobile internet services and restricted traffic movement to quell the swirling agitation.
