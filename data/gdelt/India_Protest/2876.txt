Alliance aims to loot: Smriti Irani

Hyderabad: Taking on the mahagathbandan that is being formed to oppose the BJP at the Centre, Union minister Smriti Irani said it was meant to loot the nation.

“Parties that neglected the poor and gave importance to their families have formed a Grand Alliance and are trying to loot the country,” Ms Irani in Mahbubnagar.

Ms Irani had come to Mahbubnagar, about 85 km from the city, to address BJP workers from Mahbubnagar, Nagarkurnool and Chevella Lok Sabha constituencies.

She said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had done a lot for the country and every party worker had the responsibility of explaining it to the voters.

“The Opposition is unable to tolerate the overwhelming response for the welfare schemes implemented by Narendra Modi for the poor and is levelling allegations against the government. The Opposition leaders are now struggling for their political existence,” she said. She said India had emerged as a powerful nation under the leadership of Mr Modi and asked: “What did the Congress do for the development of the nation all these years.”

She said that to help people to overcome their financial crises, Mr Modi had given loans ranging between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 50 lakh to about 15 crore people.

“Though the opposition is trying hard to bring down Mr Modi, the people have decided to vote for Narendra Modi once again,” Ms Irani said.

Taking on the TRS, Ms Irani said it was unfortunate that the state government had not considered Ayushman Bharat, the medical insurance scheme that provides treatment up to Rs 5 lakh.

“The TRS government has not taken this up as the Prime Minister will get the credit and support of the people. The people of Telangana are in favour of Narendra Modi,” Ms Irani said.
