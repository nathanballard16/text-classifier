To tackle upkeep issues, GNIDA plans office in Noida Extension

Greater Noida: In response to pressing demands by residents of Noida Extension , the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority ( GNIDA ) has decided to soon set up a temporary office in the region. A senior manager will be posted in the office to look into complaints, officials said on Wednesday.Residents have long been flagging issues related to poor roads, unattended construction waste, sewage, garbage, water and electricity problems in Noida Extension. They also claim that the distance between Noida Extension and the office of GNIDA that is 25km usually prevents them from approaching the authority.“We will set up a temporary office to address immediate concerns of residents as many of them are facing problems in interacting with the GNIDA officers as the main office is about 25 kilometres away from the region,” a senior GNIDA official told TOI.Noida Extension residents, in fact, had some time ago made an appeal to the GNIDA to set up a nodal office in the area.“We had appealed to GNIDA to open an office in Noida Extension so we can take our problems to officials for fast resolution. The GNIDA officials responded to our request and we’ve been told a nodal office is expected to be set up soon,” Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida Extension Flat Owners Welfare Association (Nefowa), said.Noida Extension, at present, has 40,000 flats which have been handed over by the builders. Of these 25,000 are currently occupied. The extension area has 1 lakh residents. By the end of 2019, the settlement area is expected to see a population increase by over 1 lakh as 40,000 more flats are likely to be handed over by the year-end.The Noida Extension residents have been on a voluntary basis taking to the streets to clean up debris and dust. They have also pooled in resources to clean up the statues in the area last week.
