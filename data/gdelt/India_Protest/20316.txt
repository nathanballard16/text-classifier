Guwahati/IBNS: The indefinite curfew, which was imposed in Assam's Dibrugarh over the violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was relaxed for five hours on Friday.

The curfew has been lifted from 8 am to 1 pm.

However, the All Assam Students' Union (AASU) has called for a 10-hour hunger strike in Chandmari area of Guwahati.

The protests by Assamese people turned violent on Wednesday with several agitators set tyres, buses on fire.

The situation went worse on Thursday as at least two people were killed in police firing while the protesters refused to budge down and escalated their protests defying the curfew imposed in Assam since Wednesday evening.

Several companies of Army have been deployed in the northeastern state.

The protesters in Assam do not want influx of refugees sensing a threat to their identity and culture.

The protests are also taking part in Tripura.

Internet services are suspended in Assam, Tripura and Meghalaya.

Meanwhile, the CAB, which will grant citizenship to all non-Muslim refugees who came to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan before 2015, became a law on Thursday night with President Ram Nath Kovind's assent.
