Unrest at Enfield’s Oragadam factory

Chennai: Labour trouble has erupted again at Royal Enfield’s Oragadam plant with 600-700 permanent employees on strike for the last two days over issues of transfer of some employees and pending bonus payments. “The problem this time is that the management is transferring and victimising the workers. It started when the management transferred the general secretary of the registered employees trade union. Immediately around 700 permanent workers went on stay in strike after which the police intervened to get them to vacate the premises,” said CITU state president A Soundararajan. The problem, he said, is similar to what happened recently in Hyundai Motor India’s Sriperumbudur plant. “The management refused to recognize or accept the registered trade union but will only talk to the 5 or 7 member workers’ committee. If the management stand does not change, the strike will continue.” The Royal Enfield workers’ trade union was registered last July in the middle of labour unrest all along the Oragadam belt in companies like Yamaha, Royal Enfield and others. When contacted, the company spokesperson said, “We got a notice for a strike on February 12 and February 13 onwards a certain section of the workforce (around 600 people) have been on strike. There was a meeting that happened with the labour commissioner on Thursday. Last time trouble happened, we had reconciled with the issues. Conversation is currently on with all relevant parties for an early and amicable resolution but on Friday also a section of people are on strike,” she added. Royal Enfield, which has three factories in Tamil Nadu, employs over 4,000 people in its Oragadam plant. Last year, the company battled a rare labour dispute when around 1,000 of its permanent and temporary workers in the Oragadam plant went on strike.
