Bengaluru: Thousands of people from the Muslim community on Monday staged a “Peace Rally” here against the Citizenship Amendment Law and proposed National Register of Citizens.

Waving the national flag and holding placards, the protestors raised slogans demanding the withdrawal of the NRC and CAA as they marched through city roads.

The rally, called by around 35 organisations under the banner of Joint Action Committee of Bengaluru, culminated at the Quddus Saheb Eidgah Maidan.

Road traffic was badly hit at several parts of the city.

Elaborate security arrangements had been made to avert any untoward incident, which by-and-large remained peaceful till the afternoon, police said.
