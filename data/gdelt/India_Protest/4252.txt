The West Bengal police on Sunday resorted to lathi charge to stop BJP activists and workers from carrying out Vijay Sankalp bike rally, launched by BJP president Amit Shah yesterday, in Midnapore district of the state. The bike rallies are part of BJP's pre-poll campaign with the aim to energise the cadre and mark the party's reach in every parliamentary constituency across the country. According to reports, the West Bengal police had denied the permission to carry out the rally citing board exams and traffic issues, yet the state BJP leaders went ahead with the rally.

Reports suggest that after being denied to carry out the rally, BJP activists tried to break through the barricades at Midnapore which led to lathi charge and scuffle between the police and the BJP workers leaving several injured, including police personnel.

The clash between the BJP workers and the West Bengal police is the latest in the bigger battle of BJP and Trinamool Congress-led by Mamata Banerjee ahead of the 2019 general elections. Earlier, Mamata Banerjee had denied permission to the BJP for holding rallies across 42 constituencies in the state citing law and order concerns. The matter reached Supreme Court where the ball was placed in Mamata's court observing that it was up to the state government to grant permission to the event.

Last month, unprecedented drama unfolded in West Bengal when a CBI team investigating the chit fund scams was arrested by the state police for trying to raid Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar's residence without a warrant. Mamata Banerjee had then launched a sit-in dharna called "Save the Constitution “against the Centre alleging that it was using CBI as its tool to destabilise the Bengal government.
