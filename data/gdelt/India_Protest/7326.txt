Thane: Two days after Shiv Sena mouthpiece urged the Narendra Modi government to ban burqa on the grounds of national security, Muslim women from Mumbra in Maharashtra’s Thane district on Friday took out a protest.

The women protested against Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut for his comment on the ban of burqas.

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut is the editor of party's mouthpiece Saamana. In the editorial, he had urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to ban burqa after Sri Lanka declared a ban on face coverings in the wake of Easter Sunday bombings.

The Shiv Sena editorial has stirred off a major controversy. Interestingly, Shiv Sena’s leadership has officially dissociated itself from the demand.

Shiv Sena spokesperson Neelam Gorhe, in a categorical statement, had said: “Today's editorial has neither been discussed nor been announced by Uddhavji and thus it may be a personal opinion of the editor on the current affairs in Sri Lanka, but is not endorsed by the party President or the party.”

The party’s ally, the Republican Party of India-A, also vehemently opposed the Shiv Sena.

"Not all women who wear the burqa are terrorists, it is their custom and their right, too. There should not be such a ban on the burqa in India," said Union Minister and RPI(A) chief Ramdas Athawale.
