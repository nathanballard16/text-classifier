Leftists Up in Arms against Desecration of Marx, Lenin's Statues in Tripura

Patna: A host of leftist parties in Patna on Tuesday burnt the effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after right wing extremists in Tripura destroyed the statues of Communist leaders Vladimir Lenin and Karl Marx to signify the end of communism in the state following the victory of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Tripura Assembly elections three days ago.

Carrying red communist flags and placards with pictures of Lenin and Marx, the protestors under the banner of Socialist Unity Center of India (SUCI), burnt the effigy of Modi at the Kargil Chowk accusing him of insulting their heroes and demeaning what they described as 'great philosophers'.

Meanwhile, Communist Party of India (CPI-ML) national General Secretary Dipankar Bhattacharya termed the desecration of Lenin and Marx's statues as a slap on martyrs like Bhagat Singh and others.

"RSS says what has Lenin or Marx got to do with India? They should know that without Lenin, we would not have heroes like Bhagat Singh and other revolutionaries who happily marched to the gallows to fight British imperialism and for the freedom of their country," Bhattacharya said.

The media-savvy communist leader further said that the 'attack on Tripura' was an assault on hard-working people and their livelihood to favor corporate fascists who were determined to destroy the working class of India.

CPI-ML state secretary Kunal announced state-wide protest in Bihar on March 7 to express their anger towards BJP-led fascists in Tripura.
