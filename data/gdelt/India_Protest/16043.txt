Grenade attack in Srinagar leaves five injured

SRINAGAR: At least five people were injured in a grenade attack in occupied Kashmir’s main city of Srinagar on Saturday, police said, the second such attack since India stripped the disputed region of its special status.

About the attack, police said on Twitter: “All (the injured) are stated to be stable. Area under cordon.” They added that a search operation was under way.

The attack took place in central Srinagar’s Hari Singh High street, and the victims were being treated at the Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital, a police official and a staff member at the hospital said.

Most shops at the attack site were shuttered on Saturday as people have resisted opening them in protest against India’s move in August to scrap the special status the disputed Jammu and Kashmir state had under the Indian constitution.

There is anger and discontent among Kashmiris over that decision. At the time, India blocked phone and internet across the disputed region and sent in thousands of additional troops, imposing curfew-like restrictions to dampen discontent.

India has claimed its move was essential to integrate Kashmir fully into India and spur development in the disputed region. But critics say India’s move could push more Kashmiris towards an armed campaign against the Indian occupation.

A grenade attack in southern Kashmir’s Anantnag city a week ago injured 10 people, police said.

Many in Srinagar have staged protests against the government move, despite the curbs.
