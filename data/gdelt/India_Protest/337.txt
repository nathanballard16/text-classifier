Gujarat: GSHSEB changes exams schedule of general stream

In a major relief to the students of Class 12, general stream, the Gujarat Secondary and Higher Secondary Education Board (GSHSEB) on Saturday announced that children will no longer have to take two exams a day.

According to the earlier schedule, the students had to take the history exam on March 8 morning and philosophy exam in the evening.

GSHSEB said the philosophy exam will be held from 3 pm to 6.15 pm on March 9.

Statistics exams (for commerce students) that was scheduled for March 9, will be held on March 8 from 3 pm to 6.15 pm.

It should be noted that the general stream consists of students who have opted for Commerce or Arts. Earlier, two (history and philosophy) exams of the arts stream had been scheduled for the same day.

The new exam timetable has been uploaded on the board's website on www.gseb.org. The other exam schedules remain unchanged, the board said. The change comes after students had claimed that with two exams scheduled on one day they were hardly left with any time for revision.

The parents of these students had also met education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama in this connection to seek a change.

Edu min wants exams for Class 3

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama once again sought freedom for the states to conduct exams for students in Class 3.

Chudasama was attending the 56 NCERT meet organised by the Human Resource Development ministry in Delhi.

The minister, while thanking the centre for amendments to the RTE which now allows states to conduct exams for Classes 5 and 8 for promoting students, said it was also mandatory for states to be given the freedom to conduct exams for Class 3 too.
