Citizenship bill not be applicable to Nagaland: CM to Rajnath Singh

Guwahati: Nagaland Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio has written a letter to the Union home minister Rajnath Singh saying the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is not applicable to the state.The development comes amid widespread protests across the Northeast against the bill, passed by the Lok Sabha , which provides for granting Indian citizenship to non-Muslim illegal immigrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.In the letter, the CM said “the Bill, even if enacted, will not be applicable to Nagaland in view of the constitutional ecosystem contained in Article 371 (A) of the Constitution of India that guarantees the Nagas their way of life un-interfered by any parliamentary enactment, unless the legislative assembly of Nagaland by a resolution so decides”.He further said, “This is necessary to ensure that the historic and unique cultural traditions and customary practices of Nagas are protected and safeguarded for which special constitutional provisions under Article 371(A) have also been incorporated.” The Nagaland cabinet has decided to refer the bill to the standing committee on Article 371 (A) under the state assembly to examine the issue.
