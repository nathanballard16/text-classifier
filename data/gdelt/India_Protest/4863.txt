‘Revoke ban on Jama’at, stop hounding Mirwaiz’: PDP

Srinagar

People’s Democratic Party (PDP) youth wing on Thursday held a protest march in Budgam against the ban on Jamaat e Islami as well as the hounding of Mirwaiz Muhammad Umar Farooq by the government of India through NIA. The protest was lead by PDP youth wing district president Shahnawaz Mir.

Terming the ban on Jamaat as uncalled for and the summoning of Mirwaiz by NIA as “witch hunt,” the protesting activists said that ban should be immediately revoked and NIA should desist for acting as a tool of vengeance against Muslims in Jammu and Kashmir.

Scores of activists of PDP youth wing were carrying placards and marched from DC Office Budgam to the main Chowk and raised slogans against BJP and government of India.
