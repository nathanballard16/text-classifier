Tension at CUSAT student’s hostel

Kochi: Tension prevailed at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT) engineering college hostel after a group of SFI-DYFI activists barged into the premises and damaged furniture and vehicles.

Meanwhile, the Students Federation of Indian (SFI) and Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) activists alleged that bottles and stones were hurled at them from the hostel. Later, police came to the spot and pacified them.

Meanwhile, SFI staged a protest in front of the police station demanding the release of their activists detained in connection with the incident. The activists also damaged the window panes of the police station.
