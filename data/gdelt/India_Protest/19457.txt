In what seems to be an unwarranted case of violence by the police in Bengaluru, a police officer of Assistant Commissioner of Police allegedly slapped a Bengaluru-based reporter of an English daily.

The reporter is working as a principal correspondent of The New Indian Express. The video of the ACP slapping the reporter, too, has gone viral on social media.

According to reports, the incident took place when the reporter was video recording the police seemingly abusing a protestor holding placard in KR Puram. The protester was advocating free and fair elections and asking people not to take money from political parties and to “save democracy”.

Reports identified the errant officer as ACP of Whitefield Sub Division, V Krishnappa. The police were reportedly unhappy as the protester had reappeared with a fresh set of placards after he was warned off for protesting near a polling booth.

It was around 1 pm when the police tried to forcefully detain the protester, Santosh, and took him to the ACP. In the video that has gone viral, the ACP was seen verbally abusing Santosh. The journalist, who was at that spot, was filming the video.

After the protester was taken away, the ACP noticed the camera.

Unhappy that the incident was videographed, the ACP himself objected to it and allegedly slapped the journalist.

Speaking to The Hindu, the reporter, who was allegedly assaulted, said that the ACP was abusing the protestor and threatened to jail him if he did not leave.

When asked about the incident, City Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao has assured that the matter will be looked into and an inquiry would be conducted. At present, the Deputy Commissioner of Police (Whitefield) MN Anuchet has sought a report on the incident.
