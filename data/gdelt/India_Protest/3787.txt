Bengaluru: Karachi Bakery is a very sought-after chain for its delectable cookies and bakery products. Though the name suggests its origin in Pakistan's Karachi city, the chain was founded by a Sindhi who migrated to India during the Partition in 1947.

However, for some fringe elements, all that matters is the name. A Karachi Bakery outlet in Bengaluru's Indiranagar area faced the ire of protesters who were miffed with the name of the bakery since it had a Pakistani city's name.

The incident took place on Friday evening when a mob assembled at the bakery's 100 Feet Road outlet in Bengaluru city and asking the outlet to pull down its board that read ‘Karachi’. Under pressure from the mob and fearing violence, the owners of the store covered the 'Karachi' on their board in order to pacify the fringe elements.

The protests are one of many that have erupted across India in wake of the ghastly Pulwama terror attack that was carried out two weeks ago.

Banned Pakistani terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed carried out a brutal attack that killed 40 CRPF jawans on February 14 in Awantipora area of Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The attack took place around 3:30 pm after a suicide bomber, identified as local boy Adil Ahmad Dar, in a Mahindra Scorpio car loaded with 350 kilograms of explosives rammed into a convoy of 78 vehicles carrying over 2500 CRPF personnel on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.
