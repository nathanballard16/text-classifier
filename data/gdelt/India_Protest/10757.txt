The opposition parties on July 10 had staged a walkout in the Lok Sabha, protesting against the government's proposal to impose one rupee cess per litre each on petrol and diesel.

The Congress members had demanded a rollback of the cess on fuel products and created ruckus during Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's reply on the Budget discussion in the House.

Apart from the Congress, DMK, National Conference, Samajwadi Party, NCP, and some other regional parties had also walked out from the House. (ANI)
