Venkatachalam ‘shows strength’ as he leads fight for water project

In an apparent show of strength, Perundurai MLA Thoppu Venkatachalam , accompanied by a large crowd, on Sunday petitioned Erode collector Kathiravan to implement the Kodiveri combined drinking water scheme.Pointing out that several villages in his constituency were suffering acute water shortage, he said the only way to address the same was to fast-track the combined potable water project. Venkatachalam said he would meet chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswamy on Monday to reiterate the demand.The project was announced by the late chief minister J Jayalalithaa in 2014. Palaniswamy had allotted 248 crore for the project and subsequently works were started eight months ago. “However, the works have slowed down now, apparently due to opposition from a section of Gobechttipalayam farmers, who fear that they would face a shortage if the scheme was implemented. This project is completely intended for drinking water needs and not for agricultural purposes. So, there is no need for farmers to be apprehensive,” Venkatachalam said.The large crowd that the MLA brought to the collectorate could be seen as a show of strength. Of late, Venkatachalam, a former minister in Jayalalitha cabinet, has been lobbying for a bigger role in the party. In May, he had called on Palaniswamy and quit his Amma Peravai state join secretary post, creating a flutter in the party. Though he refused to reveal the reason for quitting, party workers say it was the fallout of turf war between Venkatachalam and state environment minister K C Karupannan. Venkatachalam had openly charged that Karupannan, who is the Erode AIADMK district secretary, was hand in glove with the DMK and the AMMK during the Lok Sabha elections.
