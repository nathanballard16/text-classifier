Sisodia extends support to protesting govt staff

They are on hunger strike for last 4 days

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia on Thursday met and expressed solidarity with employees working with various departments of the Delhi government who are on a sit-in protest and hunger strike demanding restructuring of the Delhi Administrative Subordinate Services (DASS).

They are also demanding restructuring of steno cadre, implementation of the Sahai Committee Report, recruitment and promotions in vacant positions and general transfer posting policy.

Mr. Sisodia said the Delhi government was in agreement with their demands and that he would seek appointments with the Lieutenant-Governor and the Union Home Minister to accept their demands.

Mr. Sisodia said that that the Delhi government must have authority over the Services Department not only for its smooth functioning, but also for creating a positive environment for the employees who form the lifeline of any government.

“Since May 2015, we are fighting to retain the Services with Delhi government. This is not a personal fight, but a fight against the repressive system,” said Mr. Sisodia. He added that he was pained to see that the DASS cadre has been continuously subjected to injustice.

He appealed to the employees to call off their hunger strike. Three members of the Delhi Government Employees Welfare Association (DGEWA) have been sitting on a hunger strike outside the Delhi Secretariat for the last four days in favour of their demands.
