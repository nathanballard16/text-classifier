Ex-councillor protests against ‘encroachments’ in Shivpuri

Ludhiana: Alleging involvement of MC officials in allowing encroachments over reserved land in Shivpuri area, former councillor Bhairaj Singh held a protest outside MC zone D office on Thursday.

Holding documents in his hand to support his claim, Bhairaj alleged that he had made complaints to the MC commissioner as well as mayor, but to no avail.

He alleged that almost 2,500 square yards of land had been kept for some reserved purpose, but the land grabbers are gradually trying to encroach the land for the past few years. He alleged that MC officials are hand in gloves with the encroachers.

He requested chief minister Amarinder Singh and local bodies minister Navjot Sidhu to take care of the land for town planning scheme of Shivpuri as a case is pending in Punjab and Haryana high court but officials are least bothered about the court case.

Meanwhile, MC officials denied the allegations. Assistant town planner of zone A Mohan Singh said matter is in the high court where the commissioner, appointed by the HC to conduct an inquiry, gave his report saying that there was no encroachment on that land and people have documents to prove their ownership. He said these allegations are baseless.
