SVNIT fails to pay salary for June

SURAT: Employees and pensioners of Sardar Vallabhbhai National Institute of Technology (SVNIT) will again stage protest since they have not received their salary for the month of June. The aggrieved staffers made a representation to the SVNIT authorities on Tuesday and threatened to protest if they didn’t receive their salary at the earliest.A group of pensioners and employees submitted a letter to SVNIT director and told him during the meeting that it becomes difficult for them to manage their household without salary. They asked the institute to deposit the salary immediately now that 23 days have already elapsed.“Since last few months, the institute is passing through severe financial crisis. Employees remain worried because they don’t know whether they would receive their salary for the month or not. This is a very troublesome situation for everyone,” an employee said.“In the case of pensioners, the situation is much more difficult,” a retired professor said.“The institute is working to resolve this issue but until we receive grant from the government, we cannot pay salary to the staff. We have submitted the required papers to the department concerned in the government and hopefully the grant will be released soon,” said a senior officer of SVNIT.SVNIT didn’t receive annual grant of over Rs100 crore for two consecutive years from 2016 because it had failed to submit audited accounts of previous years. The institute is now facing trouble because of serious financial irregularities of the past, sources informed. In the absence of grant, the institute had earlier paid salary to the staff from its reserve funds but it has been instructed by the Ministry of Human Resource Development to not make salary payment from any other fund. In the current scenario, the institute is being given grant for one or two months only to pay salary unlike annual grant that used to be released earlier.
