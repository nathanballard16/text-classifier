Excelsior Correspondent

JAMMU, June 27: The Jammu Chamber of Commerce and Industry, president- Rakesh Gupta in a communication sent to Union Home Minister Amit Shah today protested against intentional targeting of business people of Jammu province.

The JCCI in its letter to Shah stated that the factual position pertains to the hallow claims being conveyed by the State Administration to the Government of India as well as the panic and scare created by the Income Tax Department and the State Taxes Department by intentionally targeting the business people of Jammu Province.

“We would like to submit that it is becoming common practice to conduct raids at the premises of business people particularly in Jammu Province which has left us perplexed, baffled and astonished. We would like to clarify that the JCCI has always stood by the Government as far as the collection of taxes is concerned because we strongly believe and advocate that the tax collections are imperative for the nation building,” JCCI letter said.

“It has been a practice in the business world to observe 3-5 holidays due to scorching heat in the month of June when the traders especially closedown their establishments and go for a holiday with their families. It is surprising that even during this period the Income Tax Department and the State Taxes Department are targeting the tax payers and raiding the closed establishments thus spoiling the family holidays.”

“We would like to reiterate with all our command and conviction that corruption is at its peak and being done by the Babus holding high positions and almost a situation of “Inspector Raj” is prevailing that is most unfortunate and unfriendly for the business world. The real culprits have been left free as the State Police Vigilance Department and the State Accountability Commission are almost non-functional. We would like to urge to your good selves to take effective corrective steps to pave the way for Central Investigating Agencies to take action and nail the real tax evaders who have accumulated enormous wealth through rampant corruption,” Chamber’s letter added.
