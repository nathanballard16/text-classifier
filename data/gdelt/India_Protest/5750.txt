Questions for Bilawal

Bilawal Bhutto Zardari led the Caravan-e-Bhutto’ train march from Karachi to Larkana against the PTI federal government and corruption. The train march reached its destination without any significant result.

I ask the chairman of the PPP to look at the Sindh government’s performance and not hide corruption done by his own party workers by blaming NAB and the PTI’s federal government. I ask the chairman PPP that what has been done by the PPP government in the last 10 years in Sindh. Almost 50 percent population of Sindh is living below the poverty line. According to the State Bank of Pakistan, Sindh is the second most affected province by poverty after Balochistan. The provincial government has failed to provide basic needs to the people of Sindh. Because of bad governance and corruption, unemployment is growing at an alarming rate as thousands of well educated and talented youth have been deprived of getting jobs on merit. I believe that our homeland can only progress if our institutions are stable. All political parties should come together and play a better role for a better Pakistan.
