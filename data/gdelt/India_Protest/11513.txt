Now there are 20 more speakers and then the minister would reply. We cannot make it a daily thing," Sharma saidHe said that the opposition was not against the bill."If we are told that so many bills have to be passed, it is not a factory producing bills. This is a legislature and must be respected," Sharma added.He was also supported by Ramgopal Yadav of SP and Tiruchi Siva of DMK."This bill is pending from a long time and as legislators we are sitting here to solve the problems of society," said Muraleedharan suggesting that the house sit till the bill is cleared.Responding to the opposition remarks, he said "passing a bill is not sin".Leader of the House Thaawarchand Gehlot said that the bill was important and needs to be passed as soon as possible.He also suggested withdrawing the names of his party members from the list of speakers for the discussion.Deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh also said that it was informed by the Chairman that the proceedings on the bill have to be completed today.
