Lakhs of people protest extradition bill, Hong Kong comes to a halt!

BEIJING: A massive demonstration with hundreds of thousands of protesters opposing Hong Kong government’s extradition bill converged on the Central.The amendment allows the chief executive of the autonomous city state to extradite local people charged with different offences to mainland China , without legislative oversight.The Hong Kong police put the number of protesters at 2,40,000, while organisers of the demonstration, mostly local activists, said that close to 10 lakh people took part.The protesters converged at the Central, the central business district of the city, where most government offices and commercial establishments are located.The government bill is due to be put to vote on June 12 and protesters are trying to block the process. Earlier, lawyers took out protest marches over the bill, while business associations voiced their concerns.Protesters said they feared justice would be denied to those taken across the sea to mainland China, instead of being tried in Hong Kong.Hong Kong, which has a democratically elected government, enjoys special autonomy status with its own set of laws which are different from mainland China. The city administration, however, says the bill is an important tool to fight international crime and maintain the rule of law.Police has given demonstrators a midnight deadline to disperse from the Central. There are no reports of violence from the scene, only a few scuffles with police. Police have arrested seven people though.Several activist groups including Civil Human Rights Front played important roles to organize the massive show of strength against the bill.“In any place where there are 1.03 million people marching ... any government should listen to people’s demands,” Jimmy Sham Tsz-kit, convener of the front said. Two pro-independence groups that organized the demonstration, the Student Localism and Students Independence Union, said they will continue to demonstrate outside the Legislative Council premises until the voting day.
