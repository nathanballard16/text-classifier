Mamata to attend TMC protest demonstration on Thursday

Within hours after her decision to skip Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing in ceremony, West Bengal Chief Minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee has decided to attend a protest demonstration of her party in North 24 Paraganas district on Thursday.

According to TMC sources, the chief minister will attend the protest demonstration being held against the alleged attacks on TMC workers by BJP cadres in the Naihati area of the district.

The demonstration will be held outside the Naihati Municipality. Out of 32 councilors of the Municipality, 29 joined the BJP on Tuesday in Delhi.

“The protest is being held against the violence of BJP goons who have forced our workers in Naihati to flee from their homes,” a senior TMC leader said.

The Municipality is located in the Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency, which has witnessed violent clashes between TMC and BJP workers during and after the Lok Sabha elections.

Two persons have died in these clashes so far. In the Lok Sabha elections, TMC candidate Dinesh Trivedu was defeated by BJP’s Arjun Singh, a former TMC MLA.

Clashes erupted between TMC and BJP cadres in the Kakinada and Bharpara area of Barrackpore soon after election results were declared. The bypoll for the Bhatpara Assembly constituency in Barrackpore was also marred with violence.
