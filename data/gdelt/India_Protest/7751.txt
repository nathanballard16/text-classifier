Hyderabad: Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) working chief Mohammad Azharuddin protested against the demolition of a 200-year-old mosque in Hyderabad demanding suspension of City Commissioner.

Azharuddin has demanded the removal of GHMC commissioner on Monday for alleged mishandling of historic monuments and asked the government to protect such sites.

"Recently, I came to know that Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) has demolished 200 years old masjid at Amberpet, locally known as Masjid-e-Ek-Khana," Azharuddin said.

"As per the reports, for the widening of the road, they have demolished an old monument. After protests by locals, a sum of Rs 2.5 crore as ex-gratia was paid to the masjid area encroachers" he added.

GHMC found itself in a controversy after a disused mosque in Hyderabad’s Amberpet area was demolished after paying compensation to its occupants. Following a controversy, the civic body tried to rebuild it which was opposed by another group.

A local outfit organised a march to the site of the demolished mosque but the Hyderabad police refused to provide security for the march and beefed up its presence.

Police commissioner Anjani Kumar stated that no unlawful gathering would be permitted in Amberpet.

As per reports, after the outfit’s call, a group of activists arrived to offer prayers at the site. The police personnel deployed in the area asked them to leave following which the former started raising slogans. Later, 77 people including activists of certain outfits were taken into custody and were released in the evening to break their fast.
