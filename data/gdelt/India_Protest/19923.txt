Protest Over Citizen Amendment Bill in Patna

Patna: A number of activist groups in Patna on Tuesday took out protest march against the Modi government's Citizen Amendment Bill (CAB) saying the bill was against the basic tenet of the Indian Constitution and must not be allowed to become a law of the land.

In a march organized by the All India Student Federation (AISF) in which leaders from the Congress and Communist Party of India (CPI) participated, leftist leader and former candidate for the Lok Sabha Kanhaiya Kumar and others burnt the copies of the proposed bill and announced the decision to observe a statewide protest in Bihar on Wednesday and Thursday.

Calling the bill 'communal' and 'divisive', the former president of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was hellbent on destroying the legacy of Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary and instead was determined to turn India into a narrow, parochial country.

"Everyone knows that India is going through a serious economic meltdown and the BJP is engaging into useless shenanigans to divert the mind of the people from serious issues. You cannot accord citizenship on the basis of one's religion and that is exactly what Narendra Modi and his men are doing," Kanhaiya Kumar said.

Congress legislator Shakeel Ahmed called the bill unconstitutional and said that it would be challenged in the court.

A number of other political outfits also took out separate protest rallies in different parts of the state capital.
