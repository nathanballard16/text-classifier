Salman Khan's security tightened after Karni Sena files complaint over 'Bigg Boss 13'; 20 arrested outside his house

Since a few days, #BanBiggBoss had taken over Twitter. While Bigg Boss 13 found a few fans, some others protested towards ban on the show. The fury for Salman Khan's show emerged right after the launch of the show, and now various organizations have demaded a ban on the popular reality show.

Among these organizations are Confederation Of All India Traders (CAIT), and the Rajasthan-based infamous organization Karni Sena. While the former protested against the show, Karni Sena filed a complaint over the show. They wrote to Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar, with complains that Bigg Boss is insulting Hindu culture and traditions. This caused Salman Khan's security to tighten for his safety.

The organizations demand ban on the show over the concept of 'Bed Friends Forever'. The latest season of Salman Khan's show - 'Bigg Boss 13', has housemates sharing their bed with one another. While Bigg Boss decided their bed partners on first day, the contestants are now free to choose their bed partner by themselves. There have thus been allegations that Salman Khan's show is obscene and maligns Indian culture.

Bollywood Hungama had previously reported that 20 protestors were arrested outside of Salman Khan's house on Friday. More so, a man named Updesh Rana reportedly posted a video where he warns Salman Khan, standing outside the actor's house. Not only Khan, Rana also warned makers to stop spreading obscenity in the Bigg Boss house.
