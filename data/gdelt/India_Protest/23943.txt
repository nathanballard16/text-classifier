Similar protests took place in other parts of the state while in Madurai, the police slapped cases against 1,384 protesters.

A large number of women too joined the protest holding placards in Chepauk. Members of CPM distributed pamphlets in Thousand Lights area. Members of the All India Youth Federation and other youth organisations raised slogans denouncing the Centre and as they marched towards the Raj Bhavan. The police put up barricades and prevented them from proceeding further.

Members of the Hindu Munnani led by their leader Arjun Sampath staged a demonstration, holding placards at Valluvar Kottam here condemning the anti-CAA protesters.

Reacting to the agitations against the Act, BJP senior L. Ganesan claimed that the opposition parties were misleading the people on the issue.
