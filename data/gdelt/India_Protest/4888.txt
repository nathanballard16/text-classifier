Xiaomi Redmi Go could launch in India on March 19 as company sends invite

Xiaomi sends out invites for March 19 event, likely to launch Redmi Go

Xiaomi Redmi Go could launch in India as soon as next week. Xiaomi, the recently crowned king of the smartphone market in India appears to be going for the kill. The smartphone maker recently launched the Redmi Note 7 and Note 7 Pro smartphones in India. The phones were received quite well by the audiences with the two going out of stock within seconds after going on sale for the first time earlier this month. However, the company doesn't appear to be in a mood to rest on this achievement and has now sent out an invite for the launch of what appears to be a new smartphone - Xiaomi Redmi Go. According to an invite sent out by Xiaomi, the company is holding an event on March 19 in Delhi. Although it has not confirmed anything, the invite does, however, highlight the word "GO" in a rather colour font.

The Redmi Go which already launched in China is Xiaomi's first Android Go device. The smartphone which comes running the lightweight version of Android Orea also brings with it Snapdragon 425 paired with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. There's also an 8-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera available to use on the device.

If launched on the 19th, the Redmi Go is expected to become the most affordable smartphone in the Redmi lineup. There have been previous reports which have hinted at a Rs 3,499 price tag for the device. However, knowing Xiaomi, the company could very well spring a surprise and bring the device at a more aggressive price via the help of offers and discounts.

For now, however, we can only. But one thing is almost certain, once the device makes way to the Indian market, the Xiaomi's Redmi Go should make for an interesting device in the ultra-affordable segment of the market.
