Farooq to Modi: ‘BJP is thief, Modi looted India. Where is money?’

Following the statement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi pointing fingers at Jammu Kashmir’s political parties, National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah said, “Before pointing fingers at us, he (Modi) should first see his actions, and how he has ruined this state in the past five years, isn’t it enough for him.”

Mr. Abdullah added that Mr. Modi’s thinking is very negative, and it has always been so. “BJP is a thief. I want to ask him where are those 30,000 crore rupees? Have you dug a well? Where have you kept all the money? You have looted India.”

“I am ready to go the jail, he can come and rule this state; but to rule the hearts, you should first understand the hearts. Don’t just point fingers on people.”

Talking about the 35A article, he said if anything happens to the article, the situation is going to get worse. In an interview with News18, Mr. Modi had said that Kashmiris problem is due to 50 odd political families who have been milking the issue and people want to get freedom from them.
