Titu Bania to do ‘dance protest’ against Phoolka outside Punjab house

Ludhiana: After raising the issue of non-acceptance of resignation of Dhaka MLA HS Phoolka, comedian Titu Bania has now threatened to protest against Vidhan Sabha speaker Rana KP Singh for his failure to accept Phoolka’s resignation. Interestingly, Titu has decided to register his protest by dancing outside the Punjab assembly along with ‘band baja’.Meanwhile, Titu — who unsuccessfully contested the recently-held MP elections — said: “It is very unfortunate that a highly educated person like HS Phoolka has acted in such a foolish manner and ditched the people of his constituency who risked their lives and opposed parties like Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) and Congress, and made Phoolka victorious. Phoolka did not do any development work in the constituency ever since winning, and now with him resigning, even the smallest of our work is not being done in any of the government offices. Adding to our agony is the inordinate delay being caused by Vidhan Sabha speaker and Congress government to accept the resignation of Phoolka and fix the date of elections for the next MLA of Dakha.”Titu also added: “It clearly seems that the state government and speaker are in no mood to respect the sentiments of people and accept Phoolka’s resignation, so I have decided to protest outside the Punjab assembly. As soon as the dates of the next session are announced, I along with ‘band baja’ will carry out a protest outside the Punjab assembly, and we will also dance outside the assembly to express our anger.”Titu, who apart from being a comedian is a mechanic, and known for holding unique protests, recently held a three- wheeler protest against HS Phoolka and the speaker Rana KP Singh at Dakha, and prior to that, he also protested by dancing on the gabage dumps to express resentment against the local bodies department for its failure to get rid of garbage from Dakha constituency.
