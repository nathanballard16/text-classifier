PM Narendra Modi begins Northeast tour, AASU stages protest

MEMBERS OF the All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) on Friday evening showed black flags to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, as his convoy passed the organisation’s office in Guwahati on way to Raj Bhavan.

The protesters, barricaded inside the office by police, raised slogans like “Joy Aai Axom” (Glory to Mother Assam) and raised black flags as the convoy passed. Many BJP supporters too were present at the spot to show their strength against the AASU members.
