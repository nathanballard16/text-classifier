Minority community in western parts of Godhra observes bandh

The Panchmahal police maintained elaborate security, particularly in Godhra, in wake of the bandh call

Vadodara: Areas in Godhra with predominantly large population of minority community observed a near total bandh on Thursday to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Messages appealing people from the community to stay away from work and observe a strike had been circulated widely on Wednesday. The Panchmahal police maintained elaborate security, particularly in Godhra, in wake of the bandh call.

Apart from business establishments, schools in the minority-dominated areas of Godhra remained closed. Several employees also preferred to stay away from work. Sources said that auto-rickshaw drivers preferred staying away from the railway station in wake of the bandh call. The municipal bus service ensured that passengers alighting at the railway station got transportation.

Panchmahal district superintendent of police, Leena Patil, however, said that the municipality operates buses to the railway station regularly and was merely asked to ensure that service continues even on bandh day. She added that the bandh call was in effect in only the western parts of the Godhra town where the minority community population is high.
