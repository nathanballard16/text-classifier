Air Canada to resume full India travel schedule following airspace closure

Air Canada will be resuming its daily, non-stop flights to northern India later this year as tensions with Pakistan continue to ease.

This comes a week after Pakistan reopened its airspace for international civil aviation.

According to the airline, Toronto to Delhi flights will be resuming on October 1 (eastbound) and on October, 3 (westbound). Additional flights on this route will also be added on October 27.

Seasonal flights between Toronto and Mumbai will also be coming back into service on October 27 and will operate four times weekly until March 28, 2020, with Boeing 777-200LR aircraft.

As for west coast travellers, Vancouver to Delhi flights will resume on August 1 and will continue with their usual flight times, according to the airline.

Air Canada says it will now have up to 18 weekly flights connecting a multitude of cities in North America to Delhi from both Toronto and Vancouver, and to Mumbai from Toronto.

Mark Galardo, Vice President, Network Planning at Air Canada, said the airline is very pleased to resume its service in time for Diwali celebrations.

“With our Delhi flights returning to normal together with our seasonal return to Mumbai for fall firmly demonstrating our long term commitment to this vibrant market, we look forward to operating our full schedule to India,” said Galardo in a statement.

This will be the first time in nearly five months that Air Canada’s full-service to India is operating after the Toronto and Vancouver routes were among the many disrupted this past February after Pakistan closed its airspace.
