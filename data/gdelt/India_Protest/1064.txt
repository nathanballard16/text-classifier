The Observatory has been informed byreliable sources about the judicial harassment against Messrs. Hiren Gohain, Akhil Gogoi and Manjit Mahanta,in relation to their participation in a peaceful protest against the Citizenship(Amendment) Bill in Guwahati, Assam State, to oppose the discriminatorycharacter of the proposed legislation.

Hiren Gohain, one ofAssam's most prominent scholar and intellectual, Akhil Gogoi, President of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti(KMSS)[1], and Manjit Mahanta, Convenor of theForum against Citizenship Act Amendment Bill, under Sections 120(B)(“punishment of criminal conspiracy”), 121 (“wagingor attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war, against the Government”),123 (“concealing with intent to facilitatedesign to wage war”), and 124(A) (“sedition”) of the Indian Penal Code.

On January 11, 2019, the Gauhati High Court granted bail to Mr.Manjit Mahanta and interim bail to Messrs.Hiren Gohain and Akhil Gogoi against a surety ofRs. 5,000 each (around 61,5 Euros), and fixed January 22, 2019 as the next dateof hearing of the case.

The case was filed after Messrs. Hiren Gohain, Akhil Gogoi and ManjitMahanta attended a public rally organized by the Forum against Citizenship ActAmendment Bill in Latasil, Guwahati, on January 7, 2019, during which theyexpressed their views against the religion-basedCitizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016 and strongly opposed the passing ofthis piece of legislation[2]. Despite their opposition to the Bill, the threehuman rights defenders have publicly stated that they are not againstthe Constitution of India, and are solely asking for equal constitutionalprotection for the people of Assam State.

TheObservatory recalls also that in 2017 Mr. Akhil Gogoi had already been charged with sedition for expressing his criticismsagainst the policies of the Government of Assam State as well as theCitizenship (Amendment) Bill[3].

TheObservatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders (the Observatory) wascreated in 1997 by the World Organisation Against Torture (OMCT) and FIDH. Theobjective of this programme is to prevent or remedy situations of repressionagainst human rights defenders. OMCT and FIDH are both members of ProtectDefenders.eu, theEuropean Union Human Rights Defenders Mechanism implemented by internationalcivil society.



Founded byMr. Akhil Gogoi in 2005, KMSS worksnotably in favour of land rights and since 2009 has also been leading a statewide movement against construction of big damsin the ecologically sensitive regions of Assam State and Arunachal PradeshState.

Amidst and ahead of thepassing of the Citizenship Amendment Bill at the Lok Sabha (the Lower House ofIndia’s Parliament) on January 8, 2019, there was widespread protest throughoutthe North Eastern states of India against the said Bill, which seeks to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs,Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistanwho had entered the State by December 31, 2014 and if they have lived in Indiafor six years. Not only does it violate Article 14 of the Constitution thatguarantees right to equality, but it also contradicts the citizenship cut-offdate of March 24, 1971 that was decided in the Assam Accord. This also implies that illegalmigrants who are Muslims or atheists will not be eligible for a citizenship.People in Assam areagainst this differential treatment to illegal migrants on the basis of theirreligion. The Assamese also fear that the Bill will make them a minority intheir own homeland.
