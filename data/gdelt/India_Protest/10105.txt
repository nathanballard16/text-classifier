A Global Gay Pride Weekend, in Photos

Parades to celebrate gay pride were held around the world this weekend, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising in New York.

It was a day to recognize gains — and demand new ones.

In Istanbul, participants were forced to disperse after the Turkish police fired tear gas and rubber bullets, and in Singapore participants protested anti-gay statutes.

But in North Macedonia, revelers gathered for the Balkan country’s first Pride parade. And in Paris, they braved sweltering heat to turn out for the city’s annual festivities.
