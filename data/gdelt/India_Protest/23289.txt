Thousands Protests Against New Citizenship Law at Jama Masjid in Delhi

Protesters held an unsanctioned demonstration against a new citizenship law at the Jama Masjid mosque in New Delhi on Friday, December 20. The UN has described the law as “fundamentally discriminatory” against Muslims.

The act, which the government said was intended to protect minorities who had entered India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, gives a pathway to citizenship for listed religious groups. Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians are all included under the legislation; Muslims are not.

Protests have been ongoing in the country since the bill was passed on Wednesday, December 11, with numerous violent clashes between demonstrators and police forces reported. At least three people were killed on Thursday, December 10, according to the Times of India. Credit: Irshad Amhed via Storyful
