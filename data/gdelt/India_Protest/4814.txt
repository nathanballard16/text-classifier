With NE tie-ups, NDA now has 36 partners

NEW DELHI: Confident of reaping electoral dividends over the Centre's welfare schemes as also hoping to ride the 'national security' narrative post Balakot strikes, BJP has continued to stitch fresh alliances, swelling the number of NDA partners.The latest are the parties in the north-east, including AGP and Bodo People's Front, AAJSU in Jharkhand and DMDK in Tamil Nadu. In fact in Assam, it's turnaround for AGP which had quit the NDA protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Bill.With the latest additions, BJP general secretary Bhupinder Yadav claimed NDA had a record "36 allies" under its belt.Party general secretary and north-east in-charge Ram Madhav, the brain behind the tie-ups in the region, is optimistic of the region playing a crucial role in re-election of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. "While opposition is talking and talking about Mahagathbandhan, we already have ours in place in north-east and the rest of the country. The NDA is a much stronger coalition than before," Madhav said.BJP managed to revive its tie-up with AGP and Bodoland People's Front after several rounds of persuasions with the talks led by state minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, who is also the chairman of BJP-led North East Development Alliance (NEDA).The saffron party has been "highly flexible" in accommodating the new allies, like it offered the sitting Giridih seat in Jharkhand to All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU), from where its president Sudesh Mahto is poised to contest as NDA candidate. In Tamil Nadu, after AIADMK, it added DMDK to NDA's kitty.While the much hyped "grand alliance" of opposition is yet to take off with regional parties not keen on sharing political space with Congress, BJP has managed to win over several new allies as compared to 2014. During Atal-Advani phase, when BJP became the rallying point of anti-Congress parties, NDA had 24 partners.Shiv Sena (Maharashtra), JDU (Bihar), Akali Dal (Punjab), AIADMK in Tamil Nadu are the larger parties.
