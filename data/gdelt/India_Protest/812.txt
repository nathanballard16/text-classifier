Ahmedabad Metro project: IL&FS contract to be terminated, work awarded to JKIL

"Measures will be taken to encash the bank guarantee given by IL&FS Engineering on termination of its contract," GMRC said. After IL&FS Engineering stopped work altogether in November, in the wake of financial crisis in parent company IL&FS, it was issued a notice for termination of the contract. The Gujarat Metro Rail Corporation (GMRC), which is developing the Ahmedabad Metro rail project, has decided to terminate the contract of IL&FS Engineering, and award the balance work to J Kumar Infrastructure Limited (JKIL), officials said. IL&FS Engineering was awarded the Rs 374.64 crore contract for construction of four Metro stations at APMC, Jivraj park, Bhavnagar, and Shreyas, and the 4.6 km viaduct in from APMC to Shreyas, in December 2015. GMRC said on Thursday that it has decided to award the balance work to JKIL.
