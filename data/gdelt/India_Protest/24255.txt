CAA stir: German IIT-Madras student asked to leave India for violating visa rules

CHENNAI: Jakob Lindenthal, an exchange student from Dresden, Germany , who was pursuing MSc physics at IIT , Madras, was asked to leave the country for taking part in a protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Chennai last week. He had one more semester to complete on campus before his scheduled return in May 2020.Jakob left for the airport on Monday evening soon after immigration officials and college authorities conveyed the decision to him. During a protest at Valluvar Kottam in Chennai last week, he was seen holding a placard that read ‘1933-45. We have been there’, hinting at the Nazi regime’s persecution of the Jews.Jakob confirmed to TOI that he was asked to leave the country for participating in an anti-CAA protest. “Yes it’s true. All interaction was oral,” he said. Asked about his reaction to the instruction, the exchange student from Technische Universität Dresden, messaged: “I love India and the friends I made here. Many of them I will see again abroad because they dislike the authoritarian developments of the past years as well. For now, I hope to reach home safely.”Sources in the immigration department said a foreigner participating in a political activity or protest is a violation of visa norms. “Such a violation attracts deportation. We also do an inquiry,” an official said, without confirming whether a written order was issued to Jakob.Calls and messages to IIT Madras director Bhaskar Ramamurthi went unresponded.
