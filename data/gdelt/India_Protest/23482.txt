New Delhi: BJP MP Subramanian Swamy on Saturday launched a blistering attack on Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi calling her a "Nazi". He accused her of triggering the anti-CAA uprising on a lie that the citizenship law is "anti-Muslim".

Subramanian Swamy took to his official Twitter handle saying, "The true Nazis are the Nazi soldier's daughter led an uprising on a lie that CAA is anti-Muslim! If you are pro Hindu then you must be anti-Muslim. If you are pro Muslim you are secular."

The BJP leader's comments have come a day after Sonia Gandhi shared a video on social media where she attacked the Modi government for "using brute force to suppress dissent".

She also said that everybody in a democracy has a right to protest and that the Congress stands by the students and citizens protesting against the controversial Act.

"The CAA is discriminatory and the proposed NRC will target the poor and vulnerable sections of the society," she further said in the video message.

A host of senior Congress leaders have joined the anti-CAA protests across the country and vehemently demanding that the contentious Act be revoked.

On the other hand, BJP has accused the Congress-led opposition parties of spreading misinformation on CAA and NRC and instigating the protests.

More than two dozen people have died in anti-CAA protests and over 150 protesters have been detained across the country so far. Section 144 and internet restrictions have been imposed in several districts.
