BJP-Shiv Sena govt 'expert' at making announcements, record in implementing programmes poor: Maharashtra Congress president Balasaheb Thorat-Politics News , Firstpost

State Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said that 'the BJP-Shiv Sena government in Maharashtra is an 'expert' in making announcements and its record in implementing programmes has been poor'.

Mumbai: The BJP-Shiv Sena government in Maharashtra is an "expert" in making announcements and its record in implementing programmes has been poor, state Congress president Balasaheb Thorat said on Monday.

He said the crop loan waiver scheme announced by the government more than two years ago has failed to alleviate the suffering of farmers in the state, which goes to the polls in the next few months.

Speaking to reporters in Amravati, around 600 kilometres from Mumbai, Thorat said, "Not a single announcement made by the state government has been fulfilled in the last five years.

"The Congress is holding a pol khol yatra across the state to expose the government's false promises. Thorat launched the Congress' yatra from Amravati to counter Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis `Mahajanadesh Yatra', which also started from the same district in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra.

"The crop loan waiver scheme has failed to ease the pain of farmers. The Shiv Sena is holding marches against crop insurance companies, but it did not utter a word on the issue in the assembly, Thorat alleged.

"Unemployment is growing in the state, but the government is keen on favouring corporates and builders, the former minister said.
