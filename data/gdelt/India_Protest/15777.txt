Rajnath Singh calls on French President, discusses defence ties - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

PARIS, Oct 8: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh called on French President Emmanuel Macron here on Tuesday and the two leaders discussed stronger India-France defence and strategic ties during their “very warm and productive” meeting.

Singh arrived in France on Monday for an official handover ceremony of the first Rafale fighter jet acquired by the Indian Air Force (IAF).

During the meeting at Elysee Palace here, the official base of the French President, the two leaders comprehensively discussed key aspects of bilateral defence partnership and resolved to continue strengthening the ties between the two countries.

“I thanked President Macron for his strong support to further intensifying our strategic partnership, especially in the defence sector, with India and for our ‘Make in India’ initiatives,” Singh said after the 35-minute meeting.

He also thanked the French President for the strong support by France to India’s strategic interests and principles, including in fighting terrorism.

The meeting was described by the ministry of defence as “very warm and productive”.

“The meeting demonstrated the depth of India-France bilateral partnership, especially in the defence sector, that has significantly strengthened in recent times. Both leaders resolved to take the relationship to the next higher level,” the ministry said in a statement.

Singh also expressed condolences on the demise of former French President Jacques Chirac on behalf of the Indian government, saying Chirac had played a decisive role in forging India-France Strategic Partnership.

“We have a multi-dimensional relationship with France and the ties are progressing on all fronts. The talks today are part of a comprehensive defence dialogue between the two countries,” said Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar, who is part of the ministerial delegation to France.

Singh also held discussions with France’s Armed Forces minister Florence Parly. Admiral Bernard Rogel, Defence Advisor to the French President, was also present at the meeting.

After the talks, Singh travelled to Merignac, a suburb of the south-western French town of Bordeaux, where participated in a tour of the facility of Rafale manufacturer Dassault Aviation before a symbolic ribbon-cutting ceremony for the first Rafale combat jet.

The minister performed a brief Shastra Puja on the new aircraft as he emblazoned it with an ‘Om’ tilak and laid flowers and a coconut, just before he was to take off in it for a sortie in the newly-acquired two-seater jet.

“It is indeed a great honour to be able to fly in this new fighter jet,” said 68-year-old Singh, just before takeoff.

On September 19, Singh flew in the Tejas fighter aircraft from the HAL airport in Bengaluru, becoming the first defence minister to fly in the indigenously-built light combat aircraft (LCA).

The ceremony coincided with the foundation day of the Indian Air Force as well as the Dussehra celebrations.

“Greetings to all IAF personnel and their families on the 87th IAF Day,” Singh tweeted.

“The IAF is the shining example of exemplary courage, fortitude, determination and impeccable service to our nation. These men and women in Blue have the ability to touch the sky with grit and glory,” he said.
