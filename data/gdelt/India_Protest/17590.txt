Progressive Democratic Front MLC V. Balasubramanyam criticised the decision taken by Chief Minister Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy and said it would have adverse effect on the children.

“The decision taken by the Chief Minister will have a serious impact on 24 lakh students According to UNESCO, it is estimated that 5.75 million children are suffering from malnutrition as they skip mid-day meals and school as the medium of instruction is not in their mother tongue,” said Mr. Balasubramanyam.

“All the other States in the country are pushing to safeguard their respective languages, but the Andhra Pradesh government is doing the reverse. Revoking Telugu as the medium of instruction and replacing it with English all of a sudden will not only affect the students but also the teachers as they are not trained in teach in that language,” said Babu Reddy, Secretary, Andhra Pradesh United Teachers’ Federation.

Activists of the Students Federation of India, Democratic Youth Federation of India, Kula Vivaksha Porata Sangham and other organisaions participated in the protest.
