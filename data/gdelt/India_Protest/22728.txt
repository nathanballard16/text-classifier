New Delhi: The Noida Traffic Police on Thursday evening announced that the Kalindi Kunj road, which connects Delhi and Noida, will remain closed on Friday and commuters taking that route are advised to opt for alternative routes.

"Due to the protest demonstration at Jamia Milia Islamia on December 15 and in pursuance of directions from Delhi police, the diversion on the Kalindi Kunj route will continue on December 20 (Friday). People are advised to take alternative routes - DND and Chilla - for travelling to Delhi," the Noida Traffic police tweeted.

The Kalindi Kunj road, which is an important route connecting Delhi and Noida, has been shut since December 15 due to ongoing protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in the national capital.

Earlier in the day, enrty/exit gates of at least 20 metro stations in Delhi, including Rajiv Chowk and Mandi House, were closed in the wake of anti-CAA protests. After hours of closure, 18 metro stations were reopened for public use in the evening.

Delhi is witnessing massive protests against the contentious citizenship law, which provides citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan living in the country. The protesters are demanding revocation of the amended act calling it discriminatory in nature.
