II PU exam results to be announced on Monday, April 15

Bengaluru, 13 Apr: The department of pre-university education (DPUE) on Friday said results of the II PU exams held in March will be announced at noon on April 15.

This is the first time that results of second-year PU exams will be declared before the Common Entrance Test (CET) is held. CET 2019 is scheduled for April 29, 30 and May 1.

DPUE director C Shikha said results will be announced at the office at 11am on Monday and students can check them after noon on pue.kar.nic.in and karresults.nic.in. She also said colleges in the state will publish the results on April 16.

As many as 6.6 lakh students appeared for the II PU exams held between March 1 and 18. About 2,500 students were denied hall tickets due to shortage of attendance (less than 75%). For the first time, the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) syllabus was implemented for economics, business studies and accounts.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka Examinations Authority (KEA) has said students appearing for CET can download the hall tickets from kea.kar.nic.

II PU results are being announced before completion of CET to ensure there’s no pressure on students ahead of entrance exams. Former director of the department, PC Jaffer, had hinted at the early announcement of II PU results. Jaffer was recently posted as Mandya deputy commissioner and Shikha replaced him.

According to department sources, they are expecting a dip in the number of candidates appearing for CET because of early announcement of II PU results. Students who secure less marks in the science stream or a low aggregate may not take CET. However, officials have advised students not to skip CET even if they fail to clear II PU exams as they can do better in supplementary exams.
