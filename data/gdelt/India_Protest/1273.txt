Mahagathbandhan against the people, says Narendra Modi

Addressing a public function at Silvassa, he takes potshots at the Opposition rally in Kolkata.

On a day when many Opposition parties came together on a common platform in Kolkata, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hit out at their proposed grand alliance, saying it was a combine of those whom he had prevented from “looting” India and it was not against him but the people of the country.

He took a dig at the Opposition rally and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, saying the BJP had only one MLA in her State, “but still they are so afraid of us that they are saying bachao (save us)”.

“The grand alliance is not against Narendra Modi but the people of India,” Mr. Modi said at a public function at Silvassa, the capital of the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, after laying the foundation stone for a medical college.

“My actions against corruption made some people angry as I prevented them from looting public money. They have formed the mahagathbandhan,” he said, adding that these leaders have come together out of fear.

Against the backdrop of the West Bengal government denying permission to the BJP to organise yatras, Mr. Modi said political parties in the Trinamool-ruled State were not even allowed to carry out their programmes. “Party workers are killed there during elections and they talk about saving democracy. When those involved in suffocating democracy talk of saving it, then people will say, ‘Wah kya baat hai...’,” he said.
