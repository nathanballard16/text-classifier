Citizenship Act protests HIGHLIGHTS: CMs who opposed NRC should stop NPR process as well, says CPI(M)

Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Protest Today HIGHLIGHTS: Hours after the Union Cabinet approved a proposal to conduct Census 2021 and updation of National Population Register (NPR), the CPI(M) Tuesday said that all chief ministers who opposed the NRC should also stop the National Population Register process.

“NPR=NRC. How much more will the Modi government lie and mislead the people? It was stated clearly on the record in the Rajya Sabha by this government that the National Population Register is the base document from where the NRC work will start,” CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury said.

In Bengal, leading the protest from Swami Vivekanada statue at Bidhan Sarani in north Kolkata, CM Mamata Banerjee Tuesday accused PM Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah of creating confusion over the impending National Register of Citizens (NRC). “The prime minister is saying there has been no discussion or proposal on NRC. But a few days ago, BJP president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah had said NRC exercise would be carried out across the country. Both the statements are contradictory. We wonder who is speaking the truth. They are trying to create confusion,” Mamata said in a rally.

Meanwhile, the Karnataka government has ordered a magisterial inquiry into the violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act in Mangaluru last week which resulted in two deaths. The state government, in an order passed on Monday, said it has appointed the Deputy Commissioner of Udupi district G Jagadish as the executive magistrate to inquire into the incident and submit a report within three months.

Congress leaders Rahul and Priyanka Gandhi, earlier today, were stopped from entering Meerut by the police. They were on their way to meet families of those killed in violence that broke out during protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.
