Indian citizenship bill for illegal Non-Muslim immigrants challenged at the Supreme Court

COLOMBO (News 1st) – The Indian citizenship amendment bill that grants citizenship to Non-Muslim illegal immigrants, has been challenged in the Supreme Court. The Indian Union Muslim League, a political party, has petitioned the court to declare the bill illegal.

In their petition to the Supreme Court, the Indian Union Muslim League argued that the bill violated articles of equality, fundamental rights and the right to life.

The Indian parliament yesterday (December 11), passed the bill which applies to migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.

It will become a law once the President of India signs it, which is a formality at this stage.

The Citizenship Amendment Bill triggered huge protests in the north-eastern state of Assam, forcing authorities to declare a curfew and shut down internet services.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi sought to reassure people in Assam, telling them they had “nothing to worry” about.

In a tweet, he said, “The Central Government and I are totally committed to constitutionally safeguard the political, linguistic, cultural and land rights of the Assamese people,”.

However, the situation in Assam remains tense, as people defied curfew to protest in the state capital, Guwahati, this morning.

Protests have also taken place in the north-eastern state of Tripura which borders Bangladesh.

Earlier today, the army was called into north-eastern India, after thousands of people defied curfews to protest against the new citizenship bill.
