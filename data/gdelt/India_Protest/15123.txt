DMK and its allies to stage protest against corporation on October 10

COIMBATORE: After the Madras high court stayed their bandh call, DMK and its allies have decided to stage a protest at South Taluk office near Red Cross building in the city on October 10 against the city corporation for handing over 24*7 water supply project to a French company and hiking property tax by 100%.The Madras high court on Wednesday (September 25) restrained DMK and its allies from holding bandh in the district against the city corporation on Friday (September 27).Citing the court direction, the city police also denied permission to the parties to stage protest on the same day.In this backdrop, DMK MLA and district in-charge N Karthik held a meeting with functionaries of alliance parties including Congress and CPM in the city on Friday.In the meeting, the parties decided to stage a massive protest wearing black shirts in the city against the corporation on October 10.Karthik said, “Obeying the order of the Madras high court, we didn’t hold bandh in Coimbatore. Instead, we would continue to protest against the corporation and the state government in a democratic way. We would be staging a protest on October 10.”Even since the corporation was formed, water distribution within the city was handled by the corporation, he said. But now, the civic body has handed over the water distribution system to a French company for 26 years, he said, questioning the need to sign an agreement for such a long time.On corporation officials recently publicizing two memorandums signed in 2008 and 2011, he said, “We had never opposed the project. We are only raising objection to the contract signed by the corporation with the private company which is highly criticized.”Meanwhile, about 50% of Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) affiliated to Kovai Power Driven Pumps and Spares Manufacturers Association (KOPMA) in the district closed their business on Friday.“Many MSMEs have lost their businesses and are in poor state after the central government increased Goods and Service Tax (GST) from 5% to 18% for job works. At this time, the increase in property tax has come as a severe blow to the enterprises. With the increase in property tax, the rent of the buildings would also be increasing tremendously. More than 70% of the enterprises function from rented buildings,” president of the association K Maniraj said.The association has estimated loss at Rs 5 crore because of Friday’s shutdown.“We are not even asking the government to withdraw the tax hike but to postponed collecting tax along with the arrears,” he said, adding that their move was to grab the attention of the state government.
