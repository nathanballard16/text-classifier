PM Modi launches Twitter campaign backing CAA

Amid nationwide protests against the newly-enacted citizenship law, Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi on Monday, December 30, launched a Twitter campaign backing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019.

The CAA does not take away the citizenship of any Indian national, said Prime Minister Mr. Modi, tweeting on the Twitter account of his personal website and Narendra Modi Mobile App. “#IndiaSupportsCAA because CAA is about giving citizenship to persecuted refugees & not about taking anyone’s citizenship away,” read the tweet.

Sharing a video of spiritual leader Sadhguru talking about the CAA and highlighting the misinformation being spread by the vested groups, PM Mr. Modi tweeted, “Do hear this lucid explanation of aspects relating to CAA and more by @SadhguruJV. He provides historical context, brilliantly highlights our culture of brotherhood. He also calls out the misinformation by vested interest groups. #IndiaSupportsCAA.”
