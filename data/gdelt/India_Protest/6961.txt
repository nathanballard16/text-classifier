Students block Minister’s convoy

Education Minister G. Jagadish Reddy was in for a rude shock on Thursday, in what was perhaps his first ‘convoy blockade’ by student leaders who demanded his resignation over Intermediate evaluation ‘fraud’.

Leaders of the Students’ Federation of India – Nalgonda unit, raised shouting slogans against the Minister and the government when Mr. Reddy’s convoy was to approach a function hall at Narketpally, to attend the party's preparatory meeting on ZPTC elections.

“Shame..Shame. You are responsible for the death of Inter students, you should resign,” they shouted as the police intervened and pulled them away. They said that Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao, even after holding a review on Wednesday, has not acted against any official or the Minister. “Re-evaluation and recounting fee should be waived for all students,” they demanded.

The Narketpally police detained the protesting leaders at the police station till the completion of TRS party meeting.
