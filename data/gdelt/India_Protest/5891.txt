Lok Sabha election: EC issues notice to UP CM Yogi Adityanath over his 'Modi ki sena' remarks

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday slammed the Congress, terming its manifesto as a "hypocrisy document" which was "full of lies". Addressing his second rally in Arunachal Pradesh within a week, the prime minister cited the Congress manifesto for the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, and said it had promised that every house would have electricity by 2009. "However, till 2014 around 18,000 houses were unelectrified... Just like them (the Congress), their manifesto is corrupt and full of lies. Therefore, it should be called hypocrisy document, not a manifesto," PM Modi said. He also said the Lok Sabha poll will be about the fight between "trust and corruption, and about resolution and conspiracy".

The prime minister also kickstarted his campaign in West Bengal. The PM held two rallies, one from Siliguri and another at the Brigade Parade Ground in Kolkata. West Bengal CM and Trinamool Congress (TMC) president Mamata Banerjee also held a rally in the state. CM Banerjee also held er first public meeting for the general election in Dinhata.

Banerjee, who was earlier scheduled to begin her campaign meetings on April 4 in North Bengal, has preponed it by a day to address the rally at Dinhata in Coochbehar constituency, which goes to polls in the first phase. BJP state chief Dilip Ghosh claimed that people in North Bengal will go to hear the Prime Minister at Siliguri. "Who will go to Dinhata?" he asked. The distance between Dinhata and Siliguri is about 170 km by road.

Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan will address two poll rallies in Chhattisgarh's Naxal-hit Bastar constituency. The Bastar seat will alone go to polls in the state in the first phase of elections on April 11. Chouhan's public meetings will be held in Sukma and Kondagaon districts. Congress chief Rahul Gandhi will visit Nagaland, Assam and Meghalaya where he will hold rallies.
