Employees begin hunger strike over Jaipur airport privatisation

Jaipur: The Adani Group won the bid for Jaipur International Airport on Monday amid protests by the employees’ union. Since then, the employees have been protesting against this move.Ravinder Singh, union secretary, Jaipur Airport Employees, told TOI, “The privatisation of the airports serves no purpose especially because hundreds of crores have already been sanctioned for Jaipur Airport. Just few days back it was also announced that Jaipur airport’s parking bays will increase from existing 14 to 46 at a cost of Rs 110 crore. This means costlier commercial facilities at the airport like parking fee, eating outlets etc,” said an airport official. Adani Group won the bid at Rs 174 per passenger.
