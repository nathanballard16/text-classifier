Leader of the Congress party in Lok Sabhaon Friday accusedPolice of "arresting" party spokesperson Sanmoy Bandyopadhyay for circulating posts critical of the TMC government.Family members and Congress sources said, Bandyopadhyay was "arrested" by a team ofdistrict police from his home in North 24 Parganas district on Thursday evening.The West Bengal police and Purulia district police neither confirmed nor denied having arrested or detained Bandyopadhyay."We will get back to you," a senior official of Purulia police said, when inquired about the alleged arrest.Bandyopadhyay is known for his staunch criticism of the TMC government through his social media posts."The arrest of Sanmoy Bandyopadhyay is a classic example of intolerance of the highest order. Sanmoy was arrested from his home for criticising the state government. Such blatant attack on the freedom of speech and expression by the Trinamool Congress government will not stop us from protesting against the ruling dispensation."We condemn such undemocratic assault on the freedom of speech and political terrorism unleashed bygovernment," Chowdhury said.Reacting to the allegations, senior TMC leader and party chief whip in state Assembly, Nirmal Ghosh said, "Sanmoy has been arrested as there were several criminal charges against him. It has nothing to do with criticism of the state government."The BJP leadership in the state also slammed the state government for arresting the Congress leader for "criticising the state government".Family members of Sanmoy claimed that he was arrested on Thursday evening by a police team from Purulia."They just came and took him away to Purulia on the charges of circulating posts against the state government," his brother Tanmay Bandyopadhyay said.The CPI(M) and Congress activists on Friday staged a protest rally outside Khardah police station against the alleged arrest.Bandyopadhyay's house at Sodepur falls under the jurisdiction of Khardah police station.The incident is reminiscent of the arrest ofUniversity professor Ambikesh Mahapatra in April 2012 for posting cartoons of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in the internet.
