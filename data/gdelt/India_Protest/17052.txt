Mumbai: 68-year-old Mulund resident dies, 'was stressed due to PMC bank crisis', says deceased's daughter

A 68-year-old Mumbai resident, Keshumal Hinduja, who had an account in Punjab and Maharashtra Co-operative (PMC) bank, passed away on Wednesday after suffering a cardiac arrest. The deceased was hailing from Mumbai's Mulund area.

According to the deceased's daughter, her mother was suffering from acute chest pains following which she was admitted to a private hospital on October 29 midnight. However, the victim died after she suffered a cardiac arrest on October 30.

Following this unfortunate incident, her daughter stated that her mother did not suffer from any diseases prior to the PMC bank scam, however, after a withdrawal limit was imposed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on bank account holders, her mother was very stressed. The daughter could not confirm the exact amount her mother had in the account.

Ever since a withdrawal limit has been imposed on PMC bank account holders, at least 7 people have lost their lives.

Earlier on Wednesday, PMC Bank depositors staged a protest outside the office at BKC in Mumbai. The protestors raised slogans and held placards which read 'punish the culprits, give our deposits' and 'we want justice'.

Last month, the RBI restricted the activities of the PMC Bank for six months and asked it not to grant or renew any loans and advances, make any investment or incur any liability, including borrowing of funds and acceptance of fresh deposits after an alleged fraud of Rs 4,355 crore came to light.
