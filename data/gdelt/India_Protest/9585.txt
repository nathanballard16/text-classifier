Ola drivers stage protest in Coimbatore

COIMBATORE: Around 200 drivers who work for private cab aggregator Ola staged a demonstration in front of its office at R S Puram here to protest a cut in salaries. The drivers said the company had been paying them almost Rs 23,000 per month. Now they are paid Rs 13,000 per month.The protesters entered the Ola office premises and continued their protest.As a result of the protest, many people who tried booking Ola cabs in the suburbs ended up facing delays and cancellations, forcing them to look for other options.The drivers said they had been receiving a reduced salary for the past two months and so they could not run their families with it.“We are employees who take vehicles on lease from Ola and pay the lease amount periodically. We also used to earn a bonus for driving 12 hours a day. With the bonus itself amounting to Rs 300 to Rs 400 a day, we could pay the lease amount of Rs 800 per day and still take home around Rs 900 per day or Rs 23,000 a month,” said a protester named Balaji.“However, for the past two months, we have been getting a bonus of Rs 50 to Rs 100 a day, so after paying the lease amount, we hardly get Rs 500 a day which is insufficient to run our families,” he said.Ola officials in Coimbatore were not available for comment despite multiple attempts by TOI.
