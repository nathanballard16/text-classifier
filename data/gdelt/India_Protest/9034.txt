Kolkata: All hell broke loose in Kolkata after a junior doctor in a government hospital was attacked by the relatives of a patient who died earlier this week. The junior doctors of Kolkata have gone on strike refusing to attend patients in the city's government hospitals while demanding adequate security for the doctors in the hospitals. They also met state Governor Kesari Nath Tripathi and discussed the ongoing situation at length. On the other hand, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday issued a deadline to the doctors to return to work immediately, which was later defied by the doctors on strike. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo also accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Communist Party of India (Marxist) of engineering the strike and bringing in the communal angle into it.

Here are the top developments in the matter so far:
