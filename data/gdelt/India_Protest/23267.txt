People’s fears legitimate: Sonia Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Amid growing unrest over Citizenship Amendment Act , Congress threw its weight behind the agitating “students, youth and citizens” and condemned the BJP government for use of “brute force” and “repression”.In an unusual intervention, Congress president Sonia Gandhi sent out a video message saying, “Congress condemns the actions of the government and expresses its solidarity with the students and citizens of India in their just struggle.”Sonia termed the CAA and the proposed “nationwide NRC” as discriminatory. “People’s apprehensions are real and legitimate,” she said. Drawing a parallel with “notebandi”, Sonia said CAA will force all individuals to stand in a queue to prove their and their ancestors’ citizenship while the NRC would target the poor.“The CAA is discriminatory and the proposed nation-wide NRC will particularly hurt the poor and vulnerable,” the Congress president warned.In her statement, Sonia described as “spontaneous” the protests that have erupted across universities and leading academic institutions against the “divisive agenda and anti-people policies of the BJP government”.She said, “In a democracy , people have a right to raise their voice against wrong decisions and policies of the government. Equally, it is the duty of the government to listen to the citizens and address their concerns. The BJP government has shown utter disregard for people’s voice and chosen to use brute force to suppress dissent. This is unacceptable in a democracy.”“Congress assures the people of India that it is fully committed to defending their fundamental rights and to upholding the foundational values of our Constitution,” she added.
