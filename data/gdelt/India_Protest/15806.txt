Abrar killing: BUET Sher-e-Bangla Hall provost resigns

Provost of Sher-e-Bangla Hall at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) Muhammad Zafar Iqbal Khan has resigned amid a massive protest of students over the death of Abrar Fahad, a second year student of the university.

Zafar Iqbal Khan resigned from the post on Wednesday afternoon.

Abrar, a second-year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering department of Buet, died after he was beaten allegedly by some Chhatra League men brutally at a dormitory of the university between 7:00 pm Sunday and 2:30 am on Monday.

The incident triggered a firestorm of protests on campuses across the country. Many took to social media to demand justice for Abrar.

Law enforcers suspect, Abrar was attacked because of one of his recent Facebook posts, which seemed to be critical of some recent deals with India.
