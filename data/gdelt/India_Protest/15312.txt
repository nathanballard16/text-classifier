Islamabad Appeals to US Congress to Steer Kashmir Resolution - Pakistan-Run Region Leader

"I have met some congressmen, congresswomen also, and what we are expecting is we are appealing to the US Congress leadership is to hold a debate on Kashmir, to move and steer a resolution on Kashmir," Khan who is currently on a visit in Washington said. "There should be hearings in the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relations Committee because this issue is very important."

Khan explained that the Kashmir dispute needs urgent resolution because of the human rights crisis and humanitarian crisis.

"But it is also important because this is a serious threat to peace and security in the region because of India’s aggressive and aggravating steps. And, therefore, we think that the US Congress should demonstrate leadership in this regard," he added.
