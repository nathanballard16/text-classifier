Students in Delhi & NCR join climate change stir

Delhi-NCR is facing the horror of degrading air quality and the situation is worst with each passing day. Earlier it was during the winters only that AQI graph use to rise due to crackers and crop burning but now it's the story of the whole year.

The climate change, de-forestation of the Aravalli Range in Gurugram; the water-level is also in danger and the students in and around Delhi has decided to fight back.

Scores of students from various schools of Delhi staged a mass bunk to protest against climate change. The mass bunk was a part of worldwide strike of students on Friday to force their governments to act against climate change.

Students from around 12 schools in Delhi NCR gathered at the Central Park at Connaught Place area of Delhi with hand-painted banners, posters, flags and placards with messages about pollution and climate change. They gathered at the Wazirabad Bundh, which was once a landfill site but now with the efforts of local NGO and authorities is a restoration park.

The students came together at the denial of the adults to recognise the 'state of emergency' and demanded an immediate and concrete action to bring down the AQI and to save the Aravallis. Similar strikes have been conducted in over 270 towns and cities all around the world.

Arya Dhar Gupta, a student of Class VII of the British School in Delhi, says, "We are already feeling the impact of environment depletion in the form of air pollution, unusual weather events, changing climate and water scarcity. But the future holds much worse. If the global warming is not controlled, up to two-thirds of the Himalayan ice cap is likely to melt by 2100, endangering 2 billion people."

Many youth in and around Delhi, who are facing severe problems due to degrading air quality say that they are being held hostage in their houses because of the situation.
