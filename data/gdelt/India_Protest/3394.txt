Lethpora Attack: NIMS Rajasthan suspends four Kashmiri students over WhatsApp status

Srinagar

The National Institute of Medical Science (NIMS), a private university, on Saturday suspended four paramedical students of Kashmiri, for their post related to the Pulwama attack.

According to report published by Times of India said that the suspension order came hours after WhatsApp status of four second-year students Talveen Manzoor (BSc OT, 2nd year), Iqra (B Pharma, 2nd Year), Zohra Nazir (BSc OT, 2nd Year) and Uzma Nazir (BSc RIT, 2nd Year) went viral.

The report quoted Sushila Chettri, hostel warden at NIMS, as having said, “The matter first came to light on Saturday morning and by afternoon, students and outsiders were demanding action and held protests against them. I have personally not seen the post, but I was told that a celebratory picture with an anti-national caption was uploaded by one of the students.”

The university administration informed the police after protesters refused to disperse until the students were removed from the campus. “I have no idea about the whereabouts of the girls. All I know is that they had left the campus by 5.30 pm,” Times of India quoted Chettri as having said.

Chandwaji police station SHO Rajat Bishnoi told TOI that police station staff was sent to the university campus after reports of protests came to their notice. “The situation on the campus is under control,” he said. The SHO added that no FIR or complaint was filed by the university administration. “The suspended students had already left the campus and gone to Jaipur city. We are trying to get information about their location to ensure their safety,” Times of India quoted SHO Chandwaji police station as having said.
