Sachin Pilot slams Citizenship Amendment Bill, says it’s majority versus morality

JAIPUR: State Congress president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot on Wednesday slammed the Centre over The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, saying that the issue is majority versus morality.“For the first time in Independent India, issue of deciding citizenship based on religion has come up. I don't think the bill will pass the judicial scrutiny. This is majority versus morality,” Pilot said here. He was speaking at a sit-in staged by the Congress workers against the Bill that seeks to grant citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan escaping religious persecution there.The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 was passed with a majority of 311 votes against 80 votes in the Lok Sabha where 391 members were present and voting. Speaking on the occasion, chief minister Ashok Gehlot alleged that the Centre is not concerned about protests across the country against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and trying to divert attention from real issues such as economic slowdown.“It is for the first time that there is an atmosphere of fear in the country. Protests are happening, the North East is burning, but this government is not at all concerned, said the chief minister. Gehlot said the Congress will hold a massive rally on the issue of farmers, unemployment and economic slowdown in Delhi on December 14. The Bill was tabled in the Rajya Sabha by home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday. Pilot alleged that the Centre has introduced the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill against the spirit of the Constitution."The Constitution's Article 14 does not mention that citizenship will be given based on religion. Anyone who has bad character, has faced criminal action cannot be a citizen of the country."But, the Centre has brought the Bill based on religion which the Congress will not accept under any situation,” Pilot said.
