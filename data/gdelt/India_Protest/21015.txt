Jamia protests: Have sought appointment for meeting with Amit Shah, says Arvind Kejriwal

Short description:

Citizenship Amendment Act protest: The Supreme Court on Monday agreed to hear petitions filed on behalf of students of Jamia Millia Islamia University over police action against them on Sunday during which many students were injured as police barged into the Jamia campus and resorted to lathicharge and firing teargas shells. The Supreme Court, however, made it clear that one does not get a right to riot just because one is a student. Meanwhile, protests are being held at various universities across the country against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Jamia Millia Islamia Chief Proctor Waseem Ahmed Khan claimed that the Delhi Police entered the campus forcibly without any permission and beat up staff members and students who were forced to leave the campus. On Sunday, clashes and violence during police action against students were also reported in the Aligarh Muslim University. Stay tuned to IndiaToday.in as we bring you Updates on Jamia protests.
