Peaceful protest, grand ‘aarti’ on demolition anniv

Gorakhpur: The All India Majlis-e-Ittehad-ul-Muslimeen (AIMIM) observed ‘Black Day’ while Hindu nationalist outfits celebrated ‘Shaurya Diwas’ amid tight security here on Friday that marked the 27th anniversary of Babri Masjid demolition in Ayodhya.

Supporters of VHP and Bajrang Dal gathered at Kali Mandir in Daudpur, chanted Hanuman Chalisa and performed a grand aarti. Members of AIMIM, on the other hand, peacefully demonstrated outside the district magistrate’s office and handed over a memorandum, addressed to the President of India, to city magistrate Umesh Mishra. They demanded punishment for those who demolished the mosque.

Speaking on the occasion, Bajrang Dal regional co-ordinator Durgesh Tripathi said, “In 1528, foreign invader Babur’s commander Mirbaqi demolished a Ram temple at Ramjanmabhoomi and constructed an edifice as a symbol of victory. For the construction of a Ram temple, our ancestors fought 76 battles and 3.75 lakh people were martyred.”

Tripathi maintained that on December 6, 1992, an “aware Hindu community erased the symbol of insult” and on November 9 this year, the Supreme Court cleared the decks for construction of a Ram temple. “We have achieved success after 491 years of struggle and with the blessings of Sri Ram,” he added.

City president of VHP Vijay Khemka appealed Hindus to come forward and form an aware and organised Hindu community.

AIMIM district president Md Islam voiced his differences. “The hearing against the accused (in Babri mosque cases) should take place in fast-track courts; bail of some of the accused must be revoked; and those who destroyed peace and harmony in the country must be punished,” he said.

Islam pointed out that the apex court had accepted that the December 6 mosque demolition was wrong. “We demand that organisations involved, including RSS and Bajrang Dal, be banned,” he added.
