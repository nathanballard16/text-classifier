Parents to stage protest at DEO office today

Vadodara: The Vadodara Parents Association (VPA) will stage a protest at DEO office on Wednesday demanding strict implementation of the provisional fees declared by the fee regulatory committee (FRC) by all the schools in Vadodara district.

According to VPA office-bearers, in gross violation of the Gujarat Self Finance Schools (Regulation of Fees) Act 2017 as well as the interim orders of the Supreme Court, some schools are demanding fees that is much more than the prescribed fees and also threatening the students.

“Even as FRC has already declared provisional fees, some city-based schools are demanding fees which is much more than the prescribed fees,” said VPA’s spokesperson Kishore Pillai.

“We have received complaints from parents against three city-based schools which are not only insisting on fees that is much more than the provisional fees but are also threatening the students of dire consequences,” he said.

“These schools have started levying hefty daily penalties by insisting that parents pay Rs 200 to Rs 250 for first day of delay and subsequently Rs 25 per day. These are totally illegitimate demands that are being made by school managements,” he said.

“Supreme Court in its interim order has also given powers to the state government to take punitive action against such erring schools,” he said.

The Act too has provided the FRC powers to regulate the excessive fees levied by self-finance schools across the state. “We are only demanding that interest of parents should be safe guarded and provisions of the Act as well as interim order of Supreme Court should be upheld,” he said.
