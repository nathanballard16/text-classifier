Hyderabad: Students, Parents stage protest before inter-board as results goof up

Students along with their parents staged protest in front of the intermediate board in Nampally pertaining to the result goof up. They suspected that the papers might have been evaluated by the unskilled.

Seeking an explanation from the board, the parents demanded justice to the students and also asked the government intervention in the matter. They demanded the state education minister to look into the issue.

The students were shocked to see the results after they were released by the inter-board on Thursday. Hundreds of students were marked absent despite appearing for the exams. For instance, a student from Mancherial who was the topper in the first year has been awarded zero marks in Telugu in the second year despite she appeared for the exam.
