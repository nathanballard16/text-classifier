The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam's (has sought to contest from, where the anti-Sterlite sentiments of the local people would be one of the factors the DMK-led opposition would try to capitalize to its advantage, in thepolls 2019.The 51-year-old daughter of late chief minister M. Karunanidhi, whose tenure in the Rajya Sabha ends in July, filed an application at the party headquarters on Monday seeking to contest the polls from the constituency in southern Tamil Nadu, which comprise the port town Tuticorin and other assembly segments namely,, Srivaikuntam, Ottapidaram, Vilathikulam, and Kovilpatti, all not fully- developed and crying for attention for decades together.But for Tiruchendur and Tuticorin all the other assembly constituencies are with theat present. However, that is unlikely to bother Kanimozhi if the party decides to field her in Tuticorin.Though the 2G scam trails her, the journalist-turned-politician, Kanimozhi, with her polite and dignified style of functioning apparently demonstrates more flair in bringing together conflicting sections, which is indispensable in the times of coalition politics, despite her outwardly shy appearance.Kanimozhi has been visiting Tuticorin and meeting people there for some time now. Going by the latest buzz she is likely to be pitted against BJP state president Tamilisai Soundararajan. The BJP or any other AIADMK-led NDA candidates in this constituency will have a slew of factors going against them including the Sterlite issue, particularly the killing of 13 protesters in police firing last year, the problems faced by fishermen and so on that Kanimozhi may have it easy in her first hustings.
