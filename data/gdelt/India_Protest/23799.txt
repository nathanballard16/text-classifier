Anti CAA stir Students converge at Shahid Minar

Kolkata: The protest against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) saw students of a number of universities in the state conducting a rally from Shahid Minar in Esplanade to the state party office of the BJP located at Murlidhar Sen Lane. They claimed that they will not allow implementation of NRC in the country and demanded revocation of CAA and NRC forthwith. The move by the police was to prevent any sort of altercation between the young students with the BJP activists. However, there was a minor scuffle between a section of students and policemen as they tried to scale the barricade and go towards the BJP office but the cops ensured that the situation remained under control. The youth Congress also took to the streets and staged protest on the same issue in front of the Raj Bhavan.
