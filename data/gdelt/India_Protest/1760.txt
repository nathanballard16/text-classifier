China Has Built World's 1st 3D Printed Concrete Bridge In Shanghai In Just 450 Hours

When it comes to Chinese innovation, it's outpacing anyone else in the world right now. And Chinese ingenuity has now extended to architecture and building as well.

For the first time in the world, China demonstrated how to build a 3D printed bridge over a waterbody in record-breaking time.

Shanghai now has the world's first fully 3D printed concrete bridge in the world. No humans were involved, the whole structure was completely 3D printed by machines.

Built by the Tsinghua University School of Architecture in Beijing, the 86 feet long bridge is inspired by the iconic Zhaozhou Bridge, which is China's oldest standing bridge built between 589 and 618 in Hebei province.

According to Professor Xu Weiguo, who designed the bridge, the structure consists of 3D-printed concrete units, 44 of them actually, with each unit measuring roughly 3 x 3 x 5 feet, while the arching structure is built by 68 different concrete slabs.

The most impressive fact about this 3D printed concrete bridge? That it was completed from start to finish in just 450 hours! That's right, the whole bridge was 3D printed and constructed in record-breaking time.

According to a CNN report, the 3D printed Chinese bridge in Shanghai also cost 33% lesser than a similar bridge built with manpower and existing construction techniques.

Well, looks like 3D printing construction jobs is pretty much how future architectural structures will be built. And why not, if the technology is good enough?
