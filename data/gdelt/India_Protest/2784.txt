BJP leader seeks action against parking mafia

Ludhiana: Highlighting the issue of illegal parking mafia in Ludhiana, BJP district vice-president Parminder Mehta has lodged a complaint with local bodies minister Navjot Sidhu, seeking his attention in the matter.

He had raised the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu earlier. Mehta claimed that illegal parking is prevalent on a large scale, which has forced him to lodge a complaint with the minister.

In his complaint, he said the multi-level parking lot near Zone A is being maintained by MC officials these days and people are asked to pay Rs 20 for car parking. But illegal parking is going on in the surrounding area near Zone A.

He said a few private people are charging Rs 50 from cars. He said he had raised the matter with the Mayor and MC commissioner as well, but the problem has not been resolved.

He alleged that there is some nexus between officials and these private people.

He said if local bodies minister does not take action, then the BJP will stage protest against civic authorities for not paying attention towards the problems of general public. He claimed they will wait for a few days for action and if nothing happens, then they will protest against the mayor.

Mayor Balkar Sandhu claimed he has already told the police to keep a check on illegal parking.
