Large number of Kashmiri men and women from across Europe on Friday gathered to protest the Indian government’s abrogation of Article 370 and 35A in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK). The protesters demanded immediate lifting of curfew and lockdown, and an end to Indian atrocities in the occupied valley.



A large number of eminent leaders of Hurriyat Conference were present during the demonstration led by former acting Prime Minister and local body minister of Azad Kashmir Chaudhary Pervaiz Ashraf.

Leaders such as Altaf Wani, Pervaiz Shah, Hasan Bana, Shamin Shawl spoke at the demonstration, expressing their anger at the brutal occupation of Indian Army in IoK.

Shamim Shawl, prominent Kashmiri leader while talking to Geo News, condemned the revocation of Article 370 and 35A in IoK and said that by doing this the country has stabbed Indian loyalists like Farooq Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti.

They must have learned a lesson that the Indian government can never be sincere with the people of Kashmir, she added.

Shawl further said that we welcome all those who have been misguided and cheated by India.

On the occasion, President of Pakistan Peoples Party UK Mohsin Bari told Geo News, “Nehru and Gandhi’s secular India has been destroyed by the fascist Modi’s regime.”
