FO summons Indian Deputy HC to protest against ceasefire violation

ISLAMABAD: The foreign Office summoned on Wednesday Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia to protest against Indian ceasefire violation.



A day ago, two Pakistani civilians, including a minor girl, were martyred by India's unprovoked firing across the Line of Control (LoC).

According to FO spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal, the Indian deputy HC was told that India should respect the 2003 ceasefire agreement.

The Indian forces are targeting civilian population with heavy weapons, said the FO spokesman, adding that India should direct its forces to completely implement the agreement.

The spokesman further said that the Indian ceasefire violations are a danger to the regional peace.

After the August 27 Indian firing incident, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that India was deliberately targeting the innocent civilian population living in areas along the LoC.
