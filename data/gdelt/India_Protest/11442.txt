Members of the Communist Party of India staged demonstrations at three places in the district on Tuesday seeking proper distribution of relief to farmers and general public who were affected by cyclone Gaja.

Leading the demonstration at Pattukottai, CPI Thanjavur district secretary M.A. Bharathi urged the district administration to take up fresh enumeration of affected people to ensure that all those who had lost their livelihood due to the cyclone received assistance without fail.

Earlier, the demonstrators took out a rally from bus stand to Gandhi Statue, where the demonstration was held. Later, a team of representatives, including CPI district-level and union-level office bearers and representatives of agricultural labour wing, met revenue officials and presented a memorandum.

Reenumeration of affected families, extending financial assistance in full for construction of concrete houses, distribution of inputs for agricultural operations for all, replacement of damaged fishing boats and nets, speeding up of 80 coconut sapling plantation in Gaja-affected areas through ryots, removal of fallen coconut tree trunks through government agencies, waiving of crop loans and lease amounts in Gaja affected areas, compensation for micro, small and medium industries were the demands put forth by the demonstrators in the memorandum.

The demonstrators also urged the Centre to release financial assistance sought by the State government for Gaja relief. Similar demonstrations were also held at Peravurani and Orathanadu.
