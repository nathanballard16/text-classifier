Teaching staff protest for regularization

Ludhiana: The teaching staff of city’s residential school for meritorious students staged a protest against the education department for not regularizing them after so many years.

As a mark of protest, the staff members did not appear for the orientation development test held in the city on Friday.

Expressing displeasure over not being made permanent, one of the members, Sukhwinder Singh, said, “The state education department is not paying any heed to our demand of regularization.”

The protesting staff said instead of focusing on quality, the education department officials were conducting orientation sessions for teachers and scrutinizing their performance. He claimed that eventhough the department had not made them permanent, they were working hard to ensure better performance by the students. “Instead of looking into our demands the education department was only insisting on conducting different types of orientation test and harassing the teachers by saying they would be removed if they did not perform,” said another protesting teacher Baljeet.
