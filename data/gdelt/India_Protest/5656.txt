Congress fields woman candidate from Jaipur after 57 years

Jyoti Khandelwal was Jaipur's Mayor during the Congress rule between 2008 and 2013.

The Congress has fielded Jyoti Khandelwal as its candidate from Jaipur. It was in 1962 when the Congress had last fielded a woman candidate Sharda Devi from Jaipur who lost to Gayatri Devi, Jaipur's Maharani of Swatantra Party.

Gayatri Devi went on winning next two elections but quit politics after her arrest during an emergency. After that, neither of the main parties ever fielded a woman candidate.

Not just because she is a woman, the Congress has taken a big risk in fielding Jyoti Khandelwal following caste considerations.

After Gayatri Devi, Jaipur and main parties often field a Brahmin candidate. However, the Congress has fielded Jyoti Khandelwal who is from Vaishya community.

Satish Chandra Aggarwal was the last from this business community to represent Jaipur in 1977 and 1980, replacing Rajput Gayatri Devi.

After that, only Brahmins have won here, and Jaipur's last Maharaja Bhawani Singh too lost in 1989 to Girdhari Lal Bhargava, a Brahmin of the BJP who won six times in a row.

In 2014, BJP's Ram Charan Bohra beat his rival, Mahesh Joshi, sitting MP from the Congress with more than five lakh voters. Jyoti Khandelwal has the challenge to defeat him.

The Congress decided to pick up Jyoti Khandelwal for several reasons. She was Jaipur's Mayor during the Congress rule between 2008 and 2013 when she defeated the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s Suman Sharma to win a direct election. That victory gives the party some confidence that she can take on a Brahmin candidate and can even polarise votes of the business community in her favour.

Even when her term as the mayor ended, Jyoti Khandelwal kept making headlines, raising allegations of corruption and protesting against her own party leaders.
