Varun Dhawan will air-dash to Mumbai to unveil Kalank’s first look on March 11

Varun Dhawan has been stationed in London for a 40-day schedule of his forthcoming film, Street Dancer. He had wrapped up Kalank before heading to the UK capital for the dance flick. No wonder, fans have been requesting the Judwaa actor to give a glimpse of his multi-starrer in which he teams up with a bunch of exciting actors.

Though Varun couldn’t do so, on March 4, he tweeted, “Its coming soon i promise #wewantkalanktrailer (sic).” And he sure is keeping his word. Varun will air-dash to Mumbai on March 11 to unveil Kalank’s first look. Says a source, “The London schedule is hectic, so Varun could squeeze in just one day to fly into Mumbai for the Kalank event, which will be held on March 12.”

The Gen-Y hearthrob will be seen opposite his Student Of The Year and Dulhania franchise co-star Alia Bhatt with whom he shares amazing chemistry in the Abhishek Varman directorial, which is produced by Karan Johar, Sajid Nadiadwala and Fox Star Studios.
