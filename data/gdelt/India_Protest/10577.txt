At a time when social media is enraged about a TikTok video on mob lynching, an older video of actor Ajaz Khan has surfaced in which he urges Muslims to rise up against mob lynching.

In a video posted on social media on June 28, actor Ajaz Khan urged 40 crore Muslims – legal and illegal – to rise up and take to the streets to protest incidents of mob lynching.

In the video, which some have called communal, Khan blamed the RSS and Bajrang Dal for ‘forcing people chant Jai Shri Ram’ and accused PM Modi of shielding them. Goading the Muslim community, he asked them to come out on the streets and ‘shut down the country’.

He said he wouldn’t use the honorific ‘aap’ for PM Modi and instead call him ‘tu’ if he didn’t act. He alleged that PM Modi – as a former RSS member – shielded the mob.

He went on to call Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse a terrorist and said those who forced people to chant Jai Shi Ram considered Godse their god.
