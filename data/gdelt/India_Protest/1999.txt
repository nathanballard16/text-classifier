Inquiry against Allahabad University vice-chancellor: Teachers threaten stir

ALLAHABAD: Days after media reports alleged that Union minister Prakash Javadekar sought permission for recommending an inquiry against Allahabad University vice-chancellor RL Hangloo, teachers of the varsity and its constituent colleges announced that they would launch an indefinite strike if the Centre takes any action against the latter.Union human resources development minister Prakash Javadekar had recently sought permission from President Ram Nath Kovind for recommending an inquiry against Hangloo.The decision was based on the report of a fact-finding committee, which visited AU to probe incidents of campus violence and financial irregularities in the institution’s working.In 2018, a group of student union leaders had protested violently against the VC while alleging financial irregularities. The students surrounded a guest house on campus where the AU executive council’s meeting was in progress.The Allahabad University Teachers Association (AUTA) and Allahabad University Constituent College Teachers Association (AUCTA) convened a meeting at CMP Degree College, on Thursday. During the meeting, the teachers passed a resolution that they would observe an indefinite strike if the Union government takes any action against the AU vice-chancellor.Addressing the meeting, president of AUTA, Ram Sevak Dubey, said, “HRD minister Prakash Javadekar is unnecessarily interfering with the affairs of the central university. Two inquiry committees have already been constituted and they had given a clean chit to Prof Hangloo.”“I would like to request President Kovind to intervene in the matter and instruct the HRD minister to stop interfering in AU’s day-to-day working,” he added,President of AUCTTA, Umesh Pratap Singh, said, “If the ministry acts against the vice-chancellor then every member of the teachers’ association would vote against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the Lok Sabha polls. We would also launch a a door-to-door campaign against any candidate fielded by the party in Allahabad, as it was done in 2004 against the then MHRD minister Murli Manohar Joshi.”Joshi had lost the seat in 2004 general elections.The teachers also organised a procession in the support of the VC on Thursday evening.
