SAD leaders meet mayor to discuss pending works

Ludhiana: Akali Dal councillors met mayor Balkar Sandhu on Wednesday to discuss the pending issue of development in their respective wards. The Akali leaders staged protests in zones A and B last month against non- development in their wards. After their protests, the mayor called them for discussion over the issues. In the meeting, it was decided that councillors from outer wards will get approval for development works up to Rs3 crore, while inner wards will get Rs2 crore each.

Apart from this, leader of opposition and senior SAD councillor Harbhajan Dang asked the mayor to get major works related with water supply, sewerage, parks, and street lights in a general quota, instead of councillor quota. Dang said the mayor had called for a meeting because he did not want them to waste time in protests. He said they had told the mayor that in the past two years, no development happened in their wards, so he granted Rs3 crore for outer wards, and Rs2 crore for inner wards. He said it would help in the development works in their areas and provide people the much-needed relief.

The mayor said he had never been partial in assigning or approving works, and in the meeting too, he assured the overall development of the city.
