Mumbai: Azad Nagar residents protest against RNA developers, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

MUMBAI: Over 200 residents of Azad Nagar chawls in Wadala on Sunday staged a protest against East and West Developers, a part of the RNA Group , demanding that either they be paid rent for transit accommodation for 22 months as per the High Court order in March, 2019 or the BMC should terminate the development agreement with the developer.Those who once lived in 32 ground-floor chawls on a 8.5 acre plot near the Wadala bus depot, shouted slogans against the developer and held placards saying “Modiji is busy with Swachh Bharat Abhiyan , RNA builder meanwhile cleaned up our homes”.Residents said the 32 chawls came into existence after the then government resettled families impacted by the April 1944 Bombay Dock Explosion In 2002, the redevelopment project was initiated and Azad Nagar Co-operative Housing Society was formed. In 2006, the society selected East and West developers and a tripartite agreement was signed between the society, the BMC, and the RNA group under Development Control Regulation 33 (7) for redevelopment of cessed structures. By 2015, the homes of all 321 tenants were demolished.“However, the developer didn’t carry out any construction work. For the last 22 months, a majority of 291 tenants have not been paid the agreed transit rent of Rs 40,000 with an annual increment of Rs 4000 per month as fixed by the HC,” said a tenant.Since the developer failed to meet the obligations, a group of tenants approached the High Court and Justice Gautam Patel on March 20, 2019, came down strongly on RNA group and passed an order warning the company that if it defaults twice in paying rent, “all agreements with the developer will stand automatically terminated, irrespective of anything contained in any previous order or consent terms”.Despite the order, the tenants said the developer defaulted on transit rent from May onwards. They also allege the BMC is silent on the issue. The co-operative society, which is supposed to represent all of us, has not filed any contempt of court plea, said a protestor.When contacted, a RNA spokesperson said: “Till date, we have paid more than Rs 120 crore as rent despite the fact that the delay is due to litigation between some tenants and the society. We have always stood by the tenants. We are expecting BMC approvals in the next two weeks and clarity on 2034 Development Control Regulations and will start work immediately.”
