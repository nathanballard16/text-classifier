HC stays sand quarrying in Thovalai

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has granted an interim injunction against sand quarrying in Thovalai in Kanniyakumari district. A Division Bench of Justices G. R. Swaminathan and R. Tharani directed notice to the district administration while hearing a petition filed by V. Jonsian Raja.

The petitioner complained that illegal sand quarrying was taking place at the village located close to the Western Ghats. Also, the feeder channel to the Thovalai-Periyakulam tank got affected as a result of quarrying.

Mandatory norms were not followed in quarrying. Though the villagers protested against quarrying, nothing was done against the operators as they were influential, the petitioner said.

If the quarrying continued, it could lead to ecological imbalance, the petitioner said and sought a restraint. The case was adjourned to June 10.
