Indian Students Urge Gov't Not to Green-Light Citizenship Bill Over 'Radical Militancy' Concerns

A prominent Students' Union in the Indian state of Meghalaya on Thursday appealed to the Indian government not to introduce the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019 in Parliament, saying it may lead to “radicalised militancy” in the northeastern parts of the country.

The request comes after the Indian Cabinet approved an amendment to the 1955 Citizenship Act.

"Garo Students’ Union (GSU) appeals to the central government not to table a dangerous bill like the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, because it will really (serve as) a 'cab' to ferry Bangladeshis to the North East,” GSU head Tengsak G. Momin has stated.

These students fear that the influx of immigrants, especially from Bangladesh, will increase the number of militant organisations in India’s northeast region.
