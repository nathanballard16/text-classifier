Union minister Piyush Goyal overseeing Operation Lotus?

BENGALURU: Union minister for railways, Piyush Goyal has allegedly been handed overall charge of the party’s Operation Lotus in the state and BJP sources say this is one reason for the concerted effort to bring down the JD(S)-Congress coalition government.Goyal, who hails from Maharashtra, is said to be personally overseeing the entire operation along with state general secretary Arvind Limbavali and Malleswaram MLA CN Ashwathnarayan. The two from the state are coordinating with the Maharashtra BJP to ensure the flock of rebels is kept intact in Mumbai.Sources say former Channapatna MLA CP Yogeshwar and state president BS Yeddyurappa’s nephew, PA Santosh, were instrumental in persuading JD(S) MLA AH Vishwanath to resign.Meanwhile, on Sunday, youth Congress workers staged a protest outside Sofitel Hotel in Mumbai — where the rebels MLAs are holed up — urging the legislators to withdraw their resignations.Congress workers, including vice-president Suraj Singh Thakur, were detained by police. During the protest, they shouted slogans against the BJP.“Their job is to work in the legislative assembly for five years,” a Congress worker said. “We demand that they withdraw their resignation.”The worker said the BJP is infamous for horse-trading. “They have done it in several other states too,” the worker said. “When these MLAs fight elections on a BJP ticket, it will be proven that the BJP was behind all this.”
