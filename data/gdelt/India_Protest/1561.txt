The protest affected traffic on the Anna Salai and other roads.The DMK cadre, led by party president M K Stalin, protested what they called governor Banwarilal Purohit’s failure to take action against the chief minister. Last week, Stalin and other party leaders met the governor and presented a petition seeking action against the chief minister. Since no action had been taken, he asked the district secretaries to protest on Thursday.DMK cadre started assembling at Raj Bhavan, Chinnamalai and party headquarters -- Anna Arivalayam -- from 8am onwards, causing traffic snarls on the Anna Salai and other roads. Chennai Metro Rail came to the aid many stranded commuters. Two-wheeler riders, passengers in MTC buses and others got down from the vehicles, walked to the nearest metro station and boarded trains to reach their destination.Prahathi Rajan said, “I am heading to attend the session at the Global Investors Meet being held at Chennai Trade Centre. I got stuck in traffic for more than 30 minutes. I decided to get down from the cab near Nandanam and boarded a metro train to Alandur. From there, I took a taxi to reach the Chennai Trade Centre.”Many commuters kept checking traffic updates on social media and on the Chennai city traffic police website.
