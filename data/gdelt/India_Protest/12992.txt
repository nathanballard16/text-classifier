Chandigarh, August 22

While comparing Enforcement Directorate (ED) to Hitler, thousands of Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) workers on Thursday wore T-shirts that read 'EDiot Hitler'.

Other activists protested silently by sporting black tee-shirts with the slogan "EDiot Hitler" painted on them, as thousands of supporters came to Mumbai from all over Maharashtra to express solidarity with their chief.

The tee shirt also had the Nazis' principal symbol the hakenkreuz, "hooked-cross" (which resembles the Swastika) printed on it.

MNS leader Sandeep Deshpande, wearing the shirt, was taken into custody.

Thackeray had appealed the party workers not to protest over the issue, there are possibilities of gathering of supporters outside the ED office.

The ED is probing alleged irregularities relating to loans and equity investment worth over Rs 450 crore by IL&FS in Kohinoor CTNL Infrastructure Company, which is developing Kohinoor Square tower in Mumbai's Dadar area.

Former Maharashtra chief minister and senior Shiv Sena leader Manohar Joshi's son Unmesh Joshi was also summoned by the ED in this case. — With PTI inputs
