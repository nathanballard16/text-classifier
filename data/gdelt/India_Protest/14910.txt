A 38-year-old man, who was wanted for raping and kidnapping his wife, collapsed and died when Mumbai police officers were chasing him.

38-year-old Surendra Parcha, the rapist, died on September 24, 2019, when the police was chasing him.

Locals went on to protest outside the Shahunagar Police Station in Dharavi, Mumbai, after they got to know Parcha passed away.

DCP (Deputy Commissioner of Police) Niyati Thaker Dave said Parcha was wanted in a kidnapping and rape case.

Parcha was a resident of the Matunga Labour Camp in Walmikhi Nagar, Dharavi.

The wife of Parcha claims she was kidnapped and raped by her own husband.

According to NDTV, over 25 cases are registered against the name of Parcha in different police stations in Mumbai.

On September 24, 2019, the Shahunagar Police Station received an Intel about Parcha.

The police sent out a search team and when they saw him, Parcha ran away and a chase-off started.

Parcha collapsed and was rushed to a hospital in the area, where he was declared dead upon arrival by the doctors.

DCP Dave said they are currently considering this case as a “custodial death case.”
