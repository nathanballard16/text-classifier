Twitterati back Rahul for supporting protesting CA students

New Delhi, Sep 25 : Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took to Twitter to support CA students protesting against the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) since Monday, demanding the right to re-evaluate answer sheets .

In a tweet, Rahul Gandhi said, "Across India 12 Lakh CA students are fighting for their right to have their exam papers re-evaluated by ICAI." "Given the widespread reports of errors in the evaluation of answer sheets, this demand is justified and should be supported by all political parties," he said, using the hashtag "dearicaiplschange".

With this tweet, Rahul Gandhi became one of the first leaders to come out in open in support of the protesting students.

The tweet has received around 40,000 likes and more than 9,000 retweets along with support for the Congress leader.

"Thank you so much sir for your support... at least one vote from Haryana in upcoming election. Once again thank you for your support.#dearicaiammend39_4," wrote one user.

The CA students have been raising these issues since December 2018. The protest gained momentum when the students noticed discrepancies in answer sheets, copies of which were obtained from the ICAI.

While in some cases marks had not been awarded for correct answers, in many cases the numbers on the report card were lower than what was written on the answer sheets.
