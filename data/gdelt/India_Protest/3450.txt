2 pistol-wielding men try to loot fuel station

Ludhiana: Two armed goons tried to loot a petrol pump near Dango village in Jodhan on Saturday night. On failing to lay hands on cash, the duo fired in the air before making good their escape.

Durga Shankar Tiwari, who works at Deol filling station, said in his police complaint, “We were closing the fuel station at 8pm when a Maruti Suzuki Zen Estilo car arrived. There were two persons in it — a turbaned man who was at the wheel and his associate who sat next to him. The associate, who was wearing a woollen cap and seemed to be around 30 years old, got down from the car and gave me a note of Rs 500 to fill the fuel tank.”

While refuelling, Tiwari, a native of Uttar Pradesh, noticed that the car had no registration number plate. “I pointed out the missing number plate to the man wearing the woollen cap. Saying that he clear all my doubts, he took out a pistol and asked me to hand over whatever cash I had. Scared, I told him I had nothing as the fuel station owner, Balwinder Singh, had collected the cash from me.”

As Tiwari raised the alarm, his colleagues rushed to the spot. “The goon then fired in the air and the duo sped away towards Sarabha village.”

Tiwari then called up the police and the fuel station owner.

Police have booked the two under sections 336 (act endangering life or personal safety of others), 382 (theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt or restraint in order to the committing of the theft), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the IPC and various sections of the Arms Act.

Jodhan police station assistant sub-inspector Baldev Singh said, “We are scrutinising the footage of CCTV cameras installed at the spot. The two are yet to be identified.”
