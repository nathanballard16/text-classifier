The BJP will kick-start its campaign in Tamil Nadu for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls with three big rallies of Prime Minister Narendra Modi between January 27 and February 19.

The first rally is planned at Madurai on January 27, after the Prime Minister lays the foundation stone for the first AIIMS facility in Tamil Nadu.

“We are making preparations for a massive public rally on Ring Road, near the Madurai airport. About two lakh party cadre belonging to 10 parliamentary constituencies will participate in the event,” a senior party leader told The Hindu. The Prime Minister is also scheduled to hold two more rallies in Chennai and Coimbatore on February 10 and 19.

“But the location has not been finalised for both these dates. The idea is that the Prime Minister’s rallies will cover cadre from all 39 constituencies in the State,” the leader said.

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam general secretary Vaiko on Friday declared that he would lead a black flag demonstration against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during his visit to Madurai.
