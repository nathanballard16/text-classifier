Protests erupt outside Supreme Court over 'clean chit' to CJI

NEW DELHI: Dozens of protesters gathered outside the Supreme Court on Tuesday, a day after a panel of judges dismissed a sexual harassment complaint against chief justice Ranjan Gogoi , carrying placards demanding a new and impartial investigation.A former court assistant accused chief justice Ranjan Gogoi of having made unwanted sexual advances last year.Gogoi has denied the charges and an internal panel of judges cleared him of wrongdoing, a court statement said on Monday.But protesters gathered outside the Supreme Cour said they were not satisfied with the decision."Transparent and fair due process is a must," read one of the placards, while another read, "Supreme injustice".Security was strengthened outside the court, with dozens of paramilitary police and trucks carrying water cannons deployed in the area.Police quickly dispersed the crowd and most protesters were taken away in police vans soon after they gathered."We were not allowed to protest even for five minutes!" lawyer Amritananda Chakravorty said.Police at the site said it was illegal to hold demonstrations at the Supreme Court.
