SI suspended for 'harassing' PM Narendra Modi proposer

VARANASI: The outpost in-charge of Rohania thana was suspended on Friday night for allegedly harassing and threatening a retired agriculture scientist for the past two months over a land dispute.The purported victim, Ramashankar Patel, was one of the proposers for Prime Minister Narendra Modi when he filed his nomination from the Varanasi Lok Sabha seat earlier this year.The action against sub-inspector Srikant Pandey came within days of Patel writing to the PM and within hours of meeting SSP Anand Kulkarni. The scientist threatened to stage a sit-in if the "uncouth" policeman wasn't punished.SSP Anand Kulkarni said a preliminary inquiry had found some truth in the allegations of misbehaviour against SI Pandey. "A probe by circle officer (Sadar) suggests the allegations against him are true. He was suspended on last night. A detailed investigation has been ordered."
