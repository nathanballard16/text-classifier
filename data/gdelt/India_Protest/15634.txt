Aarey protests: Court grants bail to all 29 arrested by Mumbai police

Mumbai: A sessions court Sunday granted bail to all the 29 people arrested by Mumbai police for unlawful assembly and assaulting police personnel during the protest to save trees at Aarey Colony. The bail was granted to them after paying Rs 7,000 bail surety.

The court ordered that those who were granted bail should not indulge in any criminal activity and they should attend the police station once a fortnight Wednesday between 6pm and 9pm and cooperate with the investigation officer when called.

Lawyer Madhav Suryavanshi for the applicants told the court that the bail should be granted because most of them were students having their exams starting from Monday.

However, the protesters’ family members claimed that the cops intentionally booked them on false charges.
