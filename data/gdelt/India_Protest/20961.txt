They converged at the Marina beach here, holding aloft placards that read 'No CAB', 'we oppose Citizenship Amendment Bill' and raised slogans.

They dispersed later.

An official of Assam Association here said the protest was by people hailing from Assam and other North-Eastern states, who had settled in Chennai.

"As an association, we are yet to decide on staging a protest", he told PTI.

Several parts of northeast India have witnessed violent protests over the past few days against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which expedites citizenship applications from religious minorities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, but not Muslims.
