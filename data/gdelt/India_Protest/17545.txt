Students demand corrections in new political map of India

KATHMANDU: Students of Pashupati Multiple Campus in Chabahil organised a protest rally against the depiction of Nepal's territory — Lipulekh Pass and Kalapani — as India’s territory in the new political map that was made public recently.

The students have demanded corrections in India's new map that has incorporated the Nepali territory as India's.

The rally was led by Kathmandu District Committee of Nepal Students Union, the student wing of leading opposition Nepali Congress.

The protesters chanted slogans like "Our Border, Our Country is Dearer than Heart". They also warned that encroachment of an inch of Nepal's land would not be tolerable.

More than 150 students participated in the rally that started from Mitrapark and converged into a corner meet at Pashupati Campus after going through Chabahil Chok.

Addressing the assembly, student leaders Raj Kumar Tamang and Prem Shahi demanded corrections in India's new map and Nepal government's diplomatic initiatives to sort out the problem.

Likewise, Nepal Communist Party (NCP)-aligned student union — All Nepal National Free Students Union (ANNFSU) — staged a sit-in outside the Embassy of India at Kapurdhara Marga, Kathmandu, this morning.

According to ANNFSU Central Committee Chair Ain Mahar, the students demanded correction in the new political map of India.
