Man attempts suicide, travel agent booked for Rs 15L fraud

Ludhiana: Two days after a man, aspiring to go abroad, tried to commit suicide near the office of his travel agent, villagers of his native village staged a protest outside Machhiwara police station, seeking action against the agent.

Following the protest, police decided to lodge a case against the agent, identified as Balwinder Singh of Jhaurdhi.

On Thursday, Dharminder Singh of Kodala Bet had consumed poison outside the office of a travel agent on Machhiwara-Samrala road. He had alleged that the travel agent had taken Rs 15 lakh from him on the pretext of sending him abroad. But he neither sent him abroad, nor returned money.

On Saturday, villagers of Kodala Bet gathered outside the Machhiwara police station and protested against the travel agent and demanded registration of a case against the travel agent for cheating fellow villagers.

Police officials said following the protest, senior police officers of Khanna police district asked the Machhiwara police to look into the matter and take necessary action.

Inspector Gurdeep Singh, SHO, Machhiwara police, said the accused had been booked for fraud. He said the accused is on the run.

Asked about the ‘delay’ in registering a case, the SHO said the matter was being investigated at the higher level in Khanna.

Police officials said the Balwinder had been to a Nawanshahr hospital, where his condition was stable.
