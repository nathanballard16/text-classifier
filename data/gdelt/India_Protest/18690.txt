Opposition may boycott joint session on Constitution Day

NEW DELHI: Opposition parties are considering a “boycott” of the joint sitting of Parliament to commemorate the 70th Constitution Day, scheduled for 11am on Tuesday at the Central Hall.A final call on whether to participate or to keep away from the joint sitting will be taken after the floor leaders of the “like-minded parties” meet at 10.30am following a joint protest dharna against the “disregard of the Constitution,” at the statue of B R Ambedkar in the Parliament premises.“Whatever we do… whether we attend the joint sitting or boycott it, we will do it together,” Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha leader Derek O’Brien told TOI, when asked about the opposition’s protest against the political situation in Maharashtra , on Constitution Day, to mark the adoption of the Constitution on November 26, 1949.With by-elections over in some states including West Bengal on Monday, opposition parties like Congress, TMC and others will now coordinate to work together against the ruling BJP in Parliament for the rest of the Winter Session, since they do not have to face each other as rivals in their respective states.Opposition leaders are also upset about the Speaker and the Rajya Sabha chairman turning down the request for holding a special debate on the Constitution on November 26, in both houses of Parliament according to floor leaders of some of these parties.Opposition parties including Congress, TMC, DMK, RJD, AAP, SP, CPI, CPM, JDS, NCP and Shiv Sena, among others, who have been coordinating from Monday in protesting against the Narendra Modi-led government will attend the protest dharna at the Ambedkar statue, as the Supreme Court is scheduled to take up the case on the Maharashtra political tangle around the same time on Tuesday morning.The opposition has accused the ruling BJP of “murdering democracy” and of ignoring the “constitutional norms” in Maharashtra, where it has been sworn-in by governor BS Koshiyari to form government in the state, without a floor test on whether the party and its allies have the numbers for it.On Monday morning, Congress leaders congregated at the Gandhi statue with banners and posters to protest against the Maharashtra situation. Later both houses saw adjournment over the issue.
