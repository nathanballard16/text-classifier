Water tanker operators stage strike in Vellakoil

TIRUPUR: Water tanker operators staged a strike on Sunday after the revenue department took action against one of them in Vellakoil. They parked 20 lorries in front of the Vellakoil New Bus Stand as part of the protest.Revenue authorities had recently seized three tanker lorries after the operators were found exploiting groundwater. “The tanker operators were drawing water from open wells and bore wells in agricultural lands in villages including Mettupalayam, Valliyerachal, Veerasolapuram, Puthuppai, Velappannaicken Valasu, and Muthur . Many of them own lands there and utilise free power to draw water from the wells, and sell it in Vellakoil town. So, we took action against three water lorries recently. They supply water to commercial units. Their protest was aimed to stop the action against exploitation of groundwater,” a senior revenue official said.But the operators denied the charges. “Many of us buy water and supply it. The authorities took action unnecessarily,” said K Kathirvel, a driver.
