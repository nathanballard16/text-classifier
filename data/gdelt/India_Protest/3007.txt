Jammu, February 12

Students of all colleges in the Jammu region on Tuesday boycotted classes to protest against the raising of anti-national slogans by some miscreants among stranded Kashmir-bound passengers here on Monday.

Classwork in most of the colleges across the region was affected badly as the students continued their protest for the second day on Tuesday. They were protesting against the administration's inaction against the miscreants among the stranded passengers who raised “Pakistan zindabad” slogans near GGM Science College in Jammu on Monday.

The attendance in different colleges of the winter capital remained thin as a large number of students boycotted the classes and reached GGM Science College, where they protested against the raising of anti-India slogans and police lathicharge on students.

The vehicular movement on the ever-busy Canal road too remained affected for more than two hours as the protesting students blocked it, demanding a strict action against those involved in the incident.

Students of degree colleges in Rajouri, Samba and Kathua districts also boycotted classes in support of the protest.

Meanwhile, the Jammu Joint Students’ Federation announced to boycott the classes till Friday. “We will continue to boycott the classes till Friday. If the administration fails to arrest all those involved in raising pro-Pakistani slogans besides taking strict action against the police for the lathicharge incident, we shall intensify our campaign,” a spokesperson of the federation said.

JU exams cancelled

Examinations of various departments of the University of Jammu that were slated to be held on Tuesday were cancelled due to the protest by the ABVP activists at the main gate of the JU. The road outside the university was also blocked for more than an hour, wherein a scuffle broke out between the students and cops deployed there. — TNS
