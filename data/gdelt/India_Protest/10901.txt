Unconvinced of the circumstances under which Patil went to Mumbai and the reasons for getting admitted in a private hospital, the Speaker directed state Home Minister M.B. Patil to get in touch with the family members of Patil and ascertain if he went to Mumbai of his own volition or was taken forcibly by BJP members as alleged by Shivakumar.
