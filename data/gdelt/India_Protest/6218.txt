Sangrur, April 10

Punjab Youth Congress general secretary Poonam Kangra says she’ll never contest elections again.

Kangra—who is a member of the Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee—was an aspirant for Fatehgarh Sahib Lok Sabha seat.

“I have decided to never seek any ticket for any election in future. It’s really insulting when your application for ticket is rejected repeatedly by your party, for which you have worked hard for years without giving any reason. I had applied twice for assembly ticket from Dirba and recently for MP ticket from Fatehgarh Sahib,” Kangra said at a press conference in Sangrur.

She isn’t the only one angry. There’s discontent brewing among Valmiki and Majhabi Sikh Congress workers against the party for having passed them over for candidates of other reserved castes.

“Around 40 candidates from both Mazhabi Sikhs and Valmiki communities had applied for all four seats, but Congress party has not found even a single eligible candidate. It’s not possible that all were ineligible,” Kangra said.

Fatehgarh Sahib is one of four reserved seats of Punjab’s 13 Parliamentary seats. Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, and Faridkot are the others.

Majhabi Sikh and Valmiki community make up 20 per cent of the state’s total Scheduled Caste population. The state has 32 per cent SCs.

“Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh has called our delegation to Chandigarh on April 13. All India Congress Committee has called us to New Delhi on April 11. We’ll make them aware about our feelings,” she said.

Punjab Dalit Welfare Sanghthan president Darshan Singh Kangra said the organisation would protest against Congress candidates across the state if the party continued to ignore the community.

“How Amar Singh could be given ticket from Fatehgarh Sahib when he’s made no contribution to the party,” Darshan Singh Kangra said.
