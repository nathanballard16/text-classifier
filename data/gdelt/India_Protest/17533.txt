MUMBAI: Some M Tech and Ph D students at IIT-Bombay staged a protest on Thursday against the recent reforms approved by the IIT Council. Among the reforms, the council had recommended a 300% hike in annual tuition fees and also discontinuing the monthly stipend given to M Tech students.A statement released by the protesting students stated that the fees of Rs 2 lakh is even higher than the fees charged in self-financing institutions. 'The rationale of the council to increase the fee and discontinue the stipend was reported as a measure to check students using IIT seats for parking themselves before joining PSUs is dubious,' said the statement.This concern could have been easily addressed either by disallowing PSUs to recruit using GATE scores or by asking them to recruit before the M Tech admissions, said the students. The move will only discourage students from socially and economically backward sections to pursue higher studies and will result in profiteering, they alleged.Students from the Powai institute organised the gathering in solidarity with students from IIT-BHU who called for a national level protest against M Tech reforms on the occasion of the visit of HRD minister Ramesh Pokhriyal. The students gathered to discuss future protests too.
