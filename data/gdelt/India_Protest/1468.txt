No citizenship to immigrants unless states on board: MHA

NeW DELHI: Amid protests in Assam over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, the home ministry on Tuesday said no Hindu or other ‘minority’ immigrant from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan would be granted citizenship without having state governments on board. Ministry spokesperson Ashok Prasad told reporters that every application seeking Indian citizenship would be enquired into by the deputy commissioner or district magistrate concerned, who would do due diligence before forwarding the same to the state government.Thereafter, the state government will conduct own enquiry through its agencies. “Only then an individual will be granted citizenship. Without the state government’s recommendations, no one will be given Indian citizenship,” Prasad said.The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, being opposed by a large section of people and organisations in the north-east who say it is contrary to provisions of the Assam Accord , seeks to provide Indian citizenship to persecuted minorities — Hindus, Sikhs, Jains, Buddhists and Christians — from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan after they have stayed in India for seven years, instead of 12 years at present. This is applicable to those who came to India before December 31, 2014.Religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan were earlier given a special dispensation for grant of long-term visas. People belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhism , Jain, Parsi and Christian religions from these countries will have to prove they belong there and faced religious persecution to be considered for citizenship.
