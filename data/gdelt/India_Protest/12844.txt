Residents, students protest setting up of mobile tower

Ludhiana: Residents, shopkeepers and students of a private school staged a protest at Kakowal Road on Tuesday against the installation of a mobile tower in the area.

While the students registered their protest holding placards, primarily with messages urging civic authorities to take steps and ensure the construction of the tower stops.

The residents and shopkeepers through their protest pointed out to the civic authorities to initiate action against the person who had allowed the mobile tower at his building which they said was a clear violation of by-laws. The residents claimed that installation of the mobile tower was stopped earlier but the work has restarted.

One of the residents of the area, Rajesh Kumar claimed that mobile tower is being installed at the terrace of a shop which is constructed in 60 square yards of three-storey building. He claimed it was against rules to install a mobile tower in a residential area.

Pointing out some other difficulties that could arise due to the coming up of the mobile tower, another resident of area Ravinder Kumar claimed that a school is located near the tower and the radiations generated would definitely affect the health of the students.

Demanding action against owner of the building, Vivek Khera, the protestors said the civic officials should impose a penalty for violation of norms. The residents had claimed that the y would be forced to resort to agitation if the authorities failed to initiate action against the building owner.

Assistant town planner Harvinder Honey said, “The mobile tower was installed in 2014 and NOC was issued by MC. We had sent the building inspector to check the location and owner showed the documents.”
