Outfits that led Bargari Morcha now lead battle against SAD

The outfits coming to attend the Thursday meet had actively taken part in protests across the state over the sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib. The United Akali Dal has planned a dharna outside the election commission’s Delhi office on April 12 to protest against the IG’s transfer. AdvertisingSikh Talmel Mission convenor Santokh Singh said, “We have called the meeting to discuss the strategy to defeat Badals and the BJP in the Lok Sabha polls. They got IG Kunwar Vijay Partap transferred as they were afraid that this SIT member could expose them in the due course of inquiry”. Dhyan Singh Mand, the parallel Jathedar of Akal Takht declared by Sarbat Khalsa 2015, has issued a one-week ultimatum to the ECI to cancel the transfer order.
