A contract killer with a bounty of Rs 1 lakh on his head was killed in an encounter with Uttar Pradesh Special Task Force (STF) in Lucknow’s Vibhuti Khand police station area on Sunday, police said.

Sachin Pandey, a resident of Azamgarh, had around two dozen cases of murder, loot and extortion against him, said police.

SSP, STF, Rajeev Narain Mishra said police had received a tip-off that Pandey was in Lucknow for a contract killing. The identity of the target is yet to be confirmed, he said.

“Today, we received information that Pandey and an associate were near Amity College in Vibhuti Khand. Around 12.30 pm, an STF team saw the two at a tea stall and tried to catch them. The two opened fire and in a retaliatory fire, one of them (Pandey) suffered gunshot injuries. The other managed to escape. He was taken to RML Hospital where he was reported brought dead,” said Mishra.

According to police sources, Pandey suffered several gunshot injuries on his chin, chest and stomach.

“We have been informed that Pandey had a long criminal history. He has 22 cases against him and was a sharpshooter. He used to run his own gang, named D-16. He had extortion, murder and loot cases against him, besides FIRs registered under Gangster Act. He would even travel to Bihar for contract killings. The latest case of robbery and attempt to murder was registered against him at Kaptanganj police station in Azamgarh this year,” he said. The SSP said police were getting details of cases registered against Pandey in Bihar.

The SSP further said that in 2013, Pandey allegedly shot at a security personnel attached with then Additional SP of Azamgarh Shailesh Kumar Pandey.
