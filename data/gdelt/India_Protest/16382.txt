NEW DELHI: Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by referring to him as 'BechendraModi', a moniker the Wayanad MP used to allege the Prime Minister was "selling" public sector companies to benefit his friends in the corporate world.Rahul Gandhi also posted a cartoon of the Prime Minister "selling" Air India, BPCL as well as the country itself. "#BechendraModi is sharing the spoils () of the sale of public sector undertakings (PSUs) with his suitedbooted friends. These public sector undertakings were set up after years of hard work," the former Congress president said in a tweet in Hindi."It is a time of uncertainty and fear for millions of PSU employees. I stand shoulder to shoulder with all those employees in protest against this loot," he added.The Congress has in over the last few weeks upped the ante against the government over its alleged mismanagement of the economic situation in the country, alleging that instead of acknowledging the brewing crisis and the steady slowdown , the government was toeing a divisive agenda. On Thursday, former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh , while interacting with investors in Mumbai, also said that he saw little hope that India would be able to achieve the $5-trillion-economy target by 2024.
