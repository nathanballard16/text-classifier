Complete shutdown being observed in IOK today

In Occupied Kashmir, complete shutdown is being observed on Sunday, to register protest against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the territory.

Call for the shutdown has been given by the Joint Resistance Leadership, comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik.

In a statement in Srinagar, the leadership said five years of Narendra Modi’s rule were marred with tyranny and oppression in Occupied Kashmir, therefore he deserves to be welcomed only with protest.

Meanwhile, the occupation authorities have beefed up security across occupied Kashmir ahead of Narendra Modi’s visit.

The authorities have also put Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and other Hurriyat leaders under house arrest or in custody to prevent them from leading anti-India demonstrations during Narendra Modi’s visit.
