Shiv Sena’s Shewale visits nine Jain temples, reaches out to community

On the occasion of Mahavir Jayanti on Wednesday, Shiv Sena candidate Rahul Shewale visited nine Jain temples in his constituency in an attempt to reach out to the community.

Then, he went on to visit three more Jain temples in the Matunga area and five in the Sion area. “Considering the sentiments of the community, I have raised the issue of renaming the King’s Circle railway station as Parshwa Dham. It is now pending with the Union government. I will follow it up,” said Shewale. Parshwanath is the 23rd of Jainism’s 24 tirthankaras and there are many temples devoted to him in India. The Jain community in the Matunga area revere the saint.

Shewale said he had also raised the issue of changing the nomenclature of the government holiday from ‘Mahavir Jayanti’ to ‘Mahavir Janam Kalyanak’ as per Jain mythology.
