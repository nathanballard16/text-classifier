Protests over citizenship law continue in India with 16 dead [dpa, Berlin]

Dec. 21–NEW DELHI — Orders prohibiting large gatherings and suspending internet services were extended to new areas in India as protests against a citizenship law continued Saturday.

A total of 16 people have been killed in demonstrations across Indian towns and cities — despite a ban — with the biggest toll in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Nine people have died there so far, the state’s police chief OP Singh said.

There were several incidents of violence during protests held Friday including arson, stone-pelting and damage to public property, Singh said. An 8-year-old boy was killed in a stampede as police tried to disperse a mob. Protests elsewhere were largely peaceful.

Demonstrations were being held in several cities Saturday including the national capital, Kolkata, Patna, Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram, NDTV news channel reported.

The Citizenship Amendment Act passed last week provides a fast-track route to citizenship to persecuted religious minorities, specifically Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis , Buddhists, Jains and Christians from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh, but excludes Muslims.

Critics say it goes against India’s secular constitution by making religion a basis for granting citizenship.

The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has said the law will not impact any Indian citizens, including Muslims.

The protests are expected to come up during Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with his council of ministers later Saturday called to review the progress on implementing government policies over the past six months.
