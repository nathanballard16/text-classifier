Plastic unit owners to hold rally in city today

Rajkot: Under the banner of Rajkot Plastic Manufacturers Association, city’s plastic manufacturers will hold a rally on Wednesday to protest against the proposed blanket ban on ‘single-use’ plastic. More than 300 units in Rajkot are engaged in the plastic manufacturing business.

The rally will commence from the Race Course and will go to the Municipal Corporation via Yagnik Road and Trikon Baug. Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC) has banned all items of single-use plastic which includes polythene bags, plastic dishes, spoons, straws, teacups among a host of other such use and throw items.

President of the association, Kishor Sanghvi said, “Banning plastic is not the only solution. Whatever will be used as a replacement of single-use plastic will also be harmful to the environment in some other way. The government should, therefore, find means on how to recycle plastic.”

The association argued that nearly 60 lakh people in India are engaged in plastic manufacturing business directly or indirectly who stand to lose their livelihood. The industries which have invested crores of rupees will incur huge losses after their machinery will turn into scrap overnight.
