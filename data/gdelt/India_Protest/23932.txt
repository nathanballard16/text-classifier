Slogans of azaadi filled the air as over 300 Indians braved a drizzle to gather in front of the Indian high commission in London last Wednesday to protest the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens. The Telegraph spoke to two students from Bengal, studying in the UK, who took part in the demonstration called by South Asia Solidarity Group and the SOAS India Society, a students’ fourm.

Budhaditya Bhattacharyya Age: 24 Occupation: PhD student at the University of Durham Hails from: Burdwan I do not usually attend protest meets. But because Indian classical music, which I am pursuing, is a syncretic tradition, I felt what is happening in India runs contrary to my ethos. I left the reading room at British Library early and walked to the protest spot, about 40 minutes away. The sun sets in London around 4pm, so it was dark when I reached India House at 5pm. The atmosphere was charged. A couple of extra placards were lying around. I picked one that said “I support a secular India, not a Hindu rashtra.” The protesters had gathered on the pavement opposite the high commission. A Met Police van was posted with two constables who were asking us to move back if anyone came down on the carriageway. Amid the azaadi slogans, we read out the preamble to the Constitution in chorus from a placard. Someone had brought a dafli and was playing it to the beat of the slogans. An elderly lady had come in a wheelchair. Three or four passers-by asked what the protest was about and when we explained, they expressed their support for the cause. Even some taxi drivers honked as they passed and gave us a thumbs up. I am happy that the protests are happening everywhere.
