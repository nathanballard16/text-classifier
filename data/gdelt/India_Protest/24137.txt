Guwahati/UNI: Senior citizens took the lead in the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, protest in Assam today, while students wore black badges against the Act when educational institutions reopened after nearly 12 days.

The senior citizens assembled in large numbers across the state to protest the CAA, joined by people from different sections of the society.

They staged a protest at Latasil Field in Guwahati, where besides the senior citizens, leaders and members of All Assam Students Union (AASU) also joined in.

Similar protests led by senior citizens were staged in different parts of the state, including at Nagaon and Jorhat.

Other protest demonstrations and rallies against the CAA continued in the state, with AASU leading in organizing the agitations.

A protest rally with over one lakh participation is planned at Dibrugarh tomorrow.

Meanwhile, educational institutions in the state reopened today, after they were declared closed owing to volatile law and order situation since December 11 last.

Annual examination of the state board schools resumed after the gap, while for some schools, it proved to be an extended winter vacation.

Examinations of the colleges resumed from today with re-scheduled dates.

Students of Gauhati University reportedly wore black badges while sitting for their examination to register their protest against the CAA.

Assam has been in grips of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, that seeks to grant Indian citizenship to illegal Hindu, Parsi, Sikh, Jain, Buddhist and Christian migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, who had entered India prior to December 31, 2014, without any documents.

People of North Eastern states, especially Assam and Tripura, are demanding its revocation as they fear being ‘overrun’ by non-Muslims from neighbouring Bangladesh.
