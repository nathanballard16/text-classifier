Man stages protests against liquor sale

TIRUPUR: A 32-year-old man staged a road roko on New Market Street on Monday, condemning round-the-clock sale of liquor in Tasmac shops near the Old Bus Stand in the city.V Karmegam of Kongu Main Road blocked the busy New Market Street, one of the two roads through which buses exit the terminus, in the morning. He was carrying a bottle of petrol and threatened to set himself on fire.“Tasmac is running three shops near the Old Bus Stand near the New Market Street. Even though the district administration had announced the last three days as dry days, liquor was sold in the black market. Though the state government reduced the working hours of the liquor shops, round-the-clock liquor sale is rampant across the state,” said Karmegam. “The situation has affected women, who are afraid to even venture on the streets. But people are not protesting against the menace. So, I wanted to show opposition.”Traffic was halted for more than 20minutes following the protest. The Tirupur south police picked up Karmegam and grilled him for more than six hours. They let him go with warning.
