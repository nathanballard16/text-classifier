Rahul Gandhi to address 'anti-BJP rally' in Patna on 3 Feb; 'top Opposition leaders' expected to attend Congress event-Politics News , Firstpost

Congress leader and MLC Prem Chand Mishra said the party has invited top Opposition leaders from across the country to attend Rahul Gandhi's rally.

Patna: As the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are inching closer, Congress president Rahul Gandhi will address an anti-BJP rally named 'Jan Aakansha' at Gandhi Maidan in Patna on 3 February.

This is the first time after 28 years that the Congress is holding a massive rally in the state without having any alliance.

Congress leader and MLC Prem Chand Mishra said the party has invited top Opposition leaders from across the country to attend the rally.

"It will be a huge rally as the party is holding it after 28 years without any alliance. All party workers, MPs or MLAs have geared up to make this rally a big success. We have invited all Opposition leaders to attend this rally in Patna. People of Bihar have the right to know what the central and Bihar governments have done so far for the poor and common people," he added.

While the NDA in Bihar, led by Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's JDU, has already announced its seat-sharing formula, the Opposition has yet to arrive at a consensus.

BJP, JDU, and LJP have already announced the seat-sharing formula for the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, with the BJP and JDU contesting 17 seats each, leaving six seats for Union minister Ram Vilas Paswan's LJP.
