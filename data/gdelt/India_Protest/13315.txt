TNUEF holds protest against statue vandalism

The Madurai police did not grant permission to TNUEF members to show their dissent against the issue.

Members of Tamil Nadu Untouchability Eradication Front on Wednesday staged a protest here against the defacement of Ambedkar’s statue at Vedaranyam on August 25.

M. Balasubramaniam, district secretary, said the incident was shocking because it happened close to a police station during broad daylight and in full public view.

“It seems like this idea of ‘beheading’ statues of Ambedkar, which was largely prevalent in north India, is slowly picking up in the south as well. This indicates that the Sangh Parivar is slowly creeping into Tamil Nadu as well,” he said.

The State government must appoint a committee headed by a judge from the Madras High Court to investigate into the matter.

The Madurai police did not grant permission to TNUEF members to show their dissent against the issue and their rights were being trampled upon.

“Police told us that members of other castes may be enraged by the protest. This means that they are looking at Ambedkar as a caste leader and not as a national leader. This needs to change,” he added.
