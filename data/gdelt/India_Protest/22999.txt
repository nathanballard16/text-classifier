In Photos: 'The Police Is Curbing All Dissent,' Say Protesters at Lal Qila

On the morning of December 19, people gathered near Lal Quila to march peacefully towards Shaheed Park near ITO. The march was against the recently passed Citizenship (Amendment) Act – one of many organised across the country.

Under the Act, people from six non-Muslim communities from three neighbouring countries – Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh – can be granted Indian citizenship if the came to India in or before 2014. It has been widely criticised as being communal and discriminatory, particularly when seen in conjunction with the Narendra Modi government’s proposed nationwide National Register of Citizens.

Even before the protests began, Section 144 was imposed in the Red Fort area and nearby metros were closed on the directions of the Delhi police.

Soon after the protest began, the police started detaining protesters and filling them in buses. Almost eight buses were filled and all protesters dispersed. Media personnel were also stopped from entering the area.

She said she did not come under Section 144 as she was one woman standing alone with a placard. The police detained her anyway.

In the meanwhile, people from shops and homes in the surrounding areas emerged to see what was happening.

The police asked them to go back to what they were doing and not join the protest. They threatened to detain the bystanders as well, if they did not leave.

Finally, all the buses with detained protesters left the area and the remaining crowd was dispersed by 12:30 pm. There were about eight buses in total.

Yogendra Yadav, former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Umar Khalid and ex-JNU students’ union presidents N. Sai Balaji and Mohit Pandey were among the protesters.
