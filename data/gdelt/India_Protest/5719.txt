I don’t think we should rename BISP: foreign minister

Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said that he doesn’t think the Benazir Income Support Programme, named after former premier Benazir Bhutto, should be renamed.

Speaking to the media in Multan on Sunday, he said their issue is that PPP workers have been using her name incorrectly. We have received a suggestion to change the programme’s name but this change would not be easy or quick, he said.

He also announced that Sohail Mahmood will be taking over as foreign secretary after incumbent secretary Tehmina Janjua steps down on April 16. Mahmood is currently serving as Pakistan’s high commissioner in New Delhi. Janjua is stepping down on April 16 of her own will, Qureshi said, praising her for her work in the Foreign Office.

When asked about traders protesting against rising expenses in the country, he said they will discuss the issue with them.

The foreign minister also said that during the prime minister’s visit to Sindh, he received two or three requests from the joint opposition. One issue they brought up was that they haven’t received a single rupee of the development funds they’re supposed to get, he said. Qureshi urged the chief secretary and police chief to make decisions based on merit.

Till just six months ago the PPP and PML-N were at each other’s throats and calling each other names, he said. You can see that from their statements, he said, adding that now they’ve joined forces.
