The images and videos of the Delhi Police rampage on the Jamia Millia Islamia campus following students’ protests against the new citizenship law in the national capital on Sunday underline an awful, dispiriting dissonance. The police force in Delhi, as in many other states in India, remains, for the most part, a heavy-footed anachronism in a democracy of the young, a brutalising left-over from a more repressive time. But the rankling gap between police and the people showcased on Sunday is about more than just lathi-happy policemen. The silence of the government in the aftermath of the outrage at Jamia — where the police barged into the campus without permission, forced its way into the canteen, mosque and library, dragged and beat up students, rounded up and detained them, using as pretext acts of arson and vandalism outside the university — is part of the problem.

And this absence, this lack, becomes more glaring, more grave, when it is confronted with restive students.
