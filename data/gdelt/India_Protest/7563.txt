Locals will be exempted from toll tax on Kashmir highway, assures Governor - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

SRINAGAR: Amid resentment over imposition of toll tax on Srinagar-Jammu national highway in south Kashmir by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), Governor Satya Pal Malik on Thursday assured that locals would be exempted from paying the tax.

The remarks by the Governor comes following protests by commuters, transporters and traders against the toll tax, besides criticism from all political parties in the State.

“There won’t be any toll tax on the locals at toll plaza near Sangam on the national highway,” Mr Malik told reporters on Thursday after inaugurating the Grade Separator at TRC Junction in Civil Line, Srinagar.

Mr Malik said that the Governor has taken up the issue with the Centre. However, he said that the process has been slowed up a bit due to ongoing Lok Sabha elections. (AGENCIES)
