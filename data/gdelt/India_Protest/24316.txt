Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has lost elections in the eastern state of Jharkhand.

The latest results announced by the Election Commission on Monday showed an alliance of the regional Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), the Indian National Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leading in the race for 45 seats and the BJP for 26.

"I dedicate this victory to the people of Jharkhand," Hemant Soren, leader of the regional JMM said.

Senior BJP leaders conceded defeat and said they would "accept the people's mandate."

The BJP has ruled Jharkhand since 2014.

Three of the five rounds of voting in Jharkhand were held at a time of nationwide protests against a new citizenship law introduced by the Modi administration.

"It is wrong to treat the Jharkhand results as a referendum on the citizenship law. State assembly elections are fought on local issues," said BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal.

The BJP won general elections in India in May with an enormous majority. It has lost state elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra since January 2018.

In March 2018, the BJP and its allies together controlled 20 states. After losing Jharkhand, that number will come down to 15, hindering Modi's efforts to revive the slowing economy.

Some opposition parties have abused the popular anger against the Citizenship Amendment Act to their advantage.
