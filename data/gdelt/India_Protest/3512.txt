Bedlam breaks loose in Bihar Assembly

Opposition seeks CM’s resignation in Muzaffarpur shelter abuse case

Bihar Opposition legislators on Monday created an uproar in the State Assembly and outside, demanding the resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in the Muzaffarpur shelter abuse case. Amid a continuous din, the Assembly passed the Bill of 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) of the upper caste.

When the House gathered for the day in the morning, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) MLAs were joined by Congress and Communist Party of India-Marxist-Leninist (CPI-ML) legislators, in demanding Mr. Kumar’s resignation in the wake of a special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in Muzaffarpur forwarding a petition seeking a probe into the role of Mr. Kumar and other officials, for the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to “look into”, last week. The petition was filed by an accused in the Muzaffarpur shelter abuse case of 34 minor girls, Ashwani Kumar. He was arrested in November 2018 and sent to jail.

“Ever since the Muzaffarpur shelter abuse case was exposed, we have been saying that it would not have happened without patronage from those in the government…the Chief Minister should resign from his post for a fair trial in the case,” demanded RJD MLAs Lalit Yadav and Bhai Birendra.

The Congress and Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) legislators, too, joined them. The protesting Opposition lawmakers, joined by RJD leader and former CM Rabri Devi, later staged a sit-in protest at the statue of former CM and veteran socialist leader Karpoori Thakur, installed in the premises of the House.
