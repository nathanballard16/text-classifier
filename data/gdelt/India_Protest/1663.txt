India making every effort to harass political prisoners: Dar

Srinagar, January 25, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, Hurriyat leader and the Chairman of Jammu and Kashmir Muslim Conference (JKMC), Shabbir Ahmed Dar has said that India is making every effort to harass Kashmiri prisoners mentally and physically.

Shabbir Ahmed Dar addressing a public gathering in Bandipora deplored the authorities are sending Kashmiri political prisoners to Indian jails where they are kept with criminals who are always trying to harm these freedom lovers. He said the authorities also use other methods to torture the Kashmiri inmates with the sole aim of breaking their resolve of these prisoners.

He said that Hurriyat leaders Mohammad Yousuf Mir, Hakim Abdul Rashid, Bashir Kashmiri, Mohammad Yousuf Falaie, Ghulam Ahmed Gulzar and Merajuddin Nanda had been kept in dark and small cells. The other prisoners have started hunger strike against these atrocities, he added.

He said this act of terror is against the international laws and resolutions of the United Nations which they have passed to safeguard the rights of all political prisoners. He urged the international rights bodies to send their teams to different Indian jails to end the plight of the Kashmiri political detainees.
