This Was Sheila Dikshit's Last Instruction To Congress Workers

She was missing from the protest, which was, instead, led by Haroon Yusuf, the working president of the Delhi Congress.

NEW DELHI: As the Delhi Congress chief, Sheila Dikshit's last instruction to party workers was to stage a protest outside BJP headquarters if the standoff between party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and the Uttar Pradesh government did not end Saturday, said a former cabinet colleague. Dikshit passed away Saturday afternoon at a private hospital here after suffering a cardiac arrest. She was 81. Dikshit breathed her last at 3.55 pm at Fortis Escorts Heart Institute. On Friday, the Delhi Congress had sent out a message in Dikshit's name, urging party leaders and workers to come for a mass protest at the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg against the detention of the Priyanka Gandhi in Uttar Pradesh.
