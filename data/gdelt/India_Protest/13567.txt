Dal Khalsa to hold march against temple demolition

Ravidas temple in Delhi was razed by the DDA on Aug. 10

Upset over the demolition of the Guru Ravidas temple in Delhi’s Tughlakabad, Sikh radical outfit Dal Khalsa along with two other political parties have announced to hold a protest march in Jalandhar on September 3.

The temple was demolished by the Delhi Development Authority on August 10 on the orders of the Supreme Court.

‘Reconstruct temple’

“We would be holding the march to express solidarity with the Ravidasia community and to send a message to the Delhi government that nothing short of reconstruction of the temple would soothe the hurt sentiments of the aggrieved community,” said Kanwar Pal Singh, spokesperson of the Dal Khalsa on Sunday.

Mr. Singh said the demolition of the temple was as painful to the Sikhs as it was to Ravidasia community. “Bhagat Ravidasji’s hymns are part of Guru Granth Sahib, hence both the communities have shared bonds. Moreover forceful demolition of any holy place, irrespective of religion, leaves followers in pain and stress,” he said.

‘Mann to lead march’

The spokesperson said the march will be led by Simranjit Singh Mann of the Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) and Harpal Singh Cheema of Dal Khalsa.

“We will support Ravidasia community in their future action plan to build the temple in case the government fails to reconstruct the same at the original location,” he said.
