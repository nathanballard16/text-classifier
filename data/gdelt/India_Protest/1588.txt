Although there had been a buzz for a long time in the Lucknow Congress office that something big was going to happen in Uttar Pradesh, little did the party workers knew that Priyanka Gandhi Vadra will be given charge of the state election.

The jubilant workers have already booked Ramabai Ambedkar Maidan in Lucknow for a mega rally on February 10 to formally introduce Priyanka in Uttar Pradesh.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi is also expected to attend the rally. The Congress members told Aaj Tak that when "Rahul and Priyanka ji will hold a rally together, then Congress workers from every corner of the state will attend it".

The workers have put up big posters outside the Congress headquarters to welcome her.

The Congress headquarters in the city has been given a facelift and party insiders said that it was all scripted and therefore the renovation was completed before Priyanka was appointed the general secretary of East UP.

Talking exclusively to Aaj Tak, Congress state president Raj Babbar said that the party is in a jubilant mood and the new party office will welcome Priyanka.

The new office is white in colour and the eastfacing new chamber on the first floor could be Priyanka's chamber in the party office.
