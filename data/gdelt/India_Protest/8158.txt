Buddha Nullah clean-up blocks traffic for 30 mins

Ludhiana: The MC’s move to clean up Buddha Nullah near Chand Cinema blocked traffic for nearly half an hour here on Tuesday morning.Traffic coming from Jalandhar bypass got stuck as the Old Bridge near Chand Cinema was blocked and traffic diverted to another bridge. While only heavy vehicles were stopped earlier, even light vehicles were not allowed on the bridge on Tuesday.A commuter, Harish Jain, who was coming travelling from Jalandhar to Clock Tower, said it took him half an hour to cross the stretch from Old Bridge to the Railway Station Road. He said if the MC had to clean the drain, it could have done it at night.Another commuter, Jyoti Khanna, who was travelling from Jalandhar bypass to Civil Lines, said she had to reach somewhere urgently, but her schedule went awry because of the traffic jam. “There must be some rules for these in government departments,” she said.An MC official claimed that they had to get done with the annual cleaning of the drain before the onset of rainy season. “That is why we have intensified cleaning,” he said. He said there was another bridge for the movement of traffic. “The bridge we closed on Tuesday is anyway off-limits to heavy vehicles. We did not keep the bridge closed for more than half an hour,” he said.
