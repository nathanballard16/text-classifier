Business Matters, Crowds in Sudan call for civilian-run government

Thousands of protestors demand an end to the country’s military leadership, but parties can’t agree who should be part of the process or be elected prime minister. We get the latest from the capital Khartoum from our correspondent Alastair Leithead. Staff from the cash-strapped Indian carrier Jet Airways hold a demonstration near Delhi airport – our reporter Devina Gupta goes to meet them. And we get a preview of the New York International Auto Show which opens on Friday.

Fergus Nicoll is joined throughout the programme by Diane Brady, Bloomberg BusinessWeek and Wall Street Journal writer turned media entrepreneur, from New York and Jyoti Malhotra, National & Strategic Affairs Editor at The Print, who’s in Delhi.
