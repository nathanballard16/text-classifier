National Medical Commission Bill Passed By Lok Sabha

The demonstration came in response to a call from the Indian Medical Association (IMA).

The National Medical Commission Bill was passed on Monday, by the Lok Sabha for replacing the corruption-plagued MCI with a new body. The bill was described as one of the biggest reforms that will end inspector raj in the medical education sector. The bill that seeks to repeal the Indian Medical Council Act 1956 was passed by a voice vote, amid a walkout by opposition Congress, DMK and Trinamool Congress. Doctors and students from various hospitals and colleges protested in the national capital on Monday alleging that the National Medical Commission (NMC) Bill will only give a boost to quacks, ahead of the parliament’s proceedings.
