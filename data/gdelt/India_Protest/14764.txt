Home Minister Amit Shah Blames Ex-PM Nehru For PoK's Existence

“He removed Article 370 and 35A in the very first session of the Parliament as soon as we formed the government for the second time with 305 seats,” he said.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah, on Sunday, said that the Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir is an integral part of India and said that the issue wouldn’t have been there if the then PM Jawaharlal Nehru had not announced ceasefire in 1947. “The issue of Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) wouldn't have been there had the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru not announced an untimely ceasefire in 1947, when the Army was strongly fighting against Pakistani infiltrators in Jammu and Kashmir,” he said. Speaking at a seminar on the abrogation of Article 370 in the capital of poll-bound state of Maharashtra, on Sunday, Shah congratulated Prime Minister Modi for his “bravery and grit” over decision on Article 370.
