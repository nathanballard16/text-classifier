Muslims see red over making of ‘Aisha’ movie

Dhamnagar: Protests against the digital movie ‘Aisha’ have spread to Dhamnagar with Muslims staging a demonstration Friday, and holding a rally alleging that the film distorted history.

The period drama set in the year 570 CE has enraged Muslims who want the film to be banned for “disrespecting the community’s sentiments.”

Sources said UP Shia Waqf Board Chairman Waseem Rizvi made the film ‘Aisha’ which triggered controversy as its teaser featured inappropriate scenes.

‘Aisha’ is based on the life of Prophet Mohammad’s wife Aisha. Sonam Tripathi, an actor from Uttar Pradesh will portray Aisha. The film chronicles the journey of Aisha who got married to Prophet Mohammad at the age of nine and was only 18 when the Prophet died. The film is scheduled to stream in 2020 and will be made in Hindi and English.

A meeting was held at the Khanaka Sarif of Dhamnagar to protest against the film under the Matali Janab Moulana Sayad Golam Mohammad. The Muslim community demanded action against the filmmaker and a ban on the film all over India.

Around 1,000 Muslims staged the demonstration in Dhamnagar demanding a ban on the film. They also submitted a memorandum to both the Prime Minister and the President through tehsildar Avipsa Patnaik.
