Residents protest over filthy roads, choked drains

Ludhiana: Irked by choked sewerage, contaminated water supply and open manholes, residents of Shanti Nagar, Giaspura, staged a protest at Eastman Chowk on Monday and threatened to boycott the Lok Sabha elections as politicians of all hues have ignored their problems.

They dared politicians to ask for votes and have rotten tomatoes and eggs thrown at them.

Later, area councillor Jaspal Singh Giaspura and MC officials assured the residents of solving their problems to and asked them to end their protest.

Abhimanyu Mishra, a resident, rued that for the past five years they have been struggling with contaminated water supply and choked sewerage in the locality and despite numerous complaints the problem still remains. He complained that the situation had gone worse in the last two months, which forced them to stage a protest.

Another resident of the area, Shivam Kumar, said, “The main road of the area remains submerged in filthy sewerage water due to which school children and commuters face a tough time crossing it. The uncovered manholes pose a great risk as their presence can’t be judged for water is all around.” He added they will not vote for any party as none of the leaders was taking their problems seriously.

The area councillor, however, said he was unable to understand why residents started the protest when they had already kicked off the cleaning works of the main sewerage line. “Due to the cleaning of main sewerage line through super suction machines, the inner drains were blocked temporarily and led to water stagnation.

In response to the issue, zonal commissioner J S Sekhon said, “The sewerage water diverted due to super suction cleaning created blockage in the area, but only temporarily. We have installed a machine to clear the stagnant water from the road. The situation will improve as soon as the cleaning works are completed.”
