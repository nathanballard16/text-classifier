TOKYO: From revolutionizing how we communicate with our smartphones to ushering in a new era of personalization, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been at the forefront of technological innovation for the better part of the last decade. But the next big frontier in AI technology lies in combining machine learning with human skills to drive a positive change in society and resolve some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time.Google has already started tapping artificial intelligence to tackle various social and environmental challenges across the world and is betting big on some of its ongoing pilot projects being tested across the world, including in India."AI can help solve some of the most difficult social and environmental challenges in areas like healthcare, disaster prediction, environmental conservation, agriculture, or cultural preservation,” Google's AI head Jeff Dean said at the company's ' Solve with AI ' event in Tokyo.Dean said that Google recognized how AI systems can benefit the society at large and started its AI for Social Good programme with two areas of focus - research & engineering and empowering others to solve big problems.Since data fuels all AI algorithms, the US-based internet giant has identified several areas where machine learning can be used to analyze large data sets to help drive solutions.For instance, in the field of healthcare, the use of AI technology to detect Diabetic Retinopathy has already started showing positive results."Diabetic Retinopathy or DR is a complication of diabetes which can lead to blindness. The key to preventing the disease is through early screenings. However, in many places such as India, there aren’t enough specialists to do these screenings," Google's Health Product Manager Lily Peng said at the event.Peng demonstrated how Google, with the help of its sister firm Verily, has developed a machine learning system that can detect the disease in the images of the patient's retina with a high level of accuracy on par with human specialists.The technology has already been tested in partnership with healthcare professionals in India and the initial results "have been encouraging", she said.Aside from diabetic retinopathy, Peng said that Google is using machine learning models in two other areas of medical imaging - analyzing CT scans to predict early signs of lung cancers and detect lesions in pathology images to assist doctors with breast cancer metastases.Besides, Google is also working on developing AI algorithms to help offer communication support to people with speech and hearing disabilities.The company recently rolled out Project Euphonia, which aims to make communication easier for people suffering from speech impairments caused by neurological conditions such as ALS and Parkinson's disease.The project's aim, Google said, is to use AI models that can understand diverse speech patterns, such as impaired speech, to help people communicate with the world."The first step of our research effort is to ask volunteers to record voice samples that we can use to improve our speech recognition models. Once we have enough recordings from someone, our team builds a personalized communication system that works specifically for people who recorded their voice," said Google AI Product Manager Julie Cattiau.The goal is to transcribe in real-time what people say which can allow a variety of application, such as composing an email, speaking to other people and using assistive technology, she said.And it's not just Google that is driving these innovations.Wadhwani Institute for AI, a Mumbai-based non-profit organization that was recently shortlisted for a grant from Google, is helping apply AI innovation in agriculture and has developed technology to reduce crop loss in cotton farming.The institute's AI algorithm aims to help small farmers in India who struggle with the issue of pest damage and are unable to receive timely advice from experts to prevent damage to the crops, Wadhwani AI's VP (Products and Programmes) Raghu Dharmaraju said.The system enables farmers and extension workers to take photos of pest traps and use image classification models on their smartphones to count and identify the pests and receive suggestions such as what pesticides to spray and when."The goal at Wadhwani AI is to find gaps in large agriculture systems and fix them using AI," Dharamraju said.Rainforest Connection (RFC), a US-based firm that uses Google's open-source machine learning software TensorFlow to help reduce deforestation, is another such example.Topher White, CEO of Rainforest Connection, said that deforestation caused by illegal logging is the second largest contributor to carbon emissions. "A single square kilometer forest we protect is equal to taking 1,000 cars off the road," he adds.How is RFC using AI to help conserve the environment?RFC has built a real-time detection and alert system for logging and environmental conservation in the rainforest. The system records the sounds of the rainforest with old cell phones installed high up in the trees. Once the audio goes to the cloud, the system uses Google TensorFlow to analyze the auditory data in real-time to listen for chainsaws, logging trucks, and to better understand the behavior of endangered species."Rainforest Connection’s (RFC) technology is already deployed in 10 countries on 5 continents protecting over 2000 square kilometers of forest area," White said.Google has rolled out several other AI research and engineering projects across the globe to stop illegal fishing, forecast floods, preserve ancient languages and conserve native bird species.Dean said that AI is now becoming a tool that can be used in a variety of fields that can significantly affect society, and not just in computer science."We are also providing tools like TensorFlow and training to empower more and more people and help them solve societal problems with the help of AI," Dean said.
