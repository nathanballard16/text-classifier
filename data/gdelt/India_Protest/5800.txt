Lok Sabha Election 2019, Kerala profile: Of 20 seats in state, BJP set to contest in Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur-Politics News , Firstpost

The LDF, the UDF as well as the BJP are likely to evoke voter sentiments by bringing up political murders during campaigning.

With 20 parliamentary constituencies and 140 Assembly constituencies, the southern state of Kerala is gearing up for an important election year. The 2019 General Elections will see a three-way clash between the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPM), Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party.

While the CPI-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) have footing in the state’s Lok Sabha constituencies, the BJP is planning to make inroads in at least two seats. Riding high on the Sabarimala protests, BJP plans to field Kerala BJP chief Kummanam Rajasekharan against two-time Congress MP Shashi Tharoor from the Thiruvananthapuram. During the Sabarimala agitations, after the Supreme Court verdict allowing women into the temple, party workers were at the forefront preventing women from entering the temple. The saffron party is also hopeful of consolidating the Hindu votes in its favour. It is also hopeful of winning Thrissur seat by winning over the Nair community.

Kerala faced one of the worst floods in its history in August last year when over 300 people lost their lives. According to the 2011 Census, the state has a population of 33,387,677, of which 52.3 percent live in rural areas. Although the state has a Hindu majority, it has a sizeable minorities population. Around 26.56 percent of the population are Muslims and 18.38 percent are Christians, according to the 2011 Census data.

The state has for decades been a battleground for the left and the right parties. The battle has left a trail of political murders over time. The LDF, the UDF as well as the BJP are likely to evoke voter sentiments by bringing up the murders during campaigning. Another campaigning point this election is the visibility of women. Although the number of women electors is more than that of men, there are only two women MPs in the state.
