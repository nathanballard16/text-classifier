‘Don’t expect help if did not vote for Cong’

Ludhiana: Disgruntled due to the non-availability of water supply in their area from the past four days, residents of Shimlapuri street number 4 protested outside the office of deputy mayor Sarabjit Kaur on Saturday.

One of the area residents Kirandeep said some women went to meet the deputy mayor to get water scarcity-related issues addressed. However, deputy mayor’s husband Jarnail Singh Shimlapuri said they are not bound to attend to their grievances since the residents did not vote for Congress party. It was also alleged that Singh’s supporters started hurling abuses on them.

The residents claimed that a tussle has been going on between deputy mayor and their area (ward number 32) councillor— who hails from Lok Insaaf Party— over the approval of a tubewell.

An advocate Harcharandeep Kaur said the existing tubewell in the locality needs to be changed.

Meanwhile, Jarnail Singh Shimlapuri refuted allegations of using foul language and claimed that he had arranged water tankers for residents. He said he will propose installation of a new tubewell soon to mayor Balkar Sandhua.
