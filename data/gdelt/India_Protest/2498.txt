Opposition members stall RS proceedings for 4th successive day

New Delhi: Rajya Sabha proceedings were Thursday disrupted for the fourth day in a row amid protests by opposition parties, including RJD, BSP, TMC, SP and Congress, over roster system for reservation in universities.

As soon as the House resumed proceedings at two in the afternoon, Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu asked members to begin the discussion on ‘Motion of Thanks’ on the President’s address to the Parliament.

However, opposition members were on their feet and sought a discussion on the issue of roster system under Rule 267. The rule provides that all business of the House is suspended for taking up discussion on a particular issue.

SP member Javed Ali Khan demanded discussion on reservation issue while other opposition members raised slogans. When the Chairman did not heed to their demand and said that the discussion on ‘Motion of Thanks’ would go on, opposition members—RJD, SP, BSP, TMC and Congress—trooped into the well protesting over introduction of roster system in educational institutions, which they claim limits the scope of reservation for jobs.

Naidu pointed out that the House is lagging behind and requested opposition members to let the House function. He also assured the agitating members that the government has taken note of the issue raised by them as the Minister has also replied on that.

As members refused to relent, Naidu adjourned the House for the day.

While replying on the issue in the Upper House, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar said, “We are fully committed towards reservation. We will ensure they are not affected.”

The Minister said the government will soon file a review petition in the Supreme Court on this issue and expressed confidence of getting a favourable judgement.
