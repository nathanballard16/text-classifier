1,400 farmer families to boycott Lok Sabha elections in Pilibhit

PILIBHIT: As many as 1,400 farmer families of Pilibhit ’s Tatarganj and Bamanpur Bhagirath villages have warned the state administration and Election Commission that they will boycott the Lok Sabha elections as a mark of protest against non compliance with high court’s order to issue sugarcane supply bonds to farmers. This enables farmers to supply their produce to mills.Farmers at the two villages situated on the Indo-Nepal border have sown cane across 3,000 acres with around 10 lakh quintals of standing crops valued at over Rs 32 crore. However, unlike previous years, they have not been issued supply tickets this crushing season, which is expected to conclude in April.Staring at huge losses, farmers on Saturday sent letters to the chief election officer in UP, the chief election commissioner in New Delhi, the chief secretary, government of UP, and principal secretary to the chief minister apprising them of their decision to boycott the elections.The supply bonds were blocked by the cane administration in September last year as the farmers concerned did not possess any valid documents relating to revenue titles of their agricultural lands.Explaining the problem, Gurdayal Singh, a petitioner to the HC, said land was allotted to them in the two border villages of Pilibhit by the then UP government in 1960 in lieu of their agricultural land in Udhamsingh Nagar district (now in Uttarakhand) acquired for the construction of Nanak Sagar dam.Since then, the farmers concerned were never issued titles of the land by the revenue department despite repeated petitions for the same.In the meantime, farmers cultivated their land and cane administration accepted their cane supply till the previous crushing year. Suddenlyfarmers were told to furnish land titles for the current crushing session, Gurdayal Singh said.Following this, a group of five farmers, including Singh, filed a petition in Allahabad High Court in September, seeking relief. The HC ordered the state government on October 25 to restore cane supply.When the judicial order was not complied with by the cane authorities, the petitioners filed a contempt application in the HC and the court again directed the government on December 21 and February 8 respectively to ensure compliance with its orders.Petitioners’ lawyer Amit Saxena said the HC finally gave an ultimatum to state government on March 5 to restore supply bonds within two days.Though cane commissioner Sanjay R Bhoosreddy issued orders to the effect on March 5 to cane authorities concerned, including deputy cane commissioner of Lucknow circle, the orders were not complied with, said Gurdayal Singh, who has a copy of the cane commissioner’s order.On being asked about this, deputy cane commissioner RV Ram said, “We have started a survey of standing cane crop in compliance with the court order but as the case hearing is fixed on March 28 for final disposal of the petition, we shall act in accordance with the final verdict of the HC.”
