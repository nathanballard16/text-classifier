Maharashtra Assembly polls: Rahul Gandhi to hold two public rallies today

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday will hold rallies in Maharashtra ahead of the assembly elections in the state.

Rahul will hold rallies in Yavatmal and Wardha.

On October 13, Rahul held two rallies in Mumbai.

In these rallies Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam and Milind Deora were not present.

Nirupam on Monday used the word “nikamma” in a tweet at Milind Deora, which is seen as an attack on the latter.

Nirupam’s tweet was a response to speculation over his absence at Rahul Gandhi’s rallies in Mumbai on Sunday.

He said the speculations over his absence from Rahul’s rally were baseless as he had informed the former Congress President about skipping the event.

Maharashtra will vote on October 21 and the results will be announced on October 24.
