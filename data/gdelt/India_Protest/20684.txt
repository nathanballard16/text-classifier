Kolkata: Protestors Protest Outside Raj Bhawan Against CAA

People in Kolkata gathered outside Raj Bhawan on Saturday to protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA). The Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, provides for citizenship to non-Muslim refugees of Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who arrived in India before December 31, 2014. The Bill was passed from Parliament earlier this week and became an Act with President Ram Nath Kovind giving his assent on November 12.
