Calls for Sharia Law as Kashmir Erupts Over Rape of 3-Year-Old Girl

New Delhi (India): A deep sense of shock and disgust is prevalent in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir over the rape of a three-year-old girl by her child-molester neighbour, reported India Today. The incident took place in the district of Bandipora last week. The entire Kashmir valley observed a shutdown on Sunday and Monday in protest, demanding that the culprit be brought to justice, the media report read.

People's Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti said that she was left mortified by the incident and said only Sharia Law needs to be applied to perpetrators of such heinous crimes.

Mortified to hear about the rape of a 3 yr old girl in Sumbal. What kind of a sick pervert would do this?Society often blames women for inviting unwanted attention but what was this child’s fault?Times like these, Shariah law seems apt so that such paedophiles are stoned to death — Mehbooba Mufti (@MehboobaMufti) May 11, 2019
