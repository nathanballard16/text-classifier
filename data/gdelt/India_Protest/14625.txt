Behind the Scenes With the Climate Strike's Teen Organizers

Teen Vogue reporter Sarah Emily Baum spent weeks with the student organizers of the New York City Youth Climate Strike, attending planning meetings and getting up to speed on how they put together one of the largest mass mobilizations for climate justice in history.

About one month before the Youth Climate Strike

In a New York City basement, just down the street from Trump International Hotel, 50 kids sit in folding chairs trying to come up with a plan to save the world.

“We really want this organizing body not to focus on September 20 as a goal, rather, as a catalyst,” says Xiye Bastida, a 17-year-old indigenous climate activist and member of the NYC Youth Climate Strike’s core committee. Now a resident of Morningside Heights, in New York City, Xiye spent most of her life in San Pedro Tultepec, Mexico. Back then, she saw the flooding of her hometown as an anomaly, rather than a symptom of a much more sinister problem — the climate crisis.

On September 20, Xiye and activists around the world will mobilize for the Youth Climate Strike. At the helm of this action is Greta Thunberg, a 16-year-old Swedish environmentalist who went viral for going on a weekly school strike to protest lawmakers’ inaction in response to the climate emergency. Thunberg will be joining the march in New York City ahead of the United Nations Climate Summit, where major world powers will decide whether meaningful steps will be taken to fight the climate crisis, or if they will continue stalling until it’s too late.

Until then, students like Xiye are building the movement from the ground up. “[Smaller actions like this are] important because organizing is always the backbone of every big action,” she says. “You need to be coordinated if you want to have a united front.”
