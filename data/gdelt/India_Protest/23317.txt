Demonetisation-like hardships for the poor: Sonia Gandhi leads oppn in backing anti-CAA stir

New Delhi: Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday led the opposition attack on the Narendra Modi government by accusing it of 'brute repression' of protesters and 'voices of dissent'. She asserted 'discriminatory' CAA and NRC will create 'demonetisation-like hardships for the poor'. By taking the “anti-poor” line, the opposition appears to be working on a plan to defuse BJP’s attempt to give the nationwide protests a polarising communal angle, particularly after the PM’s recent “the clothes of the protesters” remark.In a video message on Friday, Gandhi said: “The Indian National Congress expresses its deep anguish and concern over the brute repression unleashed by the BJP government against the students and citizens across the country.” She added: “CAA is discriminatory and the proposed nationwide NRC will particularly hurt the poor and vulnerable. Like at the time of the notebandi (demonetisation), they will have to stand in lines to prove their and their ancestors’ citizenship.”Backing her up, Priyanka Gandhi , who joined protesters at India Gate , said: “The government wants every Indian to stand in line to prove one’s citizenship in the same way as they did after demonetisation. The rich will show their passports. What will the poor show? Most have no documents with them.” CPM chief Sitaram Yechury said: “NRC will drag all to government offices. It’s about documents which most Indians do not have. It will be life in detention camps for so many, especially the poor and the marginalised. Indians have now seen through this sinister design of BJP to rule by fear. It can’t succeed.”In a tweet, Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee warned against polarisation. “On International Human Solidarity Day, let us celebrate our unity in diversity. This is our strength. Let us all work together to defeat the forces that seek to divide us along religious, casteist lines.”
