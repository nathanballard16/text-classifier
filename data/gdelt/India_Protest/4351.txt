Amritsar: Farmers block rail movement, demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission's report

Amritsar (Punjab) [India], Mar 5 (ANI): For the fourth consecutive day, farmers staged a protest on the Amritsar-Delhi railway line at Jandiala town on Tuesday demanding implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission, among other things.

Following a sit-in protest outside Tarn Taran Deputy Commissioner’s (DC) office for days and their ‘Jail Bharo Andolan’, scores of farmers moved to the railway tracks, leading to diversion and cancellation of a number of trains.

“The Prime Minister had promised to implement Swaminathan Commission’s report but failed to do so. He said that we will get the prices for our crops at par with the report but nothing has been done so far,” said Surinder Singh, a farmer protesting at the site.

“Chief Minister of Punjab, Amarinder Singh had promised that he would waive the loans of all the state-banks as soon as he comes into power. Even the loans of my innocent farmer brothers who had committed suicide have not been waived. His unkempt promises had led us to protest and block the railway tracks,” he added.

Police have been deputed in large numbers to control the agitating farmers

“We have duly noted their demands and sent them to the Central government,” said Vikas Hira, Sub-Divisional Magistrate of Amritsar. (ANI)
