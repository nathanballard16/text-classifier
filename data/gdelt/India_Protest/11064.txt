Independent Karnataka MLAs move Supreme Court

Two Independent Karnataka MLAs on Sunday approached the Supreme Court seeking its direction to the Congress-JD(S) coalition government led by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy to conduct floor test on Monday.

The two independent MLAs H Nagesh and R Shankar moved the apex court seeking its intervention to end the current political turmoil in the state.

The development came even as a group of dissenting ruling Karnataka legislators, who have been camping in Mumbai for the past two weeks, on Sunday lashed out at the ‘monster’ coalition government in the southern state.

In a video message, they said that they want to teach a lesson to the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition government led by Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy.

‘’We haven’t come here with other intention but to teach a lesson to this coalition (Congress-JDS) government. We haven’t come here for money or any other thing. We will go back to Bengaluru once everything is sorted out,’’ the rebel MLAs said.

The remarks from the dissenting ruling side MLAs came a day ahead of the crucial trust vote in Karnataka assembly on Monday.

The dissenting ruling side MLAs are reportedly unhappy with the treatment given to them by the Kumaraswamy government and had recently resigned from the state cabinet in protest, triggering a political crisis in the southern state.

Ahead of Monday’s trust vote, Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Sunday made an emotional appeal to a group of dissenting ruling coalition MLAs who have resigned from his cabinet and are camping in Mumbai, to attend the assembly session on Monday.

The Chief Minister also appealed the rebel legislators to expose the real face of the BJP, which he alleged had ‘’set a new benchmark in the country for immoral politics.’’ The JD(S) leader made it clear that he was not buying time for the trust vote and was not ‘’power-hungry.’’
