New Delhi, May 10: Campaigning for the sixth phase of the Lok Sabha elections will end today in the evening. On Sunday 59 constituencies spread across six states will go to polls.

The sixth phase will decide the fates of Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh, Akhilesh Yadav, union minister Maneka Gandhi among others.

Several leaders would have a hectic day today. Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi will be holding rallies in UP's Jaunpur, Pratapgarh and Sultanpur. The rally at Sultanpur would be an interesting one as Priyanka would be campaigning for Sanjay Singh, who is pitched against her aunt, Maneka Gandhi.
