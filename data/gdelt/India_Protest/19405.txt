VARANASI: A sub-inspector and two constables of Mirzapur's SWAT team are on the run after a loot case was registered against them.

The sub-inspector was identified as Dhananjay Pandey and the two constables were identified as Manish Chaubey and Dharmvir Yadav.

Mirzapur SP Dr Dharmvir Singh said, "The three policemen were suspended on November 30 after an investigation report was submitted against them by the ASP (city)."

An FIR under Section 392 (loot) of the IPC was also lodged against them at the Katra Kotwali police station on December 1.

Katra Kotwali police said, "As soon as the FIR was lodged, the trio escaped from the city. Efforts are on to nab them."

On November 27, two jewellers, Ram Murat Soni and Arjun Gupta, residents of Banda district, were travelling in Shipra Express. When the train reached Mirzapur railway station, three youthsposing as policemen in civil dress entered the train and caught the two jewellers, accusing them of carrying gold illegally.

After forcing the jewellers to deboard the train, the trio took them to the neighbouring railway colony and forced them into an SUV.

In their complaint, the jewellers reported that at Pachrahiya road, the three men looted 27 grams of gold ornaments they were carrying and then forced them to board an Allahabad-bound bus.

However, after travelling a few hundred metres, Soni and Gupta got down from the bus and went to the residence of their relative in Mirzapur.

The two robbed jewellers went to the Katra Kotwali police station to lodge a case of robbery but the police did not register their complaint. The jewellers then contacted a few local politicians who informed Mirzapur SP about the matter.
