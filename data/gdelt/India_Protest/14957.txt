Mumbai: Outside Mithibai, autos block traffic but refuse to ply to station

For scores of students studying in the NMIMS, Mithibai and NM college campus, its a daily struggle to find an autorickshaw that will ply short distances, such as the station. The situation for only gets worse when its rains and auto drivers refuse to budge,” said Tanvi Mehta, a commerce student from NM College, who lives in Irla. Though the distance between the college and the station is not much, one can’t walk there due to lack of pedestrian infrastructure. “We have been carrying out drives against errant drivers,” said a senior traffic police officer, “Any auto with metre ‘For Hire’ flagged up cannot refuse fare and has to ply. In case (s)he doesn’t, commuters can register complaints with the registration number or photograph of the auto on Traffic police Whatsapp helpline number 84549 99999.”
