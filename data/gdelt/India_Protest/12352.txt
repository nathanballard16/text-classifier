Kolkata: TMC leaders are using Puja Committees to launder money, says BJP

With the Trinamool Congress planning to hold a dharna against Income Tax notices to Durga Puja Committees, the BJP on Monday accused the ruling party leaders of laundering money through such committees.

“There is no harm if I-T Department looks into the balance-sheets of Durga Puja committees. In some Puja committees, senior TMC leaders and ministers hold important positions and they use it for laundering black money looted through cut money and chit fund scams such as Saradha. The Trinamool Congress is scared that this will be revealed if the I-T Department looks into it,” BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha told mediapersons.

Slamming Trinamool Congress chief and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s decision to stage a dharna on the issue, Sinha said, “If Mamata is so bothered about Durga Puja festival, then why did she stop idol immersions to allow Muharram processions in the state.”

State BJP president Dilip Ghosh said also hit out at the Chief Minister, saying she was trying to “protect her own interests” through such dharnas. “If the Income Tax Department summons Durga Puja committees and seeks clarification, then they should cooperate. There is nothing wrong with it. Why is Mamata Banerjee so scared of it? Why is she staging a protest against this? It seems she has got into the habit of standing by corruption, irregularities and unjust things. She is afraid that some people might be in trouble if this happens. She is doing all these to protect her own interests,” he said.

“She has never given financial details of her government to anyone. She has never given details of the central government funds and its utilisation. She has a habit of sitting on a dharna on roads. She has been looking for issues and now she has got one,” he added.
