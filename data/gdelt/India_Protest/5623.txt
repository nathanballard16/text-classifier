Shiv Sena-BJP together, but no sharing stage for CM Devendra Fadnavis, Uddhav Thackeray

Even though BJP and Shiv Sena are having pre-poll alliance, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis insisted that Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray should hold separate campaign rallies so that both the parties would be benefited. Fadnavis and Thackeray would be sharing dais only during the handful rallies to be addressed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at select places like Mumbai.

Meanwhile, in addition to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP National President Amit Shah, foreign affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and Union Minister for sanitation and drinking water Uma Bharati would be campaigning for BJP candidates in Maharashtra.

Top leadership of both the parties met at Chief minister's bungalow Varsha where detailed discussions on campaign was chalked out. Fadnavis along with senior ministers Chandrakant Patil, Vinod Tawde and Girish Mahajan held discussions with Sena leaders, including Sena President Uddhav Thackeray, Aaditya Thackeray, Manohar Joshi, Leeladhar Dake, Subhash Desai and Ramdas Kadam.

Thackeray was of the opinion that both Fadnavis and he should attack Congress-NCP in joint rallies while Fadnavis pointed out that holding separate rallies would provide more benefit to both the parties. It was decided that the party leaders should campaign more for their respective party candidates and there could be joint public rallies at division level so that it can send the message across region-wise.

It was decided in the meeting that BJP and Shiv Sena top brass including chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and Uddhav Thackeray would not be addressing many joint public rallies like the one in Kolhapur last Sunday.
