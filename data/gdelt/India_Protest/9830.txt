Trio who duped 6,500 with bike scheme arrested

NOIDA: Three persons, including the MD of a company, have been arrested for allegedly cheating around 6,500 people by promising high returns for investing in a bike taxi scheme.Investors in the scheme had started protesting after the company’s officials, who had reached out to them, went incommunicado. The modalities of the scheme matched with those adopted in the Bike Bot and MIP Cabs scams.Police said Bablu Yadav, managing director of the company, and accomplices Rohit Chauhan and Jeevan were arrested from near a liquor shop in the wee hours of Monday. While Etah resident Bablu is a history-sheeter from that district, Roorkee resident Rohit holds an MBA degree from Delhi University and Jeevan hails from Agra. Bablu has at least five cases lodged against him, including under the Gangster’s Act and Arms Act.Seven more accused in the case are absconding, of whom three have been named in the FIR lodged by investors.According to police, Bablu headed the sham company, while Rohit was among the most technically-sound and handled the execution of the scheme. The company offered different rent income plans for investing in one, three, five and seven bikes.For the one bike plan, a person needed to invest around Rs 62,250, including financing the RTO permit, installing GPS and for a year of maintenance. Those investing in the one bike plan were promised an annual return of Rs 1.08 lakh. Similarly, the three-bike, five-bike and seven-bike plans promised returns of Rs 1.8 lakh, Rs 3.01 lakh and Rs 4.21 lakh.In April this year, investors from across the state had gone to the company premises, but found no one there, following which they had flocked to Phase 3 police station.Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna said the company was being run in Noida for the past three years and the accused seemed to have taken lakhs from the investors. “The exact amount is subject to investigation,” he said.
