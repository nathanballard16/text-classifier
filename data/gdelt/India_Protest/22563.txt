Nagpur citizens protest against Citizenship Act, NRC

Nagpur, Dec 19 : Thousands of people took out a massive procession here on Thursday afternoon to protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens.

The procession included a large number of women, youth, Dalits, Muslims, lawyers, social activists and rationalists who rented slogans denouncing the CAA-NRC.

They carried black banners, flex posters and boards with anti-CAA/NRC slogans, demanded the scrapping of the laws and condemned the Bharatiya Janata Party government for forcing it on the people.

The processionists marched through several areas of the city peacefully amid tight police security as the Maharashtra Legislature's Winter Session is currently on here.

Similar protests are being held in Mumbai at the historic August Kranti Maidan and in other cities also.
