Tej Pratap Yadav plays Shiva again even as party youth get caned on roads

Tej Pratap Yadav, the elder son of former Bihar chief minister Lalu Prasad Yadav has been known for donning new looks every now and then. He could be seen playing Lord Krishna, or walking the streets of Patna as Lord Shiva with rudrakshas all over the body.

Yet again, he was seen in the attire resembling Lord Shiva on Sunday. Though his appearance could be ‘godly’, his acts have not gone down well with his own partymen. The RJD leader has reportedly set off for Deogarh despite his fellow workers being brutally beaten by the police.

The workers of RJD had protested in front of the Chief Minister’s office on Saturday against the government for irregularities and inefficiency in Bihar University. The workers had accused the government of playing with youths’ future. As the workers took to streets, police resorted to lathicharge. Some of them, including RJD youth wing president Srijan Swaraj, were arrested too. However, Tej Pratap, who was earlier heading the youth wing was nowhere to be seen.

Interestingly, sources revealed that Yadav had booked a bus to go to Deoghar. Reportedly, a bunch of bouncers and security guards accompanied the politician. Apparently, akin to a Kavariya, Yadav set off for the holy place wearing a dhoti with rudraksha beads all over.

Tej Pratap’s obsession with Hindu gods doesn’t just end with his supporters comparing him to deities. Last year, Tej Pratap had dressed up as Lord Shiva to offer prayers at a Shiva temple in Patna. The video of him playing a damru and blowing a conch during the aarti in the temple immediately went viral and needless to say, he was trolled.

In 2017, when he was Bihar’s health minister, Tej Pratap had donned the avatar of Krishna to ring in the New Year.

He was seen draped in a shawl, a blue jacket and a red turban with a peacock feather on it, playing a flute at his mother Rabri Devi’s home.
