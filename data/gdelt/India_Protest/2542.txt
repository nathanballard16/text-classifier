There have been conflicts between Cong-JD(S) since beginning: Muralidhar Rao

New Delhi [India], Feb 8 (ANI): BJP General Secretary Muralidhar Rao on Thursday hit out at the Congress-JD(S) alliance claiming that there were problems in the same since the very beginning.

Rao told ANI, “There have been conflicts between Congress and its alliance in Karnataka since the beginning. People of Karnataka are aware of all the incidents that have occurred.”

Intensifying his attack at the state government, Rao alleged that the current government is an opportunist and will not work in the longer run.

“BJP who won 104 seats is sitting in the opposition. We have always said that this government has been formed on the basis of opportunity and this will not work for long,” he added.

Hitting out at the government for blaming BJP, Rao stated, “Our responsibility as the opposition is to tell the government about its weaknesses. They cannot run this government and in future also they will not be able to do so. We are not responsible for making their government. Blames put on us are baseless.”

Congress members on Thursday night staged a torchlight protest against BJP, for not letting Karnataka Assembly function. (ANI)
