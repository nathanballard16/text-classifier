Former top cop H T Sangliana quits Congress

Former top cop H T Sangliana on Monday resigned from the Congress in protest against the party’s “neglect” of the Christian community.

Sangliana’s resignation comes close on the heels of a call by the Christian Community Coalition (Karnataka) asking all tall Christian leaders to quit the Congress. Earlier this month, former minister J Alexander also resigned from the party.

“The Christian community in Karnataka is marginalized because of a systemic neglect by the Congress party. Our community is exploited as a vote bank and repeatedly deprived when it comes to recognizing their contribution and giving suitable opportunities,” Sangliana, who was earlier with the BJP when he was first elected as MP in 2004, said in a statement.

Sangliana added that he was “pained” that not a single Christian had been given the ticket by the party to contest the 28 Lok Sabha seats in Karnataka.

“The entire community feels betrayed and neglected by the Congress.” Sangliana was aspiring for the Bangalore Central ticket this time.
