New Delhi [India], Nov 7 (ANI): Delhi district court lawyers boycotted judicial work on Thursday and will continue it on Friday as well in order to protest against the clash that broke out with policemen at Tis Hazari court complex on November 2.

"Abstinence from work in all Delhi District Courts will continue tomorrow. Litigants will be permitted to have access to the courtrooms," court's Secretary-General of the Coordination Committee, Dhir Singh Kasana said.
