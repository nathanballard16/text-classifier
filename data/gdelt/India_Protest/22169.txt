CAA is India's internal matter: Consul General of China in Kolkata Zha Liyou

Kolkata/IBNS: Reacting to the ongoing protests across the nation over the new citizenship law, Consul General of China in Kolkata, Zha Liyou, on Wednesday said the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, is India's internal matter.

"India is a great country. The protests over the citizenship law is India's internal matter. India is capable to resolve it's own problems. India has it's own way," Liyou said.

The statement comes amid nationwide protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act which will grant citizenship to all non-Muslim refugees who came to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on or before Dec 31, 2014.

Following the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, by both the houses of Parliament, violent protests were witnessed by the north-eastern states, particularly Assam and Tripura, with the agitators setting buses on fire and blocking roads.

Soon the protests reached the eastern state of West Bengal where agitators in the name of agitation set buses, trains on fire, ransacked railway station, damaged railway properties.

The protests turned violent even in Delhi on Sunday evening when several vehicles were set on fire following the agitation of the students of Delhi's Jamia Millia University. Reacting to the development, police had entered the university campus and assaulted various students sparking outrage across the country.

On Tuesday, protesters against the CAA in Delhi's Seelampur turned violent and clashed with the police leaving around 21 injured.

More than 1,000 people gathered outside the DCP office in North-East Delhi's Seelampur protesting against the CAA, with the police resorting to lathi-charge and tear gas.

Police had also beaten Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students in Uttar Pradesh after they were seen protesting against the assault on Jamia students.
