After resort politics, BJP's 'floor test' at Vidhana Soudha as MLAs ditch comfort for overnight 'dharna'

BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa declared his party members would stay put in the House itself overnight and even till the time the trust vote was decided.

With pillows to rest and a cook to prepare food, the BJP began its overnight "dharna" in the Vidhana Soudha against the Congress-JD(S) government in the state for dragging its feet on trust vote late Thursday night.

The party's state unit president BS Yeddyurappa announced to stage a night-long-sit-in with party MLAs in the Assembly to protest against the Congress-JD(S) government.

BJP legislator Prabhu Chauhan was seen coming with a bed and pillow for the protest in the Vidhana Soudha, while others were seen carrying food plates and bucket.

It was an anticlimactic Thursday in Karnataka as a combative Congress-JD(S) coalition delayed the trust vote by another day. However, after a day of chaos the Governor intervened with a letter to Chief Minister, asking him to hold the floor test by 1.30pm on Friday.

An earlier letter to the Speaker by Governor Vajubhai Vala to conduct the floor test by the end of Thursday was merely dismissed as a suggestion and not an order.

Before the house was adjourned, BJP leader BS Yeddyurappa declared his party members would stay put in the House itself overnight and even till the time the trust vote was decided.

BJP alleged the ruling coalition was deliberately prolonging the trust vote to buy time to shore up its numbers and save the government.
