Not any Tom, Dick & Harry can protest against India: Anantkumar Hegde on German student CAA protester

A German student studying in India was expelled from the country after he joined the protests at IIT-Madras against the Citizenship Act. BJP MP Anantkumar Hegde has now said how can "any Tom, Dick and Harry" be allowed to join protests against internal issues of India.

In a tweet, Anantkumar Hegde said, "Any Tom, Dick & Harry from any part of this globe can poke themselves and involve in their s**t protest in our internal issues!! Does any other country provide such liberty? Precisely #IndiaSupportsCAA!"

A German student who took part in anti-CAA protests in Chennai last week has left India after Bureau of Immigration authorities asked him to leave since his participation in demonstrations over domestic issues allegedly violated visa regulations.

Jakob Lindenthal, who was in India on an exchange programme, was attached to the Physics Department of the IIT Madras and he left the country on Monday night, reported PTI.

Holding a placard that had an indirect reference to the Nazi persecution of the Jews in Germany between 1933-45 during the Hitler regime, he had told co-participants at a protest last week that small measures against Jews had not attracted much attention initially.

Such measures eventually led to their mass killings, the German student had said.

The placard read "1933-1945 We have been there." He had also held another one which read, "No democracy without dissent." Jakob, who had also taken part in a protest at the institute's Gajendra Circle against the amendment to the Citizenship Act, was a student of the Technical University of Dresden in Germany.
