State govts will disrespect Ambedkar in opposing CAA: RSS

New Delhi, Dec 15 : Indresh Kumar, a key Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary, on Sunday, lashed out at the Congress and other opposition parties for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act. He said, those state governments who have threatened not to implement the Act in their states, will run the risk of disrespecting Ambedkar.

Training his guns at the opposition, Kumar alleged, "the opposition is tarnishing India's image", adding that those who are opposing the Act are anti-Muslim.

"Congress party through its opposition to the Act is sending the message that the party is anti-Muslim". said Kumar, who is also the patron of RSS' muslim wing -- Muslim Rashtriya Manch.

Hitting out at the Amarinder Singh government of Punjab, the RSS functionary labelled the Congress-led punjab government as "anti-Sikh".

"Congress' Punjab government is anti-Sikh, else, why would it oppose the Citizenship Amendment Act?" asked Kumar. The CAA will allow Sikhs among other religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to seek Indian Citizenship.

Earlier, the Punjab chief minister had said that he will not allow the Act to be implemented in Punjab.

Kumar was speaking at an event of MRM called "Jashn-E-Uplabdhiyan", in New Delhi on Sunday. He praised the Narendra Modi government for laying "the foundation of a New India" through the Act.

"All decisions in 2019 are only to unite the country, not to divide it", he said, referring to the Abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of J&K into two Union Territories.

Speaking on the sidelines of the event, Shahid Akhtar, the National Convenor of Muslim Rashtriya Manch, told IANS that the organisation reviewed key government decisions like ban on instant Triple Talaq, CAA and decided that there is a need to communicate the "truth" of the new Act to the people of India.
