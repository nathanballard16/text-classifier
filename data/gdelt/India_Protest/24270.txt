The opposition has claimed that the BJP is paying the cost of an aggressive campaign on the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizens (NRC), which has resulted in its poor show in the Jharkhand Assembly elections. During its election campaign in the last three phases of the polls, the saffron party had raised concerns about the amendments in citizenship and the NRC in its election rallies. The final three-phase poll results show that the BJP lost about five seats or 23 per cent of its seats compared to the previous Assembly election.

The last three-phases of voting were held in Jharkhand amid nationwide protests against the NRC and the CAA. On December 12, 16 and 20, polls took place for 43 seats out of the total 81 seats in the state. The result tally shows that the BJP won 17 seats followed by the JMM (11) and Congress (9), while the AJSU, a former election ally of the BJP, got two seats in the last three phases.

In 2014, the BJP had won 15 seats. In 2019, as per available data of the Election Commission, the BJP was able to retain only 10 seats. However, Congress and the JMM have gained two and six extra seats over their previous wins in the last assembly election.
