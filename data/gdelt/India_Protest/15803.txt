Jammu And Kashmir: Congress To Boycott Upcoming Block Development Council (BDC) Elections

New Delhi:

Congress will boycott the Block Development Council (BDC) elections in Jammu and Kashmir. Congress will not take part in the local body elections as part of protest against prevailing situation in the state including the detention of leaders post abrogation of Article 370.

Jammu and Kashmir Block Development Council (BDC) polls are scheduled to be held on October 24. These will be the first elections to be held in the state since its special status was revoked on August 5.

Jammu and Kashmir Congress Chief GA Mir said the Election Commission of India should have consulted with political parties with several state leaders still under detention before announcing the elections.

"We won't participate in the BDC election. How can political parties take part when leaders are under detention? The EC should have consulted political parties before announcing block development council election," GA Mir said on Wednesday.

Taking a shot at BJP, Mir alleged that the election was being held to facilitate the victory of only one party.

Barring the BJP, all the main political parties in Jammu and Kashmir are not expected to contest the elections. The NC, PDP and CPI(M) had already expressed reservations over participating in the polls.

Mainstream political leaders in the valley, including two former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti, have been either detained or placed under house arrest since the government moved to revoke some provisions of Article 370.
