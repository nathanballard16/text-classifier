Bengaluru: In a show of solidarity against their common enemy -the BJP, top JD(S) and Congress leaders, on Tuesday, announced that they would hold a public rally around Bengaluru on Mar. 31, with Congress President Rahul Gandhi and JD(S) supremo and former PM H.D. Deve Gowda (HDD) sharing the stage.

At a joint press conference yesterday, the parties said they were committed to defeat the divisive and communal forces in Karnataka in the LS polls.

Addressing press persons, JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda said that nominations have already begun and there was less time.

Appealing workers of both the parties, HDD said “Our resolve is to not only retain the seats we won in 2014, but also win a majority of seats held by the BJP” and added that he and CLP leader Siddharamaiah will address any issues in any constituency.

Siddharamaiah said that the observers will ensure co-ordination between both the parties. Strict directives will be issued to the district units of both the parties that they should forget their difference and work towards defeating the BJP.

Terming the proposed Mar. 31 rally near Bengaluru as a ‘historic’ one, Siddharamaiah said following the rally, leaders from both parties will hold joint campaigns across all the 28 seats.

Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy admitting that there were problems in a few constituencies, asserted that they would be resolved. The CM appealed the rank and file of both the parties to focus on defeating the BJP.
