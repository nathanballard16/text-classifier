Vox Populi, Vote Rongali

Democracy plays out in many ideas and ideologies. Elections present an even more ­curious picture—colourful, boisterous and achingly tortuous in their glorious unpredictability. Assam is leitmotif of all that comes with elections, including an impromptu jig recently by Himanta Biswa Sarma, state minister and the BJP’s key man in the Northeast. Of course, it’s that time of the year, Rongali Bihu, and not many in the state can resist the temptation to shake a leg. Of all people, Sarma would know that large sections of voters in Assam are reposing their faith in the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. After all, Sarma is the man Amit Shah refused to give a ticket to so that he can concentrate on ensuring that the BJP inc­reases its seat tally in the state from eight.
