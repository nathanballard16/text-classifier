Raja Bhaiya’s father booked for attempt to breach peace

ALLAHABAD: The Kunda Kotwali police in Pratapgarh lodged an FIR against Uday Pratap Singh (87), father of independent MLA from Kunda and former UP cabinet minister, Raghuraj Pratap Singh , alias Raja Bhaiya on Tuesday night on the charges of violating administrative orders, promoting enmity between different groups and attempting to disturb peace of the area.Earlier, he was also put under house arrest on Monday evening and released on Tuesday night after all Muharram events and procession concluded peacefully.SP Pratapgarh, Abhishek Singh , said, “Uday Pratap intentionally put up 15 saffron flags on the Muharram procession route. He was told to remove the flags before the 10th day of Muharram, but he intentionally disobeyed the orders.”He also made futile attempts to hold a ‘bhandara’ (community feast) in the area a day before Muharram although section 144 of CrPc was in force, Singh added.“He was put under house arrest in Kunda from Monday evening till Tuesday night when he insisted on organizing a Hanuman Chalisa ‘paath’ (recitation) and a bhandara in Shekhpura village on Tuesday, the day of Muharram,” the SP said.A section of traders in Kunda downed shutters on Tuesday to protest against the octogenarian’s house arrest.Uday Pratap had also filed a petition before the Lucknow bench of Allahabad high court seeking permission for recitation of ‘Hanuman Chalisa’ and holding a bhandara.DM Pratapgarh, Markandey Shahi, however, sent a report to the high court stating that permission to organize bhandara might disturb law and order situation in the area, hence permission could not be granted.Police lodged FIR under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony), 295A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the IPC.
