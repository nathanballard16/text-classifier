The process of getting the hostel vacated is on and 25 to 30 per cent of students have left it, the rest are expected leave by evening," he said.AMU officials on Monday said at least 60 students were injured in the Sunday clashes inside the varsity, which has been sealed and heavy patrolling is underway.AMU Registrar Abdul Hamid said the police entered the campus late Sunday night and clashes occurred inside the campus.The clashes at AMU occurred shortly after agitating Jamia Millia Islamia students in Delhi turned violent, forcing police to use batons and tear gas to disperse them.Hundreds of students gathered at the trauma centre of the Nehru Medical College Hospital in Aligarh, where the injured are being treated.NMCH CMO Nisar Ahmed said on last count, around 60 students, most of them having trauma and eye injuries caused by the tear gas, are being treated.Detailing sequence of events in AMU, varsity spokesperson Shafey Kidwai, in a statement, blamed "lumpen elements" for the trouble at the university."Peaceful democratic protests against the CAA was being held in the campus for the past few days, but on Sunday evening, an atmosphere of unrest started enveloping in the campus after violence in Jamia Milia Islamia, New Delhi," he said."As tempers ran high, a group of lumpen elements, yet to be identified, started instigating protestors and this resulted in a very difficult situation which threatened to go out of control and could have led to loss of precious lives of innocent students," Kidwai said, adding under such circumstances university declared winter vacation from December 16 to January 5.Requesting anonymity, an AMU student, who was witness to the trouble, said, "Around 7.30 PM social messages were circulated throughout the campus calling for a general body meeting of students at the university library.""These messages were not sent by the students union leaders but from some unidentified sources," he said, adding at the library, students raised the issue of Jamia violence and decided to hold a protest near Bab-e-Sayed gate inside the campus.""Some youths wearing masks tried to instigate students by raising emotive slogans and urged them to reach the varsity gate in large numbers. Shortly, a clash broke out and police entered the campus," he said.Another student belonging to the Morrison Court hostel whose brother was allegedly picked up from the hostel around 11 pm said, "A group of policemen forced their way inside the hostel after beating up security guards. They lobbed teargas shell, breaking the window pane of room no 46 which was engulfed in smoke.""My brother and three others who were present had to flee, but were picked up by the police, thrashed and taken away," he said, urging the varsity authorities to trace their whereabouts.In Varanasi, scores of Banaras Hindu University students staged a protest at the main entrance gate of the campus in support of the AMU and Jamia students.BHU students gathered at the entrance holding placards and banners and shouting slogans, but a large number of police force was deployed there to prevent any violence.Scores of BHU students, including those from the Left-backed AISA had also staged a protest at the Lanka Gate on Sunday in support of the AMU students.In a late night appeal, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath urged people to maintain peace and harmony and eschew rumours.Meanwhile, BSP President Mayawati on Monday demanded a judicial robe into the violence at the AMU and Jamia Milia terming it as "unfortunate".
