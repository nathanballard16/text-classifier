New Delhi: The RSS-affiliated ABVP and the DUSU's joint march to the Human Resource Development Ministry on Thursday to protest the proposed hostel fee hike in the Jawaharlal Nehru University was stopped by police near the Parliament Road police station.

Delhi Police had imposed prohibitory orders in the area and put up triple layer of barricades. Some protesters, however, climbed over the barricades and scuffled with the security personnel.

The protesters raised slogans against the JNU administration and the HRD Ministry who, according to students, had unilaterally imposed fee hike on the students.

Earlier, the ABVP demanded resignation of Human Resource Development Minister, Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank'.

Slogans like "HRD Minister istifa do (HRD minister resign)", "Fee hike nahi sahenge," (We won't tolerate a fee hike)," echoed opposite the Parliament Street police street as agitating student clambered on to the barricades.

"First of all, we are not the student wing of BJP, and we have always stood for students no matter which party leads the government," ABVP state Secretary Siddharth Yadav said during a march from Mandi House to the HRD Ministry against the proposed hostel fee hike in JNU.

"We are here to stand for students' right and we demand resignation of HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal on this issue," he added.

Students of the Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) have been protesting for the past several days demanding a complete rollback of a proposed hike in hostel fees, along with reconvening of the Inter-Hall Administration meeting that had passed the proposed fee hike on October 28.

The JNU Students Union (JNUSU) also demanded the resignation of Vice Chancellor Mamidala Jagadesh Kumar, claiming he had lost the faith of students and the teachers.
