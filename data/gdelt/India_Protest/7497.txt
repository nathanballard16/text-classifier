Hyderabad: Tension mounts at in-laws' house of NRI Srilatha with the arrival of her body

Tension mounted at the in-laws' house of NRI Srilatha at Habsiguda on Wednesday who committed suicide due to the alleged dowry harassment by her husband and in-laws.

Srilatha ended her life at her paternal uncle's house in Mumbai. Her body was brought to her in-laws' house in Habsiguda.

According to the police, Srilatha got married to Juvvandi Vamsi Rao in 2011 and the duo had flown to London in 2012 where the harassment has begun. Vamsi Rao and her parents harassed for additional dowry even after Srilatha delivered a baby girl.

The victim is learned to have attempted suicide earlier by jumping in front of a train in London in 2018. Later, she went to uncle's home in Mumbai and was staying there for the last 10 months.

The relatives of Srilatha staged a protest in Habsiguda demanding the arrest of Vamsi Rao and his parents.
