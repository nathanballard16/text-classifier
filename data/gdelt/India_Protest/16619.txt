Rahul meets Concor union, slams divestment proposal

New Delhi, Oct 22 : Former Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday met the agitating staff union of the Container Corporation of India (Concor) who are protesting against the proposed disinvestment of the state-run company.

Gandhi's meeting with the protesting Concor staff follows the party's high decibel campaign against the government's divestment proposal.

Following the meeting, Rahul Gandhi tweeted: "Highly profitable and strategic, the Container Corporation (CONCOR) is a PSU jewel that some of the PM's greedy crony capitalist friends are hungry for and the Govt plans to sell. I met members of the CONCOR union today. Please share their attached petition and support their cause." The Concor union has met Rahul Gandhi and requested him to take up the matter with the government. The Congress has alleged that the company has been undervalued by the government as also undervalued the assets of the Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL).

The Concor union maintains that it is a profit making company.

As a part of its programme of strategic divestment, the government has invited bids for appointment of advisors for the disinvestment of CONCOR which is under the jurisdiction of the Railway Ministry.
