A massive rally in support of Citizenship Amendment Act was held by BJP in West Bengal's capital Kolkata. BJP Working President JP Nadda and party's general secretary in-charge of West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya led the march, which commenced from Hind Cinema-CR Avenue and culminated at Shyambazar. During the march, Nadda and Vijayvargiya were atop a jeep, waving to the people amid tight security. While party workers and supporters waved BJP flags, and raised slogans in favour of the party. Several leaders including Locket Chatterjee and Roopa Ganguly were present at the march. "We are leading the march in a peaceful manner. People have been misled. In West Bengal, the Chief Minister herself is troubling the people. You are telling lies to the people and troubling them," Ganguly told ANI. (BCCL)
