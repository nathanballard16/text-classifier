Thousands of LGBT Members Take to Streets in Delhi to Protest Law for Indian Transgender Community

The transgender community in New Delhi, the national capital of India, held a pride parade as a mark of protest against the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill, 2019, on Sunday.

As per the bill, trans people can only identify themselves as man or woman after they have undergone surgery, says Ray, a trans woman studying at Delhi University.

The process occurs in two-steps. The first stage mandates that a trans person should apply for a “transgender certificate”, thereby requesting that the authorities change their legal gender.
