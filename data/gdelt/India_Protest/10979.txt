Cong seek review of SC’s July 17 order on rebel MLAs



Kumaraswamy moves SC over’s second ‘love letter’; govt defies both deadlines for floor test.In a face-off with Governor Vajubhai Vala, the JDS-Congress government in Karnataka defied the two deadlines set by him to demonstrate its majority in the Assembly Friday itself, worsening the political logjam.The assembly was adjourned till Monday after the governor’s 1.30 pm deadline and the second one to conclude the confidence motion process by Friday itself was ignored, prolonging the climax to the ceaseless power struggle.As the first deadline neared, the ruling coalition vociferously questioned the governor’s power to issue such a direction, with Kumaraswamy citing a Supreme Court verdict that a governor cannot act as ombudsman of the legislature.The second missive by the governor was dismissed as a “love letter” by Kumaraswamy who criticised Vala for talking about horse-trading now “when it had been happening” for the last several days.Before adjourning the House for the day, Speaker Ramesh Kumar said the motion of confidence would reach finality on Monday and it would not be prolonged further under any circumstances, to which the government agreed.In his second missive to Kumaraswamy, the governor expressed his “prima facie satisfaction” that the government has lost its majority confidence of the house.“When the allegations of horse-trading are widely made and I am receiving many complaints, it is constitutionally imperative that the floor test be completed without any delay and today itself.“I, therefore, require you to prove your majority and complete and conclude the floor test procedure today,” Vala told Kumaraswamy in the second letter since Thursday.The governor said he was receiving various reports about the attempts being made for horse-trading.“This can be averted only if the exercise of conducting the floor test is conducted at the earliest and without any delay,” the governor said.As he was speaking on the confidence motion, Kumaraswamy said, “I have received the second love letter” from the governor. He has got gnanodaya (awareness) now. Governor talks about horsetrading in the letter... was he not aware of it till now,” Kumaraswamy said.“I seek your protection,” the chief minister told the Speaker and left the letter (deadline) issue to him.Kumaraswamy, who had moved the confidence motion Thursday, said 25 to 26 members had to still speak on the confidence motion and requested the speaker to give them the time.The House, which missed the Governor’s 1.30 pm deadline for the voting on the confidence motion, was also locked in a debate on when the trust vote process should be completed.“Lot of discussion has happened; I want to close it (trust motion process) today,” the speaker said towards the end of the day’s proceedings.He also said, “Caesar’s wife should be above suspicion; I cannot be guilty of dragging proceedings.”Kumaraswamy said “I have made preliminary submission; we can conclude (the process) on Monday.”As the assembly clock struck 1.30 pm, the BJP insisted on a division on the confidence motion in accordance with the letter by the governor to him.Vala had Thursday set the 1.30 pm deadline for proving the majority within hours after the voting on the confidence motion could not take place with the Speaker adjourning the day’s proceedings in the assembly.Allegations of bribery flew thick and fast as the debate progressed with the ruling coalition ministers and members targeting the BJP for its alleged toppling game.“Legislators were offered Rs 40-50 crore to lure them; whose money is it?” asked Kumaraswamy hitting out at BJP even as the opposition party members remained unruffled apparently to ensure there was no disorder that would disturb voting.JDS MLA Srinivas Gowda alleged he was offered Rs 5 crore bribe by BJP to defect to bring down the government. Minister Sa Ra Mahesh alleged Vishwanath (JDS former state president) had told him that he needs money as he has election-related loan of Rs 28 crore.In his speech, Kumaraswamy accused BJP of resorting to ways to circumvent the anti-defection law.“Why is the BJP in a hurry, if they have the numbers... why the hurry to end the debate in one day.... I know it is not easy to get your MLAs,” Kumaraswamy said looking towards Yeddyurappa.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------A team of Karnataka Police was granted permission byto meet Shrimant Patil on Friday at St George Hospital where the Congress MLA has been admitted amidst fracas over being “kidnapped” by the BJP. Patil’s statement was recorded as there is a clear directive from Karnataka Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar to keep a watch on him. The Speaker has, in fact, asked Karnataka home minister MB Patil to submit a report on Patil’s health.While the Congress maintains that the BJP “kidnapped” their MLA, the man himself has given clean chit to the opposition. Patil said he experienced chest pain after leaving for Chennai fromon Wednesday. He said doctors suggested getting treatment in Mumbai, so he travelled to the city and got admitted in a private hospital, from where he was shifted to state-run St George Hospital.Outside the hospital, Patil’s Audi is parked and a posse of 200 police officials is guarding the entrance. His personal assistant gets him food from a nearby Punjabi restaurant and no one is allowed to meet him. Congress workers insist that Patil was hospitalised to mislead the Assembly. Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president Dinesh Gundurao has asked the Speaker to help bring Patil back.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Karnataka Congress moved the Supreme Court on Friday contending that its July 17 order on the resignation of 15 rebel Congress-JD(S) MLAs was coming in the way of the party issuing whip to its legislators on the ongoing trust vote. The application said the apex court order “whittles down” the power of a political party to issue whip to its MLAs as it has a constitutional right to do so and the court can’t restrict that.
