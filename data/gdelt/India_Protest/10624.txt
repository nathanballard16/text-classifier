MADURAI

A petition filed before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday sought permission to stage a demonstration in Paramakudi in Ramanathapuram district, demanding declaration of the birth and death anniversaries of Immanuel Sekaran government functions.

After hearing the petition filed by M.R. Ranjith Kumar of Madurai, organiser of Devendra Kula Vellalar Makkal Sabai, Justice G.R. Swaminathan ordered notice to the State.

The petitioner said the event was scheduled for August 3, and since the police denied permission for the event, he filed the petition.
