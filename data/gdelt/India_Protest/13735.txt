Bob Katter chains himself to shovel in bid to open up Galilee

MAVERICK MP Bob Katter has staged his own protest to counter the anti-Adani mob who continue to cause chaos shutting down mine sites and business in the North.

The Kennedy MP today chained himself to a shovel next to a rail line outside of Townsville to highlight the need for work to start on a publicly owned rail to open up the Galilee basin.

Wearing jeans, a singlet, steel caps and his trademark Akubra, Mr Katter rallied with his homemade signs reading "Lights for China India" and "Our Coal, Our Rail, Our Jobs."

"We want North Queensland to own the rail line into the Galilee and not some foreign corporation," Mr Katter said.

"Our rail line will open up all of the Galilee not just a small part of it.

"This bloke, he's chained himself to the drill rig so we can't work.



"Well I'm chaining myself to the shovel so I have to work - for all of the Galilee, not one corporation.

"And this rail line will be owned by North Queensland.

"Give us the power, and we will give you the rail line."

Mr Katter has been one of the only voices screaming for the railway line into the Galilee Basin to be a multi- user state-owned and built asset, not owned by Adani, a venture which he supports.

"Adani is essential, it is the gateway to the massive Indian market where 500 million people are without electricity," Mr Katter said.

"But whoever owns the railway line will control the Galilee, no question about that."
