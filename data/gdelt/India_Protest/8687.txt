Telangana Speaker okays 12 Congress MLAs’ plea for tie-up with TRS

Hyderabad: The Telangana Speaker on Thursday admitted the request of the 12 defecting Congress MLAs to merge the Congress legislature party with the state's ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS), dealing a major setback to the national party and robbing it of the opposition status in the state.The late evening development comes a fortnight after the Congress appeared to have gained some lost ground in Telangana by securing three of the 17 Lok Sabha seats, and weeks after it won three member of legislative council (MLC) seats. Earlier in the day, state Congress leaders had protested in front of the Assembly, seeking to disqualify the turncoats.Led by Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) president N Uttam Kumar Reddy, they had attempted to meet the Speaker, Pocharam Srinivas Reddy, but he was unavailable.“Those MLA s have been purchased, one at a time, over four months. The disqualification petitions of the MLA s are pending with the Telangana Speaker for four months now,” said PCC chief Reddy.“The matter (seeking orders to disqualify turncoats) is pending in the court of the Telangana Chief Justice for over a month now.”On Thursday morning, the defecting MLAs had obtained the blessings of TRS president and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao before submitting a letter to the Speaker seeking the merger. They claimed to represent the CLP.Congress leaders in the state now plan to explore legal options to prevent the merger, apart from seeking to get the turncoats disqualified.ET had earlier reported that the ruling TRS is working hard to win over more from the Congress to dissipate the national party in the Telangana Assembly.Helping the turncoats circumvent the disqualification provisions of the anti-defection law, Congress lawmaker Pilot Rohit Reddy on Thursday announced his allegiance to the treasury benches, taking the total number of Congress MLAs defecting to TRS to 12, or two-thirds of their total Assembly strength.Though the Congress had won 19 out of 119 seats in the state Assembly in December, their number got reduced to 18 with PCC president Uttam Kumar Reddy, who has been elected to Lok Sabha from Nalgonda, submitting his resignation as an MLA on Wednesday.This is the second time the Congress has faced embarrassment in the state over the last few months. Soon after sweeping the Assembly polls in December, the ruling TRS had managed to lure four Congress members from the legislative council.“TRS president and Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao perceives the Congress, which has a strong cadre base across the state, as the potential threat and wouldn’t want to give it any scope for resurgence,” said political analyst Manchala Srinivasa Rao. “Ahead of the Lok Sabha poll results, TRS had paused luring further defections from the Congress in Telangana Assembly, only to keep its options open to support the Congress-led coalition government at the Centre, which anyhow didn’t happen.”This is not the first time that TRS had engineered defections. In the 2014 Assembly polls, the regional party, which had won 63 of the 119 seats, had managed to lure 25 MLAs and seven MLCs of Opposition parties to shift loyalties, weakening the two key opposition parties – Congress and Telugu Desam Party (TDP). Further, the ruling TRS went ahead and merged the TDP legislative party with its own legislative party.In the 2018 Assembly polls, TRS won 88 out of the 119 Assembly seats. By entertaining the defections --- 12 from Congress, one from TDP and two independent, the regional party improved its tally to 103. Now, Congress will be left with six MLAs, All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen with seven members, and BJP and TDP with one lawmaker each, in the Assembly.
