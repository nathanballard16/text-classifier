Child dies after five days down well in India

A child rescued after five days stuck down a well in India has died.

Fatehveer Singh, three, fell down the well last Thursday afternoon - and was finally extracted 110 hours later.

However, after being rushed to hospital, he was declared dead.

Villagers in the area of Punjab had protested over delays in trying to rescue the toddler from the 45m deep hole in the ground.

“Fatehvir has been pulled out of the borewell and he is being taken to hospital in an ambulance,” Sagrur Deputy Commissioner Ghanshyam Thori told news agency PTI.

The toddler is reported to have fallen down the 18cm wide hole while playing in a field near his home in the Sangrur distrrict.

The hole is believed to have been covered with cloth - which covered his face when he fell.

While rescuers using drilling gear were said to have reached his depth earlier, according to India Today it was at the wrong level.

The National Disaster Response Force told the paper it was a difficult operation.

"It has never ever conducted such an operation at this depth. Usually in other cases for saving child, the depth of borewell was just 40-50 feet.”

Officials told the paper food or water couldn’t be given to the child, but oxygen was.

Cabinet Minister Vijay Innder Singla earlier tweeted: “We are hoping for the best, and pray for a speedy end to this ordeal! “
