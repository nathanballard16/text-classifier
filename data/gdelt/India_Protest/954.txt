Plea to open Netaji Museum for public

Puri: Sachetan Nagarika Manch, a social outfit, has demanded the immediate opening of Netaji Museum at Gopal Ballav Road here for public.

Activists of the outfit Sunday held a demonstration near the museum and urged the state government to open the facility for public by January 23 that coincides with the birth anniversary of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.

The outfit has threatened to raise the issue with the President of India, Prime Minister and the Chief Justice of India if the authorities concerned do not open the museum by January 23.

The outfit targeted the district administration for its failure to make arrangement for opening of the museum for people. “There were reports that the administration was facing problems to inaugurate the museum due shortage of time on the part of some people’s representatives. The authorities concerned could inaugurate the museum in the hands of either Odisha Governor or Orissa High Court Chief Justice. They could also invite Gajapati king Dibyasingha Dev for the purpose,” said an activist of the outfit.

Among others, Sachetan Manch convener Priyadarshan Patnaik, president Prasanna Dash, secretary Lalatendu Mishra, adviser Shivsundar Mishra, treasurer Nalinikant Barik and coordinator Prafulla Behera participated in the demonstration.

It is worth mentioning here that Netaji’s father had constructed a house at Gopal Ballav Road in the Holy City here by taking a piece of land on lease form the district administration in the pre-independence era.

The state government had converted the house as a museum after Netaji by taking control over the properties a few years ago. However, the museum could not be opened for public due to some litigation.

However, all these litigation have been solved by the judiciary recently, sources said.
