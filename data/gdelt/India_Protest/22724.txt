"There were at least 10 buses filled with people who were detained," said Aman, who was present at the spot. At 11 am, various political leaders and student organisations planned to march from Red Fort to Shahidi Park at ITO. "A lot of people were detained, but I somehow managed to save myself and joined other protesters here," said Shahid, a Delhi University student. On the other hand, the detained protestors were dropped off at various locations of national Capital and NCR. A Delhi University student who "saved from being detained" said that a lot of the protesters were let off at Anand Vihar.
