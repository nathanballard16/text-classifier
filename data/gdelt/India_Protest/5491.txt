Manish Sisodia and Satyendra Kumar Jain were on a one-week long hunger strike and finally succeeded in putting up the CCTV cameras. Delhi is getting free water.”

His tweet further reads: “Savings done by AAP: Electricity 2500 Rs, water 1000 Rs, medicine 2500 Rs, school fees did not increase 5000 Rs (two kids) which totalled to saving of to 11000 Rs. Loss done by Modi-ji: Gas 1000 Rs, Metro 2000 Rs (two people), Petrol/Diesel 5000 Rs, Price rise 8000 Rs totalled to a loss of 16000 Rs.”

Union Home Minister Singh on Tuesday, while addressing an election rally here, took a potshot at Chief Minister Kejriwal led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in the city-state, which he alleged, has done nothing to improve the people’s life.

“AAP leaders promised that they will provide free 20,000-litre water to the poor. They promised that the toilets will be constructed everywhere. They promised that 20 new colleges and 5,000 schools will be opened up in the national capital, but none of these promises was fulfilled by them,” he said. (ANI)
