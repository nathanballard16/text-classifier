Morigaon (Assam) [India], Dec 28 (ANI): Workers of Assam BJP took out a four-kilometre-long mega rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act in Morigaon district's Jagiroad area on Friday.

The massive rally was led by Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and State Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.

Several leaders, including Sonowal and Sarma, also addressed the gathering here.

Taking to Twitter, the Chief Minister said after attending the rally, "People of Assam want peace and progress. Massive turnout in the peace rally at Jagiroad proved this once again. My heartfelt thanks to the people for their continued faith in us. Sought their blessings and cooperation to continue the development journey of our state."

Sarma also posted a picture of the rally on Twitter, in which a massive gathering of people can be seen.
