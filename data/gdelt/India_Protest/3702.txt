RAJOURI, Feb 21: Alleging that BJP, its Jammu leaders and MPs have cheated them, displaced persons from PoK led by SOS International held strong protest demonstration at Rajouri town today.

A large number of PoK DPs from Rajouri took part in the protest demonstration, which was organized under the banner of SOS International – a prominent organization of PoK Displaced Persons. After the demonstration near Dak Bungalow Rajouri, the protesting DPs marched towards Deputy Commissioner’s office where a memorandum of demands was submitted to the Prime Minister of India and Governor J&K State through Mohd Aijaz Asad, DC, Rajouri.

In the memorandum, the SOS International highlighted the demands, which include implementation of the whole package passed by State Cabinet in October 2014 for PoK Displaced Persons, facilities to all displaced persons at par with Kashmiri migrants, reservation of eight Assembly seats for the people displaced from PoK, permission for PoK DPs to visit their religious places in Pak occupied Jammu and Kashmir, inclusion of 5,300 PoK DP families living outside the State in the ambit of package passed in October 2014 and return of cash deposits with interest to PoK DPs lying with J&K Bank, Mirpur.

Earlier, while talking to media persons outside DC office, Rajouri, Subash Sharma senior member of SOS International, in presence of Rajouri district president of SOS Intl Capt Ravinder Kumar and others held BJP responsible for non-redressal of grievances and issues of the PoK DPs as the duo allegedly misled Central Government over their demands, particularly the implementation of whole package passed by the J&K Govt in October 2014.

Terming BJP slogan of `Sabka Saath Sabka Vikas’ as farce, Sharma said that PoK DPs from Poonch, Rajouri and other areas were again befooled by the BJP which took them to Modi’s rally in Vijaypur with a promise of some big announcement there but the PM completely ignored the community in his speech and kept appeasing only Kashmiri migrants.
