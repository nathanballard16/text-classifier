Irom Sharmila: Democracy exists “only in name”; govt disregards people’s sentiments when making decisions

Manipur human rights activist Irom Chanu Sharmila has criticised the NDA government, accusing it of disregarding people's sentiments when making policy decisions.

Democracy exists in the country "only in name" under the current dispensation, she said, urging people to vote for bringing about a change in the country.

Lambasting the "all-controlling" government at the Centre, Sharmila, who had observed a 16-year-long hunger strike seeking revocation of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act in Manipur, said, "Democratic leaders are servants of people, not controllers. They need to respect people's opinions before making policy decisions." Describing the provisions of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill as "complicated", she said the Centre should have taken the popular sentiment into consideration before introducing the legislation in the lower house.

"They (Modi government) are trying to control everything based on their beliefs and system. There is a long history of suffering and discrimination... There is a sense of backwardness among people in the area (northeast), which lacks development.

"It is a long way before a bill like that gets accepted by people. You (the government) need to understand the sentiment of millions of people residing in those areas and analyse the ground situation before taking a decision," she told PTI in an exclusive interview.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill seeks to grant nationality to non-Muslim minorities from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan, after six years of residence in India.

The legislation, passed by Lok Sabha on January 8, wasn't tabled in Rajya Sabha during the last Parliament session of the present government. It is set to lapse on June 3, when the term of the lower house ends.
