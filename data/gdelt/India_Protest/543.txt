In Kolkata, protesting workers blocked railway tracks at the Howrah Railway Station on Tuesday morning to demand higher minimum wages and social security benefits. Train services were also partially affected in Sealdah South Railway Station. The situation in Kolkata was reported to be normal with road transport services continuing; the TMC government had earlier announced it would not allow disruption of essential services. CPI(M) activists protesting during the strike were detained in Kolkata.

Blockades of rail lines were also reported from Guwahati in Assam and Jaleswar in Odisha.

In Kerala, trade union activists blocked trains at several railway stations. In the capital Thiruvananthapuram, daily trains such as the Jan Shatabdi Express and Raptisagar Express were unable to commence their services. Due to both privately-owned buses and buses of the state-run KSRTC staying off the roads, people were reported to be stranded at airports and railway stations across Kerala.

In Bhubaneswar, protesters blocked roads and burnt tyres as part of the two-day general strike.
