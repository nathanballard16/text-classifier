Patna: Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday visited the Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur where 108 children have died due to Acute Encephalitis Syndrome (AES) so far. Nitish Kumar, accompanied by Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, visited the state-run Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH), where they met children undergoing treatment and also their parents, a district health official said. The Chief Minister will hold a review meeting with doctors and health officials later in the day to take stock of the situation. As he entered the hospital, Kumar faced protests from the relatives of patients. Protesters raised 'Nitish go back' slogans as they alleged that government failed to take preventive measures. The relatives of the deceased are also fuming as the chief minister has come to take a stock approximately two weeks after the outbreak.
