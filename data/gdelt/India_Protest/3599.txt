New Delhi: In what could cause huge embarrassment to the Congress party, the official website of the party’s Gujarat unit described it as the “oldest and largest political party in India who looted India for 70 years.”

"Become a part of the oldest and largest political party in India who looted India for 70 years,” text on the 'Join Us' section of the website read. "The party evolved into the natural party of thugs after independence and a custodian and champion of anti-nationalism," it added.

The party, however, later rectified the error and changed the text. “Become a part of the oldest and largest political party in India. Originally founded to organize the fragmented Indian resistance to British rule in the country, the party evolved into the natural party of governance after independence and a custodian and champion of the values espoused by the country’s founding fathers,” the text on the website now reads.

The Congress party has not issued any statement in the matter as yet.

The incident holds importance in the backdrop of upcoming Lok Sabha elections that is scheduled to take place this year. In the run-up to general elections, the political parties have been locking horns over several issues, putting each other down, and engaging in the war of words.

While the BJP has time again accused the Congress party of looting the country during its 70-year rule, the grand old party also blames the saffron party of misleading the people of the country by making false promises.
