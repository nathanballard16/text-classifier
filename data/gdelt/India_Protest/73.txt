Biggest woman protest in India demands entry permission to K...

(MENAFN- Kuwait News Agency (KUNA)) NEW DELHI, Jan 1 (KUNA) -- More than three millions of women formed a human chain across the south India state of Kerala on Tuesday to press for equality by allowing women below 50 to enter the ancient Sabarimala shrine in the state.

The historic chain stretched 650 kilometers along the national highway this afternoon, according to local media estimates.

The massive protest, supported by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan's Communist Party of India (Marxist) ruling the state, aims to press the demand for temple entry for women of all ages.

It is strongly opposed by supporters of Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party ruling the Centre, the Indian National Congress - the main opposition party in the state, and other right-wing and religious forces. The turnout for the protest exceeded the projections of organizers with participants coming out from all the 14 districts in the state to demand unbanning the entry of menstruating women into the temple.

India's Supreme Court had ruled earlier unban entry of women in the age group of 10-50, citing the constitutional right to equality.

However, the previous attempts of Kerala government to implement the apex court order failed as the right-wing activists, devotees and temple authorities refused to revoke the centuries old ban. (end) atk.gb
