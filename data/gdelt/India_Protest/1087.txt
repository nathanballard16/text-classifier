Karnataka Political Turmoil Highlights: Congressmen Protest Outside Gurugram Resort

Congress protests outside the 5-star resort where 104 BJP lawmakers are staying

Congressmen have been protesting outside the Gurugram resort where more than 100 Karnataka BJP lawmakers who flew to Delhi over the weekend, are staying. The official reason for the break is not known.

The leaders were flown to Delhi on the weekend, when the BJP had a two-day leadership conclave. Now 104 legislators have virtually taken over the entire resort, occupying 60 of its 100-odd rooms. The rooms cost Rs. 30,000 each, though it is not known whether they paid this or were given a discount. Hotel insiders say since they arrived, the police have placed extra layers of security, which means hardly any other guests are left. BS Yeddyurappa told NDTV yesterday, was a boot camp before the national election due by May.

In a jolt to the seven-month-old Janata Dal Secular-Congress coalition in Karnataka two independent lawmakers H Nagesh and R Shankar withdrew support from the ruling state government.
