Solidarity shown with Kashmir

Activists rallied in solidarity with the people of Kashmir in Sydney on August 9 and 11. The protest was organised by the Pakistan Association of Australia.

The Narendra Modi government in India has recently removed the section of the Indian constitution that gave Kashmir near autonomy, imposed a curfew on the region and sent in the military.

Several Kashmiri people told the rally of the grave fears they held for their relatives in Kashmir, which is under total lock-down with a media, social media and telephone blackout.

Former Greens NSW Senator Lee Rhiannon condemned the Modi government for trying to convert India from secular rule to Hindu fundamentalism. "We need to stand with the people of Kashmir", she said.
