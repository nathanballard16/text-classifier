CPM’s Karat writes to Javadekar, says changes in Forest Act will give ‘untrammeled’ powers to officials

NEW DELHI: CPM politburo member Brinda Karat on Wednesday wrote to Union minister Prakash Javadekar to register her party’s protest against the proposed amendments to the Forest Act on grounds that they went beyond what the British had done by “militarising” forest conservation.Karat also sought withdrawal of the proposed amendments, alleging that they “criminalise every aspect of tribal life” and give “untrammelled powers to the forest bureaucracy to arrest without warrant and use arms to implement the law”.The Left leader also accused the government of playing down “repressive” measures proposed in the amendments to the Indian Forest Act.The Indian Forest Act, 1927 was the instrument through which the British colonialists established government ownership over forests and declared tribal communities to be encroachers, giving legal sanction to the burden of historical injustices against tribal communities, she said.“You have sought to play down the extremely repressive measures proposed in the Act and have entirely ignored the bulldozing of the rights of tribal communities in particular,” Karat said.Highlighting issues with the proposed amendment, Karat said inclusion of the chief of Army staff as a member in the proposed National Forestry Board presumes that the Chief of Indian Army now has the time to discuss how to “protect” forests not borders.
