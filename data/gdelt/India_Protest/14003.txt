Oops! Congress uses Pakistan protests photo to slam Khattar-led Haryana govt for unemployment

Screen grab of Paksitani daily that carried the photo and Youth Congress tweet along with the same photo

Key Highlights Congress tweeted that Khattar government provided 647 jobs in its 4-year tenure This figure came into public domain last year and it pertains only to those youths who registered themselves at employment exchanges

New Delhi: The Youth Congress on Monday tweeted that the BJP-led Haryana government, in its four-year tenure, has provided only 647 jobs in the state while becoming the world's richest party and "emptying" the coffers of the Reserve Bank of India. The youth wing of the grand old party shared an infographic on the same, using a photo where people can be seen protesting against unemployment.

However, what's interesting is the fact that the photo is not from Haryana or India for that matter, but from Pakistan. The same photo was first published by a Pakistan daily while covering protests in Balochistan over unemployment way back in 2010.

Further, the fact that Khattar government only provided 647 jobs in its 4-year tenure is also a half-truth. The Haryana government in November last year had revealed the same in response to an RTI seeking information regarding employment provided to youths registered under the employment exchanges functioning in 15 districts of the state.

According to a report, Rohtak-based RTI activist Subhash, who is the state convener of the Haryana Soochna Adhikar Manch, had sought information about jobless youth registered at employment exchanges in the state from October 1, 2014, to May 20, 2018.

In response, the Haryana government had revealed that only 647 of the 15.21 lakh youth registered at the employment exchanges had secured jobs in the last four years.

While the fact is correct, it does not take into account the jobs provided under the Haryana Staff Selection Commission and other recruitment drives.
