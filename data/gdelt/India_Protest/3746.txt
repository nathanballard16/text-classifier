Infosys arm warns public on fraudsters looting in disguise for spot news

Bengaluru, Feb 23 : Software major's social arm Infosys Foundation on Friday cautioned the public of falling prey to fraudsters extracting money by faking stories linked to it.

"We request the public to alert city police to identify such conmen as helping it to spot them will be a service," said the Foundation in a statement here.

With some individuals and groups engaged in collecting money from unsuspecting members of public, traders and other businesses are claiming to represent the Foundation.

The Foundation is also in receipt of copies of appeals for funds typed on a fake letterhead of its social arm, bearing forged signatures of its Chairperson Sudha Murty.

The Foundation uses its own funds for all its projects and programmes.
