Kejriwal may skip Thackeray's swearing-in ceremony

New Delhi, Nov 27 : Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal may skip the swearing-in ceremony of Shiv Sena President Uddhav Thackeray as Maharashtra Chief Minister due to prior engagements, sources said on Wednesday.

The national convenor of the Aam Aadmi Party, Kejriwal was among the invitees of Thackeray's swearing in to be held at Shivaji Park in Mumbai on Thursday.

According to known sources, Kejriwal has numerous engagement for Thursday.

"The Chief Minister is yet to confirm his visit to Mumbai," a source said.

According to another, the invitation was received at such a short notice that the Chief Minister is unable to reschedule the engagements.

Thackeray was among the leaders who supported Kejriwal during his sit-in protest at the Raj Niwas in June 2018 against Delhi's Lt. Governor, despite being part of the BJP-led NDA.
