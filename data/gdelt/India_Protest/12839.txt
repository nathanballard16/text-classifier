Raj speaks out against summons in IL&FS case

MNS chief Raj Thackeray (left) alleged that the Centre was being vindictive against him for his protests against EVMs.

Nothing could have been as bad as a summons from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for the 'perfectionist' Raj Thackeray. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) president had planned an all partymarch on August 22 demanding that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) be scrapped and replaced by ballot papers in the upcoming Assembly election.

The ED has asked him to appear on August 22 to explain his role in selling off the Kohinoor Mill land once owned by him to now-bankrupt Infrastructure Leasing & Financial Services (Il&FS) which is under probe for financial fraud.

A politically smart Thackeray called the summons an act of political vendetta by the Centre.

He claimed that the ED wants to interrogate him only because he raised voice against the "doubtful" EVMs. Thackeray has claimed that there is mismatch in the number of votes polled and counted in at least 361 Lok Sabha constituencies. However, he could not provide evidence to substantiate this.

The ED summon, however, has given an opportunity to Thackeray to play the victim card. He has asked MNS workers to hold demonstrations all over Mumbai on August 22 protesting the ED action. The Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) have backed Thackeray in his charge against the Centre.

It will be interesting to watch whether they join the demonstration.
