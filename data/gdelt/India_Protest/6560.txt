The dean of state-run, and some other medical teachers were pulled up for ‘moral policing’ for dictating theof undergraduate students during a recent college festival. The warden of the girls’ hostel, Dr Shilpa Patil, has also been replaced after a committee felt that she had instructed girls to wear “appropriate dress” at the festival.Around 100 students of state-run Grant Medical College (GMC), Byculla, had last month protested against alleged moral policing by faculty members inside the college premises. In a letter to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), the students had alleged mental harassment as a result of the rules introduced by the new dean.They said the dean had allegedly instructed male and female students not to talk to each other after college hours. A member of thesaid authorities had also demanded that girls and boys sit separately during the annual college festival ‘Astitva’, which was held on March 22-23.The committee headed by DMER joint director Dr Prakash Wakode found merit in the allegations. The committee also pointed out that he Dr Chandanwale became the dean of JJ Hospital just three months ago and could not dictate Mumbai students like Pune. Dr TP Lahane, director of DMER said, “Mumbai is different from Pune and the dean tried to create a Pune-like environment. One cannot implement what was happening 40 years ago. Also, the communication between the students and the dean was not adequate.”
