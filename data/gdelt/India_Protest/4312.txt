Guest teachers’ stir continues

Guest teachers working at Delhi government schools continued their protest on Monday outside Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia’s residence, demanding regularisation of service.

“We are grateful to Mr. Sisodia for supporting the demands of the guest teachers. However, until our demands for a policy gets passed and implemented, new posts should be created keeping in mind the student-teacher ratio, as mentioned under the Right to Education Act,” said Shoaib Rana of the All India Guest Teachers’ Assocation.

Mr. Sisodia, who is also the Education Minister had on Sunday tweeted, “...Delhi government shall pass the policy as per their [guest teachers’] demand and do all the needful to help them in the interest of education.”
