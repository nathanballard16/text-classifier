TSRTC Strike: Police Arrests BJP President K Laxman, JAC Convenor

Hyderabad: Telangana police arrested state BJP president K Laxman and TSRTC joint action committee convenor Ashwathama Reddy on Saturday as TRSTC strike continued for the eighth day today. Tension prevailed at Bus Bhavan here on Saturday as BJP leaders staged protest against the government's decision to sack 50,000 employees in the face of the ongoing strike by the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) unions.

Speaking to media persons, Laxman said that the demands of the TSRTC employees were just and the government should take steps to resolve the issues and also said that they would intensify their protests if the government fails to address their demands.

Different employees and workers unions of TSRTC had begun an indefinite strike from October 5 across Telangana on a call given by the JAC of TSRTC, demanding merger of the RTC with the government, recruitment to various posts, among others.

With nearly 48,000 employees boycotting duty and state-run buses staying off roads, the RTC had earlier said alternative arrangements were made to run buses from its own fleet and hire buses. Around 11,000 vehicles, including buses, were being operated.

Taking a tough stand on the strike, Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had made it clear that under no circumstances the RTC would be merged into the government.

Meanwhile, the Telangana High Court had, on Thursday, posted to October 15 the hearing of a petition that sought to declare the strike as illegal.
