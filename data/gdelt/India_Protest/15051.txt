Police deny nod to DMK to stage protest

Coimbatore: The city police have denied permission to the DMK to stage a protest condemning the corporation for doubling the property tax and handing over 24x7 water supply to a France-based firm.

DMK and its allies had called for a bandh in the district on September 21 to condemn both the state government and city corporation for handing over 24x7 water supply project to a France based company instead of giving it to the TWAD board. The party cadres met various trade unions, associations and general public in person seeking their support.

Meanwhile AIADMK filed a petition before the Madras high court, seeking a ban on the bandh. The court also banned the strike on Wednesday. Meanwhile the DMK party cadres planned to stage a protest against the project on Friday and sought permission from the city police officials

However the city police denied permission to DMK for staging protest. Already Madras high court ordered not to conduct the bandh. However, many organisations have been spreading message on social websites to support the bandh. If the police grant permission to conduct protest, there would be a chance of law&order issues and so the permission has been denied for the protest, L Balaji Saravanan, deputy commissioner of police (law&order), replied to DMK MLA N Karthik.

Following the reply, the DMK functionaries are planning to conduct a meeting to decide on further course of actions.
