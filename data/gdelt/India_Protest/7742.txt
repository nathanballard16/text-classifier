AAMSU set two hours protest in Sarupathar over wrongly inclusion of names in Draft NRC list

Sarupathar: The regional unit of AAMSU of Sarupathar in Golaghat district set two hours protest in front of the Subdivisional Office in Sarupathar against wrong inclusion of the names of the people in draft National Register of Citizens (NRC) list.

“During the hearings for the claims and objections, several names were reported to wrongly include in the draft NRC list. During the ongoing sessions of hearing for claims and objections several cases had come to light where people’s names were wrongfully included,” said an AAMSU leader of Sarupathar regional unit.

He also added, the provision of verification in the Citizenship is being endorsed by the Supreme Court of India and is part of the standard operating procedure. If they appeal, this will definitely help in illegal foreigner-free, correct NRC,” said an AAMSU leader further.

The Supreme Court on May 7 reiterated that it will not extend the July 31 deadline fixed by it for finalization of the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam and gave “free hand” to the State Coordinator of NRC, Prateek Hajela to deal with complaints.

The Final Draft NRC list was published on July 30, 2018 in which 2.89 crore names out of the 3.29 crore people were included while 40,70,707 people failed to make it to the list. Of those left out 37,59,630 names had been rejected and the remaining 2,48,077 were put on hold.
