City bizman robbed on Delhi-Ludh bus

Ludhiana: A Ludhiana-based businessman of Agar Nagar has been allegedly looted of gold, cash, and smartphone by an unidentified miscreant in a bus, on his way to Ludiana from Delhi in the early hours of Saturday. The man has alleged that the miscreant either made him smell something intoxicating or hypnotised him for the loot.

Nitin Jain (40), a water pump wall manufacturer from Agar Nagar said he often visited Delhi in connection with his business. On Friday morning, he reached the capital, and was supposed to return by the evening train. However, as he was waitlisted, he boarded a bus from there instead, and in the bus, he said he met that miscreant who first asked him to pay for his ticket to Ludhiana too, because he did not have enough loose cash.

“Thereafter, the man started asking me about my name, home town, business, etc. He also asked me how I would reach home after arriving in Ludhiana, and I told him my car was parked at the railway station. Meanwhile, I did not realise when I fell unconscious, but when I gained consciousness, I was in my car. However, my gold kada, two gold rings, one smartphone, and Rs15,000 in cash were missing” added Jain.

He further said: “I also got the CCTV of the railway station parking lot checked, in which I am walking alone towards my car. But I could not remember anything. Initially, I was confused about where I should give a complaint, but now I am giving it to the commissioner of police on Monday.”
