Chennai: The opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) staged statewide demonstrations against the ruling AIADMK government for not taking adequate steps to solve the water crisis in Tamil Nadu.

Party MPs, MLAs, district secretaries and senior party functionaries were among those who participated at various district headquarters. Large number with empty pots also joined the DMK's demonstrations.

In Chennai, DMK MPs Dayanidhi Maran and Kalanidhi Veerasamy were among the prominent faces who participated in the protest. Dayanidhi Maran said the state government "must quit" if it failed to solve the water scarcity.

In Vellore, local strongman and DMK treasurer, Durai Murugan led the demonstration. He later told press persons that Vellore district itself faced water deficiency and there was no sufficient water for its people. Hence, water should not be transported from Jolarpettai to Chennai . "If the Government still persisted with that decision, they would have to face a very big protest; people are praying to the government for water and the government (ministers) is praying to God," Durai Murugan said, adding, "we will raise the water problem in the Assembly."

Meanwhile, DMK president M.K. Stalin will lead the party's demonstration over the water crisis issue, organised by the Chennai west DMK unit, on June 24 near the Government guest house at Chepauk. Dayanidhi Maran and J. Anbazhagan, MLA and others will be participating in that protest also.
