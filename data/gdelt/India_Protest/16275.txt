A 20-point manifesto, just for Worlikars

NCP’s Mane says focus is on key issues

Lawyer Suresh Mane, the Nationalist Congress Party’s (NCP) candidate from Worli on Tuesday, released a manifesto tailored to the constituency. A prominent Dalit voice, Mr. Mane is contesting against Shiv Sena’s Aaditya Thackeray.

Taking a dig at Mr. Thackeray, who is a resident of Bandra, Mr. Mane asked, “Why leave Bandra and come to Worli? Did the Mithi river change course and bring him here?” Mr. Mane said he has a 20-point agenda for Worli residents. “I am a Worlikar and I understand the constituency and its issues like no one else,” he said at a press conference on Tuesday.

At one time the national general secretary of the Bahujan Samaj Party, Mr. Mane later went on to form his own party, the Bahujan Republican Socialist Party. He was also the head of the law department of the Mumbai University.

Mr. Mane said his focus is on issues that are important to the constituency, such as the BDD Chawl redevelopment, SRA, Worli Koliwada, and Coastal Road project.

Dalit leader and Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mevani, who has come down to Mumbai to campaign for Mr. Mane, was also at the press conference. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is synonymous with grand failure when it comes to employment generation,” Mr. Mevani said.

Citing examples of the economic slowdown, he said, “The Parle company laid off so many employees, the automobile sector has so many jobless people.”

He asked why Mr. Thackeray was not among the 29 people who were arrested for protesting against the tree felling in Aarey Milk Colony. “They are all only commenting on social media,” he said.
