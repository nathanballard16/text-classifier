Kashmiri students stage protest, want CPRF moved out of college

SRINAGAR: Students of Kashmir Government Polytechnic (KGP) College in Srinagar’s Gogji Bagh area staged a protest on Monday demanding the immediate shifting of CRPF personnel who have been camping at the facility, ever since authorities called upon additional forces to control the security situation in Kashmir Valley in wake of the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A on August 5.This is the first such demonstration since the annulment of the Articles which was followed by the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into the Union Territories of J&K and Ladakh. No violence, however, took place during the protest and the students later dispersed peacefully, officials said.KGP students said the classrooms and other areas of the institute have been occupied by CRPF personnel, which forced the college authorities to defer the semester examinations till February 2020. “We couldn’t attend our classes due to the presence of security forces inside the college. As a result, our syllabus hasn’t been completed. Authorities too had to postpone our exams till next February, even as our counterparts in Jammu have taken theirs,” said a student.While all colleges in the Valley reopened after the annulment, KGP remained shut since the security personnel continued to stay at the institute, alleged the protestors, demanding the immediate shifting of the CRPF personnel from the college.Kashmir divisional commissioner Baseer Ahmad Khan assured that the forces will be shifted from the college soon.At least six educational institutions had been occupied by additional forces deployed to control the law and order situation in J&K after the state’s special status was revoked. In the past two months, authorities have moved out nearly 39 companies from the Valley, official sources said.
