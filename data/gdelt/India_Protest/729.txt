DUTA protests at V-C’s office

Demands include implementation of UGC regulations, regularisation of temporary staff

As part of a two-day shut-down, the Delhi University Teachers’ Union (DUTA) on Wednesday protested outside the Vice-Chancellor’s office on North Campus.

Raising concerns over various issues, including delay in promotions, implementation of regulations provided by the UGC and others, DUTA president Rajib Ray said, “The silence on the issue of reservation roster to ensure treating the university/college as a unit clearly reveals the government’s intentions. The government must respond to the demand on regularisation and absorption of temporary and ad hoc teachers.”

Academic Council meet

Richa Raj, a professor at Jesus and Mary College, said, “At the last academic council meeting, the V-C refused to table the report of the recommendation committee constituted to review the UGC gazette notification related to our service condition. Not tabling the report undermines the authority of a statutory body and obliterates the rights of the teaching community.”
