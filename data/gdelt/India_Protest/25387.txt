Video: Uttar Pradesh cop tells protesters to 'go to Pakistan'

The video of an Uttar Pradesh (UP) cop telling Muslim protesters to "go to Pakistan" has gone viral on the internet, triggering angry responses from netizens.

Thousands of Indians have taken to the streets against the contentious citizenship law passed by the Indian government last week. According to the law, religious minorities other than Muslims fleeing from neighbouring Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan will be granted Indian citizenship.

The law, which is being seen as anti-Muslim by millions in India, has triggered protests around the country which have led to 27 people being killed and thousands arrested.

In a video that went viral on the internet recently, a UP cop can be seen telling Muslim protesters to "go to Pakistan if you don't want to stay in India".

The video caused an outcry on social media as people took offence to the way the cop behaved with protesters

Mobile internet was cut on Friday in parts of India's most populous state and thousands of riot police were deployed as fresh protests erupted in Delhi and Mumbai against the law.

Coupled with a mooted citizens register, it has stoked fears, including in Washington and the UN rights office, about the marginalisation of Muslims who make up 14 percent of India's 1.3 billion people.

Armed policemen patrolled Muslim-dominated areas of the capital as hundreds of demonstrators gathered outside the grand mosque in Delhi's old quarter after Friday prayers.
