The battle between West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has just got shriller in the build up to the general elections due in April/May.

Earlier, the West Bengal government had denied permission for the BJP president Amit Shah's chopper to land in Malda district. He eventually held a rally there.
