William Dalrymple draws lessons from history

“It’s a bit of a homecoming for the book since a large part of the action unfolds in this city” — The author

Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet hosted the Calcutta launch of the The Anarchy: The East India Company, Corporate Violence, and the Pillage of an Empire by William Dalrymple recently at Abanindranath Tagore Gallery, Indian Council for Cultural Relations. The book launch was followed by a presentation on the book by Dalrymple and an interactive session with stand-up comedian and author Anuvab Pal.

“It was an honour to present a book like The Anarchy: The East India Company, Corporate Violence, and the Pillage of an Empire in Calcutta. It’s a bit of a homecoming for the book since a large part of the action unfolds in this city. The author has a legion of fans in Calcutta and it was pretty special to see so many avid readers at the event,” said Malavika Banerjee, director, Tata Steel Kolkata Literary Meet.
