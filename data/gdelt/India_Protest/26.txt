Two women came close to reaching the temple in October, helped by 100 police protecting them from stone-throwing opponents, according to the BBC.

The police officers protected the women as they walked the last 5km stretch. But they were forced to stop metres from the temple after clashing with other protestors.

The decision to form the 620km wall was made in early December by the state’s left-wing CPI(M)-led government.

Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan declared the women’s wall was required to “protect the renaissance tradition of the state,” on Monday.

The wall is backed by many Hindu organisations that support the entry of women of all ages into the temple, according to the Indian Express.

However, historically Hinduism sees menstruating women as unclean and they are told not to enter temples during this time.

Most temples allow women who are not menstruating to enter temples.

Those supporting the ban on women entering the Sabarimala shrine say it goes against the temple's idealogy.

The temple’s deity Lord Ayyappa is regarded as a bachelor who has taken an oat of celibacy.

Sabarimala is one of the largest Hindu pilgrimage sites in India.

The women's wall was also backed by protests in New Delhi.
