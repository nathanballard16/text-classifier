Ruling out parleys with Pakistan till it stopped aiding and abetting terrorism, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today said talks, if any, would be held with the neighbouring country only on Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).

“Jammu and Kashmir is non-negotiable. If talks are ever held with Pakistan, these will be on PoK,” he announced at a rally before flagging off BJP’s “Jan Ashirwaad Yatra” at Kalka, 30 kms from here.

Referring to the abrogation of Article 370 which accorded special status to Jammu and Kashmir, he observed, “Our neighbour (Pakistan) is knocking at the doors of the international community, claiming that India has made a mistake.”

The Defence Minister categorically stated that the abrogation of Article 370 was “non-negotiable” as bifurcation of the state had been done purely for development. Claiming that Pakistan had been isolated internationally on the Jammu and Kashmir issue, he said even the world’s most powerful country had snubbed Pakistan, advising it to initiate talks with India on all outstanding issues.
