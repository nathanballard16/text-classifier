‘No one can take away your rights’: PM Modi assures Assam as it erupts in protest against CAB

As Assam boils over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB), Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday assured the people of Assam that they need not worry about the new law.

“I want to assure my brothers and sisters of Assam that they have nothing to worry after the passing of #CAB. I want to assure them- no one can take away your rights, unique identity and beautiful culture. It will continue to flourish and grow,” PM Modi tweeted.

“The Central Government and I are totally committed to constitutionally safeguard the political, linguistic, cultural and land rights of the Assamese people as per the spirit of Clause 6,” PM Modi added.

Guwahati, the epicentre of anti-CAB protests, was placed under indefinite curfew yesterday while the Army was called in at four places and Assam Rifles personnel were deployed in Tripura.

Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passed the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) 2019. The bill was earlier passed in Lok Sabha.

The bill was passed in Rajya Sabha with 125 votes in favor of it, whereas the bill received 105 votes in protest.

Prime Minister Modi thanked MPs who voted for the bill. He said this Bill will alleviate the suffering of many who faced persecution for years.

“A landmark day for India and our nation’s ethos of compassion and brotherhood! Glad that the #CAB2019 has been passed in the #RajyaSabha. Gratitude to all the MPs who voted in favour of the Bill. This Bill will alleviate the suffering of many who faced persecution for years,” PM Modi had said.
