Narendra Modi

On Sunday, over 50 kids held a protest at HN Lake Road in Bellandur requesting Prime Ministerto provide them basic amenities. The protest called ‘Howdy HN Halli’ and ‘Howdy Bellandur’ saw children holding placards stating the long hours they tool to reach schools due to the bad roads. Children also highlighted other issues such as skin problems, wheezing and dust allergy due to the muddy roads leading to air and dust pollution.Shraavani Karthik Vembar, a nine-year-old girl suffers from severe wheezing issues. “I fall sick quite often in school. And even though the school is close by, I take 30 to 45 minutes to reach there. I wear a mask when I go to school but it does not help. I would like to request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to lay proper roads in the area and save us,” she says.The residents had protested three years ago and had achieved fixing the roads from the civic authorities, but the roads have once again become unusable after civic agencies again dug up the roads, points Harikrishna K, one of the parents at the protest. “The road was dug by the BWSSB, GAIL for the pipeline work. Later it was dug up to lay pipes. We have been raising this issue on social media and on the Sahaaya app but there is no response,” says Harikrishna. Rajesh Mohan who had spearheaded the movement says the BBMP closes the complaint on the app awithout fixing it or keeps it open without attending to it.“It is difficult for us to step into the bus as well. Our shoes and uniforms get dirty when we reach school and our teachers are not happy with our shabby look,” says 12-year-old Hasmitha K. Pahima Hemachandra, another kid, who complains she often misses the first class at school due to traffic and bad roads.
