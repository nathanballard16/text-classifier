New Delhi/Srinagar, April 10

Facing criticism for closing down the National Highway connecting Jammu with Srinagar, the Union Home Ministry today cited statistics to claim the ban was for only 15 per cent of total weekly hours.

Underlining that the ban became necessary in the backdrop of the Pulwama terror attack, it said the step has been taken for ensuring safe movement of forces till May 31.

The statement comes at a time when the ministry has to file its reply to the Jammu and Kashmir High Court, which has directed it to respond by April 19 to a bunch of petitions challenging the decision.

The ministry said the total duration of prohibition is for 24 hours out of 168 hours in a week, which amounts to only 15 per cent of the time.

“The state government... has already clarified that of seven days in a week, only reasonable restrictions have been imposed, that too for 12 hours, two days in a week. This has been done to ensure safe movement of forces and at the same time minimising the inconvenience to public.”

Meanwhile, political parties held protests against the highway ban on April 7 as well as today.

Former Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah has termed this order a reflection of a BJP-led mindset of turning Kashmir into a colony like the British-era. The Army has already stated that it is not going to follow the order of the state government as it will continue to run its convoys as per the need, officials said. — TNS/PTI
