Delhi: Two men loot people using lighter shaped like a pistol

A pistol-shaped lighter and pollution masks were among the items two Ghaziabad residents used to rob several people in Gurgaon and Delhi over the last two months, said police. The men, who lured people into their car under the pretext of offering them a lift, were arrested near NH-48 Thursday. AdvertisingThe accused have been identified as Sumit (26) and Sandeep Sharma (24), both residents of Ghaziabad. The accused would tape their mouths and tie up their hands to reduce any resistance,” said Subhash Boken, PRO of Gurgaon police. While Sharma worked as a delivery boy with an online retail website, Sonu was recently released from prison.
