Kejriwal appeals to DCW chief to end hunger strike

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday appealed to DCW chief Swati Maliwal to end her hunger strike.

The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief has been sitting on a fast unto death at Samta Sthal, near Rajghat, for 11 days now. Her demands include capital punishment for rapists and setting up of fast track courts in Delhi, among others.

"We are concerned about her (Swati Maliwal's) health. Her life and health are valuable to the country," Kejriwal told reporters here.
