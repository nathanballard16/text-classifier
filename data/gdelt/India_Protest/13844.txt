Bengalis protest against NRC in Delhi

By A Correspondent / NEW DELHI

The All Assam Bengali Youth Students Federation (United), a body of 13 organisations, on Thursday staged a demonstration here and lashed out against the BJP government for discrimination and unconstitutional procedure taken to detect foreigners through the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Talking to media, Assam Pradesh Congress Committee president and Rajya Sabha MP Ripun Bora, who joined the demonstration at Jantar Mantar, said the government has no right to harass Indian citizens.

“We have verified those 19 lakh names dropped from the NRC and discovered that 90 per cent are Indian citizens. There are cases where half of the members of the same family have been excluded while the others have been included,” he said.

“The BJP government has deliberately done this and it is very unfortunate. The BJP has said that those who have found their names dropped from the NRC should not be terrorised… But how can they feel safe when they are forced to run from pillar to post to get justice,” Bora said.

“The BJP government has hatched a conspiracy to create this chaos. The BJP is talking in different voices – while a section has opposed the NRC exercise, another group has supported it,” he said.
