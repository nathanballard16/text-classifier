I miss you, Papa, tweets Tej Pratap after denied of speaking at Pataliputra rally

After denied of speaking at a rally in Pataliputra, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) supremo Lalu Prasad Yadav’s elder son Tej Pratap on Friday wrote an emotional message for his father.

“I was not allowed to speak due to my father’s absence. I miss you, papa,” said Tej Pratap in his tweet. Also he posted a cut out of his picture with his father with his tweet.

Lalu Prasad Yadav is currently serving a jail term in the multi-crore fodder scam case.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday held the mahagathbandhan rally in Pataliputra. He was joined in the rally by party candidate Shatrughan Sinha and alliance partner RJDs Tejashwi Yadav among others.

When asked about Tej Pratap being upset, Tejaswi denied of any knowledge about it and said, “He has delivered many speeches with me at rallies. However, sometimes, there is a time crunch”.

However, over the weekend, the brothers were seen together campaigning for the party.

Calling his Tejashwi ‘Arjun’, Tej said that the RJD will defeat the opposition winning over all the seats.
