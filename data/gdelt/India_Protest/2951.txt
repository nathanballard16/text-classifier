BJP intolerant towards political opponents, democracy in danger : Chandrababu Naidu

New Delhi (India), Feb 12 (ANI): Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday said that denying permission to former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav from flying to attend an event in Prayagraj displays "high-handiness" of BJP-led government in the state and "intolerance" of the saffron party towards its political opponents.

“I strongly condemn the high-handed behaviour of Lucknow authorities against Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav. This is another instance of BJP's intolerance towards its political opponents. Real democracy is in danger,” said Naidu who is currently in the national capital.

The Chief Minister also spoke to Akhilesh, condemning the incident.

Earlier in the day, the Rajya Sabha was adjourned after SP members protested against preventing Akhilesh from boarding the aircraft at Lucknow airport.

Following the ruckus, the Upper House was adjourned for half a day by Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu, after less than an hour of regular functioning.

Yadav was stopped from boarding an aircraft at Lucknow airport while he was on his way to attend the swearing-in ceremony of a student leader in Allahabad. (ANI)
