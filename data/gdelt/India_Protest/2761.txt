Smriti Irani refuses to call Rahul Gandhi a gentleman

Bengaluru: Refusing to address AICC president Rahul Gandhi as a 'gentleman', Union Textile Minister Smriti Irani charged that Mr Gandhi is spewing venom against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for stopping loot in the country for the last 55 months.

Delivering a key note address at an event, "Intellectual Merit", organised by the BJP here on Sunday, she said that the corrupt coalition of parties is demeaning Mr Modi since he is standing between them and the country's treasury.

Mr Modi's government identified over eight crore fictitious names receiving government subsidy for the last 10 years. This was going on with the full knowledge of the then government. When Mr Modi stopped it, there were heartburns, she claimed.
