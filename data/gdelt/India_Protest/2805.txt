UP Minister labels Congress' Lucknow road show as 'Chor show'

Uttar Pradesh Minister Sidharth Nath Singh on Monday said the people of Lucknow will come to see the faces of those who looted the nation in today's "chor show".

"They are calling this roadshow but the BJP sees this as 'Chor machaye shor'. Gandhi-Vadra family is out on bail. They can't hold roadshow but a 'Chor show'. People of Uttar Pradesh, especially Lucknow, will come to see corrupt faces of those who looted Rs 12 Lakh crores of this nation," Singh told ANI.

Congress' general secretary for Eastern Uttar Pradesh Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and General Secretary for Uttar Pradesh West Jyotiraditya Scindia will conduct a road show in Lucknow. Congress President Rahul Gandhi will also accompany Priyanka and Scindia.

A day ahead of her first maiden visit as Congress' eastern UP general secratary, Priyanka had said: "I am coming to Lucknow tomorrow and I wish that together we will begin a new and you be a part of it. Youth, women and marginalised, everyone's voices will be heard. Let's establish a new future and "

Priyanka and Scindia would stay till February 14, while Rahul is expected to return on the same day.

Since the announcement of SP-BSP alliance for the coming Lok Sabha polls in the state where two parties will contest on 38 seats each, the Congress leadership has been leaving nothing unturned to retain the party's lost ground in the state, where they won only two seats-Rae Bareli and Amethi-in the last Lok Sabha polls.
