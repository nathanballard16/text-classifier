VADODARA: Railway unions are intensifying their protests against privatization, outsourcing, corporatization of production units and sale of railway colonies in all divisions of Indian Railways The Western Railway Mazdoor Sangh (WRMS), the zonal union of the National Federation of Indian Railwaymen (NFIR) on Friday organised rally and dharna protests at the divisional railway manager’s office at Pratapnagar in which nearly 300 railway employees participated.Lakhs of railwaymen who are living in railway colonies will be left without any houses, WRMS’ general secretary and NFIR’s vice-president J G Mahurkar said.“We are also opposing the handing over of mail and express passenger trains to private parties who will exploit the traveling public and earn huge profits without rendering good service for the first time in the history of railways. The goal of the contractors or agencies who will run the trains would be to maximize the profit without maintaining the expected quality,” he said.WRMS and NFIR are pressing for withdrawal of national pension system from railways, stop outsourcing of activities, stop handing over of railway assets, railway colonies to private parties and stop handing over trains to contractors to save passengers from exploitation.“The highest level of safety standards which has been maintained by Indian Railways in the last five decades will be compromised by the contractors,” he said.
