Star Bharat responds to criticism over actor Sushant Singh's exit from Savdhaan India

Actor Sushant Singh, who participated in the Monday protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, came under the media spotlight when he announced that he is no longer part of nonfiction TV series ‘Savdhaan India’ that airs on the channel Star Bharat.

The actor had made a comment on the news channel NDTV that ‘no person should be discriminated on the basis of religion, caste, creed, etc.’ referring to the bill. That was swiftly followed by an abrupt announcement on his Twitter handle Sushant_says ‘And, my stint with Savdhaan India has ended,’. With the clip circulating on social media and the actors abrupt announcement there is widespread speculation that the actor was axed from his role following his criticism of the bill.

So proud to have known you and worked with you @sushant_says .. more power to you https://t.co/uHyZkdBE3S — Manasi Parekh (@manasi_parekh) December 18, 2019

Star Bharat released a statement in which they clarified, “Star Bharat is dismayed by some reactions regarding a change at Savdhaan India. Savdhaan India has frequently experimented with formats and has used multiple presenters in its 7 year journey. The existing presenter was brought back in October, 2019, with the contract ending on January 15, 2020. The next format of Savdhaan India did not require a presenter, and hence a new contract was not signed. The channel has no political views, nor does it seek to influence the political views of its contracted talent.”
