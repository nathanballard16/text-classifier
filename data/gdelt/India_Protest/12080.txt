Pakistan Expels Indian Ambassador, Suspends Trade Over Kashmir

Pakistan and India are never on the best of terms, but that seems to be getting dramatically worse on Wednesday, as Pakistan has greatly downgraded diplomatic ties with India and suspended all bilateral trade in protest over the Indian crackdown in Kashmir.



Beyond cutting billions of dollars in annual trade, Pakistan also expelled the Indian Ambassador as part of the protest. It’s not clear how long that’s going to last, but Pakistan intends to take the matter to the UN Security Council as well.



What is happening in Kashmir is a huge deal internationally, but nowhere more than in Pakistan, where there is strong support for Kashmir independence movements, and a lot of resentment over Indian crackdowns.



Pakistan has been seeking international support for trying to guarantee autonomy of Kashmir, a region that for generations has been guaranteed legal autonomy under Indian law, but which tends to be the target of crackdowns by the government, as a Muslim-majority state in Hindu-dominated India.
