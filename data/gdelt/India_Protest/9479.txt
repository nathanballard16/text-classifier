WB Guv KN Tripathi welcomes resolution of crisis caused by state-wide strike by doctors

Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], June 17 (ANI): West Bengal Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi on Monday welcomed the "resolution of crisis caused by the state-wide strike" which had been ongoing since June 10.

"Governor Keshari Nath Tripathi welcomes the resolution of crisis caused by the state-wide strike of doctors consequent upon recent incidents of violence on the doctors at NRS Medical College and Hospital. The Governor is happy that amicable settlement arrived at the meeting held today between the Chief Minister and doctors," the press release by Tripathi's press secretary read.

Earlier, protesting doctors on Monday called off their strike after they had a meeting with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee at Nabanna earlier in the day.

Tripathi appreciated the steps taken by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee to solve the "impasse" and added that both the government and the doctors will continue doing their job.

"The Governor appreciates the initiative taken by the Chief Minister and also the junior doctors to resolve the impasse. He hopes that the doctors will take up the work of care and treatment of patients as per the high ideals of their noble profession and also that the state government will take all the steps committed to in the meeting expeditiously," the press release read.

The Chief Minister has accepted the proposal of doctors to set up a Grievance Redressal Cell in the government hospitals and also directed Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma to deploy a nodal police officer in every hospital.

Banerjee on Saturday had extended an olive branch to the agitating doctors by promising not to invoke the stringent Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) and appealed to them to resume work immediately. (ANI)
