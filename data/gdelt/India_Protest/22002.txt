Protest in Patna over the Death of Rape/Burn Victim

Patna: It was yet another riot-filled day in Patna on Tuesday as protestors marched through Patna roads to express their anger over Modi-Shah sponsored Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register for Citizenship (NRC) while in another part of the state capital, hundreds of people were protesting against the tragic death of a teenager who was raped and then set on fire a few days ago in Muzaffarpur.

"It is the lackadaisical attitude of the law enforcement officials that has given rise to such heinous crime in the state. Until these rapists are dealt with swift and tough justice, such crime will continue to take place," protestors said.

Outside the Apollo Burn Hospital where the rape and burn victim died, armed policemen cordoned the entrance to stop protestors from storming the building. That did not stop the mob from blocking the busy road for over three hours causing the traffic to snarl up for several kilometers.

Protestors also blocked the railway track disrupting the movement of all trains for hours. Bhagalpur Intercity Express remained stranded at Patna City station for nearly two hours before it was allowed to move amid heavy security presence.

Situation was finally brought under control when senior police officials arrived at the scene and assured the protestors of swift justice for the victim in the case.
