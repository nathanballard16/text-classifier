Many private hospitals in Madurai remain closed

IMA members wear black badges while at work.

Doctors owing allegiance to Indian Medical Association (IMA) in Madurai were wearing black badges while at work on Monday in support of the nationwide protest against attack on doctors in a Kolkata hospital. Medical practitioners having private practice did not open their establishments.

President-elect, IMA Madurai, V. N. Alagavenkatesan said over 1,500 practising doctors in the city did not attend to any outpatients and treated only emergency cases. Doctors at Meenakshi Mission Hospital, Vadamalayan Hospital, Aravind Eye Care Systems and Lakshmana Hospital did not perform any elective surgeries.

Outpatient wards and operation theatres at Government Rajaji Hospital continued to function. However, the hospital seemed to have lesser patients footfall than usual.

Members of the IMA and Tamil Nadu Government Doctors’ Association (TNGDA) organised meetings with medical students and faculty members stressing the need for better securityfor doctors.

Dr. Alagavenkatesan said, “The West Bengal Chief Minister must hold talks with IMA office-bearers in Kolkata. The Tamil Nadu government has enacted the Hospital Protection Act to safeguard doctors. Other States should follow suit,” he said.

M. Ramesh, Madurai district secretary, TNGDA, and R. Ravindran, treasurer of the Association, urged students to actively take part in the protest. “A Central legislation must be enacted to protect hospitals and doctors,” Dr. Ramesh said.
