As the general elections are drawing nearer, political parties have intensified their election campaigns across India. From closed-door meetings to the massive public rallies, several events are being organised to strike a chord with voters. Yesterday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar addressed the Sankalp rally at the historical Gandhi Maidan in Patna. As always, PM Modi tore into the opposition over several issues including corruption and patriotism. He slammed Congress for allegedly demanding the proof of air strike in Pakistan. "I want to know from Congress and its allies why they are demoralizing security forces by asking for proof of the air strikes against terror camps. Why are they issuing such statements that benefit our enemies?" Modi asked. He further added that when the entire nation is rejoicing over the Indian Air Force's successful air strikes on terror camps in Pakistan, "a few of our own people have raised suspicion on such a strikes". Bihar CM Nitish Kumar also lauded the armed forces and PM Modi for taking punitive action against Pakistan. There will not be any compromise on terror, Nitish said. He assured PM Modi of winning all 40 Lok Sabha seats in Bihar. "People have turned up at the rally in very large numbers. The Lok Sabha polls are impending...I want to assure you (Modi) that we will win 40 out of 40 seats in Bihar. This is our resolve." (BCCL)
