Speaking to ANI, a protester Nirvaan said, "The CAA is actually a vote bank politics by the ruling party as many Hindus from Bangladesh and Pakistan will be included".

The students also raised their concerns over the police action in Jamia university and asserted that the students should be allowed to protest peacefully.
