Hyderabad: TISS students protest continue over hostel fee

The protest has been going on for five days since Monday with no satisfactory response from the administration. The students claim that this year, the service provider, CN Reddy, was chosen in a non-transparent manner, without consulting the students. A student said that the new service provider wants them to pay the hostel and mess charges for the entire semester upfront. “The administration has refused to share a copy of the contract signed with CN Reddy, and the tender documents from other participants. The students also threatened to intensify their stir against the administration as their failure to address the issue had forced many students to drop out from the course.
