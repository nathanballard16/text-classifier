COIMBATORE: Taxi drivers in the city staged a protest on Tuesday demanding that police personnel treat them with dignity.

The protest comes in the background of the suicide of taxi driver Rajesh Kumar in Chennai, who allegedly killed himself after harassed by a policeman. “He was waiting to pick up a lady customer when a cop abused him verbally and used derogatory language. Dejected by this, he jumped in front of a train at the Maraimalai Nagar Railway Station. He had sent a video message to his family and friends citing police harassment as the reason for the drastic step,” local president of the Federation of Tourist Taxi and Call Taxi Association S Murthy said.

The association has requested senior police officers to educate and sensitise personnel to treat taxi drivers with dignity, said Murthy. About 200 taxi drivers from several associations participated in the demonstration.

Meanwhile, after messages from Chennai about a plan to strike work on Sunday reached the city, a section of drivers struck work on Tuesday. Several taxis parked at the railway station had posters announcing the strike. City residents, who tried book cabs using apps, said they were told by the drivers that the taxis won’t be running on Tuesday.

The association also wanted the government to bring petrol and diesel under the GST regime and lower third party insurance. “Third-party insurance rates have been hiked too much. Also, several toll plazas, whose licences have expired, continue to collect fare. Our demonstration was against those issues also,” added Murthy.
