Delhi: Peasants brave the cold and continue to fight for their rights

Hundreds of farmers braved biting cold on DND till Saturday afternoon where they camped the next whole night cooking out in the open and putting on their bed. All this to make the administration understand till what level the farmers can go in order to make their voices heard.

On Friday, hundreds of farmers from the hinterland marched on the Delhi-Noida border on Friday afternoon, triggering traffic jams across the Delhi-NCR. These people who had planned to reach Jantar Mantar to hold a protest were stopped at the Delhi-Noida-Direct (DND) flyway, causing traffic chaos. The farmers had to hault at the border as the DND was shut for all while the traffic was being diverted. It is pertinent to mention here that the Delhi Traffic Police had issued traffic advisory prior to the protest.

"We were determined to meet the PM and get our grievance heard. We wanted an assurance on our demands being fulfilled," said Nitin Tyagi, a farmer, adding that they were grateful that their leader had made arrangements for food and blankets. "We are farmers, make us sleep anywhere and work anyhow, we will. It was freezing cold but but we didn't care about anything," said Sonia Chaudhary, a farmer from Khacheda village. She further added that they were served food and lit angeethi to keep themselves warm.
