Quota a political gimmick, say NEET aspirants

NEET students say list should have been delayed till HC order

Aspirants of the NEET-PG and their parents staged a rally at JJ Hospital on Friday, demanding justice for students from the open category and terming reservation a political ploy.

Asking the government to withdraw the socially and economically backward classes (SEBC) and economically weaker sections (EWS) quota from postgraduate admissions, they urged politicians not to make them suffer due to the elections.

Similar rallies were held in Solapur and Nagpur, and students from Delhi University also protested in the capital in solidarity.

Parents and students have said this year’s batch is being compromised as it is an election year. The aspirants said the first State list declared by the CET Cell on Friday should have been put on hold till the Bombay High Court ruling. Several students were also upset as they were not allocated a seat in the list.

“This is just a political gimmick. I have scored 760, but I have not been allocated a seat today despite having filled 146 options, including private colleges and alternative branches,” Sonam Turkar, an aspirant, said. Another student, Neil Prabhu, said, “The fact that these quotas are being applied in the year of the elections is a bit suspicious. It indicates that leaders are engaging in vote bank politics.”

While the State CET Cell commissioner refused to comment, Dr. Tatyarao Lahane, director, DMER, said, “We have been following the directives of the State government. The first State list for MD and MS was put out on Friday as the HC had not stayed it. Since the court stayed on MDS (Dental), that list has not been released.”
