Protest outside hotel accommodating rebel MLAs of Karna Cong

Activists of Mumbai Youth Congress on Tuesday protested outside the five-star hotel in suburban Mumbai where rebel MLAs of Congress and JD (S) from Karnataka have been holed up after resigning from the Assembly, triggering a political crisis in the southern state.

Police detained the workers who tried to go inside the hotel this evening to "meet" the legislators.

The MLAs have been staying at the hotel in Powai since early this month.

Mumbai Youth Congress vice president Suraj Singh Thakur said the hotel was a public place and the workers wanted to meet the Karnataka legislators.

"We are initially allowed to go inside the hotel. But as soon as we entered the hotel we were taken away by the police. The security at the hotel is more than the Arthur Road or Tihar Jail. Whose money is being used for their (MLAs') accommodation and food in a five-star luxury hotel?" he asked.
