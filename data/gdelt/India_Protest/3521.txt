Chandrababu Naidu, Arvind Kejriwal discuss proposed Front, Common minimum programme

Amaravati: Taking forward the efforts to stitch an alliance of all anti-BJP parties, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu met here on Monday evening for over two hours.

According to sources, both the leaders discussed issues to be incorporated in the common minimum programme (CMP) of the proposed front. It may be mentioned here that the leaders of all 23 anti-BJP parties are scheduled to meet in New Delhi on February 26.

AICC president Rahul Gandhi has been given the task of preparing a draft CMP which would be discussed at the meeting and a final CMP would be announced on the same day. This meeting is also likely to finalise a name for the front and announce a pre-poll alliance at the national level so that in the event of the BJP not getting absolute majority, the President of India will have to first invite the Front to form the government.

Both the Chief Ministers have also discussed the modalities and tentative dates for holding meetings in various parts of the country, including Andhra Pradesh. In all probability the first such meeting will be held at Amravati either on February 28 or on March 1 depending on the availability of the dates of all other leaders.

It is learnt that both Naidu and Kejriwal spoke to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, DMK president Stalin and Karnataka CM Kumaraswamy and discussed the possible dates. Similar meetings will also be held in Bihar, where the RJD has agreed to play the role of host. In Karnataka, Kumaraswamy proposes to hold a huge farmers’ rally in March. The February 26th meeting is likely to finalise the calendar of meetings and rallies, sources said.
