Pakistan airspace reopens to all commercial flights after India standoff

Pakistan has reopened its airspace, five months after shutting it to most commercial flights.

Pakistani airspace closed in February following a standoff with India over the Kashmir region, which forced international flights to be re-routed.

The country’s Civil Aviation Authority said today that its airspace was now fully open to commercial flights, including those operated by Indian carriers.

A Notam (Notice to Airmen) lifting the ban took effect shortly after midnight, local time.

In March, Pakistan reopened its airspace for commercial flights to four major cities, Karachi, Islamabad, Peshawar and Quetta.

But the airspace above major eastern cities like Lahore, near the border with India, would remain closed.

The move caused significant disruption to travellers, with some Asia-Europe flights rerouted to avoid Pakistan airspace.

The most direct routes from London to Kuala Lumpur and from Manchester to Singapore pass over northern Pakistan.
