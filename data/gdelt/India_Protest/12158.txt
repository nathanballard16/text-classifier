SP student wing stops train in Kanpur, demands justice for Unnao rape survivor

Kanpur (Uttar Pradesh) [India], Aug 9 (ANI): Samajwadi Party Chatra Sabha workers, as part of their state-wide protests against the Yogi Adityanath government, stopped a train at Lucknow crossing in Kanpur on Friday.

A group of agitators belonging to the student cell of Samajwadi Party were seen chanting slogans of "Unnao ke kand pe Nyay do (Deliver justice on Unnao rape case)" on the railway track.

One of the protesting members, SP Chatra Sabha leader Gaurav Narang said, "Till now, no justice has been meted out to the Unnao rape survivor's family. That is why, as a mark of protest against the government, we have stopped this train."

Another party worker said, "Under the directions of our National President (Akhilesh Yadav) we are carrying out protests all over the state against the government. We are protesting here to demand justice for the Unnao rape survivor. The BJP MLA (Kuldeep Singh Sengar) should be hanged, just like all politicians who are found guilty of such acts."

Sengar, who was recently expelled by the BJP, had allegedly raped the girl at his residence in Unnao in June 2017.

On July 28, a truck rammed into the vehicle in which the Unnao rape survivor, her counsel and two aunts were travelling to Raebareli. While her aunts succumbed to their injuries, the victim and her lawyer sustained grievous injuries.

The rape survivor and her lawyer were shifted to AIIMS in New Delhi from Lucknow this week. (ANI)
