‘Merger of banks will strengthen private financial institutions’

MANGALURU: The central government ’s decision to merge several public-sector banks has, at least along the Karnataka coast, elicited widespread backlash. While employees’ unions are protesting against the move, the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC) has voiced its opposition to the merger.The members of the outfit opined that the merger would only serve to strengthen the hold of private banks in the sector, which would happen at the cost of the public-sector institutions.The results of the central government’s previous merger exercises – Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank ’s merger with the Bank of Baroda , and the associate entities’ merger with the State Bank of India – had not been very positive, said AIBOC vice-president Sathish Shetty. “The business sector was not very pleased with the results of the previous exercises. Also, management of non-performing assets, customer service, and handling of the workforce have been badly affected. The central government has announced a new series of mergers without reviewing the outcome of the previous exercises,” said Shetty.He added that the customers of the smaller banks would be the ones bearing the brunt of the merger. “They are likely to feel neglected in the larger setup. Also, business of the individual banks, now merged, will suffer enormous losses, given the amount of time, energy and financial resources that will have to be expended on setting the new house in order. Consequently, this will allow private banks to foray into territories previously the bastions of public-sector institutions,” said Shetty.AIBOC called for a ‘White Paper’ giving a detailed explanation about the outcome of the previous merger exercises, with particular focus on the operational front.
