Centre Proposes To Give Back Same Land To Reconstruct Sant Ravidas Temple; AAP Welcomes The Move

The Centre on Friday (18 October) told the Supreme Court that it proposed to give the site where the demolished temple stood to the devotees of Guru Ravidas for construction of the temple.

Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Friday welcomed the Government of India's decision to give land to build the Sant Ravidas Temple.

AAP's Delhi convener Gopal Rai said that people of Delhi and India took the streets after the demolition of the temple, and under the public pressure and protests, the Centre has taken the decision of giving the land for the temple.

"We want that the temple is built and harmony is maintained. We believe that the Centre will ensure that such incidents which hurt the sentiment of people will not take place," Rai said urging the centre to formulate a constructive programme to build the temple.

In August, the Delhi Assembly had passed a resolution demanding the temple to be rebuilt at the same site, days after the temple was demolished. AAP MLAs, joined by party workers from Punjab and Haryana also held protests at Jantar Mantar in Delhi against the demolition.
