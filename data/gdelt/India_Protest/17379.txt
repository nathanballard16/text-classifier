Protest by Delhi Police personnel affects traffic at ITO intersection

Traffic was affected for hours at the ITO intersection here on Tuesday after Delhi Police personnel staged a protest, which was sparked by two attacks on their colleagues, outside the police headquarters.

Traffic was closed in the carriageway from ITO towards Laxmi Nagar since the agitation lasted for 11 hours.

The protesting police personnel literally blocked a carriageway outside the police headquarters, while the traffic on the other side was moving at a snail's pace.

Motorists were advised to use the roads going towards Delhi Gate and Raj Ghat due to the road blockade outside the police headquarters -- a major route to go to east Delhi, Noida and Ghaziabad.

Several motorists took hours to reach their destinations.

At around 8:45 pm, the traffic movement was opened in the carriageway from ITO towards Laxmi Nagar, the traffic police informed in a tweet.
