VALSAD/SURAT: Lal Dungari in Valsad district will be remembered by the Gandhi scion forever on Valentine’s Day. On Thursday, a woman hugged and planted kiss on Congress president Rahul Gandhi ’s cheeks in front of public and senior party leaders.Kashmira Munshi, 68, a lone Parsi Congress worker from Bharuch district was part of the women workers group who were called on stage to garland Gandhi at the Jan Akrosh public rally venue.Gandhi was taken by surprise when she came forward, hugged him and gave him a kiss. When the SPG guards asked the women to clear the stage for others in the queue, Munshi again went close to Gandhi, pampered his cheeks and blessed him for the 2019 election.“My gesture has nothing to do with Valentine’s Day. I have hugged him earlier as well during the public meeting in Bharuch prior to the 2014 Lok Sabha election. I hugged and kissed him just like a mother blessing her son to become the Prime Minister in 2019,” she told reporters.Munshi has been active in the Congress for the past three decades and she was the in-charge of Congress Mahila Morcha in Bharuch district for a long time. At present, she lives with her family in Surat district ’s Dungari village.“The country see future PM in Rahul Gandhi. Only he has the guts to take on Narendra Modi . I wish and pray that he becomes the PM in 2010,” she said.When Gandhi ended his speech and alighted from the stage, Munshi and her fellow Congress workers followed him. She even cheered Gandhi when he was matching steps with the tribal dancers at the venue.When his cavalcade moved out of the venue, Munshi and the Congress workers followed him till the end to bid him adieu.
