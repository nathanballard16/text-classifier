India’s Top Court Refuses to Halt Implementation of New Citizenship Law

The Supreme Court of India, which took up a batch of around 60 petitions on Wednesday, including those filed by opposition Indian National Congress, however, has refused to stay its implementation. The bench headed by the Chief Justice of India, Justice S.A. Bobde has issued a notice to the federal government and all 60 petitioners challenging the legislation and said the court would take up the pleas in January.

India’s federal government enacted the new Citizenship (Amendment) Act last week. The controversial law grants Indian nationality to persecuted Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, Jains, Sikhs and Parsis from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, who entered India illegally before 2015.

The law, however, does not grant citizenship to Muslims from these three neighbouring countries, something which protesters and several opposition parties in the country held as violation of the Constitution
