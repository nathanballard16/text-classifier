Special cop units to look into vehicle theft cases

Team bolstered due to rise in incidents, involving gangs



Pimpri-Chinchwad has witnessed plenty of cases related to vehicle thefts and damage — a cause of concern that the cops are now planning tackle with additional units. The Pimpri-Chinchwad police have appended three new squads to the crime branch that have started functioning from this week.



Commissioner of police (CP) R Padmanabhan told Mirror that the crime branch needed expansion so that it could cover the twin towns. “The new units have not been deployed to simply divide work, but to work on specific cases for a faster resolution. While we already had specialised units to tackle narcotics, gangs, cybercrime and so on, we still required further specialised help to work on the cases in-depth,” he added.



Additional CP Ramnath Pokle said that one unit will now exclusively look into the matter and its officials are being supervised by an officer of the ACP-rank. “Thus, three more assistant commissioners of police (ACPs) have been assigned,” he said.



The cops have been on the alert after 675 cases of vehicle thefts cases were registered. The vandalism has been on the rise after a brief pause last month, with the incidents making their presence felt in densely populated areas like the industrial settlements.



The police records, accessed by Mirror, showed that in six months, Chakan recorded 98 cases of vehicle thefts, loot and damage — highest so far — followed by Wakad and Hinjawadi that recorded 75 cases each. Bhosari recorded 65 cases and Pimpri had 51 cases.



So far, the Pimpri-Chinchwad police have been able to recover 80 vehicles. Probes have pointed towards the inter-district gangs that have been lifting vehicles to sell in the rural parts. These gangs have been sneaking in from Ahmednagar, Satara, Sangli among others.
