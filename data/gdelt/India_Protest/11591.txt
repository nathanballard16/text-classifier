Time and again, fans of leading stars in the South film industry prove that their fandom knows no bounds. They go to any extent to prove their loyalty to a particular star. This time, Kajal Aggarwal's die-hard fan has found himself in trouble and has lost Rs 60 lakh to fraudsters.

A youth hailing from Ramanathapuram is an ardent fan of Kajal Aggarwal and wanted to meet her. He stumbled upon a webpage which promised fans a meeting with the Sita actress. He expressed his interest to meet Kajal and as the first step, the criminal gang asked him to make a payment of Rs 50,000 and furnish his personal details.

Since the fan is from a well-off background, he did not hesitate to pay the fee. In the coming months, the gang looted more money from him but didn't share any details about the impending meeting with Kajal. The fan found that he was being cheated.

The gang did not stop there, they continued to demand more money from the fan. When he refused to pay them, he was threatened to an extent where the fraudsters shared obscene photos of him. They also threatened him that they will share these photos on social media.

The fan confessed that he made a payment of Rs 60 lakh in three instalments. The fan was in a lot of mental stress and fled the house. Police officials found him in Kolkata and he revealed the whole story to them. It is said that the cops have taken producer Saravanakumar into their custody, based on the complaint filed by the fan.

The cops are now investigating the issue and are hopeful of finding more members of the gang.
