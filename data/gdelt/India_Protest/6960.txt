Kolkata, April 26 : Lawyers in West Bengal on Thursday decided to go on "cease work" till April 29, protesting against police "atrocities" and demanding arrest of police personnel who "brutally tortured" advocates, staff and judicial officers of Howrah court on Wednesday.

In a five-point resolution adopted at an emergency meeting on Thursday, the Bar Council of West Bengal decided to go on cease work till Monday. During this period, the lawyers would not attend court hearings.

Ashok Deb, chairman of Bar Council of West Bengal, told IANS that a delegation would go to Howrah court on Friday to express solidarity with the lawyers working there.
