Three days after the shocking incident involving a minor’s “rape” by a teacher of a private school in Neshta village, located near the Pakistan border in Attari, came to light, residents of the area, along with family members of the victim, staged a protest against the school management on Monday. The protesters sought action against the principal and also change of members of the entire school management.

The police have arrested mathematics teacher Ashwani Kumar for rape and a maid of the school for destruction of evidence.

Residents raised slogans against the school management. A few of them pelted the building with stones, damaging window glasses.

They alleged that it was an utter negligence and failure of the school management, including the principal, to keep a check and follow the norms properly. “The school principal and staff failed to inform the family about this. It was only after the girl complained of pain that the incident came to light,” said a woman agitator, adding, “If teachers indulge in such heinous acts, whom will parents trust while sending their wards to schools.”

Around three years ago, seven students of the school lost their lives after a van fell into a drain at Muhawa village. At that time, the school was accused of not following the vehicle safety norms.

People alleged that a teacher of the school married his student, bringing it a bad repute.

“It is the responsibility of the school management to ensure the safety of the children. It has failed miserably,” the protesters alleged.

Manmeet Pal Singh, Station House Officer, Gharinda police station, reached the spot and pacified the agitators. He said the police had submitted a complaint against the school management and appropriate action would be taken in this regard.
