From the Archives (April 11, 1969): UK Sikhs force lifting of ban on turbans

Civic chiefs of Wolverhampton last night [April 9] lifted a two-year ban on Sikh busmen wearing beards and turbans – and averted a ritual suicide threat. The ban had angered Britain’s 130,000 Sikhs who considered it an affront to their religion, and it sparked demonstrations in India. The British Government, fearing a race crisis could blow up here [Wolverhampton (England)], intervened and last night Wolverhampton Transport Committee reversed its policy – just four days before Sikh leader Sohan Singh Jolly planned to burn himself to death. Mr. Jolly, 66, a former Inspector in the Kenya Police, had declared that unless the ban was lifted, his self-immolation on Sunday would be followed by other prominent Sikhs in a chain of death-by-burning. A British Government junior Minister paid a surprise visit to Wolverhampton on Tuesday. The Committee, in apparent deference to this, said it was lifting the ban because of outside pressure.
