Bengaluru, July 10

The BJP in Karnataka demonstrated outside the Vidhana Soudha on Wednesday to demand that Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy step down from office, claiming his government had lost majority after 14 MLAs of the ruling Congress-JD(S) alliance submitted their resignations.

Several state BJP leaders, including former deputy chief minister KS Eshwarappa, took part in the protest led by state president BS Yeddyurappa in front of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue at the Vidhana Soudha.

As Congress leader and state minister DK Shivakumar stood on vigil outside a hotel in Mumbai to meet the rebel MLAs, BJP protesters here raised slogans like “Down, down with the government that has lost majority... down, down with the CM who wants to stick to the chair.”

Yeddyurappa and other leaders are likely to meet Governor Vajubhai Vala at Raj Bhavan later in the day to ask him to dismiss the coalition government that had lost majority, BJP leaders said.

A delegation of BJP leaders is also expected to meet Speaker Ramesh Kumar and apprise him on the situation, they added.

The former chief minister has been holding a series of meetings with party leaders for the last couple of days regarding the ongoing political developments and the BJP’s plan of action.

During the protest, Yeddyurappa asked Kumaraswamy to resign immediately and make way for the BJP to form the government.

“The Assembly session starts from July 12. How will you have the session with no majority, Mr Kumaraswamy?” he asked, adding that Kumaraswamy should voluntarily resign.

“We expected your father and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda will advise (you to resign),” Yeddyurappa said.

Pointing out that Congress-JD(S) MLAs who had resigned had moved the Supreme Court, he said he expected a judgment on Thursday. PTI
