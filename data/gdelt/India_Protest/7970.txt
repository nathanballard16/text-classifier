EC nod to state govt will pave the way for such reservations.After facing embarrassment on the issue of reservations for Marathas in postgraduate medical courses, the state Cabinet is due to announce an ordinance in a specially convened cabinet meeting today, government sources said. Thehas now received permission from the Election Commission (EC) to promulgate an ordinance for Maratha reservation inThe government had made a special request to the EC, stating this would be a major issue in the forthcoming assembly elections in the state.Government sources told Mirror the issue would be discussed in the state Cabinet meeting to be held today. “Promulgation of the ordinance will pave the way for admissions to postgraduate medical courses under the Maratha quota, and also save the admissions of existing students,” said Medical Education Minister Girish Mahajan.On March 8, the state had written a letter to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), to incorporate the Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) quota in postgraduate medical courses from the 2019 academic session.However, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court had said that the 16 per cent reservation for Marathas under thewould not apply to postgraduate medical courses this year. The HC had held the government’s decision to introduce the quota unconstitutional.A division bench of Justices Sunil Shukre and Pushpa Ganediwala had said the March 8 notification (about the new quota) shall not be applicable to the admission process, which had started earlier. The Supreme Court also upheld the HC order, cancelling the 16 per cent SEBC quota for postgraduate medical seats in the state.The ordinance expected to be announced today will end the deadlock between protesting Maratha medical postgraduate students and the BJP-led state government. Nearly 250 postgraduate medical students have have been protesting at Azad Maidan over the past week.A senior government officer said the ordinance would be issued under section 17(1) of the Social and Educational Backward Class, Act, 2018 (SEBC), under which a 16 per cent quota has been given to the Maratha community in jobs and education.Once the ordinance is issued, the government will be able to make the quota applicable to Maratha students despite the SC upholding the Nagpur HC bench’s order.Officials said the government will have to bring in an amendment to the SEBC Act in the state Assembly during the forthcoming monsoon session.
