Pak recalls ambassador from India for ‘consultations’

ISLAMABAD, Feb 18(Agencies): Pakistan recalled its ambassador to India on Monday for “consultations” amid heightened bilateral tensions after the Pulwama terror attack, officials here said.

“We have called back our High Commissioner in India for consultations. He left New Delhi this morning,” Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal said on Twitter.

India recalled its ambassador to Pakistan last week to discuss Pakistan relations in the wake of a suicide bombing in Kashmir region that killed 44 Indian paramilitary police. New Delhi says Pakistan had a hand in the attack, which Islamabad denies. India has blamed Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday.

Over 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a bus carrying security forces. The bus was a part of a convoy carrying more than 2,500 personnel from the Central Reserve Police Force. On Monday it was reported four Indian soldiers and two militants were killed in a gun battle in Kashmir.

Pakistan High Commissioner to India Sohail Mahmood was on Friday summoned in New Delhi by Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale who lodged strong protest over the killing of 40 CRPF soldiers in Pulwama.

Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria was also called to New Delhi for consultations in the wake of the attack.
