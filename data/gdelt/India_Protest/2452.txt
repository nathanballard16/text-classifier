Former Congress man joins BJD

BHUBANESWAR: Twenty days after resigning from the Congress on January 18, former legislator from Sundargarh Jogesh Singh joined BJD on Wednesday along with his supporters at the party headquarters here.He joined hours before Congress president Rahul Gandhi addressed a public rally at Rourkela in Sundargarh district, his home turf. Welcoming him into the party, BJD president and chief minister Naveen Patnaik said Singh’s joining will strengthen the party organization in the tribal-dominated district.The two-time legislator was suspended from the Congress on January 17 for anti-party activities that led to his resignation.Senior BJD leaders from Sundargarh district were present during Singh’s joining. BJD leader Kusum Tete, who unsuccessfully contested the 2014 assembly election against Singh, was also seen on the dais. She had initially opposed Singh joining BJD. “The chief minister has paid special attention to the development of Sundargarh district. I joined the party to expedite the process. I will work with all dedication and commitment,” said Singh.Asked whether he would contest the 2019 assembly elections from Sundargarh, he said it is up to the BJD president. Singh is the second senior leader after Naba Das, who quit the Congress, to join the ruling party ahead of the ensuing elections. Das joined BJD on January 24, a day before Rahul’s public meeting in Bhubaneswar.Meanwhile, the state government has appointed Tete as chairperson of the special development council, Sundargarh, a day before Singh’s induction into the BJD.
