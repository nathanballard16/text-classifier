Local authorities impose curfew in IoK

Authorities in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK) imposed curfew and restrictions in the valley on Friday after the martyrdom of a top separatist commander Zakir Musa on May 23.According to Radio Pakistan , Musa along with an associate was martyred by Indian troops during a cordon and search operation in Dadsara Tral area of Pulwama district.The killing triggered massive protests in many parts of the troubled valley on Thursday evening.As a result, the authorities had to announce curfew and restrictions in Srinagar, Pulwama, Tral, Awantipora, Shopian, Islamabad and Badgam areas.Local officials also ordered the closure of all educational institutions across Kashmir to prevent students’ protests against the latest killings.Meanwhile, heavy deployments of Indian troops and police personnel have been made in Srinagar, Badgam, Ganderbal, Pulwama, Islamabad, Shopian, Kulgam, Bandipora, Kupwara and Baramulla districts.In wake of the prevailing situation, Kashmir University Srinagar and Islamic University of Science and Technology Awantipora Pulwama postponed all exams slated for Friday.The Muslim-majority Himalayan region of Kashmir has been at the heart of more than 70 years of animosity, since the partition of the British colony of India into the separate countries of Pakistan and India.Since both neighbours tested nuclear weapons in 1998, IoK has become one of the world’s most dangerous flashpoints.
