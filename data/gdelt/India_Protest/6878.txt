Asansol (WB), April 23

PM Narendra Modi today mocked TMC chief Mamata Banerjee for her prime ministerial aspirations and said she would have bought the post with the money looted from chit fund scams had it been up for auction.

Modi said he felt “pity” for Mamata as the PM post could never be brought by money looted in Saradha and Naradha scams. “To become the PM of a vast country like India a person has to earn the respect and blessings of its 130 crore people,” he said at a rally in this industrial hub where Union Minister Babul Supriyo will take on actor-turned-politician Moon Moon Sen of TMC.

“By fighting in just a handful of seats, Didi is dreaming of becoming the PM. If the post could be bought in auctions, Congress and Didi would’ve bought it with the money they’ve looted from the country.

Hitting back, Banerjee alleged the central forces were working for the BJP by illegally sitting inside the booths and asking voters to cast vote in favour of the saffron party. She claimed that the voting process was dragged for three months to help the BJP. — PTI
