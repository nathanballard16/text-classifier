In unison

Thousands of members of the minority community along with social activists and citizens marched on the streets of Pune in protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) and on Sunday. The protest march organised by Kul Jamat-e-Tanjim and NRC CAA Virodhi Maha Rally Niyojan Samiti started from Golibar Maidan near Cantonment and ended at Council Hall. In the memorandum submitted to authorities, the protesters stated, “The CAA and NRC in its current form exclude persecuted Muslims from benefits and, hence, are discriminatory and outright communal. Also, the NPR (National Population Register) exercise is giving the authority wide and unchecked discretion to declare a person as a doubtful citizen.” Activist Umar Khalid too joined the rally. Considering the huge number of protesters, cops blocked roads in various parts so that the protesters could walk peacefully. This, however, caused inconvenience to the commuters.
