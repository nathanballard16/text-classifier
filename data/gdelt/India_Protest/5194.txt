KU students hold forceful demonstrations in Srinagar

Srinagar, March 19, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the students of Kashmir University, Srinagar, held a protest demonstration, today, against the summoning of Hurriyat forum Chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, by India’s National Investigation Agency for questioning in New Delhi and against the killing of a school teacher in custody.

A student of the varsity told media that scores of students marched in the campus of the university denouncing the killing of school teacher and Jamaat-e-Islami activist, Rizwan Asad Pandit, in custody and NIA summons to Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. The students raised anti-India slogans and demanded action against the culprits involved in the killing of Rizwan.

The students carried placards condemning the NIA summon to Mirwaiz and termed it direct interference in religious affairs. They said the summoning of Mirwaiz amounts to the harassment of resistance leadership in occupied Kashmir and should be stopped forthwith. The students said that the NIA summon to Mirwaiz Umar Farooq was not acceptable to the people of occupied Kashmir.

Meanwhile, the Chairman of Tehreek-e-Muzahamat, Bilal Siddiqi, and the Jammu and Kashmir Islami Tanbzeem-e-Azadi in their statements in Srinagar strongly condemned the cold-blooded custodial murder of Rizwan Assad Pandit. They said in its pursuit of keeping its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir through military might intact New Delhi has turned the territory into a killing field.
