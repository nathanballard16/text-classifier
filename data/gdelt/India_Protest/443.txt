Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen backs Naseeruddin Shah over 'intolerance' comments

A day after Nobel laureate Amartya Sen stood by actor Naseeruddin Shah for his comments on the Amnesty International video, he said issues like Ram Mandir and whether menstruating women should enter temple crop up ahead of general elections.

“It’s amazing that issues like building Ram Mandir in Ayodhya and whether menstruating women should be entering the temple crop up ahead of general elections. Some important issues that would have been major issues elsewhere in the world aren't anywhere in the picture. Ram Mandir and whether women should enter a temple be a central issue?” said Sen while attending an event at Asiatic Society in Kolkata on Monday.

A day ago, Sen showed solidarity to Naseeruddin Shah’s comments.

“We must register our protest against any attempt to disturb the actor. He is being harassed in many ways and we must protest against it. What is happening in the country now is objectionable and should stop right away. The present situation in the country must change,” Sen said at the airport a day ago when he arrived in Kolkata.

Later, he said, “Many institutions in the country are under the attack, and curbs on free press. Even journalists are being harassed. Losing the ability to tolerate others is a serious concern for all of us. This only lead to losing the ability to think and analyse.”
