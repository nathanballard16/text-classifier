Thank you for joining us. Do come again on Saturday (March 30) for election live updates.

Here are the updates from Wednesday (March 29):

* Our government is not idle on bringing Dawood Ibrahim to justice. USA and France are helping India on Masood Azhar: Rajnath Singh

* We are acting against those offenders who have fled the country. We are trying to extradite fugitives like Nirav Modi: Rajnath Singh

* Ayodhya issue is sub judice. But everyone wants Ram temple in Ayodhya. Even a majority of the Muslims want the Ram temple in Ayodhya: Rajnath Singh

* BJP will win more seats in 2019 than it won in 2014: Rajnath Singh

* I have never given any thought about Rahul Gandhi as an opposition leader: Rajnath Singh

* Our scheme is not a sop or dole. We have a target to double the income of farmers by 2022. Our scheme will help the farmer in increasing their income: Rajnath Singh

* Congress has once again tried to fool the poor people of the country: Rajnath Singh on Rahul Gandhi's proposed NYAY scheme

* This is a hypothetical question: Rajnath Singh on BJP not getting a majority in 2019 Lok Sabha election and some other leader being chosen as the prime minister of India.

* I have not thought about my role when we come back to power. The party will decide what role I should play and I am ready to do it: Rajnath Singh

* I have one regret that more could have been done for our Central Paramilitary Forces. They are extremely brave and need work in very difficult circumstances: Rajnath Singh

* We need a debate on Article 35 A. Jammu and Kashmir has suffered because of this. This is my personal opinion: Rajnath Singh

* We formed the government in Jammu and Kashmir with Peoples Democratic Party in the interest of the state and the country. But unfortunately, it did not work out: Rajnath Singh

* The Kashmir issue is very old and chronic. It will take some time to resolve. But we are determined to ensure Kashmir's development for the welfare of its residents: Rajnath Singh

* Lal Krishna Advani-Murli Manohar Joshi era has not ended. They have contributed a lot in making the BJP strong. We have immense respect for them: Rajnath Singh

* I have achieved most of the targets working as Home Minister. We have successfully tackled the Naxal menace. Naxalism has been contained in 130 districts. The moral of our security forces have been strengthened. The situation will change for the better: Rajnath Singh

* BSP-SP alliance in Uttar Pradesh has no credibility. This alliance was formed with a negative mindset just to stop PM Modi. Such alliances do not work. This alliance is unnatural and will not work. It can break anytime and it will happen soon: Rajnath Singh

* People have more faith in PM Modi's leadership in 2019 as compared to 2014: Rajnath Singh

* I believe that the opposition should forget political difference when it is about the country. This is essential for a healthy democracy. We try for coordination with the opposition. There is a shortcoming in the opposition. Politics is not just for power, it is about the country: Rajnath Singh

* We should not politicise actions which make our country strong. We should congratulate the soldiers, scientists and the leadership. This is not for politics: Rajnath Singh

* We were a bit restless as our soldiers had been killed in Pulwama. But we were ready to act and there was no doubt that our forces will cross the Line of Control and target terror camps inside Pakistan. We prepared and thought about the pros and cons but the surgical strike was well planned and executed. I thank the Army, IAF and Indian Navy: Rajnath Singh

* Our forces did not attack Pakistani army and defence or its people. We attacked only the terror camps. The strike was carried out based on credible intelligence. While Pakistan is rattled due to the airstrike, there are some people here in India too have are not happy: Rajnath Singh

* Anti-satellite missile test has put India in a league of 4 nations with such a capability. India will not hesitate to conduct another surgical strike on terror camps inside Pakistan if there is another attack here: Rajnath Singh

* India has never attacked any country but if someone challenges us, then we will respond: Rajnath Singh

* Balakot is not an election agenda but the airstrikes show that the country is in safe hands and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will always act against terror. Pakistan will have to mend its ways and stop exporting terror. If Pakistan is not able to stop terror groups, then it can seek India's help in tackling these terrorists: Rajnath Singh

* I don't believe that people do not vote on the development agenda. People look at a leader and party which works for the development of the country and ensures safety and security: Rajnath Singh

* GDP growth rate has gone up. Our prestige in the eyes of other countries has increased. The people and weaker sections have benefitted from several developments schemes: Rajnath Singh

* The difference in 2014 and 2019 is that BJP will win more seats than the last election. People knew about Narendra Modi but they were not aware of his performance. Now they have seen how he works and performs. People want strong leadership: Rajnath Singh

* Union Home Minister and BJP leader Rajnath Singh speaks to Zee News on Lok Sabha election and brand Modi

* With your vote, two important things will be done on April 11, 2019. There is 'Sun' & 'Son'. On that day, there will be 'sun'rise of Andhra Pradesh and 'son'set of corruption. For the 'sun'rise of Andhra Pradesh, there should be 'son'set. Your vote will ensure the double engine for the development of Andhra Pradesh - BJP govt in the state and BJP govt at the centre: PM Narendra Modi in Kurnool, Andhra Pradesh
