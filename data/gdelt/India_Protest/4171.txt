South Korea marks 100th March First Independence Movement Day - in pictures

South Koreans lit torches and took part in a massive parade in the streets of Seoul to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the March First Independence Movement against Japanese colonial rule.

On March 1, 1919, it was estimated two million Koreans marched in defiance against Japanese supression, which held the Korean peninsula from 1910 to the end of the Second World War in 1945.

Japan responded to the march with heightened supression and several thousand were killed in the demonstrations.

Though the movement failed to break Japan's grip, it did sow the seeds for the establishment of a Korean government in exile and the formation of the Korean army.

Asian scholars today say the event inspired non-violent forms of protest such as India's struggle to end British rule about 30 years later. March 1 was designated a public holiday in Korea since 1949.
