Police detains Hardik Patel over protesting in Surat: Surat tragedy

As soon as Congress leader Hardik Patel drove into Surat for initiating a protest in the wake of the Surat fire that took away lives of 22 teenage students, he was detained by the police here.

Patidar Agitation spearhead, Patel was detained by the police from Kamrej highway at the entry point of Surat, when he was heading towards the house of Reservation Agitation leader Alpesh Kathiriya, who is serving jail term in a sedition case.

Threatening to rage agitation at the incident site, the police here denied permission to hold the protest. Despite of no permission granted to the Congress party to take on the agitation, Patel was on his way to the site where the incident happened.

Surat Police Commissioner Satish Sharma said, Patel was attacked by some rival group member when he yesterday visited the site and his protection was the major concern, adding “… we cannot allow him to visit the area every day.”
