NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik tenders written apology to Anna Hazare

Mumbai: Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and spokesperson Nawab Malik had tendered an apology to veteran social worker Anna Hazare for the allegations levelled against him regarding the recent hunger strike by the latter. Malik, during the hunger strike by Anna Hazare at Ralegan Siddhi, last month, had said that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh funds Anna Hazare for his hunger strikes, during a debate on a news channel. Malik has now tendered written appology for the defamatory allegation.

Anna Hazare had staged fast unto death at Ralegan Siddhi in January protesting the failure of the government to implement the decision to appoint Lokpal and Lokayukta despite passing the Act. The hunger strike had led to heated debates in political and social circles of the state as well as the country. Speaking on a debate on a news channel Nawab Malik had leveled serious allegations against Anna Haare saying that RSS funds his hunger strikes.

Taking note of the allegation, Anna Hazare, through his lawyer - advocate Milind Pawar - had issued a legal notice to Nawab Malik on February 2 seeking proof of the allegations levelled against the veteran social worker, failing which, he should tender a written apology.

The defamatory statement had sent waves of anger among residents of Ralegan Siddhi. To register the protest, the residents of Ralegan Siddhi had resolved not to let NCP leaders meet Anna Hazare during the Parivartan Rally. Senior NCP leaders such as state unit president Jayant Patil, Chhagan Bhujbal, Madhukar Pichad could not meet Anna Hazare during the rally.

"I had no intentions to hurt you. I dont want to escalate the dispute any furhter. A senior leader from my party has already appologised for what has happend. You are a fatherly figure, I apologise if you are hurt by what happened," said Nawab Malik in the apology letter.
