Hyderabad Police Suspends Charminar Cop For Misbehaving With Woman Medico

Hyderabad: Following the furore over a constable misbehaving with a woman protestor under Charminar Police Station limits, Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjan Kumar suspended Paramesh, the erring constable. The video, which had now gone viral, Paramesh was seen pinching and stamping a woman medico as she writhed in pain.

The Commissioner ordered a thorough probe into the incident. The particular constable is attached with Charminar Police Station.

On Wednesday, some Unani medical students, most of them women, staged a sit-in near the Ayurveda Bhavan near Charminar protesting its relocation to Erragadda in the city. Police descended on the scene as protest intensified. While women constables tried to bundle them off into police vans, male policemen who were in Mufti misbehaved with them touching them inappropriately. Particularly, Paramesh was seen mercilessly pinching a woman medico and stamping on her legs when she was being whisked away.

The video shot by other students show incriminating evidence against the constable doing his act discreetly. It had gone viral and shared across various social media platforms and on television. Women's and students' organisations condemned the inappropriate behaviour of the constable and demanded action against him.
