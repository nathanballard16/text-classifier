Maharashtra resident doctors threaten strikes, protest

A week after writing to the Directorate of Medical Education and Research (DMER), the Central Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) on Thursday said they had been “fooled” by the government and DMER over the stipend hike issue and will “toil and moil” for their demand to be implemented.

In a letter to the DMER on Thursday, the MARD warned authorities of a strike by resident doctors of government medical colleges in Latur and Ambejogai over delay in stipend payment, and protests in Mumbai to show solidarity to the doctors from state peripheral medical colleges.

“The administration at every level is saying that stipends would remain locked. A few colleges are not getting permission to release the PLA fund, while others have no funds to release (stipend) from anywhere. Ministry should release some funds from their loaded pockets we will return them, once we get our stipends,” the letter reads.

Stating that the government and DMER have fooled them over stipend hike, MARD said that it will get the demand implemented this year. “We have lost our patience now. About the delays in issuing stipend, Latur MARD and Ambejogai MARD has already given intimation for going on strike next week individually. We would protest and support them to regain their financial strength,” the letter further stated.

Dr. Kalyani Dongre, president, Central MARD said, “We in Mumbai will protest like we did the last time by setting up fruit stalls. While a strike call has been given by the two colleges, protests will take place across the state.”
