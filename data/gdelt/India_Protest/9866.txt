NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of protesters carried out a protest march here in the Indian capital on Tuesday against the three-day visit of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo beginning Tuesday.

The protest was organised by the All India Peace and Solidarity Organisation (AIPSO).

AIPSO convener Nilotpal Basu said the protest was organised in the Indian capital against the "arm-twisting" policies of the United States and also to call on the government not to bow before the U.S. "pressure tactics."

"The arm-twisting policies and pressure tactics of America are not in the interest of India and its people. We want to tell the government of India not to succumb to such policies of America ... We can never tolerate such tactics," said Basu.

He added, "We are against U.S. hegemonic and imperialist policies ... we organised protests against the U.S. in Delhi and other cities as well."
