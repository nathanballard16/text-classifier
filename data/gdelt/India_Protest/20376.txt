Nirbhaya's mother urges govt to ensure Maliwal ends strike

Nirbhaya's mother on Friday appealed to the Centre to fulfil the demand of DCW chief Swati Maliwal to give capital punishment to rapists and ensure that she ends her fast.

She visited Maliwal at Samta Sthal near Rajghat where the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chairperson has been sitting on a hunger strike for over 10 days.

Nirbhaya's mother said she was upset that the government had not bothered to check on Maliwal during her hunger strike.
