Police ‘inaction’: LIP supporters protest outside top cop’s house

Ludhiana: Alleging police inaction, a Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) leader, along with other supporters of the outfit, staged a protest outside the residence of commissioner of police Sukhchain Singh Gill early on Friday.

LIP leader Rajesh Khokhar, a resident of Manohar Nagar, said Congress workers thrashed him near his house, but instead of acting against them, cops asked him to lodge a complaint at the area police post the next day.

Khokhar said, “The three Congress men are my neighbours. I had gone to attend a Bhog ceremony in the locality on Thursday evening. There, the three taunted me about LIP’s rout. Ignoring their jeers, I left the place. Hours later around 11:30pm, when I was driving back home from my office in Janta Nagar, the trio intercepted my bike, thrashed me and threatened to kill me.”

Khokhar called up the police and a PCR reached the spot. “But instead of taking action against them, the cops asked me to go to the police post in the morning,” he added.

Angry over the police “apathy”, Khokhar, along with LIP workers, reached the residence of commissioner of police around 3am. “We protested for half-an-hour, but nobody came out to listen to our grievance,” he said.

He then lodged a police complaint.

Atam Nagar police post in-charge ASI Balkar Singh said, “On receiving the complaint, a case was registered against the three — Sanjeev Kumar, Manohar and Jai Patar, all residents of Manohar Nagar — under Section 107/151 (preventive detention) of the CrPC. Later, Sanjeev was arrested.”
