“While so much injustice has been done to Muslims, an image has been strongly being portrayed as if the Muslims unanimously had accepted the verdict…to ensure that it is not misrepresented in history, Tamilnadu Thowheed Jamaath is holding a massive protest,” said the organisation.

TNTJ said the Supreme Court was expected to provide judgement based on laws instead provided the verdict based on beliefs. “This decision has been extremely disappointing for Muslims, who were hoping for justice,” the organisation added.

Tamilnadu Thowheed Jamaath also appealed to the Muslim proponents to not accept this 5-acre land offered to them.
