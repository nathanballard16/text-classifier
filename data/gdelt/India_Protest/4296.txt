The Mumbai Mirror reported that the accused used to pose as CBI officials and used to run away with the money in a vehicle. The accused allegedly used to book the vehicles using stolen mobile phones. A complaint filed by the owner of a forex company based in Malad prompted the arrest of the accused. In his complaint, the owner alleged that his employee was threatened and looted by two people. He added that he received a call asking him to exchange 4,000 US dollars and 2,000 Singapore dollar to Indian rupees.

The caller allegedly introduced himself as Hardik. The accused even gave him an address in Goregaon East where the money was to be delivered. However, when an employee reached the spot, he was looted of Rs 4 lakh by four men waiting in a car. The four men allegedly pretended to be CBI officials and looted the money.
