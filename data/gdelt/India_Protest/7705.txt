Bangalore News May 13 Highlights: Rains make a comeback in several areas; evening peak hour traffic kicks in early

Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), the local civic body, is all set to launch online monitoring of lifts and escalators on all skywalks in the city. The measure is being taken to keep track of pedestrians whether they use skywalks. The new project, however, will take place only after final approval by the BBMP council.

Meanwhile, BBMP has issued work orders for the construction of 29 new skywalks in the city. The projects which were planned to be based on a public-private partnership (PPP) model initially, however, will see the civic body investing in it due to non-takers for partnership and the growing demand among pedestrians and citizen groups for new skywalks. The project is estimated to cost BBMP Rs 50 crore
