Despite India’s protest, Pakistan foreign minister calls up Syed Ali Shah Geelani

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: Despite the strong protest lodged by India against Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s phone conversation with separatist leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq , Qureshi spoke to hardline Hurriyat Conference chairman Syed Ali Shah Geelani and discussed the Kashmir issue.The Pakistan foreign office said Qureshi and Geelani discussed an international conference to be held in London to “express solidarity with the Kashmiri people”. India has alreadyasked the UK not to allow the event to take place.“Foreign minister Qureshi spoke to the senior leadership of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference on telephone before his departure for London to attend international activities to be held there in connection with the Kashmir Day,” the foreign office statement said.Indian refrained from responding officially as, government sources said, it had already made its position clear on the issue. The government believes Qureshi, by taking an excessively hard line position on Kashmir, is trying to undercut Pakistani PM Imran Khan ’s peace overtures to India.
