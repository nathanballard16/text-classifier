Campus Front activists protest against CAA, arrested

Mangaluru: City police on Monday arrested 38 people belonging to the Campus Front of India for organising Collectors Gate Road blockade without permission. The activists were protesting the alleged police action against students of Jamia Millia Islamia and AMU who have been protesting against the new Citizenship Amendment Act.

Police also resorted to mild lathi charge to disperse the crowds.

Speaking to TOI, Fayaz Doddamane, CFI state president, said, “We organised the road blockade to protest the police crackdown reported at Jamia Millia. Several students including women were beaten up by police and we are fighting against injustice. Similar road blocks will be held across the state,” he said.

As protesters kept shouting slogans, police resorted to lathi charge and bundled them into a police bus.

City police commissioner P S Harsha said, “The CFI activists without permission or intimation formed an unlawful assembly and blocked the road between Jyothi and Balmatta jeopardizing public peace. Even on clear instructions to disperse they refused to do so and obstructed police from discharging their duties.”

In public interest 38 people have been arrested. A case has been registered and investigation is under progress, he added. The situation on the ground is absolutely peaceful, Harsha said.
