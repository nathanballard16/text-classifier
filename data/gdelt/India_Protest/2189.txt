Govt announces public holiday on February 5 to honour Kashmir

The interior ministry has issued a notification in this regard.

(Web Desk) – The government has announced a public holiday on February 5 – the Kashmir Solidarity Day – to express support of and unity with the people in Indian-occupied Kashmir.

The interior ministry has issued a notification in this regard.

All institutions, government-run departments and private offices will be closed.

Pakistan has been criticizing atrocities of India in Kashmir.

Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal took to Twitter yesterday and denounced ‘intensified’ repressive measures, including arrests and house arrests of Hurriyat leadership, search operations and killings of Kashmiris ahead of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s visit to the occupied valley.

“IOK converted into an army jail, hurriyat leaders imprisoned, shops closed, mobile & internet suspended & thousands of Indian occupation forces deployed to close roads with razor wire and iron barricades to prevent protests during PM Modi’s visit,” he stated.

According to the notification, one-minute long silence will be observed at 10:00 am to honour the shuhada of Indian occupied Kashmiri (IoK) while all officers, autonomous and semi-autonomous bodies, corporations as well as local councils under the administrative control of the Sindh government would remain closed on Tuesday.

Earlier, a complete shutdown was observed in IOK in protest against Modi’s visit on the call of the Joint Resistance Leadership comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik.

Hurriyat leaders including Gilani, Farooq, Muhammad Ashraf Sehrai, Mukhtar Ahmed Waza, Hilal Ahmed War, Javaid Ahmed Mir and Molvi Bashir Ahmed Irfani, were placed under house arrest to prevent them from leading anti-India demonstrations.

Often, the day marks unrest in IOK.
