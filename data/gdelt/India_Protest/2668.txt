Congress in spot as demand for Gujjar reservation gains steam, CM Gehlot says Centre can do 'constitutional amendment'

Protesters are demanding five percent reservation to Gujjars, all you need to know.

Gujjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla and his supporters continued their sit-in on the rail tracks in Rajasthan's Swai Madhopur district for the second day on Saturday, forcing authorities to divert four trains and cancel 14.

The protesters are demanding five percent reservation to Gujjars, Raika-Rebari, Gadia Lohar, Banjara and Gadaria communities in government jobs and educational institutions. Train movement continued to be affected due to the blockade on Swai Madhopur-Bayana railway section in Kota division.

North Western Railway (NWR) Chief Public Relations Officer Abhay Sharma said three trains, including Hazrat Nizamuddin-Ahmedabad, Hazrat Nizamuddin-Udaipur, and Udaipur-Hazrat Nizamuddin were canceled whereas Firozpur Cantt-Mumbai train was diverted.

Bainsla, who is staging his dharna along with supporters on the railway tracks in Malarna Dungar of Swai Madhopur district, said he will not move till five percent reservation was given. He said the government had promised five percent reservation to the community in its election manifesto so the state government was liable to give the same "so that the people can return home gracefully".

Vijay Bainsla, another Gujjar leader, said they have been waiting for talks with the government since the last 20 days on their demand.
