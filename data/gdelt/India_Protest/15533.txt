Mumbai: Section 144 imposed at Aarey Colony, roads blocked

MUMBAI: The Mumbai Police have imposed section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) at Aarey Colony and blocked all roads into the colony. Over 100 activists and locals, including adivasis, have been detained. "Some FIRs have been registered and arrests are underway," said regional additional commissioner of police Dilip Sawant.Section 144 of the CrPC is issued in urgent cases of security threat or riot and bars the assembly of five or more people in an area where it has been imposed. The road block has led to congestion inside Aarey Colony.A few hours after the Bombay high court passed orders on Friday, the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) started cutting trees in the barricaded areas of Aarey Colony for the construction of Metro-3 car shed. Local residents and activists from various environment groups rushed to the spot on learning about it. There were massive protests with activists and residents barging into the barricaded portion to count the number of felled trees. Subsequently, the police resorted to lathicharge."Around 80 people were detained at Aarey police station, another 40 at Vanrai and 30 at Dahisar including," said Reuben Mascarenhas, national joint secretary of Aam Aadmi Party who was among those detained. "The police said they would release us in a few hours. But as of Saturday morning, people are still detained at Dahisar police station, including adivasi women. Arrests have now begun," said Mascarenhas.Due to road restrictions in Aarey Colony, BEST bus routes 342, 451, 452 are temporarily suspended and routes 326, 341, 478, 498L, 460L, 489L are diverted and operated via WEH, JVLR.
