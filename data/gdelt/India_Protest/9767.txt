Dhananjay Munde slams Sena’s bank threat

Munde said that since last five years, the offices of insurance companies in Mumbai were looting the farmers.

Mumbai: A day after the Shiv Sena threatened banks and insurance companies who dupe and harass farmers seeking loans, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) slammed the saffron party for raising the issue just ahead of the Assembly election.

Senior NCP leader and leader of Opposition in Council, Dhananjay Munde remarked that insurance companies have been looting and duping farmers since the last five years but Shiv Sena couldn’t see their offices in Mumbai.

“How come they (Sena) located these offices just ahead of the Assembly election?,” Mr Munde asked.

Addressing the farmers in Gangapur Taluka of Aurangabad district on Saturday the Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray said that his party would protest against the banks and insurance companies who dupe and harass farmers seeking loans. Also, offices of such unscrupulous institutions in Mumbai will be closed.

Mr Munde said that since last five years, the offices of insurance companies in Mumbai were looting the farmers. “Why did Sena think of raising these issues just ahead of Assembly election? Why these actions were not taken before?” the NCP leader questioned.

Mr Munde also slammed the BJP and Shiv Sena over the chief minister’s post after Assembly election. He claimed that the CM would be from the Congress and NCP grand-alliance.

“In last five years, the saffron alliance failed to build a memorial of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, despite securing a huge mandate on his name. The farm loan waiver scheme had started in the name of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, but it was a farce,” the NCP leader said.

Mr Munde also slammed the government for taking action against the NCP workers who had protested during chief minister’s programme in Pune. He asked whether the Opposition parties have any right to protest in a democratic way?
