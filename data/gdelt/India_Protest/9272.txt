The management of Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research announced that the doctors association in the institute had given notice announcing the strike on June 17.

A release from the management said in view of the plan of doctors to resort to a strike all the services in the OPD and in thelaboratory and elective surgeries scheduled for Monday have been suspended.

The strike had been organised to show the solidarity of doctors in JIPMER with their counterparts across the country to condemn the attack on two medicos in West Bengal.
