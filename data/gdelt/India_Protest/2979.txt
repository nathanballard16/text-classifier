Akhilesh stopped, Samajwadi Party men protest

GREATER NOIDA: SP functionaries protested against the BJP government on Tuesday, hours after party chief Akhilesh Yadav was detained at Lucknow airport in the morning. Around 1pm, a group of SP workers gathered at Moser Baer Chowk in Greater Noida and raised slogans against the ruling party and chief minister Yogi Adityanath. The protesters also tried to burn effigies of the chief minister and Prime Minister Narendra Modi “We sent a team. The protesters raised slogans for 20 minutes. They tried to burn effigies, but were not allowed,” said Munish Chauhan, the SHO of Surajpur. Akhilesh was reportedly detained for about an hour at Lucknow airport and stopped from going to Allahabad. The SP chief took to Twitter to lodge his protest, saying the move to detain him was “another example of how scared the government is”.
