Islamic TV channel faces ban in UK for saying gay people are worse than 'pigs and magicians' should be executed





An Islamic TV station could be stripped of its UK broadcasting licence over provocative comments made about gays and magicians.

Peace TV, based in Dubai, was found to have shown four programmes which breached Ofcom regulations on inciting crime, hate speech and abuse, Daily Mail reported.

The channel which is broadcast on Sky and also airs in the US, said the programmes were based on Islamic teachings but in one of the programmes, presenter Imam Qasim Kha said gay people are worse than pigs and that magicians should be executed.

The show, called Strengthening Your Family - The Valley of the Homosexuals - made reference to homosexual people dying 'from a disease they contracted because they are homosexual' and said homosexuality was 'a very unnatural type of love that is energised by the influence of (Satan)'.

According to the Ofcom report, presenter Imam Qasim Khan said: 'Then they make laws now, the newest and most brash and insane laws, laws that protect homosexuals and even make it legal for them to marry each other.

'Men marrying men. Being on television in front of our children, kissing each other in the mouth, walking down the street, hugging and kissing - this society has gone insane.

Even an animal that is defiled by Islam, the pig - as nasty and corrupted and contaminated as a pig is - you never see two male pigs that are trying to have sex together. That's insanity.

'These are animals. Human beings are supposed to be dignified, they're thinking beings, a human being is supposed to be the thinking being.'

In a statement by Lord Production, who holds the licence for Peace TV, it claimed that the March 2018 show was 'an expression of Imam Qasim Khan's views on male homosexuality, reflecting the teachings of Islam'.

Peace TV, which was founded in 2006 has since been banned in India and Bangladesh.
