Chandrababu Naidu to stage protest for Polavaram on Feb 11

Vijayawada: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said that he would stage a protest demonstration in New Delhi on February 11 demanding the Centre to accept the detailed project report of Polavaram project with revised estimates.

Addressing the meeting of APNGOs here on Wednesday, Naidu said that the Centre had failed to implement the AP Reorganisation Act. Though the Centre did not release funds for Andhra Pradesh, the state government introduced various welfare schemes, he said.

He also said that the state government had set up 20 corporations for welfare of backward classes. The government has given utmost priority to backward classes while the economically backward people in upper classes would also be provided welfare schemes, he said.

The Chief Minister said that the government also wants to introduce one exclusive corporation for drivers’ empowerment. On this occasion, the leaders of APNGOs felicitated former state president P Ashok Babu on the occasion of his retirement from service. Several NGO leaders were also present.
