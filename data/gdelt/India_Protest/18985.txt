Bangladeshi migrants whisked away to north Bengal for pushback

KOLKATA/BENGALURU: The 59 Bangladeshi illegal migrants, detained in Bengaluru and kept in two Howrah safe houses for the last few days while awaiting pushback to Bangladesh , were whisked away before daybreak on Friday after the Bengal government was asked to provide escort vehicles to ferry them to “two locations in North Bengal”.Officials here said cops in Malda district (more than 300 km north of Kolkata) had been asked to remain on standby to help in the “handover” of 22 detainees to BSF outposts in Ardhyapur and Saat Mile. The South Dinajpur border, too, could be an option, officials added.Central government agency officials here refused to divulge specifics about the time and location of the pushback but said “appropriate action will be initiated at the appropriate time”. Karnataka cops, too, were tightlipped about the pre-daybreak journey.Howrah police officials told TOI that the detainees were asked to vacate one of the safe houses (in Howrah’s Nischinda) around 4.30am and board vehicles that headed for Howrah station.The Foreigners’ Regional Registration Office (FRRO) in Bengaluru issued deportation orders for the 59 Bangladeshis after they were rounded up by cops in the Karnataka capital last month.“The state’s role starts and ends with providing logistical support. But this is the first time the state has had to keep detainees in safe houses for a week,” a state government official said. TOI on Thursday morning broke the story about the 59 detainees’ being housed here since last Saturday.The Bangladesh deputy high commission in Kolkata insisted that it did not know anything about the developments. “We have learnt everything from media reports,” an official said.Rights groups have criticised the push-back. “We protested against this inhuman push-back at the Howrah district magistrate’s office on Friday,” Association for Protection of Democratic Rights central secretariat member Ranjit Sur said.
