BJP worker shot dead in Assam

GUWAHATI: A BJP worker was shot dead by two to four unidentified gunmen in lower Assam's Dhubri district on Tuesday. Hundreds of angry villagers took to the streets on Wednesday to stage a massive protest against the killing. The BJP worker, identified as Ruben Roy, was a homoeopathy practitioner. He was gunned down in front of his residence. The attackers fired four bullets, two of which hit Roy and killed him on the spot. Raunak Ali Hazarika, DIG (Western Range), told TOI: "Roy was returning home on Tuesday when he was shot at in front of his residence. A bullet hit him on his upper neck and another on his upper chest."Though speculations are rife that there is a political angle to the killing, local sources said that it may also be a case of personal vendetta. "We are examining all possible angles," Hazarika added. Dhubri goes to polls on April 23.
