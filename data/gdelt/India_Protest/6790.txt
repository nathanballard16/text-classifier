A student from Mancherial, who last year had secured the first position in her Telangana Intermediate 1st year examination has been awarded zero marks in Telugu in the second year though she had appeared for the exam.

Several students across Telangana, including the nephew of Telugu Desam Party Rajya Sabha MP C M Ramesh reportedly committed suicide as they failed in the Intermediate examination.

The parents, who alleged "goof up" in the paper valuation, have been demanding a thorough re-verification of the papers of those who had failed. They also suspect that the papers might have been evaluated by some unskilled person.

In the wake of this heightening tenions in the state capital, Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief Uttam Kumar Reddy dashed a letter to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, drawing his attention to the dozen of suicide in the past four days over the alleged "messed up" in Telangana Intermediate results.

Reddy demanded that the Education Minister and officials behind the mess be sacked immediately and a thorough inquiry be ordered. Some ABVP workers also held a dharna in front of the BIE office at Nampally. Several leaders were taken into preventive custody, a police official said.

Telangana Government Junior College Lecturers Association president Madhusudhan Reddy said a high-level inquiry has to be ordered into the issue and BIE authorities should undertake recounting and re-evaluation of answer papers of students free of cost.

According to Reddy, 11 students who scored over 900 (out of 1,000), 125 with scores between 850 and 900 and about 2,000 who scored over 750 were declared failed.
