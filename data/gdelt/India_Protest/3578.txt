New Delhi, Feb 19: Twenty-two students were taken into custody for protesting outside a college here, demanding expulsion of Kashmiri students, a senior police official said Tuesday.

Protests broke out against Kashmiri students in the city after one of them studying in Sridev Suman Subharti University sent a WhatsApp message to his friends exulting over the terrorist attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama.

The student has been arrested but there have been sporadic protests against Kashmiri students breeding a sense of insecurity among them.

However, Kukreti said there has not been a single incident on Tuesday with no complaints or distress calls received from anywhere.
