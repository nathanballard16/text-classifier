Shatrughan Sinha (Cong.) Faces Protest by His Own Party Workers

Patna: Congress leader Shatrughan Sinha faced the ire of his own party workers on Sunday when he arrived at Sadaqat Ashram, the state headquarters in Patna, to hold a meeting with senior office-bearers of the party to discuss campaign strategy with them.

Sinha, who dumped his party a few weeks ago after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) refused to field him from his old seat of Patna Saheb that resulted in him joining the party of Sonia Gandhi and her son Rahul Gandhi, was faced with unflattering slogans by his own party operatives who accused him of being an outsider who had failed to do anything for the people who had voted for him in the last two Lok Sabha elections.

"Shatrughan Sinha had been missing in action for the last five years. His own party members have compared him to a 'counterfeit coin' that has no real value. He spent his entire life bashing Congress and now he is being treated as one of the most senior leaders of the Congress Party," protestors said.

The protestors claimed they were the members of the Congress Party's extreme backward cell in Bihar.

As reported, Sinha will be facing his former colleague and senior BJP leader Ravi Shankar Prasad from Patna Saheb where voters will go to poll in the seventh and last phase of the election on May 19th.

The actor-turned-politician has renctly earned the ire of many Congress leaders in Uttar Pradesh when he joined his wife Poonam Sinha during the filing of her nomination papers from Lucknow on a Samajwadi Party ticket to go against veteran BJP leader Rajnath Singh.
