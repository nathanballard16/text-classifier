Shankudeb Panda joins SSC protest

KOLKATA: Shankudeb Panda , the former TMC leader who recently joined the BJP has joined the hunger strike of the SSC candidates at the Mayo Road in Kolkata. He has alleged that the government is yet to recruit the candidates who have cleared the SSC exams while relatives of the “political leaders” are getting appointment letters.Successful candidates of the SSC examination, who are yet to receive appointment letter, had started fasting in protest. “The state government has not paid any heed to their demands despite the fact that they have been fasting for past 14 days,” Panda said. A few days back poet Sankha Ghosh had also met the agitators. BJP leaders were quick enough to seize the opportunity and the party’s national secretary Rahul Sinha met them during the fasting.Panda alleged that 600 successful candidates are not being provided with any appointment letter although more than a lakh posts are lying vacant across the state.
