Medical students burn copies of NMC Bill in front of Ker Raj

Protesting against the National Medical Commission Bill (NMC), a large number of medical students in Kerala burnt its copies in front of the Raj Bhavan here, describing it as "anti-poor".

The students raised slogans alleging that the bill, which seeks to replace the graft-tainted Medical Council of India, was "anti-poor, anti-student and undemocratic".

When some of them tried to enter the Raj Bhavan, the residence of Kerala Governor P Sathasivam, police stopped them.

Five medical students are observing an indefinite fast in front of the Raj Bhavan since Wednesday against the bill.

Meanwhile, pro-CPI(M) Students Federation of India (SFI) announced it would observe a state-wide protest day on Friday against the bill as it was "anti-people".

The bill, cleared by the Lok Sabha, was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

Healthcare services were affected in various parts of the country on Wednesday in response to a call given by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) for a 24-hour withdrawal of non-essential services in protest against the bill.
