Pallavaram residents protest against lack of piped water supply

No water received for over 80 days, they complain

Chromepet and Pallavaram residents held a protest on Tuesday to highlight the lack of piped water supply for over two months.

Residents bearing empty cans and placards protested outside the Pallavaram Municipality office. This is the second time the residents are holding a protest.

V. Santhanam, president, Chromepet New Colony Residents’ Welfare Association, who led the protest, said New Colony, which falls under wards 38 and 39, has not been supplied with Palar water since May 29. Though officials of the Pallavaram Municiaplity claim to be supplying 25 lakh litres of water daily from two sources — the Palar river and the Chennai Metro Water Supply and Sewerage Board — residents have not received a single drop of water through the pipelines for over 80 days now, he complained.

No action yet

Residents claimed they were forced to depend on private water tankers for their daily needs. They said despite giving petitions to Municipality authorities, no steps had been taken to mitigate the situation.

S. Natarajan, a resident of Nehru Nagar, said multi-storeyed apartments, with some 120 flats, had not been supplied with piped water for more than six months.

A senior Pallavaram Municipality official said the Tamil Nadu Water Supply and Drainage Board was pumping only 5-15 lakh litres of water a day, and the Municipality was finding it difficult to fulfill needs of all wards. The official said the Municipality would take steps to supply water at least every 15 days in the coming weeks.
