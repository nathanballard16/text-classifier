However, a functionary of the All India Students' Association (AISA) said the group will go ahead regardless.The permission for the protest march was denied due to law and order and traffic issues, the police said.Thursday's march will commence from Red Fort and culminate at Shaheed Park near ITO.

What is the meaning of such challenges to the Opposition. It is gratifying that students and the young generation are liberal, secular, tolerant and exhibit humanism. Is the government challenging these values," he said.Chidambaram's comment were in context of PM Modi's comments at an election rally in Jharkhand where he challenged the Congress to "openly announce that they are ready to give Indian citizenship to all Pakistanis."Around 12 noon on December 18, protesters started marching from Seelampur towards Jafrabad. By the time they came on the Jafrabad main road, there were almost 3,000 people and the police were escorting them. Police barricaded the road and protesters started dispersing when the mob got violent. Several motor bikes were torched, buses were damaged and stones were pelted on the police personnel who resorted to baton charge and fired tear gas shells to disperse the crowd. Several police personnel were left injured, said officials.The Union home ministry on Tuesday released a detailed Q&A answering the frequently asked questions about the new law. It clarified that the Act will not affect any Indian citizen, it has nothing to do with deporting any illegal immigrants living in India and that Muslims from Pakistan-Afghanistan-Bangladesh will still be able to apply for Indian citizenship under other laws.Of the around 600 students residing in seven blocks of the boys hostel more than 90 per cent have left the campus since the university declared holidays following violence during protests. Women hostels too wore a deserted look. Usually, hostels are abuzz with activity during winter break as hostlers stay back to prepare for competitive exams, complete research work and do internships.Senior Delhi police officials met locals from Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Nagar police station in the capital on Tuesday. The peace committee meetings were organised amidst the protests to establish goodwill between citizens and authority.Chinmoy Biswal, DCP South East said, "We held meeting with locals and listened to their perspective as a confidence building measure. We appealed to them to maintain law and order, and not pay heed to rumours."Protests rocked the Osmania University and University of Hyderabad on Tuesday as the students took out torch rallies.
