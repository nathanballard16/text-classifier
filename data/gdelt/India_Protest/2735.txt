'You are senior in stabbing your own father-in-law in back': PM Modi turns Chandrababu Naidu's jibe on its head

This is PM Modi's first visit to Andhra Pradesh after Chandrababu Naidu-led TDP severed ties with the NDA in March last year.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday launched a scathing attack on Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and TDP supremo Chandrababu Naidu, saying he was indeed senior to him in "switching alliances and back-stabbing his father-in-law NT Rama Rao."

Speaking at a rally in Guntur, Modi alleged Naidu was taking him on since the Centre had sought details of every paise given to Andhra Pradesh.

This is Modi's first visit to the state after the ruling Telugu Desam Party severed ties with the NDA in March last year. The Chandrababu Naidu-led party quit the BJP-led alliance protesting the "injustice" done to the state post-bifurcation.

BJP leaders alleged that people were "thwarted," from reaching the venue in large numbers and said countdown would start for Naidu with Modi's rally at Guntur.
