Farmers block railway track to protest against pending sugarcane dues

MUZAFFARNAGAR: Farmers under the banner of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) blocked the Delhi-Saharanpur railway track in Muzaffarnagar to protest against pending sugarcane dues on Tuesday. The managements of sugar mills are not keen on addressing our issues. At this, the angry farmers marched from the collectorate to the railway station and staged a dharna demanding that sugar mills officers be called to the spot. Unless officers from the sugar mills come here to discuss the matter, we will not budge. Later, the protesting farmers locked both the officials in the lock-up located in the court premises for several hours.
