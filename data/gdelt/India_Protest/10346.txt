Delhi Cong. to protest against BJP leader

The Delhi Congress on Saturday said that party workers will hold a demonstration outside BJP leader Subramanian Swamy’s house, on Sunday, to protest against his remarks on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi.

Mr. Subramanian on Friday had alleged that the outgoing Congress president “consumes cocaine” and that Mr. Gandhi would “fail the dope test”. Mr. Swamy’s comments came after Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh’s order of a mandatory dope test for all government employees.

Terming the allegations as “unwarranted and baseless”, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee working president Rajesh Lilothia said that party workers will march towards Mr. Subramanian’s residence to “seek an apology for his condemnable and objectionable remarks” against Mr. Gandhi.
