Doctors stage protest in Hubballi; OPDs closed today, tomorrow

Doctors staged a protest on the premises of the Mini Vidhana Soudha here on Thursday under the aegis of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Hubballi branch, condemning the attack on a doctor at Minto Hospital in Bengaluru.

The doctors wearing black bands raised slogans demanding action against the accused. They also submitted a memorandum to the Chief Minister through Tahsildar Sashidhar Madyal.

IMA Hubballi branch president Kranti Kiran condemned the incident and demanded that the government ensure that these incidents did not happen again.

Senior cardiologist G.B. Sattur demanded a stricter law from the government to prevent such incidents from recurring. He said that no doctor would want to work in such an atmosphere, if relatives of patients manhandled doctors. “If that happened, it will only be a loss for patients and their families and they should understand it. By assaulting doctors what kind of message they are sending to society,” he added.

IMA Hubballi public relations officer M.C. Sindhur said that assaults on doctors are becoming frequent and if such a situation continues, the government in future would be forced to deploy police personnel in each hospital and clinic.

In the wake of the incident, the doctors across Karnataka have decided to go on a strike by shutting down OPDs from 6 a.m. on Friday to 9 a.m. on Saturday.
