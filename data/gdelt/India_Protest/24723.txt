Prakash Ambedkar-led outfit holds protest against CAA, NRC

Activists of the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) on Thursday held a protest here against the Citizenship Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The activists, led by Aghadi leader Prakash Ambedkar, gathered at Dadar TT circle in central Mumbai and shouted slogans against the CAA and NRC.

Ambedkar claimed that besides Muslims, the CAA-NRC will affect at least 40 per cent of Hindus in the country, and its implications are not yet fully understood.

"Tribals, Vanchit Jati and Nomadic tribes are going to be the worst affected by the CAA and NRC. This fight is not about Hindu-Muslims. This is about RSS citizenship versus Constitutional Citizenship, he said.

Meanwhile, Mumbai Police issues an advisory on diversions around Dadar TT circle due to the protest organised by the Vanchit Bahujan Aaghadi.

Dadar TT junction would be shut for all vehicles from 6 am till midnight, the advisory stated.
