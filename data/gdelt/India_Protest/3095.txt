Congress dares KCR to stage anti-Modi protests

Hyderabad: Congress senior leader and TPCC Treasurer Gudur Narayana Reddy on Wednesday challenged Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao to hold protests in Delhi or elsewhere against Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the injustices his government has done to Telangana State.

Questioning the silence of Chandrashekar Rao and other TRS leaders over two major protests held in Kolkata and Delhi by Trinamool Congress and Telugu Desam Party against the BJP government, Gudur Narayana Reddy said by abstaining from anti-Modi protests, the Chief Minister has proved his loyalty to BJP and Modi.

He said that the Congress party has supported both the agitations and AICC President Rahul Gandhi even addressed the day long dharna held by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu.

Narayana Reddy said the BJP government at the Centre has done gross injustice with Telangana by depriving the State with required funds and not honouring the promises made in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act.

The Congress leader also slammed the Chief Minister for the delay in formation of the State Cabinet. “K Chandrashekar Rao took oath as Chief Minister exactly two months ago. He appointed only one minister in his cabinet and deferred the appointment of a full-fledged cabinet. Is this not a dictatorial form of government? Is it not against the spirit of democracy?” he asked.
