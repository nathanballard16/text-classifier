'Wondering if they have common agenda': NCW chief says no difference in Pakistan and Cong's Azad's stance on Article 370

NCW chief Rekha Sharma on Monday created stir by saying that there is very little difference between Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad's stance and that of Pakistan's position regarding India's decision to do away with special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Union government decided to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and also to divide the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two parts, that of Jammu and Kashmir (Union territory with legislature) and Ladakh (Union territory without legislature).

While many opposition parties including vocal critics like AAP and BSP supported government's move, Congress has been upfront in claiming that it would destroy the Constitution of India.

With Pakistan too dubbing the move as illegal, NCW chief Rekha Sharma said,

No difference between Pakistani 's statement and statment from Congress leader #GulamNabiAzad. Wondering if they have a common agenda. — rekha sharma (@sharmarekha) August 5, 2019
