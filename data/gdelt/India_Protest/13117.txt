Ordnance employees to resume work Monday; protests, agitation to continue

BENGALURU: More than 80,000 employees from the 41 ordnance factories that were on a 'tools-down' strike from August 20, which had brought production to a standstill, will resume work from Monday (August 26).The employees had called for a Month-long strike beginning August 20 protesting the Ministry of Defence's (MoD) move to corporatise Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) and the factories operating under it.However, after a series of meetings with multiple government representatives in the past week— the most recent was chaired by secretary (defence production) on Friday— the federations leading the strike have decided to resume work from 6am Monday.A joint decision to this effect has been taken by all the three federations: The All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), the Indian National Defence Workers Federation (INDWF) and the Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS)."Protests and other agitation activities against the Centre's move to corporatise OFB will continue at all factories, but we've decided to resume work from Monday as the secretary-DP has assured continuous bilateral discussions. He also told us that no final decision on corporatisation has been taken," C Srikumar, general secretary, AIDEF, said.TOI has also learnt that a special committee will be formed to have a dialogue with the unions and employees, and that all their concerns will be heard.The unions have decided to write to PM Narendra Modi. Friday's meeting came two days after Rajan Verma, chief labour commissioner, met with the federations and the representatives from MoD. The TOI had reported that Verma, after the meeting asked for a meeting at the ministry level to be organised on priority basis.“...It was felt that there must be bilateral discussions at the level of senior officers, that is, secretary (defence production) so that all the concerns expressed by the office bearers (of unions) can be properly heard and discussed. So it was requested to officials from the MoD present in the meeting to arrange a discussion at the level of the ministry on priority basis,” a source privy to the matter had told TOI.The decision to resume work will be a relief for MoD, given that the impact of a Month-long strike, if it had continued, would've been borne by the armed forces—especially the Indian Army—at a time OFB is already lagging behind in production schedules. Production of arms, ammunition and equipment, and their supply to army has missed the target by 39% and 45%, respectively, as of July 31, 2019.
