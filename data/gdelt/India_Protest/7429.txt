New Delhi: Section 144 imposed outside the Supreme Court following the protest by lawyers and women activists against the procedure adopted to deal with sexual harassment case against CJI Ranjan Gogoi.

Lawmakers and activists who gathered outside the Supreme Court premises to protest against the clean chit given to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi were detained by Delhi Police. The protests came a day after a three-member panel headed by Justice SA Bobde gave a clean chit to CJI in the sexual harassment case against the latter by an employee of the apex court.

The protestors held placards supporting the woman employee, who had accused CJI of sexually harassing her. She had later said that she would not appear before the SC panel as she believed that she was not likely to get justice. The former employee had said that she felt quite intimidated and nervous" in front of three SC judges.

"It was an in-house committee of sitting judges junior to the CJI and not an external committee as I had requested..." she had said in a statement.

"I was asked to narrate my account, which I did to the best of my ability even though I felt quite intimidated and nervous in the presence of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court and without having a lawyer or support person with me," she said.
