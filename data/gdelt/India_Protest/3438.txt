Fire raging in your bosoms is in my heart too: Modi

BIHAR, Feb 17 (Agencies): Prime Minister Narendra Modi was received by Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Patna on Sunday where the PM will lay the foundation stones of various development projects.

Hundreds of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, workers and supporters had gathered in Begusarai, about 130 km from Patna, since morning to listen to the Prime Minister.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asserted that he shared the grief and outrage with the people of the nation in the wake of the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. The prime minister, who was in this north Bihar town to launch a slew of projects, began his speech with a few lines in the local dialect Angika and paid tributes to two jawans from the state who died in the Pulwama attack.

"I salute and pay my tributes to Sanjay Kumar Sinha and Ratan Kumar Thakur. To the people who have gathered here, I would like to say the fire that is raging in your bosoms, is in my heart too," Modi said, evoking a thunderous response from the crowds.

The projects include the Patna Metro Rail project, costing about Rs 13,400 crore, an ammonia-urea complex at Barauni and extension of a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) pipe network to Patna and Muzaffarpur.

The Prime Minister will flag off a new weekly AC train between Patna and Ranchi via Hazaribagh and inaugurate the city's distribution of LPG.

Union Ministers Ram Vilas Paswan, Ravi Shankar Prasad and Giriraj Singh and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi were also present in Begusarai.
