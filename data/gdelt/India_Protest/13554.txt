Police confirms over 300 incidents of protests take place over past three weeks in IOK

In Occupied Kashmir, police has confirmed that more than 300 incidents of protests took place over the past three weeks, with Srinagar topping the list with over 160 such incidents reported from the area.

It is worth mentioning here that before raising of the issue by international media and rights organizations, the authorities in Occupied Kashmir kept denying any such protests and claimed that situation is normal and there is no resistance to the clampdown in the territory.

On the other hand, an Indian soldier from Tamil Nadu's Ariyalur district posted in Jammu and Kashmir died. His family staged a road blockade in New Delhi, demanding the return of his body. The protest provides ample proof that Indian army is dumping the dead bodies of its slain soldiers and reluctant in sending them back home fearing severe backlash.

Meanwhile, the curfew and communication blackout continue in Occupied Kashmir on the 28th consecutive day, today, where people are facing acute shortage of essential commodities including baby food and life-saving medicines.

According to Kashmir Media Service, the Kashmir valley remains cut off from the rest of the world since August 05 due to continued blockade and suspension of internet, mobile and landline services and closure of TV channels. Publication of local newspapers remains suspended.

The shops and business establishments continue to remain shut and schools, too, remain empty of students amid the authorities' claims that they had opened the primary, middle and high schools in the territory.

People of the territory are facing acute shortage of essential commodities including food, milk and life-saving medicines due to curfew and blockade.
