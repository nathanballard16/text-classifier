Ordnance corporatisation: Now, labour ministry intervenes

Production hit

OFB chairman statement

MoD reiterates stand

BENGALURU: Less than 24 hours after the first day of the 30-day strike called by Ordnance employees against corporatisation of Ordnance Factory Board OFB ) kicked off, the Union labour and employment ministry has intervened, seeking a meeting with the striking federations.“The chief labour commissioner has decided to intervene into the matter and therefore proposed to hold a joint discussion on August 21,” the letter sent by the ministry reads. It adds that the decision to intervene comes in the backdrop of “failed negotiation (with ministry of defence ) decision taken by all the three federations jointly…”Sources said that the ministry’s intervention comes in the wake of a perceived impact on ordnance production in the country if the employees continue to strike. A meeting was under way in Delhi on Wednesday evening.The three federations—the All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), the Indian National Defence Workers Federation (INDWF) and the Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS)—have already made it clear that the 30-day strike that began on August 20 was only the first phase of their agitation and that the strike could go on for longer.On Wednesday, the co-ordination committee of defence civilian employees unions in Bengaluru also expressed their solidarity to the 82,000 Ordnance employees. “We have decided to wear black badges throughout the strike period of 30 days and have protest meetings in front of establishments. As a part of the programme, the Controllerate of Quality Assurance-Electronics (CQAL), under the Directorate General of Quality Assurance (DGQA) civilian employees union staged a protest meeting already,” Ravindra Pillai from the committee, told TOI.As was reported by TOI earlier, the unions going on strike—less than 10 per cent of the workers below the officers’ rank were estimated to have attended work on Tuesday—have got significant response from the workers, with a majority of them staying away from work.The impact of the strike, if continued, will be borne by the armed forces—especially the Indian Army—at a time OFB is already lagging behind in production schedules. Production of arms, ammunition and equipment, and their supply to army has missed the target by 39 per cent and 45 per cent, respectively, as of July 31, 2019.The target for 2019-2020 for 41 ordnance factories was estimated as Rs 16,850 crore, and, by the end of July, 33 per cent of this should have been completed. However, as per an internal report accessed by TOI, the value of production up to July 31, 2019 was 20 per cent which is 39 per cent less than the target, while the value of issue (supply) to the Army is only 15 per cent, which is 55 per cent less than the target.OFB chairman Saurabh Kumar, who had, after his August 6 meeting with the workers, written to MoD raising concerns, late on Tuesday issued a statement that read: "It is emphasised that the proposed policy of corporatisation by Government of India is aimed at providing greater flexibility in day-to-day functioning; increased operational freedom and autonomy in decision making, leading to enhanced productivity."He argues that this would enable ordnance factories to respond faster to the futuristic needs of the armed forces and provide an impetus to the export potential of its products. The federations, however, argue otherwise. In a joint statement, the unions termed Kumar’s latest statement as one exhibiting "double standards".C Srikumar, general secretary, AIDEF, said: "The statement made by the chairman is his opinion and does not reflect what the OFB members feel."The ministry of defence (MoD), in another statement issued on Wednesday, reiterated that there was no proposal to privatise OFB, and that there “is no threat to job security of the workers”.“The Proposal is to corporatise OFB. This is being made in the long term interest of the workers to improve efficiency and productivity of 41 ordnance factories. The need for corporatization to make the OFB autonomous and transparent was recognized a long time ago. Three committees —the TKA Nair committee (formed in May 2000), Dr Vijay Kelkar Committee (formed in 2004) and the Raman Puri Committee (formed in April 2015)—have given various recommendations to improve the working of ordnance factories,” the statement read.
