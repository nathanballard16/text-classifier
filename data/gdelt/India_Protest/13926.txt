Phagwara: Dalit activists burnt the effigy of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Punjab's Phagwara district on Saturday in protest against the demolition of a Ravidas temple in Delhi last month.

On the concluding day of their six-day relay fast-cum-dharna at a local tehsil complex, the protesters demanded the reconstruction of the Ravidas temple in Delhi's Tughlqabad area.

Held under the banner of the Bahujan Samaj Front Punjab, they shouted slogans against the BJP-led NDA government, RSS and Modi.

The other demand of the protesters include the release of 96 people who were arrested in Delhi during a protest on August 21 against the demolition, according to Front activist Harbhajan Suman.

The call for the six-day protest was given by Shri Guru Ravidas Sadhu Sampradai Society.
