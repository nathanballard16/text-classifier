Lawyers to resume work from tomorrow

Vadodara: After holding a meeting with the superintendent of Vadodara rural police on Wednesday, the Baroda Bar Association (BBA) took back its call to boycott court proceedings. The advocates had been staying away from the court proceedings since March 18 to protest registration of an FIR against the president of the association and a female advocate at the Vadodara Taluka police station.

The office bearers of BBA were informed that senior officials are supervising the case and no evidence have been found against BBA president Hasmukh Bhatt. “We have been assured that until any evidence is found no action will be taken,” Bhatt said. He added that the boycott has been taken back and lawyers will resume work from March 22.

Even though they will resume work, the lawyers’ body has decided to take out a rally from the court complex in Diwalipura to submit memorandums to commissioner of police and district collector.

The rally has been organized to highlight problem that lawyers have to face at the local police stations and also in the revenue court, which falls under the district collectorate.
