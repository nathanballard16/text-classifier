Protest over Chinese President’s visit to India

Bhubaneswar: Many groups in India are protesting the visit of Chinese president Xi Jinping to India. In the Capital city, Kalinga Sena members protested at Master Canteen and burnt posters of Chinese president. Hemanta Pradhan of Kalinga Sena said that Beijing sharply criticized New Delhi’s recent actions in India-administered Kashmir and supported Pakistan which makes them dangerous for India.

The two most populous nations in the world are home to some 2.7 billion people, over one-third of humanity. The two countries still have unresolved territorial claims. China claims about 90,000 square kilometers (35,000 square miles) in the Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, referred to, informally, as “Southern Tibet.” India, on the other hand, claims sovereignty over 38,000 square kilometers (15,000 square miles) of the Aksai Chin plateau. The disputes occasionally flare up and lead to minor border skirmishes.

Meanwhile, in Chennai Five Tibetans who tried protesting outside the hotel where Chinese President Xi Jinping is expected to stay, were detained.
