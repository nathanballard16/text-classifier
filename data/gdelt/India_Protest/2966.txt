Hubballi advocates refrain from court proceedings, stage demonstration

They carry out protest in response to a call from the Bar Council of India

Seeking a law to protect the interests of advocates, members of the Hubballi Bar Association stayed away from attending court proceedings and staged a protest here on Tuesday.

The protest was carried out in response to a call given for a nation-wide peaceful protest by the Bar Council of India to press for various demands that were raised during the joint meeting of Bar Council of India and the State Bar Council.

The advocates refrained from attending court proceedings and held a peaceful demonstration in front of the new court complex at Vidyanagar here.

Leading the protest, president of Hubballi Bar Association Ashok Baligar, general secretary Guru Hiremath and others submitted a memorandum, addressed to the Prime Minister, to the tahsildar’s representative who visited the protest venue. The protesting advocates also condemned the recent attack on court bailiff in Dharwad and sought steps to protect those in the legal profession. Some of the demands of the advocates included medical facilities, insurance, housing schemes, financial assistance to young lawyers and pension scheme. The advocates opposed the reported move to scrap the Bar Council of India and the State Bar Council and demanded the promulgation of Advocate Protection Act and amendment to Legal Services Authority Act.
