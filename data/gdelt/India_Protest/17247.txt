New Delhi: In yet another brazen attack on police, a group of protesting lawyers thrashed a policeman at Saket Court complex in the national capital on Monday. Reportedly, the policeman was simply patrolling the area when he was stopped and repeatedly slapped by some advocates. The incident has come two days after the violent clash between some lawyers and policemen at Tis Hazari Court.

According to reports, the policeman is a constable posted in Saket police station. He was assigned the task of patrolling the Saket Court complex, one of the courts in Delhi where advocates are striking to protest against the violent clash of Saturday.

While patrolling inside the court complex, the constable was stopped and slapped by one of the advocates present at the spot. When the policeman tried to escape from the area, a helmet was hurled at him by another advocate.

It is also being reported that lawyers have been thrashing autorickshaw drivers who are trying to move towards the main gate of Saket court. Even other policemen who are trying to enter the court complex to monitor suspicious activities are being beaten up by the protesting advocates.

Earlier on Saturday, at least 20 police personnel and several lawyers were left injured while 17 vehicles were vandalised after lawyers and police clashed at Tis Hazari Court complex.

In order to mark their protest against the clash, lawyers in six district courts of the national capital - Patiala House Court, Tis Hazari District Court, Karkardooma District Court, Saket District Court, Dwarka District Court and Rohini District Court - are abstaining from work today.
