Pimpri-Chinchwad crime branch arrests two wanted criminals

The Pimpri-Chinchwad crime branch arrested two wanted criminals on Sunday for allegedly possessing arms illegally.



The accused were identified as Omkar Shingore (19) of Pimple Gurav and Ganesh Mote (20) of Sangvi. Both of them are on the criminal records of Pune police.



The crime branch’s anti extortion cell had launched an area wide hunt in Pimpri Chinchwad on the night of July 20 for the criminals involved in thefts, loots and chain snatching cases that keep police on the toes in the twin town.



The crime branch teams found the duo near Pimple Gurav where they both were allegedly found hiding an illegally possessed arm. When they saw the police team they allegedly tried to hide the weapons near a bus stop, however the police teams caught hold of them.



The Anti Extortion Cell Inspector Sudhir Aspat said, “The duo were wanted in two big cases of loot and dacoity in the Pimpri-Chinchwad area. They will be arrested for those two cases too after primary investigation in this case is over”.



The crime branch recovered two country-made pistols and three cartridges from them. The duo were booked under the Arms Act. The case was registered with the Sangvi police station.



The police further said that two were earlier arrested in a series of cases of dacoity, loot, theft, attempt to murder and more.
