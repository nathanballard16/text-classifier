Congress takes out silent march to protest against ‘insult to Gandhiji’

Killers of the Mahatma have again defamed India: Dikshit

The Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee led by president Sheila Dikshit on Monday held a silent dharna outside Rajghat to protest against the “insult to Mahatma Gandhi on Shaeedi Diwas when some people fired at a portrait of Gandhiji.”

Ms. Dikshit said that the “killers of Mahatma Gandhi” have once again defamed the country in front of the world with their “deplorable action”. She said under the rule of the BJP government at the Centre, the insult to Mahatma Gandhi has created simmering anger among the people of the country, and the Congress party, while strongly condemning it, held country-wide silent protests to uphold the feelings of the people of India.

“Such shameful incidents, which are happening under the communal and casteist BJP rule, had never happened in the country before,” said Ms. Dikshit.

She added that the Congress would spare no effort to uproot the communal, divisive and destructive BJP government from the Centre to take revenge for the insult heaped on Gandhiji.
