Many do politics in Dr Ambedkar's name but PM Modi fulfilled his dream by revoking Article 370: UP CM

Deoghar (Jharkhand) [India], Dec 13 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fulfilled the dream of Dr BR Ambedkar by revoking Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said here on Friday.



"Many do politics in the name of Dr Ambedkar but only Prime Minister Narendra Modi followed his path and fulfilled his dream by scrapping Article 370 from the Valley," said Adityanath while addressing an election rally.

In another rally at Madhupur, he said: "Dr Ambedkar had warned the then Congress government that the Article 370 will give birth to terrorism and separatism ... His words came true later as several damages were caused to Jammu and Kashmir. But now, the region will progress rapidly."

Lambasting the Congress party for opposing the scrapping of Article 370, he accused India's grand old party of speaking the language of Pakistan and said that the party "loves Pakistan more than its own country."

Talking about the citizenship law, Adityanath said: "At a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were trying to give citizenship to the minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Christians and Parsis, parties like Congress, RJD, and CPI-ML were protesting against it."

The Chief Minister appealed the voters to exercise their franchise in favour of BJP candidates in Jharkhand polls as Prime Minister Modi works for every section of the society without creating any differences on the basis of caste, creed and religion. (ANI)
