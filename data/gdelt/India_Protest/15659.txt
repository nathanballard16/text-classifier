Mumbai Aarey forest Updates: Respect SC's decision, won't cut trees now, says MMRC

Govt will respect SC orders: BJP leaders on Aarey forest case

Hours after the Supreme Court asked the government to ensure that no trees are further axed at Mumbai's Aarey Colony, BJP leaders on Monday said the government will respect the orders while expressing hope that the required permission will be granted once the facts are kept before the top Court.

Reacting to the order, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya said the party has always respected the judiciary.

"When the facts pertaining to the development work and environment conservation done by MMRCL is kept before the court on October 21, then I am sure the permission to work on Mumbai metro will be granted," he said.

He asserted that development and environmental conservation will go hand-in-hand.

BJP leader Madhav Bhandari said the top court has not given any specific order.

"Court has given the next date of hearing on October 21. The government will honour Supreme Court directives," he said.

Earlier in the day, a special bench of the Supreme Court on Monday asked the Maharashtra government to ensure that no trees are further axed at Mumbai's Aarey Colony.
