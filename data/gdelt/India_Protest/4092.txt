Hyderabad: Doctors’ protest continues over physical assaults

Hyderabad: Following an allegation of a doctor being physically assaulted by patient’s relatives, junior doctors of Gandhi Hospital here continued their protest on Thursday over the safety and security of the doctors.

Dr Sagar Navani, a PG dermatology student, said, “It is a sensitive scenario where doctors have to face assaults from relatives of patients who do not recover from treatments. They need to understand that it is not the fault of doctors when their patients do not recover. We, as doctors make best efforts to treat the patients.”

The doctors are boycotting their services for the last three days after a patient’s relative physically assaulted a junior doctor of the hospital when his patient did not recover from illness.

“I also demand if the doctors are assaulted, they should be given compensation of Rs 10 lakh to Rs 20 lakh .

People who resort to violence. He must be made responsible for the damages of the property. There is a need of 20- 25 policemen for our protection,” Navani added.

Dr Vasanth, General Secretary of the Gandhi hospital said, “The junior doctor was attacked by a patient’s relative in front of the police. This is very embarrassing to say that no police has come for his protection. Therefore, we along with junior doctors have come forward to protest seeking justice and security to doctors.”
