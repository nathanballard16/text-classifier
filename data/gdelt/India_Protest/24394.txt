UP Police stops Rahul, Priyanka from entering Meerut to meet kin of deceased protesters

Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra were on Tuesday refused entry into Uttar Pradesh's Meerut as they were on their way to meet the kin of victims who lost their lives during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

Stopped by the police near Partapur police station, the Gandhi siblings returned to Delhi.

In a statement, police said Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi were served a notice which said section 144 of the CrPC has been imposed and the situation in Meerut was sensitive.

Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) bans the gatherings of four or more persons.

"They were told that they will be held responsible for any deterioration of the law and order situation in the district due to their visit," the statement said.

Both were conveyed that the police will have no objection if they wanted to visit the district peacefully. They both went back on their own, it added.

As they were stopped at the Meerut border, the Gandhis requested the cops that they, along with another Congress leader, be allowed to meet the families. Their request was, however, denied.

"We asked the police to show us order, but they did not show any order for stopping us and told us to return," Rahul Gandhi said.

While 18 people have been killed during protests across UP, five alone died in Meerut last week.

As the Gandhis returned to Delhi, senior state Congress leaders Imran Masood and Pankaj Malik met the victims' families.

Earlier on Sunday, Priyanka Gandhi had met the families of two victims who died in Bijnor.
