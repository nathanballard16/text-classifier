Rahul Gandhi bats for Mallikarjun Kharge in Bengaluru

Rahul Gandhi says Angel tax will be removed if voted to power.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi toured Karnataka on Monday and held a rally in Kalburgi and a town hall with tech entrepreneurs in Manyata Tech Park.

Rahul batted for his party leader Mallikarjun Kharge and said that he is an incumbent MP in Kalburgi and will contest the upcoming elections. He attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the 'main bhi chowkidar' campaign.

"Modi has turned the whole country into chowkidars after getting caught. Whose chowkidari has he done?" said the Congress president. Kharge is likely to take on former Congress MLA Umesh Jadhav who recently quit the Congress and joined the BJP.

Around 500 tech entrepreneurs took part in the event. Rahul answered questions on Angel tax, Dalit entrepreneurship, eduction, employment from the budding and renowned entrepreneurs.

Rahul said, "I won't promise many things like the incumbent government, but if I do promise one or two , it will be done. Angel tax will be removed if the UPA is voted to power."

"Whatever is happening in Indian institutions are suppressed today. We need to be liberal. That is the first step towards building an ecosystem. That is one way we can tackle China. Rafale is the biggest defence contract in the world. It was started by UPA and manufacturing was supposed to begin in Bengaluru," he said.

Rahul was greeted with 'Modi Modi chanting' by a few techies at the tech park. Police said the sloganeering was engineered by people with vested interest.
