Doctors’ protest in Kolkata: 108 resign in NRS College, 43 others quit too

As many as 108 doctors in Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital (NRSMCH) and 43 in other hospitals resigned on Friday to express solidarity with junior doctors in West Bengal, as a mark of protest.

Earlier in the day, film director Aparna Sen, actor Kaushik Sen along with music director Debojyoti Mishra extended their support to the doctors, and also met them at the NRSMCH.

Protests, demanding protection for doctors, continued on Friday in other cities -- Mumbai, Patna, Hyderabad, Thiruvananthapuram and Jaipur -- resulting in loss of medical services.

NRS Hospital is the centre-stage of the entire doctors' agitation, which has now spread to large parts of the country and brought down healthcare services.

The country-wide protests escalated soon after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee criticised the agitation by the junior doctors in NRS Medical College in Kolkata and urged them to end the agitation.

It all started on Monday soon after a 75-year-old patient died at Kolkata’s NRS Hospital and his family alleged medical negligence.

Frenzied over the patient's death, the family, accompanied by a 200 men barged into the hospital and severely injured a junior doctor Paribaha Mukhopadhyay.
