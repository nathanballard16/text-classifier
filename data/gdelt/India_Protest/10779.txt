Congress, CPM MPs protest against customs duty on newsprint, allege government bid to control media

NEW DELHI: Congress’ Kerala MP TN Prathapan on Monday joined the chorus of leaders registering their protest against the government’s decision to impose a 10 per cent customs duty on newsprint Prathapan demanded a discussion on the decision in Lok Sabha on Monday on grounds that this is the government’s attempt to curb media by imposing excessive production cost upon publishers. Domestic production of newsprints only meets 40% of the current need for newsprint in the country, compelling publishers to import it. The current situation, therefore, is a huge burden on print media, Prathapan said. His request for a special mention on the subject, however, was not allowed by the Speaker.He also condemned the finance ministry prohibiting media persons entering the North Block without prior appointments and alleged it was another act by the State to “control the media”.Last week, CPI Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam had also demanded the withdrawal of imposition of customs duty on newsprint raising the issue as a special mention in the upper House. Opposing the levy, Viswam had said the budget proposal to impose 10% customs duty on newsprint poses a big threat to the industry and may lead to the shutdown of several smaller newspapers."Last year newspapers faced a shock when the cost of newsprint went up by 40% to 60% when China stopped newsprint production as a part of its effort to contain excess pollution. Now this imposition of 10% customs duty will affect their very existence," he said.Viswam also urged the government to approach the matter as an issue of people’s right to information. “People need newspapers to continue, as the mirror of their aspirations. It should not be broken,” he said seeking the withdrawal of the customs duty.
