LUCKNOW: A day after the death of Unnao gang rape survivor, the state capital was wracked by protests and police unleashed a crackdown on demonstrators who demanded swift action against the accused. While Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra rushed to Unnao to meet the victim’s family, SP chief Akhilesh drove down to Vidhan Bhawan with state party chief Naresh Uttam and trusted aide Rajendra Chaudhary and staged a sit-in at the gates to draw attention to injustice.

Earlier in day, Congress workers raised slogans — “balatkariyon ki sarkar nahin chalegi nahin chalegi” — and demanded resignation of the chief minister. They also tried to gherao the UP BJP office. Police used force to disperse agitating workers, many of whom were detained, including senior leaders Jitin Prasada, Deepak Singh, PL Punia and Pradeep Mathur. Hours before the victim’s body was brought to her native village late Saturday, the government gave a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and announced a house for her family. The CM also announced that the case would be fast-tracked.

Cancelling her meetings with party cadre, Priyanka, who arrived in Lucknow on Friday, left for Unnao to meet the bereaved family on Saturday. She tweeted: “While on a social level everyone is responsible for the incident, it exposes the failure of UP government on law and order front.”
