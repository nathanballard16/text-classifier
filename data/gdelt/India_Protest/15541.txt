“I have not violated Section 144. I am standing here alone and not in a group. We (citizens) are requesting police to show us permission to cut trees and they are violently acting and detaining,” Chaturvedi told reporters.

She later tweeted: “I have been forcibly evicted by the cops and I wasn’t even breaking the law! The cops in the car won’t even tell me where I am being taken… this is insane.”

Meanwhile, the Mumbai Police has registered an FIR against as many as 40 protesters under IPC Sections 332, 353, 143 and 149, a police spokesperson told The Indian Express.

Section 144, which prohibits the assembly of four or more people, was imposed by the police this morning.

A Sena leader claimed at least 1,000 trees were felled.

The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) began cutting trees late Friday night, hours after the Bombay High Court dismissed a petition challenging Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s Tree Authority’s decision to fell over 2,000 trees in the Aarey area of Mumbai’s Goregaon for the construction of the Metro Line 3 rake depot.
