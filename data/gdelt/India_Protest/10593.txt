The NIA learnt during the probe that Jarman Singh was highly radicalised and was fighting for the creation of Khalistan. He was associated with a number of people of same ideology through various social media platforms.

A fanatic to the core, he tried to arrange illegal weapons through various channels i.e. by soliciting the same from different people but after having failed in his effort, he planned and executed this incident in association with his associates.
