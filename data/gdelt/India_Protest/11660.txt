CPI plans protests against 'increasing' atrocities on dalits, minorities

The Communist Party of India (CPI) will stage protests against "increasing" atrocities on dalits, tribals, minorities and women from August 7 to 9, according to a party statement on Friday.

The party said that despite strong opposition from the Left and other parties, the BJP government has introduced and passed "draconian legislations" in Parliament and alleged that it was done by using its number in Parliament and through "political manipulations" to exert pressure on some parties.

"The situation in the country is scary. The people do not feel secure. There is increase in the atrocities on dalits, tribals and minorities. The women and children are not safe.

"Those who are the affiliates of RSS-BJP and their outfits are taking the law into their hands and spreading hate and violence. Mob lynching incidents have touched terrific level and trying to dehumanize society," the statement said.

It alleged that the BJP stood "thoroughly exposed" by the involvement of its supporters and also by its protection of those accused.

"In such emerging alarming situation, CPI calls upon all its party units and people to protest against the increasing atrocities, particularly on dalits, tribals, minorities and women, from August 7 to August 9," the statement said.
