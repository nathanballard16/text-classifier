Jamia protest: Schools in South Delhi to be shut on Monday, says Manish Sisodia

In the wake of violent protests in South Delhi over the newly amended Citizenship Act, Deputy Chief Minister and Aam Aadmi Party leader (AAP) Manish Sisodia on Sunday announced that schools in the area will be shut on Monday.

In a tweet, the AAP leader said, "Looking at the grim situation, schools in the national capital's south Delhi district-Okhla, Jamia, New Friends Colony-will be closed."

The development came as the national capital turned violent on Sunday after protests broke out near Jamia Nagar against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which aims to provide expedited Indian citizenship to non-Muslim immigrants from Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The Delhi Police fired teargas shells and lathicharged the protesters. Clashes were witnessed between cops and protesters as the former tried to dispel the crowd using force. Some buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation were also set on fire.

The situation escalated later on Sunday evening after the Delhi Police entered the university campus to quell the protest.

An official from Jamia Millia Islamia University said the cops beat up staff and students.
