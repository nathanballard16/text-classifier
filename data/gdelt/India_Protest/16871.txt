Pakistan will continue its diplomatic efforts for resolving the Kashmir dispute in lines with the UNSC’s resolutions:

Syed Fakhar Imam (Chairman, Kashmir Committee): The black day is observed every year to record protest against illegal occupation of Kashmir by brutal Indian forces. India shamelessly violated the international laws by entering its troops and occupied the valley against the will of the Kashmiri people. It was decided and accepted by India that the issue of Kashmir should be resolved with plebiscite. Any aggressive move from Pakistan can weaken Pakistan's position in Kashmir case at international front. Pakistan is fully committed to continue its diplomatic efforts to resolve Kashmir dispute in accordance with the United Nations resolutions. The brave people of Kashmir have been rendering matchless sacrifices for last seven decades. It is highly appreciable that Pakistan's narrative is endorsed by International community. It is result of our efforts that India is under diplomatic, political and media pressure. The world's perception about Pakistan is changing. The world is now taking notice of Indian human rights violation in Indian occupied Kashmir in unprecedented manner. The international community has acknowledged the fact that Kashmir is a disputed territory and no unilateral decision can change its status. Modi has distorted the secular face of India. China has taken a strong stance against illegal and unconstitutional move of revoking article 370.China has always supported Pakistan's stance at international front .India has exceeded all it limits of brutalities in the held valley. Kashmir is the jugular vein of Pakistan and we would never compromise on Kashmir cause. Pakistani nation stands with their Kashmiri brethren in their legit struggle of self determination. Pakistan is determined to support indigenous freedom movement politically, diplomatically and morally.
