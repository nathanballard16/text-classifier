Kochi hotels to protest against OYO, calls for 48-hour shutdown over price determination rights

By Express News ServiceKOCHI: Sixty-five hotels in the city affiliated to Kerala Hotel and Restaurants Association (KHRA) will shutdown for 48-hours from Thursday protesting against OYO, the online hospitality company. The association alleges that OYO’s policies were steadily destroying small and medium hotels and demanded the return of price determination rights to hotel owners. The hotel owners are organising a protest in front of OYO office at Edappally on Wednesday. “As all the business is through OYO platform, the hotel owners have no option but to lease out the property to Oyo very cheaply,” Rameez said. “Most of the boycott claims are being made by small vested interest groups with no property franchised with or leased to OYO Hotels,” said Ayush Mathur, chief supply officer, India and South Asia, OYO Hotels and Homes.
