British Government to Allow Kashmir Protest in London Despite India's 'Serious Concerns'

In a decision that is set to irritate New Delhi, the British government has hinted that they will not stop Pakistani protesters from holding a march in front of the Indian High Commission in London on 27 October.

The British High Commission in Delhi on Thursday said the right to protest within the scope of the law would be respected and the two countries are in close contact on this issue.

“We respect the right to peaceful protest within the law but strongly condemn any damage caused to diplomatic missions. The safety and security of diplomatic missions in the UK, and their staff, is of utmost concern and we fully recognise our obligations under the Vienna Convention,” the UK High Commission in Delhi stated in a statement on Thursday.

“We have been and remain in close contact with the Indian High Commission in London to emphasise this,” it added.
