F.P. Report

ISLAMABAD: People overwhelmingly boycotted the fourth phase of the Indian parliamentary elections, Monday, as 90 per cent voters stayed away from the polling process.

According to KMS, the polling began at 07:00am and ended at 4:00pm for the second phase of the three-phase elections for Islamabad Lok Sabha seat. Less than two percent votes were cast in Devsar, Kulgam and Homeshalibugh areas of the district.

The polling was marked by complete shutdown in the entire poll-bound Kulgam district. Call for the boycott and strike was given by the Joint Resistance Leadership.

Meanwhile, several youth were injured when Indian troops fired pellets and teargas shells during protests against the fourth phase of drama, enacted by India in the name of parliamentary elections in different areas of Kulgam district.

Hundreds of people, mostly youth, raising pro-freedom, anti-India and anti-election slogans marched towards the polling stations set up in school buildings in Qaimoh, Bugam and Kujjar areas of Kulgam and pelted stones on the polling staff. The troop used lathi-charge and fired teargas, but the protesters refused to budge. Then, the forces opened pellet fire directly on the protesting youth, injuring many.
