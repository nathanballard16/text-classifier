Delhi protests over CAA - top updates

* The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) has now opened a majority of the metro stations in the capital, after shutting down the gates of 20 stations earlier in the day over protests against the amended citizenship law. The DMRC tweeted that all entry and exit gates of Rajiv Chowk, Chandni Chowk, Barakhamba, Mandi House, Pragati Maidan, Lal Quila, Jama Masjid, Delhi Gate, ITO, Janpath, Khan Market, Vasant Vihar and Munirka stations are now open. Gates of Vishwavidyalaya, Patel Chowk, Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan and Lok Kalyan Marg are also open. The Metro stations still shut are Jamia Millia Islamia and Jasola Vihar Shaheen Bagh.

* Delhi Police has denied that Section 144 has been imposed across the capital city. Delhi Police PRO MS Randhawa said: "Section 144 is imposed in northeast district, Red Fort, and some parts of New Delhi. There are rumours that it is imposed throughout Delhi; it is false. Section 144 is imposed in only some small parts of the city." He added that the police were keeping a tab on the social media to check spread of fake news and rumours. "Police is closely monitoring social media. Please share with us if you come across any rumours. We are identifying those who are trying to spread rumours and will take legal action against them."

* Earlier in the day, the Delhi Police detained protesters, including Swarajya Abhiyan chief Yogendra Yadav and former JNU student and activist Umar Khalid, who had gathered near the Red Fort and tried to take out a march despite the imposition of Section 144 of the CrPC in the area. Section 144 prohibits the assembly of more than four people in an area. The police had earlier refused permission for a march to be held under the banner of 'Hum Bharat Ke Log' against CAA from the Red Fort to Shaheed Bhagat Singh Park (ITO). The protestors, which included activists and students, were dragged into buses by the police. Some of the protesters, holding placards and shouting slogans, allowed themselves to be escorted to the buses.

* The Delhi Police had also denied permission to a protest march planned to be held by the Left parties from Mandi House to Jantar Mantar over Citizenship Amendment Act and National Register of Citizens. However, activists and political leaders still gathered in the area and tried to hold a march. Congress leader Sandeep Dikshit and Left leaders Sitaram Yechury, Prakash Karat and Nilotpal Basu were detained and put in a bus at Mandi House.

* In view of the ongoing protests, Bharti Airtel said that the service provider had suspended calls, SMS and Internet services in parts of Delhi. "We're complying with instructions received from government authorities on suspending voice, SMS and data services in certain areas in Delhi. Once the suspension orders are lifted, our services will be fully up and running," Bharti Airtel had said earlier in the day in a statement. Vodafone-Idea and Reliance Jio services were also suspended. As per the Delhi Police order, services were suspended for a few hours for several locations including Old Delhi areas of north and central districts, Mandi House, Seelampur, Jaffarbad, Mustafabad, Jamia Nagar, Shaheen Bagh and Bawana. "In view of the prevailing law and order situation, it is hereby directed that communication of all types i.e. voice, SMS and internet, be halted from 0900 hours to 1300 hours in Cell IDs/BTS (base transceiver stations) covering the following areas for 19-12-2019," said the order issued by Deputy Commissioner of Police, Special Cell, New Delhi.

* Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today appealed the Centre to repeal the CAA. "Today, the law and order situation in the country is deteriorating. There is a fear among all citizens today. I appeal to the Central government to not bring this law but give employment to the youth," Kejriwal said.

* Meanwhile, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued an advisory with regard to Delhi. MHA sources said: “There are inputs of mobilising people from neighbouring states of Delhi. A message has been given to all concerned districts to keep a check on all Delhi borders.” The added: “There were few protests in Delhi in the past 24 hours which were organised by mobilising people through WhatsApp groups but no organization has come up to take responsibility for protest. Few locations identified where officers have asked to provide local intelligence frequently.”
