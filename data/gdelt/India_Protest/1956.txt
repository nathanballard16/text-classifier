Mumbai: Parents, Yuva Sena protest over scrapping of internal marks in SSC

Sainath Durge, Yuva Sena core committee member said, "Many parents have complained that scrapping of oral exams of 20 marks will bring down the marks of students. Several parents of students from Secondary School Certificate (SSC), along with Yuva Sena, held a protest at Maharashtra State Secondary Higher Secondary Education (MSSHSE), Pune on Thursday. They demanded to bring back 20 marks oral exams for language and social science subjects. The SSC introduced a new syllabus this year and also declared a new paper pattern for 100 marks which did not go well with parents of the students. After the protest, the board officials wrote a letter to the higher authorities of the State education department at Mantralaya to come up with some positive decision as students and parents are under stress.
