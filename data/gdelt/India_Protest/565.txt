BJP Rath Yatra tussle: SC seeks WB govt's response, next hearing on Jan 15

New Delhi [India] Jan 8 (ANI): The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued a notice to West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's government, seeking their response on a plea filed by the BJP for permission to hold 'Rath Yatra' in the state.

The matter is scheduled to be heard on January 15 in the apex court.

Also, BJP will inform the state government about their new 'Ratha Yatra' scheduled by Tuesday evening.

A division bench of the Calcutta High Court on December 21 quashed the order of a single bench allowing the BJP to hold its 'Rath Yatra' programme.

The division bench, headed by Calcutta High Court's Chief Justice Debasish Kar Gupta, was hearing a plea filed by the Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government, following which, the BJP had decided to approach the vacation bench of the Supreme Court against the order of the high court's division bench barring the party to hold 'Rath Yatra' in the state.

Mamata Banerjee-government filed the plea after the single bench of the high court had allowed the BJP to proceed with its yatra in the state and directed that the administration should ensure there is no breach of law and order.

The state government had refused permission for the proposed yatra citing intelligence reports of possible communal violence in areas where the BJP planned to hold rallies.

The BJP had planned to hold yatras, beginning from Cooch Behar district on December 6 and moving further to Kakdwip in South 24 Parganas district on December 9 and Tarapith in Birbhum district on December 14. (ANI)
