JRL strongly reacts to governor's assertions

In occupied Kashmir, Joint Resistance Leadership says Kashmiri youth are chased and killed and Hurriyat leaders and activists are detained under draconian Public Safety Act.

According to Kashmir Media Service, leadership comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik said this in reaction to recent assertions made by Governor Satya Pal Malik that there was nothing like Operation All-Out in the territory.

Chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Gilani, while addressing the mourners of the martyr, Zeenatul Islam in Shopian over telephone from his residence in Srinagar reiterated the Kashmiris’ pledge to continue liberation struggle despite the fact that India has crossed every degree of brutality to suppress the freedom struggle.

Senior APHC leader, Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai and other Hurriyat leaders in their separate statements denounced the filing of a charge sheet against seven Kashmiri students in a sedition case by Delhi Police.

The leaders demanded immediate withdrawal of all the charges against the students.

Meanwhile, scores of women staged a protest demonstration at Rajouri Kadal in Srinagar, today, to condemn the arrest and subsequent handover of their relatives to the India’s National Investigation Agency.

Similarly, forceful protests were held in Kastigarh area of Doda against the killing of a Muslim youth, Majid Hussian, by the activists of Hindu extremist organization, Shev Sena, in the area.
