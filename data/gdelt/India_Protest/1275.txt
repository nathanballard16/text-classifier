I say if speaking truth is an act of rebellion then I am a rebel," said the veteran actor-turned-politician.The mahagathbandhan rally is a show of unity by opposition parties against the BJP positioning itself for the upcoming general elections this year."Now that the elections are coming, BJP will divert the attention towards Ayodhya," said Sinha and added that the government has only made promises and failed to perform."Mood of the nation is Parivartan. Parivartan. Parivartan. People want a new leadership,"said Sinha.While Sinha gathered applause in Kolkata for his 'rebel' speech, his party members called for an action against him.BJP's MP from Saran, Bihar, Rajiv Pratap Rudy called Sinha's attendance at therally "opportunistic"."Some people are intelligent in a different way. Some people want to carry stamp of BJP for the facilities that come as an MP. They make it a point to be present at the whip so that they don't lose their membership. At the same time they are so opportunistic that they want to climb the stage and be present at a conclave. BJP will take cognizance of it," said Rudy.
