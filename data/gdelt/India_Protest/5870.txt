Pro-Pakistan slogans rock govt college in Occupied Kashmir

Srinagar: The Government Degree College Ganderbal reverberated with pro-freedom, pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans as the pro-India National Conference President, Farooq Abdullah, arrived in Ganderbal to address a convention of party workers, according to Kashmir Media Service (KMS) on Wednesday.



Quoting eyewitnesses, the report said girls and boys in large numbers studying in the college gathered in the college campus shouting pro-freedom, pro-Pakistan and anti-India slogans as soon as Farooq Abdullah arrived in the area.

The NC President and candidate for Srinagar constituency of Indian Parliamentary elections, Farooq Abdullah, was in Ganderbal with other leaders of the party.

The students did not give a warm welcome to the NC leaders and raised slogans against India as the party members entered into the campus.

A few days ago in Bandipora, the students of the Government Degree College had staged a strong protest against a function held by the Indian Army in the college. The army was forced to leave the college campus after strong resentment from the students.
