Thane: MNS leader Avinash Jadhav and his goons physically assaulted a hotel owner in Virar and also did a Facebook Live to boast about it. In the video which is going viral on social media, the MNS leader can be seen brutally thrashing the owner. Jadhav thrashed Raju Shetty, the hotel owner, for not returning Rs 16 lakh to a local man who is battling cancer. Jadhav says that the local is paying Rs 5000 every day for his medical bills but Shetty, who owns multiple businesses across the state, is not returning him the amount.

“I want to know when he is going to return the money. When the man dies? This is what we do to people who treat locals like this,” Jadhav stated.

Last year in June, Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena workers thrashed a theatre manager in Pune in protest against high prices of popcorn, beverages and other food items in cinema halls.

In a video which went viral on social media, MNS workers were seen slapping, punching and abusing the manager.

“We asked the manager to read news reports, he said, don't know how to read Marathi. Then we dealt with him MNS-style,” Kishor Shinde, one of the MNS workers who had attacked the manager, had then boasted.

The Bombay High Court bench in an observation had said that the price of food items and beverages sold in multiplexes are very high and added that their prices are sometimes even higher than the movie tickets.
