DMK, alliance parties to stage protest for water in Singanallur

COIMBATORE: DMK and alliance parties have decided to stage a protest at SIHS Colony in Singanallur on Friday condemning irregular drinking water supply.“Residents have been receiving drinking water only once in 15 to 20 days. Despite several requests, the corporation has not taken any steps to correct it. Without regular water supply, people are forced to purchase water,” Singanallur MLA N Karthik, who will lead the protest, said after an all-party meeting held at the party’s head office here on Saturday.“Even though there is enough water in reservoirs to supply till the end of June, the city is facing severe shortage as the corporation has failed to utilize the available water properly. As some of the overhead tanks (OHTs) are in bad shape, the corporation has been supplying water without storing it in the tanks. Leaks in pipelines were not fixed for days,” Karthik said.Members of DMK and alliance parties including CPI, CPM, VCK, DK, MDMK and Congress will take part in Friday’s protest.
