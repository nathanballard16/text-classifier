NEW DELHI: India should demonstrate its innovations in the Information Communications Technology (ICT) domain to other countries including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) as a part of digital diplomacy , a top government official Monday said.“Digital diplomacy is a great idea. We should showcase innovations. In the digital domain , India has done a path-breaking achievement,” the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India ( Trai ) chairman Ram Sewak Sharma said.Sharma was speaking at a five-day-long ASEAN-Trai workshop aimed to evolve best regulatory practices.“The innovations that we have done were frugal, scalable, diverse and interoperable, and that can be further developed as a part of the digital economy,” the top official said.However, Sharma believes that in making such an initiative a reality, the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) should take a leadership role.Digital diplomacy is a medium to achieve diplomatic relations between countries with the alliances in the areas of the Internet and new technologies.In September this year, Indonesia hosted a regional conference on digital diplomacy called— the Regional Conference on Digital Diplomacy (RCDD) with 15 countries including 10 ASEAN nations coming together to promote cooperation in reducing the technological and digital divide in the region.“Our purpose is to interact with other countries having diverse experience and learn from each other and develop best practices,” Sharma said, addressing the representatives from nine ASEAN countries.“We have implemented the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with a billion transactions a month, and have a digital identity infrastructure and a lot of innovations have been done,” he said.Launched in 2016, UPI is mobile-only payment system with a total transaction value reaching close to Rs 20 lakh crore.The official added that India has taken a pragmatic approach in the Net Neutrality considering applicability in select scenarios.“Telecom is extremely an important sector, and this is no more a vertical sector. It is a foundation of the economy today,” he added.Sharma believes that the regulatory systems need to evolve in a harmonised manner for an orderly growth and the guiding approaches can be calibrated so as to gauge the impact.Department of Telecommunications (DoT) secretary Anshu Prakash said that telecom, being a core infrastructure has a direct impact on the country’s economy.“With the advent of fifth generation (5G) technology, the linkage will be stronger, and as we move to 5G networks, we are exploring new bands,” Prakash said.Bridging digital divide, according to him, would be a crucial element to reach to growth trajectory with consumer interest being of utmost importance.“We have been supporting bilateral and multilateral initiatives with an objective to enhance cooperation and best practices among member countries,” Trai secretary Sunil K Gupta said.Gupta added that despite a large number of consumers on mobile networks with 90.34% teledensity, connectivity in rural areas still falls behind.
