HYDERABAD: Amidst tight security, students of the University of Hyderabad (UoH) held a protest within the campus against the Centre's decision to revoke special status of Jammu and Kashmir.Nearly 100 students joined the protest which was organised by the All India Students Federation in association with the Students Federation of India and Telangana Vidyarthi Vedika.As the left student organisations started sloganeering, police arrived at the spot and again informed the protestors of imposition of Section 144 within the campus. This was for the second time that the police tried to foil the students protests, leaving many of them irked."Our idea was to only protest in a democratic manner. However, we were yet again asked to disperse thereby curbing our freedom to express and dissent," said a student.Following police orders, the students concluded the protest within 30 minutes to avoid any law and order situation within the campus.
