A purported image of Bagga, sitting inside the police station, was widely shared by BJP members on Twitter and Facebook. (Zee News cannot independently verify the authenticity of the image)

BJP's IT in-charge Amit Malviya alleged that several BJP leaders, including Bagga, were detained in a midnight crackdown on West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's instructions.

“Mamata Banerjee ordered a midnight crack down on several BJP leaders in Kolkata, who were picked up in the middle of night, without due process of law being followed. Tajinder Bagga and several others are now in TMC’s illegal detention. #SaveBengalSaveDemocracy #FreeTajinderBagga,” he tweeted.

She has resorted to lowest kind of politics,she has faith in violence,” tweeted Aijaz Hussain, BJP National Vice President and Incharge West Bengal BJP Youth Wing (BJYM).

The situation continued to remain tense in West Bengal where violent clashes ensued between ruling Trinamool and Bharatiya Janata Party workers on Tuesday. While BJP will hold a dharna against the attack on Shah's roadshow in Kolkata at New Delhi, Trinamool will hold a protest rally against the BJP over the destruction of Bengali philosopher and social reformist Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's statue in Kolkata on Wednesday.
