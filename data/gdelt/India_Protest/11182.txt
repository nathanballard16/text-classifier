Concern over rise in nomadic population

Angul: The rise in the number of nomadic families from Jharkhand, Sonbhadra area of Uttar Pradesh and Nagpur in Maharashtra settling in this town has been a cause of concern for the locals owing to the criminal activities of the former. The district administration, however, is yet to take action against them.

Some of these outsiders earn their livelihood selling articles along the streets. Some others go around the town begging. Most importantly, many of them are allegedly involved in petty crimes and flesh trade.

What surprises the locals is that neither the police nor the district administration seems to be serious about it.

At least 15 nomadic families are residing in PTC ground near Bal Sudhar house by pitching tents. Some such families are also staying at Hulurisingha and Panchmahala areas.

According to residents, some of these people are engaged in stealing articles from houses. Some of their women are seen begging alms with children in their arms. They however do not miss an chance to steal utensils or valuables from houses, said a local.

Similarly, some are allegedly running flesh trade in their shanties. They also have their pimps who bring them customers.

“Police have the information but they do not take action because no complaint has been lodged against them,” said a police officer.

Earlier, the cops used to drive them out of the town after a bank loot incident last year. Later on, they were seen again in the town.

When contacted, Sub-Collector Basudeb Satapathy said he had no info about their rehabilitation. “An administrative decision has to be taken about their settlement,” he added.
