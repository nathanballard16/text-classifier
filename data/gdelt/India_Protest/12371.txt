YSR Congress Party MP Gorantla Madhav had been invited to the launch of Korean carmaker KIA's Seltos in Anantpur district of Andhra Pradesh. It was an event where the carmaker, which had entered into an agreement with the previous N Chandrababu Naidu government for investment in Andhra Pradesh, was left red-faced by the "congratulatory message" by Hindupur MP Madhav.

The Korean automobile giant invited the guest to write a message on the bonnet of the first Seltos car at the event. Madhav wrote, "KIA car rolled out, young people ruled out here, sorry."

Madhav alleged that the Korean carmaker is not employing local youths in its company according to the policy of the Andhra Pradesh government.

Andhra Pradesh government of YSR Jaganmohan Reddy, which came to power earlier this year, passed a law making 75 per cent reservation for the local youths in jobs in private sector.

The Lok Sabha MP from Hindupur had been protesting against the Korean company alleging that it is deliberately not offering jobs to the local youths. Earlier, Jaganmohan Reddy had skipped the launch of Seltos from the KIA factory at Anantpur.

He had reportedly accepted the invitation for the launch but cited prior engagement for not turning up at event, which was attended by state finance minister and other members of the YSR Congress Party.

Recently, police had booked one YSRCP leader for threatening the general manager of KIA motors plant for not employing his supporters.
