PM Modi gives governance push amid anti-CAA protests

NEW DELHI:

Amid widespread protests over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the country, the Modi government has now begun moving to fix other big governance challenges instead.Rounds of intensive meetings have been held over the last five days to assess the government's sector-specific five year plans, relook at ground implementation and impact of key policies and decide on comprehensive steps needed to boost investment and infrastructure in the country. Even as protests peaked last week, an unruffled PM along with his entire council of ministers chaired the 230 member meeting to take stock of the recommendations made by the ten Sectoral Group of Secretaries.On Monday, December 23, the PM chaired the first meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Investment which is learnt to have discussed ways to boost private investment, especially in telecom, power, aviation and mining. There was also serious discussion on creating an enabling mechanism to encourage banks to lend more freely to the private sector to snap out of the sluggishness in the economy.The message to the bureaucracy is also clear and starkthere is a need to bring in immediate and implementable measures keeping ground reality in mind.Top government officials across ministries are, in fact, busy re-working their five year plan proposals—more so after the action packed stock taking exercise that the PM took only last week.And with good reason.In the nine-hour-long meeting on December 21, only two of the ten groups could get through as threadbare discussions were held on the issues at stake- Infrastructure and rural agricultural sectors. While the Modi council of ministers usually keeps a low profile, the December 21 meeting saw them come out in full form even as PM Modi mostly listened through from 10.30 am to 7.30 pm.While the first round of discussions on Infrastructure went by more or less smoothly with plans discussed for bullet trains and intensive road expansions, I&B minister Prakash Javadekar is learnt to have opened up the field first with a suggestion to launch a vigilance enquiry into the losses of national carrier Air India . It was, however, the discussion on rural and agricultural sectoral group that had every other minister speak up. The 100 slide presentation made it past just about the 12th or 15th slide on agriculture when Minister of State for Statistics and Implementation Rao Inderjit Singh made an interjection questioning how farmer suicides and agrarian crisis were being reported across villages if everything was on track as was being indicated in the presentation. Singh is said to have asked for clarifications and ground reality assessments rather than a presentation of tall aspirations alone. Textile minister Smriti Irani is learnt to have raised issues regarding jute farmers of West Bengal and deficiencies in the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism. Food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal made an impassioned argument on how one should reconcile India topping the charts on milk, wheat and rice production and a farmers’ crisis at the same time.Minister after minister followed grilling top government officials on the farmer distress and agrarian crisis and the solution to it.Farm loan waivers were discussed but Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman pointed out that this was far from a prudent financial proposal. Commerce minister Piyush Goyal, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar, Petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan, MoS Finance Anurag Thakur- all had much to say on the state of rural agricultural economy.Ahead of the January 4 meeting- the second round of Sectoral Group of Secretaries with the Council of Ministers- each ministry has its task cut out---to draw up a five year plan for the government that passes muster.
