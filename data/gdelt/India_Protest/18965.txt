Sanskrit professor boycotted at Indian university ... because he is Muslim

One would think educated individuals would know better than to boycott someone over their religion. Yet time and again, we've seen Islamophobic narratives among people in power, but had hope in the younger generation in countries across the world. Students in the northern Indian city of Varanasi, though, diluted that thin string of hope we had left in humanity.

At the beginning of November, students at the prestigious Banaras Hindu University (BHU) in the Indian city staged a sit-in outside the vice-chancellor's office in protest of a Muslim professor hired to teach Sanskrit, the ancient classical language of Hinduism.

Two days after Firoz Khan took the job, members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, a rightwing student organization with a Hindu nationalist ideology, demanded his dismissal from the post.

"A Muslim cannot teach us our religion," one placard read. To Khan, the discrimination he faced was disheartening, to say the least.
