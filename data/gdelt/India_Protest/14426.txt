Mumbai: Of 2.7 lakh students, only 36 have bus pass

Out of 2,71,218, only 36 Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus passes has been issued to the civic school students this year. Last year we organised a two-day protest outside the BMC education department for the delay in providing ID cards, bags, uniforms. Meanwhile, Mahesh Palkar, education officer of education department said that it would not affect students. "BMC students in school uniforms are never charged by BEST conductors," he said, adding all the details of students and their bus pass forms have been already provided to the BEST. If this was being followed by the BMC, the need for bus service or free bus passes would not have arisen.
