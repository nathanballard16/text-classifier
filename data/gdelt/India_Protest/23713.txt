Time to undo mistakes, feel Assam’s BJP MLAs

GUWAHATI: With protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act raging across Assam , CM Sarbananda Sonowal on Saturday chaired a state BJP legislature party meeting where it was unanimously felt that it was time for the government to undo “mistakes” and “face the unexpected situation”.“We don’t want to say that there were no mistakes on our part… We have made mistakes and may have hurt the sentiments of the people. We are facing an unexpected situation and we have to face it,” said Sootea MLA Padma Hazarika . The MLAs unanimously decided to implement three broad points to re-build the confidence of the state’s people.Later, the state cabinet adopted several resolutions to protect the language, identity and land of the indigenous people of Assam to allay their fears that CAA will put their existence at stake.The cabinet decided that the government will bring in two bills — one for protecting the land rights of the state’s indigenous people by prohibiting them from transferring land rights to non-indigenous people and another for making teaching of Assamese language compulsory in all schools up to Class X — in the February session of the assembly. However, schools in two hill districts, Bodo-majority areas and the Barak Valley , will be kept out of the ambit of the mandatory Assamese teaching.
