Nobody claps with one hand, says SC on Tis Hazari violence

The Bench – which also included Justice KM Joseph – said strike by lawyers to protest against the last week’s clashes was not the solution to deal with it. A parking dispute between a cop and a lawyer had triggered clashes between the two sides at the Tis Hazari court last Saturday. Lawyers in all six district courts in Delhi have stayed away from work ever since to protest against the clash. Delhi Police personnel too had organised a protest at the Delhi Police Headquarters in the capital demanding action against lawyers who beat up their colleagues. "If the concerned cop is not arrested within 10 days, the issue will be taken on all India basis," Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said in a statement.
