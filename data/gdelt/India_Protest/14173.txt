"We will not accept NRC in Assam. They have silenced the people of Assam by using police administration but they cannot silence Bengal," she said while addressing an anti-NRC rally here. She led the protest march from Sinthi More to Shyambazar five-point crossing, in North Kolkata to protest against the NRC in Assam.
