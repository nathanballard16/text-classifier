New Delhi: Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad was, on Saturday, sent to judicial custody for 14 days by a Delhi court in connection with the violence in Old Delhi's Daryaganj area over Citizenship Amendment Act.

Azad, who was arrested earlier today for allegedly instigating the Jama Masjid crowd and provoking violence at Daryaganj area of Delhi, sought bail from Tis Hazari Court, citing that there was no evidence against him.

However, the police opposed his bail plea, saying that he may threaten witnesses and his judicial remand is necessary for the sake of law and order. Subsequently, the court dismissed his bail plea and remanded him to 14-day judicial custody.

Earlier, a lawyer had requested the court to direct the investigating officer to give details of Azad's whereabouts.

Meanwhile, the court also sent 15 people, who were arrested in connection with the violence in Daryaganj, to two-day judicial custody.

The Bhim Army chief was on Friday denied permission for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar against the new citizenship law, however, he carried out the march, defying the police order.

Police and paramilitary personnel stopped Azad and a group of protesters near Delhi Gate while they were moving towards Jantar Mantar from Jama Masjid, which led to violent protests. The protestors set a car ablaze and vandalised a few other vehicles while police resorted to lathi-charge and used a water cannon to quell the protests and bring the situation under control.
