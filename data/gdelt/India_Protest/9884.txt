SFI stages protest against draft nat’l education policy

Coimbatore: Members of the Students Federation of India (SFI) on Tuesday protested the draft National Education Policy 2019, saying it was aimed at privatizing the education sector and against students from poorer socio-economic backgrounds.

Around 40 SFI members demonstrated in front of the Government Arts College and attempted to burn a copy of the draft policy. They were, however, stopped by police.

Dhinesh Raja, district SFI president, said they wanted the draft policy to be translated into all regional languages by the respective state governments and made public so that all stakeholders, who didn’t know English, could access it and offer their views.

“The policy was drafted over a period of one and half years. But they have given stakeholders less than a month to provide suggestions. This seems as if the Centre is in a haste to introduce the policy. At least six months must be given to people to come up with suggestions,” he said.

Pointing out that the policy intended to bring in a nationalized entrance exam for undergraduate arts and science courses, they said that would adversely affect the rural students. According to them, the draft policy overlooks government schools and lays more emphasis on private schools.
