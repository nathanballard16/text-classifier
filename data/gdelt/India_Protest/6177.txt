Congress claims new expose in notes ban

The Congress on Tuesday alleged that officials of the Modi government continued to exchange old notes after demonetization in lieu of hefty commissions. Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal, showing a 'sting' operation, alleged that an employee of the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW) who is posted at the Cabinet Secretariat, was involved along with an IndusInd Bank employee.

Releasing a video at a press conference at the Congress headquarters, which showed the exchange of banned notes with the new currencies at commissions ranging between 15% to 40%, Sibal said the Modi government looted the people.

"It is another proof of how Modi-led government looted the people. They banned these notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denominations during demonetization in 2016. But this video shows the exchange of demonetised notes with the new ones in a government godown in Maharashtra," Sibal alleged.

In the videos, the R&AW employee is seen mentioning BJP president Amit Shah twice. The alleged modus operandi is that the notes are printed abroad and then brought into India via the Hindon Air Force Base at Delhi border.

Sibal added that "a team of government officials drawn from different departments" were involved in the alleged racket.

Sibal demanded that action be taken on the matter. "The alacrity with which the Enforcement Directorate (ED) searches people, it can easily arrest these people and tell the country what the truth is. Will the ED, CBI, and the government arrest these people," he asked.

Responding to these charges, union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad told reporters in Patna that the BJP will seek legal remedies. "Kapil Sibal has made false allegations on our party president Amit Shah and we will take legal action," said Prasad.
