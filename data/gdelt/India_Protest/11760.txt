‘Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge’, Israel says on India friendship

NEW DELHI: To the tune of the “Sholay” hit, “Yeh dosti hum nahin todenge”, India and Israel exchanged virtual friendship bands on World Friendship Day on Sunday.The Israeli embassy here tweeted a set of photographs of PMs Narendra Modi and Benjamin Netanyahu with the background score of the Amitabh Bachchan-Dharmendra song on Sunday. “May our ever strengthening friendship and growing partnership touch greater heights,” Israel tweeted.In response, Modi tweeted in Hebrew, “Thank you and wishing a Happy Friendship Day to Israel’s wonderful citizens and my good friend Netanyahu. India and Israel are time-tested friends. Our bond is strong and eternal. May the friendship between our nations grow and prosper even more in the times to come.”The India-Israel partnership, much closer than is demonstrated, will be on full display when Netanyahu visits India in September. Apart from defence and security ties which have grown closer, water issues are expected to dominate the discussions. Israel has developed huge expertise in water conservation and desalination, and these are things the second Modi government is very keen on.
