Manipur: SIT to probe student death

IMPHAL: A Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up to investigate the death of a student in a school hostel as an interim measure until the CBI takes up the case, Manipur inspector general Clay Khongsai said here on Sunday.The minor was found hanging in her hostel room, feet touching the ground and leg smeared in mud, on July 18. Soon after news of her death spread, Thangmeiband locals protested against "government inaction" and set up a Joint Action Committee. Her parents have not claimed her body yet as a sign of protest. Under public pressure, the government decided to begin the process to hand the case over to the CBI. There had then been a growing demand by protesters that until that is formalized, an SIT should investigate the case.
