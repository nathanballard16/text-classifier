Ayodhya verdict: Mumbai, other parts of Maha peaceful

Mumbai was calm and peaceful and no untoward incident was reported from any part of the metropolis following announcement of the Supreme Court's Ayodhya verdict, a senior police official said.

The Supreme Court in a unanimous verdict on Saturday cleared the way for the construction of a Ram Temple at the disputed site at Ayodhya, and directed the Centre to allot a 5-acre plot to the Sunni Waqf Board for building a mosque.

Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), which prohibits the assembly of five or more people at any spot, has been in force in the metropolis since 11 am and will continue for another 24 hours, a Mumbai police spokesperson said.

An official also attributed the calm to the denial of police permission to hold any kind of rally or procession in the wake of the verdict.

Police presence, with over 40,000 personnel on the ground, is at its highest across the city and would continue despite no incident being reported, he added.

"Security is in place for Eid-e-Milad festival that falls on Monday," he said.

The CCTV network is being monitored round the clock and posse of State Reserve Police Force, Riot Control Police, Rapid Action Force have been deployed, he said.

Online activities are being monitored to curb rumour- mongering and mischief while Maharashtra police have uploaded videos and messages on social media appealing for calm and peace.

Other parts of Maharashtra were also peaceful, he added.
