Congress is not going to enter into any alliance: Sheila Dikshit

New Delhi: Hitting out at the AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal, Delhi Congress chief and former Chief Minister Sheila Dikshit said: “When did AAP ever come to us? If he (Kejriwal) wants an alliance, then he should directly speak to me.” She also accused AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal of making “empty talks” on the issue of full statehood for Delhi in view of the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. It must be noted that Chief Minister Kejriwal has announced an indefinite hunger strike from March 1 over his demand for full statehood for Delhi.

Dikshit, who is the Congress’s Delhi unit president told on Sunday “Kejriwal is making empty talks about full statehood for Delhi and nothing will come out of his rhetorics. If he was serious about full statehood for Delhi, he should have taken up the issue four years ago. He is raking up the full statehood issue with an eye on the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections,” Indian Express quoted her.

Sheila Dikshit also reiterated that Congress will not have any alliance with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) for the Lok Sabha polls. She claimed the people of Delhi are fed up of “hollow promises” of Chief Minister Kejriwal and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and wanted Congress governments at the Centre and in Delhi. She told this while addressing party workers at Mehrauli and Badarpur areas.
