However, the poll panel had asked him to approach local authorities.On Sunday, the party got a green signal to conduct a rally, but on April 23, instead of 24. The MNS had already warned that they would go ahead with their plan even if they were denied permission.Though MNS is not contesting, Raj Thackeray has been an aggressive voice on the campaign trail against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, rallying for their ouster. His rallies have been getting a lot of crowds whether in Satara, Ichalkaranji or even Pune.Addressing a rally in Satara, Raj warned saying the 2019 elections' outcome would decide whether democracy would survive or pave the way for autocracy in the country. "I had said that last time. Maharashtra was not cautious then. However, I appeal to the people of the state to remain alert now as this election is very important since it will decide whether the country will move towards democracy or dictatorship," he said.
