On August 7, the National Security Council had decided to downgrade diplomatic relations and suspend bilateral trade with India after neighbouring country revoked the autonomous status of India-held Kashmir.

India earlier this week repealed article 370 and 35A of its constitution, revoking autonomous status of Indian-administered Kashmir. Article 370 granted special autonomy to Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir. It allowed the state’s assembly to make its own constitution and gave it autonomous state power.
