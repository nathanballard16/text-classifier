Thousands of people have been detained in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) over fears of unrest since New Delhi stripped the disputed region of its autonomy two weeks ago, government sources said.A magistrate speaking to AFP on condition of anonymity said at least 4,000 people were arrested and held under the Public Safety Act (PSA), a controversial law that allows authorities to imprison someone for up to two years without charge or trial."Most of them were flown out of [Occupied] Kashmir because prisons here have run out of capacity," the magistrate said, adding that he had used a satellite phone allocated to him to collate the figures from colleagues across the Himalayan territory amid a communications blackout imposed by authorities.





Indian authorities reimposed restrictions on movement in major parts of Srinagar on Sunday after violent overnight clashes between residents and police in which dozens were injured, two senior officials and eyewitnesses said.



In the past 24 hours, there has been a series of protests against New Delhi’s August 5 revocation of the region’s autonomy. This followed an easing in curbs on movement on Saturday morning.
