However, due to non-coordination by the Ahmedabad station officials, Navjivan Express left Surat station at about 11:25 as the Surat station officials were not given information about the arrival of the passengers through Gujarat Express.The passengers came at Surat railway station in Gujarat Express to found that the Navjivan Express had already departed. The passengers protested outside the station manager’s office at Surat railway station and demanded to call back Navjivan Express.Talking with TOI, station manager CM Khatik said, "Actually, we were not given any information by our counterparts in Ahmedabad regarding the passengers boarding Navjivan Express from Surat.
