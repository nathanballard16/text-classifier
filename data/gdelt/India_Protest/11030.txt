Parleys in Karnataka for floor test

Bengaluru, July 20

With the fate of the HD Kumaraswamy led wobbly coalition government in Karnataka likely to be decided on Monday, political parties are silently preparing their strategy and plan of action for the crucial floor test.

While hectic parleys continued in coalition circles with leaders of both Congress and JD(S) holding meetings, state BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa too met party MLAs and held discussions on the plan of action when the Assembly resumes on Monday.

In a face-off with Governor Vajubhai Vala, the JDS-Congress government had defied the two deadlines set by him to demonstrate its majority in the Assembly Friday itself.

“Despite the Governor’s directive to conclude the confidence motion process on Friday itself, unnecessarily time was wasted by allowing legislators to speak for hours. They don’t have majority and are committing the sin of wasting time,” Yeddyurappa told reporters here on Saturday.

Claiming that the Congress-JD(S) coalition had just 98 legislators and BJP 106 MLAs, he said after having lost the majority, Kumaraswamy has no moral right to continue as CM.

Minister DK Shivakumar said “We have said we will prove majority on Monday, we will do it...we are confident that we will get the support. We are not buying any time.”

Kumaraswamy and the Congress have moved the apex court, accusing the Governor of interfering with Assembly proceedings when the debate on the trust vote was on and sought clarification on its July 17 order causing hindrance in issuing whip to the legislators.
