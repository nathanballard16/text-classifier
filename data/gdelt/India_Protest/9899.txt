Hotels in Kochi on 2-day strike to protest against OYO

Kochi: Protesting against hospitality startup OYO, the Kerala Hotel and Restaurant Association (KHRA) has called for a 48-hour strike from Wednesday in Kochi. Small and middle-size hotels in the city won’t be accepting any new bookings during the strike. However, pre-booked customers won’t be affected, office bearers of the association said.

The strike is called against OYO, alleging their policies are resulting in loss for small and medium sized hotels. OYO is making the hotel owners bear the charge of room rent discounts given to customers. Earlier OYO would bear the cost of the reduction offered and the original amount was given to hotel owners. But since last December, OYO has forced hotel owners to bear this discount, they said.

Even though the hotel owners tried to inform the issues faced by them to OYO, they never accepted the offer for discussions.

A protest march will be taken out to OYO office in Edappally, they further added.

KHRA has called for the strike demanding the intervention of centre-state governments to protect the hotels, to give back the authority to decide room rents to hotel owners and to make the money transactions transparent.

The press meet was attended by association district president Azeez Moosa, district secretary T J Manoharan and samara samithi chairman Muhammad Rameez.

Legal action against business interruption

Those who obstruct OYO’s business in Kerala will be dealt legally, said OYO Hotels and Homes India South Asia chief supply officer Ayush Mathoor.

Those who are calling for the strike have no link to hotels. Some people have raised threat of cancelling agreement and not taking bookings. These will be seen as violation of agreement and dealt legally, he said.

An order from Delhi High Court was obtained against obstructing OYO business. We are more concentrating on economy and business growth, he added.
