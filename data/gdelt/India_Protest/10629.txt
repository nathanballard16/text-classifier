Worli residents oppose BMC’s parking fines

There was another protest against the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) new parking fines, in Worli on Thursday. Residents said their societies do not have parking space, and demanded that the policy be scrapped.

There is a growing clamour against the fines on unauthorised parking in Mumbai. A similar protest was held on Thursday morning outside the BMC’s G South ward office in Parel. The agitation was led by NCP leader Sachin Ahir.

The demonstrators came to the ward office with their cars and demanded that since the BMC had marked their streets as no-parking zones, they be allowed to park there. While they were not allowed to do so, they held a meeting with assistant municipal commissioner D. Jain.

After the meeting, Mr. Ahir said people, who have been living for years, have no place to park their cars. “Now, if they park somewhere else and if the cars are stolen, who is responsible? We brought our cars here and asked them to allow us to park here. We also demanded that the penalty be reduced. They agreed in principle but the ward office has no right to reduce fines. They will forward our demand to the municipal commissioner.”

Residents of Napean Sea Road have already registered their opposition, and said they will consider moving court. On Tuesday, residents of Mahalaxmi Cooperative Housing Society in Worli had staged an agitation.
