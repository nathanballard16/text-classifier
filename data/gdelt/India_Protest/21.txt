Economic offenders who fled will be brought back: PM Modi

He told ANI in an interview that the government is using all means, including diplomatic channels, to ensure that fugitives are back in the country to face the law.

"...those who have fled the country earlier, they have not returned. But those who fled during this government, they will be brought back, today or tomorrow," Modi said when asked whether fugitives like Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi and Vijay Mallya will ever be brought back.

"Those who have stolen India's money, they will have to compensate for each and every penny," he added.

"Why did they need to flee after all? Had there been governments like earlier, the same friendship would have continued, 'if you want to loot, loot, if you want to grab, grab'. There would have been no need to flee," the Prime Minister said.

He said they had to flee because they would have to adhere to the laws here.

"Those who have fled, there are international laws to bring them back. Those are being implemented. For such fugitives, we have made stringent laws. Seizure of property is happening even in foreign countries. Therefore, we are using all tools available with the government," Modi said.

He also added that India had entered into agreements with various countries and after 2019, "we will get real-time information from different countries. So black money will be brought back.
