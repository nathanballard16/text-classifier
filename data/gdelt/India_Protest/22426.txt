Bengaluru: With protests going in different parts of the state by various groups against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) Former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah urged the city police to act sensibly and responsibly.

Taking to Twitter Siddaramaiah wrote, ” Though Police force is acting on the behest of the ruling dispensation, I strongly urge them to be Indians and Humans first.”

“Act sensibly and act responsibly!!” he added.

On Wednesday, December 18 Siddaramaiah said that the CM BS Yediyurappa led state government is suppressing the people’s right to protest by using powers vested to the government as per section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code.

“After a series of assault on the values enshrined in the Constitution, it is time to take away the Right to Peaceful Protest through Sec144. I never expected Yediyurappa to play to the tune of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I thought he was more progressive and inclusive,” tweeted Siddramaiah.

“Shame on you Yediyurappa,” he added.
