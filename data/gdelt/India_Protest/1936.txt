‘Modi has tricked Anna Hazare also’

Destructive interference in institutions continues, alleges Chandrababu Naidu

As social activist Anna Hazare launched hunger strike on Wednesday over the ‘non-fulfilment’ of assurances by the Centre, Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu lashed out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “tricking” the social activist.

“Mr. Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party deceived not just Andhra Pradesh but Mr. Hazare also,” he said during a teleconference with party leaders and cadres on Thursday. Mr. Modi cheated the social activist by making a false promise that Lokpal would be appointed and now his attitude had compelled Mr. Hazare to launch hunger strike. The government had failed to act despite giving Mr. Hazare an assurance nine months ago.

Three of India’s premier institutions came under sharp public scrutiny in the recent past. After the Reserve Bank of India, the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Supreme Court, another institutional degradation was in the offing. The National Statistical Commission (NSC) is now in the news. Two of its members resigned as they did not like Mr. Modi’s ‘egoistic and self-centred attitude,’ he said.

The institutions that are unable to bear Mr. Modi’s ‘destructive interference’ were openly protesting, he said, adding there was dissatisfaction over Mr. Modi’s style of functioning across the country. Stating that the Governor’s speech reflected the development witnessed in A.P. in the last four years, he said the TDP was concerned about State interests alone. The party was determined to achieve rights of five crore people.

‘People on TDP’s side’

More than 2.14 crore people were the undisputed strength of the TDP. About 95 lakh DWCRA women, 54 lakh pensioners, and a strong force of 65 lakh party cadres were strengths of the party, he said, adding, it was an indication that the upcoming elections would be ‘one-sided.’ The TDP had to become an “unchallengeable force” in the days to come, he added.
