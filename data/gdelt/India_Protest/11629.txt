Violent protests in Uttara Kannada district: BS Yediyurappa may quash cases against 2,000 Hindu youths

BENGALURU: Hot on the heels of cancelling Tipu Jayanti as a state event, chief minister BS Yediyurappa has initiated steps to withdraw cases against about 2,000 Hindu youths in connection with the violent protests across Uttara Kannada district in December 2017.In a note issued to the additional chief secretary, home department, S Selvakumar, secretary to the chief minister, stated he had been directed by Yediyurappa to take necessary action on a plea from Karwar MLA Roopali S Naik. Official sources said the cabinet is likely to withdraw the cases.In her letter to Yediyurappa, Naik said more than 150 cases under the IPC and Information Technology (IT) Act were foisted on about 2,000 Hindu youths in connection with the violence that erupted after the body of Paresh Mesta was found near Shettikere Lake, Honnavara on December 8, 2017. The BJP had claimed Mesta — allegedly murdered — was a party worker.Mesta’s death resulted in communal tension in Uttara Kannada district and the state government eventually handed over the case to the CBI.The incident occurred a few months before assembly elections. In February 2018, then BJP national president Amit Shah met Mesta’s father in his house and assured him of all support. Chief minister Siddaramaiah was fiercely criticised by BJP leaders, who claimed Karnataka was not a safe place for Hindus under his leadership.Reacting to Thursday’s move, Dinesh Gundurao, KPCC president, claimed the decision was based on BJP’s communal considerations.“Look at the letter of the MLA. It says cases registered against Hindu youth be withdrawn,” Gundurao told reporters. “Let them withdraw cases registered against innocents no matter which religion they follow, but the letter shows that they want to withdraw cases against a particular community.”Yediyurappa had on Tuesday cancelled celebrations of Tipu Jayanti as a state event. The order came after he received a letter from Virajpet MLA KG Bopaiah asking him to consider cancelling the celebrations as it had led to violence in the past, especially in Kodagu.
