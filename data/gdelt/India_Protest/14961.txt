Delhi Police stopped a proposed protest demonstration against "50 days of Kashmir lockdown", scheduled to be held at Jantar Mantar on Thursday.

The protest was slated for Thursday and was being organised by Punjab-based Shiromani Akali Dal (Amritsar) led by Simranjit Singh Mann, Dal Khalsa and Tamil Nadu-based Naam Tamilar Katchi and Tamil National Movement, Naga Students Federation with the Delhi-based Committee for Release of Political Prisoners.

A leader of the protest, Kanwarpal Singh of the Dal Khalsa said the Delhi Police informed them about the development at midnight and handed over an order issued by Eish Singhal, Deputy Commissioner, New Delhi district. The order said permission for the protest cannot be granted as there was an “apprehension of breach of peace due to proposed demonstration”.

The march and rally was to protest the “continuous, unrelenting disrespect for human rights and political rights in the Kashmir valley”, Singh said.

“It is our endeavour to break the overall silence on Kashmir and bring to focus the plight of the people of Kashmir due to the unilateral abrogation of the special status of the people and the state,” he added.
