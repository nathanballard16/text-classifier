New Delhi: While Prime Minister Narendra Modi champions the cause of Swachh Bharat (Clean India), his efforts were ‘trashed’ by the members of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s youth wing. The Delhi unit of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) had on Sunday held a rally at the national capital's Ramlila Maidan.

After the event, the Ramlila Maidan was found to be littered with thousands of plastic bottles, wrappers, and filth, making the historical ground look like a garbage dump.

The organisers of the event did not bother to clean up the place after the function was over. What is striking is that this callousness on the part of the organisers came despite the fact that some notable BJP leaders like Meenakshi Lekhi and Vijay Goel had attended the rally.

Speaking to Times Now, Delhi-based environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said the BJP, which calls Clean India as one of its flagship programmes, does not really follow the principle.

“A clean India would be the best tribute India could pay to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150 birth anniversary in 2019,” the PM had said while launching the Swachh Bharat Mission at Rajpath in New Delhi on 2nd October 2014. The PM himself initiated the drive at Mandir Marg Police Station by picking up the broom to clean the dirt. The campaign aims to achieve the vision of a ‘Clean India’ by 2nd October 2019. But the visuals captured on Ramlila Maidan tell another story.
