HYDERABAD: The Sindh United Party (SUP) has called for removing Benazir Bhutto's name from Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) while also demanding stringent accountability of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leaders. On a hot and humid day on Tuesday, hundreds of workers of SUP walked for more than a kilometre in their protest march in Hyderabad, led by the party's president, Syed Jalal Mehmood Shah, to the press club.



"In more than 10 years of the PPP's rule, the Sindh government received thousands of billions of rupees, most of which were embezzled," alleged Shah. He said that the BISP was launched on the recommendation of the World Bank but the PPP's former federal government named the programme after the party's former chairperson.



"Why shouldn't Prime Minister Imran Khan not remove her name from BISP? He should". Demanding accountability of the PPP Co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari and his associates, he said that the reigns of Sindh government have remained in the corrupt hands and that the province has been made notorious for corruption in whole country.



"The 18th Constitutional Amendment, which was meant to provide autonomy to the provinces, is being used to plunder the public money." He demanded that the National Accountability Bureau's (NAB's) laws of plea bargain and voluntary return should be abolished and replaced with stringent punishment.
