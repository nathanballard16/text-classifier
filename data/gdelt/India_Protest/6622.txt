62.3% polling in 8 UP Lok Sabha seats

Lucknow, April 18 : Eight Lok Sabha constituencies that went to polls in the second phase of polling on Thursday in Uttar Pradesh recorded an average voter turnout of 62.30 per cent till 6. p.m., according to the Chief Electoral Officer (CEO).

The percentage is expected to increase further since voters were still in queue in many places when the figures last came in.

According to CEO L. Venkateshwarlu, the highest polling percentage (68.77) was reported from Amroha whereas Agra recorded the lowest of 59.6 per cent. He said that there was no case for a repoll in any of the constituencies.

Polling was held on Thursday in Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Hathras, Fatehpur Sikri, Nagina, Amroha, Mathura and Agra.

Glitches in EVMs were reported from over 150 polling stations and polling had to be stopped for some time till the EVMs were replaced.

Two villages in Fatehpur Sikri did not cast their votes in protest against lack of development. Efforts to persuade the voters proved futile.

The CEO denied complaints that certain caste groups were prevented from casting their votes.
