7 ABVP workers protesting against manhandling’ of Union Minister Babul Supriyo, injured in police lathi-charge

Kolkata: Seven Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) activists were injured Monday here in the police baton-charge during a march against the last week’s ‘manhandling’ of Union Minister Babul Supriyo at the Jadavpur University.

Heavy security arrangements were made on the three-kilometre stretch between South Kolkata’s Golpark locality and the Jadavpur University with the Left student organisations and a large number of faculties gathering at the campus to prevent the ABVP activists from entering the premises.

The ABVP began its ‘March to Jadavpur’ from near Swami Vivekananda’s statue at Golpark. The activists were carrying banners against ‘fascist’, ‘anti-dalit’ and anti-democracy communists’.

When they were stopped by the police near Jodhpur Park, they tried to break through the barricades and even climbed the guard walls.

According to the police, several cops were injured in the brick-batting. The police resorted to lathi-charge to disperse the protestors. ABVP leaders claimed seven activists were injured in the police action. The protesters then began a sit-in in Jodhpur Park area.

Later on a top police official in Kolkata approached the leaders of the ABVP. He told them that a delegation of 10 persons can go to the university can go to the vice-chancellor and hand him their demands and protest letter. However, ABVP representatives turned down the offer.
