Velmurugan moves HC for star campaigner status

Tamizhaga Vazhvurimai Katchi (TVK) president T. Velmurugan has filed a writ petition in the Madras High Court to quash an order passed by Chief Electoral Officer Satyabrata Sahoo on March 29 refusing him the ‘star campaigner’ pass, which he sought for campaigning in support of the Secular Progressive Alliance led by Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK).

The petition has been listed for hearing before a Division Bench of Justices S. Manikumar and Subramonium Prasad on Friday.

In his affidavit, the petitioner claimed that his representative had been trying to approach the CEO’s office since March 22. However, the officials did not let him meet the CEO, citing one reason or the other.

Finally, the petitioner himself met the CEO on March 27 and made a request for issuing star campaigner pass. On April 1, he was shocked to receive an order passed by the CEO on March 29 stating that the last date for application for the star campaigner status expired on March 26. Therefore, his request could not be conceded.

The petitioner said it had been done wantonly to prevent him from campaigning for the DMK-led alliance. He alleged that the rejection order had been passed at the instance of the ruling party because he had protested against the State and the Central government scheme.
