Trans Indian gurus make history in Hindu parade

Trans Indians drew the biggest ever crowd at a Hindu procession in Allahabad, India this weekend.

Hundreds of transgender Indians, also known as kinnars, joined the ceremony, according to the Times of India.

They wore bright colors, spangly jewelry, and danced to disco beats.

The procession took place ahead of Kumbh Mela, one of Hinduism’s most holy festivals. Millions gather at the at the holy confluence of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati.

Hinduism’s 13 Akharas (or congregations) take part in processions ahead of the event.

This year’s procession in Allahabad was led by trans religious leaders.

Fight for rights

While a landmark Supreme Court ruling in 2014 recognized transgender as a third gender, the community remains marginalized.

In fact, the Upper House of the Indian Parliament on Tuesday (8 December) was debating a transgender rights bill.

Trans Indians and their allies have been urgently rallying against the bill.

They want a parliamentary committee to review the law.

India’s lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, passed the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Bill last month. It was supposed to protect their rights.

But, the transgender community has slammed it. They claim it infringes their rights rather than protecting them.

Activists organized large-scale protests in Indian cities over the weekend.
