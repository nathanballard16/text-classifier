CAB protest: AGP to move Supreme Court against Citizenship Act, workers stage protest in Guwahati

Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) - an ally of the BJP-led Assam government will move to the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, that aims to provide Indian citizenship to Hindu immigrants from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.

The party has decided to file a writ petition before the Supreme Court against the newly contentious amended act.

AGP chief and Assam agriculture minister Atul Bora on Sunday, while expressing concern, said the party will meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

"This Act will bring a big threat to the Assamese language, culture, civilization. We have appealed PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah not to implement it in the Brahmaputra valley of the state. We will meet the prime minister and union minister soon and to raise our concerns. We have decided to move the Supreme Court against the act. A four-member team of our party has already left for Delhi to file a writ petition before the apex court," said Atul Bora.

The AGP will stage a demonstration against the Citizenship Amendment Act across the state on December 16 and the district committees will send a memorandum to the prime minister and union minister through the deputy commissioner of the respective districts, said sources.

It is to be mentioned that, the AGP had snapped ties with the BJP when the Modi government had passed the contentious citizenship bill in the Lok Sabha in 2018.

Before the 2019 general elections, the AGP had again joined the NDA and fought the polls as an alliance partner of the BJP.

AGP has 12 MLAs and there are three ministers from the regional party in BJP-led Assam government, including the party president.
