‘Make re-evaluation of scripts free’

SFI demands burdened teachers be relieved

Activists of the Communist Party of India(M)-led Students' Federation of India (SFI) demonstrated in front of the Prakasam Bhavan here demanding a “grand supplementary examination” for students.

Undergraduate students, led by SFI district secretary Ch.Vinod, took out a procession from the Ambedkar Bhavan shouting slogans in support of their demands, including that answer scripts be re-evaluated free.

Lecturers evaluating answer scripts were overburdened, SFI district president K.Chinnappa Reddy said, adding that only 30 answer scripts per day should be evaluated as against the present 90 to avoid discrepancies.
