Asaduddin Owaisi fumes at Congress protest banner

Hyderabad: AIMIM Chief and Hyderabad MP Asaduddin Owaisi today slammed the Congress leadership for putting up a banner during a protest program against the Election Commission on Assembly polls.

The MIM supremo also sought to know whether the Congress accepts a similar banner comprising AICC Chief Rahul Gandhi and newly appointed General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi. The banner has the caricatures of Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and Owaisi that added to his anger. The Congress staged protest against the Election Commission citing irregularities during the recent Assembly polls.

The banner shows voters as Draupadi, ECI as Dhritharasthra and ERO, DEOs and CEO as Dusshasana. The banner of the Congress shows that KCR and Owaisi are looking at Draupadi (democracy in Telangana) being stripped. Owaisi alleged that the Congress was playing cheap dramas as it could not digest its unceremonious defeat in the Assembly polls. The Congress was crossing its limits, he charged.
