Daman MPrsquos assets see twofold growth in five years

Surat: The Union territory of Daman may not have witnessed much development in last five years, but its two-time sitting MP Lalu Patel’s assets have witnessed a two-fold increase during the same period.The election affidavit filed by Daman BJP MP, Lalu Patel, shows that his assets have increased from Rs13 crore to Rs27 crore in the last five years. For all these years, Lalu Patel has done nothing. He is always in the front protesting Gujarat Police’s action against wine shop owners,” said a Congress leader of Daman. Daman administration has done little to improve infrastructure facilities in Daman. Except for weekends and public holidays, Daman remains deserted as it has very little to offer to tourists except for cheap liquor.
