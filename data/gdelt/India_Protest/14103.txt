Madhya Pradesh: BJP holds statewide protest against Kamal Nath govt

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) [India], Sept 11 (ANI): The Madhya Pradesh unit of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Wednesday held a statewide protest against Chief Minister Kamal Nath-led Congress government in the state.

BJP's MP unit president Rakesh Singh was arrested along with several party workers by the police here.

"This protest was held to get justice for the public of Madhya Pradesh. We planned a statewide protest of the BJP workers in every district today for this purpose," Singh said.

"The loans of the farmers have not been waived off in the state. There is no unemployment allowance for the youths of the state while electricity rates continue to be very high," he added.

Singh further said the state was earlier identified by its good roads while now the condition of the roads has degraded. He also said that law and order is in doldrums in the state.

Former Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also joined the protest at Vidisha while Leader of Opposition in the MP Assembly Gopal Bhargava joined in the protest at Jabalpur. (ANI)
