Sitting Fatehgarh Sahib MP Harinder Singh Khalsa, who was suspended from the Aam Aadmi Party in 2015, on Thursday joined the BJP.

Khalsa joined the saffron party in the presence of top BJP leadership, Union Ministers, including Arun Jaitley, Hardeep Puri and the general secretary (organisation) Ram Lal.

While Jaitley unsuccessfully contested from Amritsar in the last elections, the name of Puri was doing the rounds for the prestigious constituency the BJP wants to wrest back from the Congress.

Khalsa started his career as an English lecturer at the GGN Khalsa College in Ludhiana. In 1974, he joined the Punjab Civil Service and in 1974, the Indian Foreign Service (IFS).

In June 1984, while posted in Norway, he resigned in protest against the Operation Bluestar. As the Congress government filed some cases against him, he stayed in Norway, running a small eating joint and working as a postman there.

He returned to India in 1990, after being assured that the cases against him would be dropped.

During 1990-91, he served as the Chairman of Punjab Human Rights Organisation, an NGO, which highlighted the alleged excesses committed by the state government during the anti-insurgency operations.

During 1991-2003, he also served as a secretary of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandak Committee (SGPC).

The AAP had in August 2015 suspended party MPs Dharamvira Gandhi and Khalsa from primary membership of the party and initiated disciplinary proceedings against them. He had won the 2014 Lok Sabha polls on the Aam Aadmi Party's ticket.
