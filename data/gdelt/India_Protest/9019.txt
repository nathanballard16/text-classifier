New Delhi: In the latest development in the Kolkata doctors strike, members of Resident Doctors' Association (RDA) of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) also expressed solidarity with their counterparts in West Bengal.

The AIIMS doctors worked wearing helmets and bandages to register their protest against ‘worsening of violence against medical doctors in West Bengal’. The AIIMS doctors went on with the regular duty but it was a bit of shock to the patients as they saw the doctors wearing helmets and bandages.

Some doctors also placed placards which read out the solidarity with the doctors in West Bengal. The doctors who are striking in Kolkata and Burdwan allege that their safety is often compromised as kin of patients hurt them if the patient does not recover from an ailment despite the doctors trying their best to save them.

Earlier in the day, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had threatened the doctors on strike and said that if they did not end the strike, she would throw them out. Banerjee also talked to the patients and their families. She also sent a few patients to private hospitals and added that the patients would be provided the necessary facilities free of cost.
