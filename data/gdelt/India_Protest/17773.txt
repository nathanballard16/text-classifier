Quick Exit

On Monday, HRD Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal was trapped inside the AICTE campus for three hours as JNU students protested outside against a hike in hostel fee. However, one dignitary at the JNU convocation ceremony was able to leave unnoticed and much before everyone else. University Chancellor and scientist V K Saraswat, who also attended the convocation at the AICTE auditorium, was smuggled out by breaching the AICTE boundary fence adjoining the JNU campus.

Celebrating Gurpurab

The Kartarpur corridor inauguration may be over, but South Block is commemorating the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev in a grand manner. To mark the anniversary, embassies across the world have organised many activities such as Baisakhi celebrations, photo exhibitions, international conferences, seminars and screening of documentary films on the life of Guru Nanak.

UNESCO is partnering in translations of Guru Nanak’s teachings in many international languages. Indian embassies will be unveiling special commemorative stamps issued by the Department of Posts and presenting them to foreign dignitaries.
