Farmers block rail traffic, sent to jail

Members of the BKU (Sidhupur) are staging a protest dharna in front of Jaito police station for the last about three-weeks. They are demanding the cancellation of FIRs against farmers for burning stubble. Intensifying their protest on Thursday, the farmers tried to block the Delhi-Ferozepur rail link, but police stopped them. As the farmers declined to avail the right to get bail in this case, they were sent to the judicial custody. The protesting farmers are demanding cancellation of FIRs registered against them for burning stubble across the state.
