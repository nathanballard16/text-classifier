Residents of Sumbal town of north Kashmir’s Bandipora district held a protest march on Monday against the arrest of a local boy by Delhi Police.

Last week, a special cell of Delhi police arrested Hilal Ahmad Bhat of Wani Mohalla Sumbal.

“A joint team of Delhi police’s special cell with local police of Sumbal and a unit of army picked up Hilal from his home on January 23 without letting us know the reason of his arrest,” said one of the relatives of Hilal.

He said they assured that he will be released soon after questioning but on contrary to that he was shifted to Delhi without our knowledge.

Following a call issued by the Traders’ federation and sumo drivers’ association, a complete shutdown is being observed in sumbal against Bhat’s arrest. No traffic is seen on roads and all shops and business establishments are closed.

Meanwhile, scores of people along with the family members of Bhat staged a protest at main chowk Sumbal and marched towards the town to demand his release. They said Hilal is innocent and we demand his immediate release.

However, a police official said that Hilal was arrested in case FIR No. 17/2019 under section 25,27,54,59 Indian arms act and 16,18,18-B of unlawful activities (Prevention act) by special cell Delhi police and was shifted to Delhi.
