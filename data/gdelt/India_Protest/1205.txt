Despite the actor looking dapper in a black brocade printed velvet bandgala, the stray had all eyes on him as he walked the catwalk.

Both Malhotra and actress Diana Penty were on the stage but didn’t let the dog get in the way of doing their job.

The audience cracked up at the scene-stealing canine before authorities chased him off stage.

The Bollywood star spoke to TimesNow about the show that fell on his 34th birthday where he said he was happy to spend it on the catwalk.

“Actually, I did my celebration before, last night, so I thought then and for Gudda (Rohit Bal), I’ve spoken to him, we were planning something a few years ago, to walk for him and I couldn’t, for the next show in Bombay, I’ll do it; the date came out to be my birthday, so it’s okay,” he said.
