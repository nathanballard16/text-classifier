CPM politburo member G Ramakrishnan, Coimbatore Lok Sabha member P R Natarajan and district secretary of CPI V S Sundaram participated.Ramakrishnan said communist parties had suggested that the Citizenship Amendment Act should not mention any religious identity and include all neighbouring countries. “But the Centre did not accept these. Now they have brought the Act and next they will bring in the National Register of Citizens. These moves are an attack on minority people of this country,” he said.
