Hyderabad: Activists of the Bajrang Dal, a right-wing fringe group, on Thursday allegedly “forcibly” married off a couple in a park in Hyderabad, as part of their ongoing protest in Telangana against the celebration of Valentine’s Day. The activists found the couple together inside the Kandlakoya Oxygen Park in Hyderabad.

The Bajrang Dal in Hyderabad had pledged to take out rallies and protests before shops, pubs and offices in Hyderabad on Valentine's Day as a mark of protest. Calling Saint Valentine a "terrorist”, Bajrang Dal activists had claimed that they would marry off couple found celebrating Valentine’s Day on February 14 in Telangana.

As per reports, the police took the Bajrang Dal activists in preventive custody after they made the couple tie the knot in the park. However, cops said that no complaint had been filed in the case as the couple said that they had “willingly” married.

Bajrang Dal, which is the youth wing of the Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP), had earlier claimed that they had plans to send over 30 teams across the state to keep an eye out on young couples out celebrating Valentine's Day in Hyderabad. The group had also declared that they would also protest outside offices in the city that celebrate the day, besides regular places such as parks and shopping malls.

Meanwhile, the Hyderabad police had stated that they had beefed up the security throughout the city to tackle such protests, adding that its teams would patrol the streets and would take action if anyone violated law and order.
