JNU students protest against Jitendra's lecture on Art 370

NEW DELHI, Oct 3 (Agencies): Some students of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) on Thursday staged a protest to oppose a lecture programme of BJP MP Jitendra Singh on revoking of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

JNU students linked to the All India Students' Association (AISA), a left-wing student organisation, raised slogans against Singh's presence on campus and also against the central government for its August 5 decision to scrap special status of J&K granted under Article 370.

The situation turned unruly after RSS-affiliated ABVP students staged a counter-protest on the campus.

The JNU had organised a talk on "Abrogation of Article 370: Peace, Stability and Development in Jammu, Kashmir, and Ladakh" in which Singh, a senior leader from Jammu and Kashmir, was invited to deliver a lecture around 4 p.m. at Convention Centre of the university.

While the AISA students gathered outside the Convention Centre of the university raising slogans, several student supporters of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP) reached there and began counter-protest, leading to heckling and manhandling by rival groups.

A section of students raised pro-Kashmir slogans, while ABVP activists countered with "Kashmir se Kanyakumari, Bharat Mata Ek Hamari".

In September, BJP MP Babul Supriyo faced a protest at Jadavpur University in Kolkata, West Bengal by Left students during which he was heckled by some students.
