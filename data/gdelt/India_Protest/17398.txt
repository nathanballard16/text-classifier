Delhi Police protest: At India Gate, families of cops say time to keep them safe

“Scared” for their families’ future, over 50 people, including children, held a candlelight march at India Gate to support police personnel seeking justice from authorities. As over 2,000 policemen staged a protest outside the police headquarters, their families reached India Gate at 3 pm.

Phule Ram, a retired sub-inspector and father of a policeman said, “We want the accused lawyers to be arrested. My son works day and night for police; the force must do something for safety of their men.”

A 10-year-old boy stood in the corner of the group, holding a placard that read: “Protectors need protection”. The child’s father works as a head constable. He said, “I am with my mother and sister to protest against people who haven’t helped my father and his friends…”

The child was joined by 8-10 other children who held placards with “Police waalo ka tabadla waapis liya jaaye.”

“My husband wants to help his colleagues, but also must continue with his duty. When I saw a video of the Saket assault on a constable, I was angry, but later I felt scared. What if the same thing happens to my husband? The court and government won’t help him as well… Why is action being taken against only the policemen,” said Ritu, wife of an inspector posted with Delhi Police.

Another woman, Pratima Singh, said, “My husband has made a lot of sacrifices for police in the last 20 years. He doesn’t come home for Diwali, Holi… But now, the authorities have to help us… How can people expect police to keep them safe if police aren’t safe themselves?”
