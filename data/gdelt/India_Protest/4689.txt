Monks of Tashi Kyil Monastery spread message of compassion, peace, and love

The monks of Tashi Kyil Monastery are in Evansville spreading a message of compassion, peace and love.

The monks are creating a world peace sand mandala at the Yoga 101 studio in Evansville.

The monks will be working on the Mandala daily until the closing ceremony.

On Friday morning at 9:30, they will take the Mandala to the downtown Riverfront and it will be ceremonially dispersed into the water.

“When we’re making this kind of sand mandala it is also to present about impermanent. And when we’re done with this sand mandala and it is put in the river and wherever the river is carrying the message about compassion and peace and love.”

The monks will be visiting local schools and a scout troop. They’re also hosting two educational sessions about the Buddhist perspective on dying.

The group will tour in the US for nine months.
