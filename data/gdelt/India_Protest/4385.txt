AAP leaders protest outside Ashu’s house seeking his removal, Mayor pleads

Ludhiana: Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders on Tuesday staged a protest near the official residence of Punjab Civil Supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, seeking his removal from the state cabinet for his alleged involvement in the multi-crore ‘CLU’ scam. If they have some substantial proof they should make it public instead of doing such protests. Climing that people in Punjab and his party would not accept such malpractices, he demanded that the the chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh should immediately sack the tainted minister to re-instill a semblance of peoples’ faith in the established democratic system. The opposition parties are raising hue and cry over nothing. As AAP leaders were protesting against the cabinet minister, mayor Balkar Sandhu was seen convincing the leaders, including deputy LOP Manuke to call off the protest.Meanwhile Ashu was in Chandigarh on Tuesday said the protesters have been politicising the issue without any proof.
