‘Complete NH; Save Lives’ | U T Khader flags off 42 km Congress padayatra in DK

Mangaluru, Jan 14: The leaders and workers of Congress party in Dakshina Kannada today began a 42 km padayatra to protest against the stopping of four-laning work of National Highway (NH)-75.

The slogan of the three-day padyatra is ‘Rastriya Heddari Poornagolisi; Janara Jeeva Ulisi (Complete National Highway; Save Lives).

Dakshina Kannada district in-charge minister U T Khader, flagged off the march at Nelyadi bus stand in the presence of hundreds of workers and dozens of leaders in the morning.

Explaining the reason for holding the padayatra, former minister B Ramanath Rai said the four-laning of NH-75 from BC Road to Addahole was started during the UPA regime, however, due to several reasons, the contractor did not complete the work, and it was only half-done.

“This half-done work will prove fatal for motorists in the coming days, and many hazards are expected to take place in the rainy season. The stopping of work is not only a threat for development, but many lives may also be lost,” he said.

In the evening, there will be an open public protest at Uppinangady at 4.30pm. Former MLA Vasanth Bangera will participate in the protest.

On Tuesday, the padayatra will resume from Uppinangady and end at Mani Junction with a public meeting and protest.

On Wednesday, the padayatra will culminate at BC Road for the valedictory programme. It will be presided over by KPCC president Dinesh Gundu Rao who will be joined by B Narayan Rao, the MLA from Bidar, and other Congress leaders.
