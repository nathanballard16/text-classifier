Constitution Day: Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh lead protest outside Parliament as PM Modi addresses joint session

Opposition parties held a protest before the Ambedkar Statue in Parliament on Tuesday as they boycotted Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Constitution Day speech.

Congress president Sonia Gandhi led the protest and read out the Preamble to the Constitution. Former party president Rahul Gandhi and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh were also present.

The Opposition parties are protesting recent developments in Maharashtra, where a BJP-led administration was sworn in on Saturday even though a prospective alliance of opposition parties had chosen a chief minister and seemed poised to claim the right to form a government.

The Congress said it resolved to save the Constitution's soul by not allowing it be mortgaged to am "autocratic government blinded by the insatiable lust for power".

The Supreme Court, meanwhile, has said the new Maharashtra government must face a floor test by 5 pm tomorrow.

There will be no secret ballot, and a pro-tem speaker will swear in MLAs.

Senior Congressman and advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi said the Supreme Court had given the nation "a gift" on Constitution Day.
