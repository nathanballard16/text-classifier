Violent clashes erupted in a congested Delhi neighborhood on Tuesday as widespread protests were held in parts of India against a controversial new law to give citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from neighboring countries of Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

Largely peaceful demonstrations were held across the country in solidarity with Delhi students whose protests turned into violent clashes when police entered a university campus in the Indian capital on Sunday night.
