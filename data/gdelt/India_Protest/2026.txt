JD(U)'s former MLA joins Congress ahead of Rahul Gandhi's rally in Patna

PATNA: Bihar’s ruling JD(U) leader and former MLA Rishi Mishra, who is grandson of former railway minister Lalit Narayan Mishra, on Saturday left Nitish Kumar ’s party and joined the Congress in the presence of AICC in-charge for Bihar affairs Shaktisinh Gohil and state Congress chief Madan Mohan Jha at the state Congress office Sadaqat Ashram here.Rishi had won assembly by-poll as JD(U) candidate from Darbhanga district’s Jale constituency in 2014 but lost to BJP’s Jibesh Kumar in 2015 elections. Rishi’s father Vijay Kumar Mishra, who won assembly polls from Jale seat in 1990 on Congress ticket and in 2000 and 2010 as BJP candidate, is currently a nominated member of the Bihar Legislative Council.“Today, the country requires an energetic leader like Rahul Gandhi,” Rishi told reporters after joining his grandfather’s party just a day before the Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s “Jan Akanksha Rally” in Patna’ Gandhi Maidan.Being a JD(U) candidate, Rishi had contested the 2015 assembly elections from Jale seat against the BJP. “I contested the last assembly elections canvassing against the BJP and its leaders. Now, I am being asked to work with the JD(U) ally BJP against whom I campaigned. What answer I will give to my peoples in the constituency if I support the BJP in the next elections. For the last 18 months, I had been living in dilemma. I have no problems with CM Nitish Kumar but it was difficult for me to work with an ally like BJP,” Rishi told reporters while explaining the reasons behind leaving the JD(U).However, a JD(U) senior said Rishi left the JD(U) because he was not sure of getting the party ticket from Jale seat in the 2020 assembly election in alliance with the BJP as the sitting MLA Jibesh Kumar hails from the BJP. In Congress, he might have a chance of getting a ticket for assembly polls, the JD(U) senior, who didn’t want to be identified, told TOI.State Congress media in-charge H K Verma said, Rishi joined the Congress along with his supporters. They all were offered primary membership of Congress by the party state chief Jha.
