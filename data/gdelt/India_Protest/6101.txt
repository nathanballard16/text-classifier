Devendra Gundappa was arrested on Saturday, two days after the child’s body partly decomposed body was found.

The youngster, who has not been named, disappeared on April 4 in Mumbai, India, after being sent to buy tea from near her home.

Her mother told local media: “She had come back from school and was sent to buy tea. She never came back. We had been searching for her since then.”

Local police reports suggest Gundappa had lured the child to an empty room near his home where he raped, battered and strangled her.

The 35-year-old then dumped his victim's body in a gutter between two stalls in the public toilet, weighing it down with a concrete slab.

Four members of Gudappa’s family, including his wife and his mother, were detained by police for obstructing the investigation and threatening officers with violence.

According to local media, the suspect had a previous conviction for sexual offences against a minor in a neighbouring village.

News of the child’s murder sparked large protests in the Juhu neighbourhood, with large crowds gathering outside the police station to demand justice.

The protestors were calmed with assurances from the police commissioner that the suspect would face the full force of the law.

Gudappa appeared at a local magistrate court and has been remanded in custody until April 15.
