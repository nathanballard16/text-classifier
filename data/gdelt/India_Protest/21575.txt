Tamil Nadu's main opposition party, Dravida Munnetra Kazhgam (DMK), held a protest today in Chennai against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, which it considers anti-Muslim.

Its MP from Thoothukudi, Kanimozhi, is one of the top leaders who took part.

The citizenship law "is against the Muslims and DMK will never let the minorities down," Kanimozhi said last week, when the legislation was still being discussed in Parliament.

Today, she said the law discriminated against people on religious lines and "clearly excluded" Sri Lankan Tamils.

She described the ruling AIADMK party, a BJP ally, as a "shame on this nation".

The DMK is part of the United Progressive Alliance, a national coalition of opposition parties led by the Congress.

Nationwide protests were held on Monday after a police crackdown on students at Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia university, who have also been protesting the new law.

That happened after ugly scenes unfolded near the campus -- buses and police vehicles were torched -- but Jamia students said they were not involved.

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been protested with particular bitterness in the Northeast, where it is seen as a threat to indigeneity.

The law fast-tracks naturalisation for Pakistani, Afghan and Bangladeshi refugees who fled religious persecution in their home countries; it covers six minority groups but not Islamic ones.

The government denies that its policy is anti-Muslim and has promised to protect the rights of locals in the Northeast.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi personally appealed for calm both after Sunday's violence in Delhi and during the protests in the Northeast.
