Mumbai: 2 more PMC Bank depositors die of cardiac arrest

TWO MORE account holders of the scam-hit Punjab & Maharashtra Cooperative (PMC) Bank have died in Mumbai, taking the total number of deaths following RBI-imposed restrictions on the bank to eight since October 14.

Kuldeep Kaur Vig (64) and Ranjeet Puri (43) allegedly died of cardiac arrests. Vig died in a local hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest Tuesday. “She was worried about her money being stuck in the bank. After watching the protests against the bank on TV, she grew agitated,” Vig’s husband Varinder Singh (74) said. “My own account is in the bank. Our health insurance is also not getting renewed as no one wants a PMC Bank cheque,” he added.

Puri, based in Mumbai, also died from a cardiac arrest in Solapur. “Puri had gone to Solapur for a work-related trip. He had been worried about his accounts at the bank, as it was affecting his business,” said a family friend.

On October 14, former Jet Airways employee Sanjay Gulati (51), a PMC Bank depositor, had died of a heart attack hours after he attended a protest against the bank. Another account holder in the bank, Fattomal Punjabi (56), died the next day in his Mulund-based shop, also from a heart attack. The third death was reported the same day. A 39-year-old depositor committed suicide.

Muralidhar Darra, an octogenarian, died of a heart attack after he could not get a bypass surgery due to lack of funds. Bharati Sadarangani (73) became the fifth victim when she died of a cardiac arrest. On Thursday, a 68-year-old depositor had died after suffering a cardiac arrest at his Mulund residence.
