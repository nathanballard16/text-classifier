Killer Indian Elephant Nicknamed “Osama bin Laden” Dies After 6 Days In Captivity

Osama bin Laden (nope not that bin Laden), a rogue elephant in Assam, India, was responsible for the deaths of 5 villagers, which forced the authorities to capture him and place him in a sanctuary.

Osama was named after the late al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after he was captured following a massive hunt for him in Assam, a northeastern state in India.

Authorities tracked Laden for days by the forestry officers and tranquilized him after carrying out a deadly rampage in October, where he killed 5 villagers.

Laden went on a rampage killing in Goalpara, which is located in Assam.

After capturing Laden, he was renamed after the Hindu God Krishna and was moved into the Orang National Park in Assam.

Officials wanted to teach Laden how to patrol and stay in sanctuaries.

A park ranger who did not want to share his identity with the public, said, “The animal was behaving as normal. It was, however, kept with its legs tied so that it couldn’t escape.”

The keeper of the animal said the Laden died by 5 am (10:30 GMT) on Sunday.

The exact cause of Laden’s death is still unclear.

Authorities have sent a team of veterinary surgeons to the state to carry out an autopsy.

According to reports, the animal was unsuitable for captivity as it was already 35-years-old.

Death Caused By Elephants In India

According to government records, in the last 5 years, nearly 2,300 people have been killed by elephants in India.

Since 2011, 700 elephants have been killed in India. Most of them died due to losing their natural habitat.

A large number of elephants migrate to Goalpara due to rampant deforestations, and when the large animals interact with humans, it usually ends up bad.

Elephants in India usually die after being poisoned by locals, shot by locals, get trapped in electric fences, or sometimes after they get hit by fast trains.
