Chandigarh, February 9

There will be no change in the seat-sharing arrangement between the Akali Dal and BJP. The two alliance partners are also unlikely to swap the two parliamentary seats — Amritsar with Ludhiana and Hoshiarpur with Jalandhar.

A decision to this effect was taken in the first coordination committee meeting of the alliance partners held here this evening. SAD chief Sukhbir Singh Badal, state BJP chief Shwait Malik, and BJP incharge of Punjab affairs Capt Abhimanyu Singh met for the first time after the thaw in relations between the two parties reached last week.

The leaders present in the meeting also decided that they would have district-wise protests across Punjab against the alleged failures of the Congress government. “Vishwasghat rallies” will be organised in all Lok Sabha constituencies by the alliance partners jointly beginning March 3.

SAD senior vice-president Daljit Singh Cheema and BJP general Secretary Rakesh Rathore have been asked by the committee to formalise these events and to promote all pro-people initiatives of the Modi government.

Others who attended the meeting were Balwinder Singh Bhunder, Tota Singh, Janmeja Singh Sekhon, Sikander Singh Maluka, Bibi Jagir Kaur (from the Akali Dal), and Vijay Sampla, Manoranjan Kalia, Madan Mohan Mittal, Ashwani Sharma, Tikshan Sud, Arun Narang and Dinesh Kumar (from the BJP).
