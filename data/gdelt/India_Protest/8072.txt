Indian National Elections 2019: Villagers In Uttar Pradesh Allegedly Bribed By BJP Workers With Rs. 500

Villagers in UP (Uttar Pradesh) say that they were bribed by BJP Workers and that the workers forcibly applied the indelible ink on them today.

Residents of the Tara Jivanpur village and workers of the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party held a protest outside their local police station and claimed that the villagers were bribed by 3 workers of the BJP.

A resident said, “They asked us if we’ll vote for the party. They told us now you can’t vote. Don’t tell anyone.”

The villagers added that 3 men from the party gave them Rs. 500 on Saturday.

The police told the villagers to register an FIR so that a probe will be launched for the incident.

I can assure that all people who are eligible to vote in the constituency will be able to cast their vote, action will be taken against those who are found guilty.”

Harish Srivastava, the spokesperson of the BJP, said, “This is a ploy of our rivals to defame us. Why would the BJP do such things when we are already winning the seat by a huge margin?”
