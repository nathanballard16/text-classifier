West Bengal: PM Narendra Modi addresses public meeting at Jalpaiguri

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday slammed West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for sitting on a dharna to support "those who looted the poor people of Bengal".Addressing a well-attended BJP rally in North Bengal's Jalpaiguri district, Modi assailed Banerjee for the sit-in she staged against the attempted questioning of Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar by the CBI in the Saradha chit fund scam case.The Prime Minister said it was for the first time that a chief minister had staged a dharna to protect the fraudsters who looted thousands of poor people."For the first time in country's history, a CM in broad daylight sat on a dharma in favour of those who looted thousands of poor people," he said.The state government has alleged that the Centre has been misusing the central agency to score political points.PM Modi said it was an "extortionist syndicate" and not 'Didi', as Banerjee is fondly called, that was running the state."Didi is anxious to reach Delhi and is willing to leave behind Bengal's poor and middle classes to be looted at the hands of the syndicate-gathbandhan," he said.The PM said that the "naming rights" of all the schemes introduced by the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government are owned by "TMC's middlemen".Attacking Banerjee's government, PM Modi added that those who got power in Bengal in the name of "Maa, Maati, Manush" have adopted a culture of violence.
