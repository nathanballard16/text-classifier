DU admissions 2019: The Left-backed AISA Tuesday met Delhi University officials to highlight ‘discrepancy’ in the application fee for OBC applicants for postgraduate courses, who are supposed to pay the same amount as applicants from unreserved category.

All India Students’ Association (AISA) president Kanwalpreet Kaur said the application fee for Other Backward Class (OBC) candidates applying for postgraduate courses is Rs 750, the same as unreserved category.

The application fee for candidates belonging to Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe, Persons With Disabilities (PwD) and Economically Weaker Sections is Rs 300.
