TMC delegation ‘detained’ at Lucknow airport

Kolkata: A four-member Trinamool Congress (TMC) delegation, which was scheduled to meet the grieving families of those killed in Uttar Pradesh during protests over the new citizenship law, was ‘detained’ at Lucknow airport Sunday afternoon, party sources claimed here.

TMC Rajya Sabha MP Md Nadimul Haque, who is part of the delegation, said he and other party memebers were staging a sit-in near a hanger at the airport.

“We have been detained at Lucknow airport. As soon as we got down from the aircraft, we were surrounded by the police and were taken by the police to a secluded spot on the runway. We are staging a dharna near a hanger,” Haque told this agency over phone from Lucknow.

The delegation, led by party’s former MP Dinesh Trivedi also includes parliamentarian Pratima Mondal and Abir Biswas.
