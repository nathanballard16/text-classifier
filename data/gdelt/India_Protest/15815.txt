Punjab rice millers oppose new policy, hold protests

PATIALA: Resentment among state rice millers over the implementation of custom milling policy formulated by the state government for kharif marketing season 2019-20 led to protests in Rajpura on Tuesday. They alleged that the government was mounting pressure upon the millers for the execution of agreement for storage and custom milling of paddy during the current season.Protesting millers raised slogans during the visit of Anandita Mitra , director, department of food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, Punjab, who had reached there to resolve the issues being faced by commission agents during paddy lifting.Punjab Rice Millers Association president Tarsem Saini, who along with his supporter raised slogans during her visit, said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) had run out of storage space but the state millers were being asked to supply rice before March 31. He said while the millers were not in a position to accept new lots of rice, they will have to pay 12% penalty under the latest milling policy if they fail to deliver the produce by March 31.The millers also held a meeting with Mitra in Rajpura but it remained inconclusive, following which they started protesting against the government.Speaking to TOI, Mitra said she had met the rice millers and taken note of issues being raised by them. She said the government was committed to providing storage space and that the millers’ apprehensions were farfetched.However, Saini claimed that in the absence of space, the FCI refuses to accept the produce and, under these circumstances, a miller would end up paying hefty penalties. He said other demands of the rice millers include settlement of milling bills, a refund of levy security and user charges payment @ 7.32 rupees per bag have not been settled had also not been sorted out by the government forcing the miller to hold protest against the government.
