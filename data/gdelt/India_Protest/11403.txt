Booked AAP leader yet to be arrested

PATIALA: Sangrur police are yet to arrest AAP leader Bachan Bedil who was booked for allegedly helping his brother, a murder accused, flee from the police custody.Bedil, a retired assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a lyricist famous for ‘Luk 28 Kudi Da’ number, was booked on Sunday for helping his brother Sukhvir Singh escape from Badrukhan police post on Saturday morning.Bedil who heads the cultural wing of the AAP claimed that it was him who had had first taken Sira to the police station and later when he returned to hand over his medicines on a scooter, Sira used the same to flee from the police custody.However, he was nabbed by the cops on Sunday after which Bedil was released and placed on ‘notice’.The police claimed the sections under which the AAP leader had been booked had provisions for his release.Sangrur SSP Dr Sandeep Garg said while Sira had been booked under Section 302 and was in police custody, he also faced charges under Sections 224 (resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension), 109 (punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code at the Longowal Police Station on Saturday, along with Bedil whose scooter he had used to flee from the police post. He said Sira was in police custody while Bedil had been put on notice.However, under pressure from the local Congress leaders, who had even staged a protest on Sunday against the release of Bedil, the Longowal police on Monday incorporated Section 120B of the IPC in the case registered against Bedil for aiding Sira’s escape.Bedil said he had nothing to do with the escape of his brother from the police custody.The state unit of the AAP said the case against Bedil has been registered under political pressure and demanded a probe into the matter.The Congress leaders had on Sunday blocked the Bathinda-Chandigarh national highway outside the police post for about six hours seeking Bedil’s arrest.
