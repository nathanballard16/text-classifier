Janasankalpa rally in Dharwad today

Citizens for Democracy, a civil society movement started by Jayaprakash Narayan to fight Emergency, in collaboration with several other citizen groups will hold Janasankalpa rally in Dharawad on Sunday.

The rally will see Swaraj India leaders Prashanth Bhushan, Devanuru Mahadeva and S.R. Hiremath, national president, Citizens for Democracy, participate. “There is an undeclared Emergency in the country today, 10 times more dangerous than the Emergency of 1975-77. The social fabric of the country and the fundamentals of our democracy and institutions have been corrupted. The rally will call upon people to defeat the incumbent government,” said Mr. Hiremath.

The rally will also see the release of ‘Reclaiming the Republic’, a people’s manifesto drafted by 21 eminent citizens and jurists led by Chief Justice A.P. Shah (retired).

Mr. Bhushan, speaking in Bengaluru on Saturday, said this was a citizens’ charter for any government that comes to power to follow. Launching a tirade against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he described the incumbent government as a “tumour in the body of the republic that needs to be addressed first”.

Accusing Mr. Modi of diverting attention from real issues such as unemployment, rural distress, destruction of constitutional institutions, diversity, he said: “Mr. Modi is taking recourse to fake nationalism to make political capital out of it.” This polls will decide whether India will remain a democratic republic country, besides a civilised society as well, because every sign of fascism is clearly visible in the country today, he said.
