In unique protest, kin of detainees bring to ‘jail’ heaters, blankets

SRINAGAR: Family members of some of the 33 political detenues in Jammu & Kashmir currently lodged at Srinagar ’s MLA Hostel arrived at the facility with heating equipment on Wednesday as a mark of protest against the administration.At least a dozen visitors were seen carrying room heaters, hot water bags, blankets and other electrical heating appliances to meet the detenues, who protested against alleged mismanagement on part of the administration, claiming that authorities aren’t providing them with proper facilities and heating arrangements at the hostel.Former PDP minister Naeem Akhtar’s daughter, Shehriyar, and PDP leader Nazimuddin Bhat’s son Mehraj accused authorities of neglecting the detenues’ need, and demanded proper heating facilities inside the MLA Hostel. Kin of other political leaders like Sartaj Madni and AM Sagar also joined them.Authorities, however, refuted the allegations claiming that the detenues have been provided with adequate facilities, including one electric blanket , one electric heater besides normal blankets and proper bedding arrangements to keep themselves warm. The politicians have been detained since August 5 when the Centre abrogated Article 370 , paving the way for the bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories — J&K and Ladakh . They were initially kept at Centaur Lake View hotel on the banks of Dal Lake, but later moved to the MLA Hostel on Sunday in view of the impending winter. During the move, the detenues were allegedly manhandled by the cops. Authorities, however, had refuted the allegation.
