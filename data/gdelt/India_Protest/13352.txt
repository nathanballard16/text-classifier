The members gathered at the entrance gate of zone A and raised slogans against the lackadaisical attitude of MC. They claimed that the number of stray cattle is increasing with each passing day due to which number of accidents have also increased. They added that in many localities, children cannot play outside due to fear of wandering stray cattle. They also threatened to stage a protest on large scale if the MC does not make arrangements to eradicate the menace soon.

Senior deputy mayor Malhotra claimed that they have started tying up with cow shed managements for lifting of stray cattle from the city roads. “One agreement has been signed recently for East constituency and more vacant space will be identified where stray cattle could be shifted,” he said.
