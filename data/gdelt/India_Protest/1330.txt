Come on one platform to save Ganga: Medha

One of the leaders of Narmada Bachao Andolan, Medha Patkar has said that all organisations, big and small that are fighting to save the Ganga river shall have to come together on one platform to ensure the unbridled flow and purity of waters of the Ganga river. A national campaign shall be launched to achieve this. She said that the dedication of ascetic Brahmchari Atmabodhanand for the Ganga will not go in vain. She also said that a campaign shall be launched at Jantar Mantar in New Delhi through which dialogue shall be made with the Government of India on the issue of Ganga conservation .

Medha Patkar said this while addressing the gathering at the two-day seminar held at Matri Sadan in Jagjeetpur in Haridwar. Targeting the central government Patkar said that despite the sacrifice of lives by two ascetics in Haridwar there has been no action from the state of Central Government which appear to be in slumber. The government has not taken any initiative for talks with Atmabodhanand who is on hunger strike for the past 88 days. During the two days seminar many eminent people from across the country have gathered including noted columnist Bharat Jhunjhunwala, Ram Singh, Prakash Nautiyal ,Snigdha Tiwari, Nirmala Pandey, Vijay Verma, Pallavi Joshi, Gilbert Kolankar and others.

Preparations for a big campaign for Ganga conservation are underway at Matri Sadan Ashram which would be led by Patkar. Observers opine that this clearly indicates that the fight for Narmada and Ganga are now on the same platform and hundreds of Ganga lovers from across the country will fight on both legal and physical fronts.

The struggle is not going to remain confined to one Ashram only but will be a country wide movement. A team is being prepared with legal advisors, writers, scientists, environmentalists and social media experts to strengthen the movement. At the same time attempts are also being made to involve many youths with this crusade
