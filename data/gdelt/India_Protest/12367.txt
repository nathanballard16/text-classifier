J&K students in UoH reject government’s Eid invite

Hyderabad: Days after Jammu and Kashmir Governor reportedly sanctioned Rs 1 lakh each to designated liaison officers for organising Eid festivities for Kashmiri students studying in other states, students from University of Hyderabad have expressed their dismay and rejected the government’s invitation to lunch.



Following the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35 (A) by BJP-led government, and amidst the communication blackout in J&K, there are reports of several protests in the region with hundreds of people hitting the streets.



Jammu and Kashmir Students’ Association (JKSA) of University of Hyderabad issued a statement in response to an invitation for Eid lunch from a liaison officer of the central government. The students said that the invitation was conveyed through DSW’s (Dean Students Welfare) office to them.



In a strongly worded statement, the students said, “We would like to take this opportunity to register our protest against the onslaught on J&K’s special status and the clampdown of all communication channels in the Valley.” Condemning the curfew and alleged use of force, JKSA expressed its support with Kashmir residents.
