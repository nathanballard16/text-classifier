Farmers block NH-44 against shortage of seeds

Protest held for fourth consecutive day in Anantapur dist.

Groundnut farmers blocked National Highway No. 44 at Pamidi in Anantapur district demanding immediate supply of seeds, which led to the vehicular traffic getting stalled for about 45 minutes on Thursday morning. Farmers sat across the four lanes at 10 a.m. on the NH blocking traffic from Pamidi to Gooty and about 4 km from Pamidi towards Bangalore.

This is the fourth consecutive day the farmers are blocking the traffic on important highways in different mandals of the district. The farmers said that while the monsoon had set in and it was raining in some parts, they were facing severe scarcity of seeds, as they were yet to be supplied by the government on subsidy.

The police intervened and persuaded the farmers to allow the traffic and, following an assurance from the agriculture officials, the farmers left the place.

Meanwhile, Collector S. Satyanarayana along with Joint Director of Agriculture Habib Basha, held a review meeting on the current situation of distribution and the stocks procurement schedules.
