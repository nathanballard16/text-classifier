Rahul Gandhi calls students and youth for protest at Raj Ghat today

The grand old party, Congress is going to hold a protest against the amended citizenship law that grants citizenship to non-Muslim refugees fleeing religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

The protest will be held at the memorial of Mahatma Gandhi, Raj Ghat in the National Capital. Leaders of the Congress party, in huge numbers, including party MP Rahul Gandhi, led by Congress interim President Sonia Gandhi will be hitting the streets.

“Dear students and youth of India, it’s not good enough just to feel Indian. At times like these it’s critical to show that you’re Indian and won’t allow India to be destroyed by hatred,” tweeted Rahul Gandhi.
