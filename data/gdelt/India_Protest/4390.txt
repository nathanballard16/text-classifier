Meek response to Bharat Bandh in Steel City

JAMSHEDPUR: The dawn-to-dusk Bharat Bandh called by various Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe outfits on Tuesday evoked only a weak response in Steel City.The bandh activists, led by Bahujan Kranti Morcha, an offshoot of BAMCEF (All India Backward and Minority Communities Employees Federation) took to the streets to enforce the bandh but police swung into action to thwart their activities. Bandh suppoerters were seen moving in Sitaramdera, Agrico, Kadma, Bistupur and Sakchi but police didn’t let the traders shut shop.Morcha state functionary Pratap Yadav admitted, “The bandh response in Jamshedpur hasn’t been encouraging as police foiled our bid to ensure peaceful demonstration but in different parts of the country, including in Bihar, the bandh was successful.”In Sakchi, police arrested 35 bandh activists after a ruckus in the town market. In adjoining Seraikela-Kharswan district’s Adityapur and Gamharia, RJD activists supported the morcha to carry out the bandh, which evoked mixed response.RJD leader Sharda Devi said, “Given that traders usually keep their shops close on Tuesdays, most of the shops were closed today and few shut down their shutters on our request.”Meanwhile, police in both the districts were on the alert with armed police personnel and “lathi party” were deployed in adequate numbers at market places, malls, cinema halls and at important installations to prevent the bandh activists from damaging public properties.The bandh was called to put pressure on the central government for implementation their various demands. Their demands include promulgation of two ordinances to secure Dalit and tribal rights that have been affected by the Supreme Court decisions. One is to secure the forest rights of tribals and the other is to ensure fair representation in UGC faculty posts. The other demand is to establish the Indian Judicial Services under Article 312 of the Constitution to ensure inclusion of SCs, STs, OBCs, minorities and women during recruitments in higher judiciary posts.
