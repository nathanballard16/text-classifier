Active protests and demonstrations took place across the country. As hundreds were detained for defying the prohibitory orders, many states also faced traffic restrictions and internet shutdowns.

The protests across India gained momentum days after the police lathicharged students of Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University. While several people have lost their lives ever since the protests flared up, hundreds were detained and injured after police resorted to lathi-charge ad tear gas shells.
