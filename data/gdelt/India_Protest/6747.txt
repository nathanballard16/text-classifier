Poll officials grant permission to MNS' Mumbai South rally

Poll authorities have given a permission to Raj Thackeray-led MNS to hold a rally in Mumbai South Lok Sabha constituency next week.

Authorities had reportedly denied permission to the rally earlier.

The Mumbai city district election office Sunday said it has set up a single window clearance system for giving permission to election campaigning for all candidates.

"Permissions to hold election meetings are given after following a due procedure. It is ensured that there is no injustice to anyone. The permission to Maharashtra Navnirman Sena has been given after following a due procedure," the election office said in a statement.

In Mumbai South constituency, Shiv Sena's sitting MP Arvind Sawant is pitted against Mumbai Congress president Milind Deora.

Though the Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) is not contesting elections this time, Raj Thackeray has been holding rallies across Maharashtra appealing to people to vote against the BJP and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The BJP and the Sena are accusing the MNS chief of doing the bidding of the Congress and the NCP.

In coming days, Thackeray is slated to address rallies in Mumbai and suburbs.

All six Lok Sabha constituencies of Mumbai go to polls on April 29.
