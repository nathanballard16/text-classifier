Chandigarh, December 12

A senior police officer on Wednesday announced his resignation from service in protest against the passage of the contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Rajya Sabha.

In a series of tweets, Rahman said that he was quitting in “civil disobedience” and thought that the bill was against “religious pluralism.”

This Bill is against the religious pluralism of India. I request all justice loving people to oppose the bill in a democratic manner. It runs against the very basic feature of the Constitution. @ndtvindia@IndianExpress #CitizenshipAmendmentBill2019 pic.twitter.com/1ljyxp585B — Abdur Rahman (@AbdurRahman_IPS) December 11, 2019

“The Bill is totally unconstitutional and against very basic feature of Equality before Law. It violates Article 14, 15 and 25 of the Indian Constitution. It is against the ethos and very spirit of the Constitution. Religion can not become a basis in giving or depriving a person from citizenship,” said Rahman.

Rahman said Muslims had to spend huge amount of money and “run from pillar to post to collect the required documents to prove their citizenship.”

“If NRC and CAB implemented jointly, then people belonging to non-Muslim communities even if unable to produce the required document, will be declared refugees and will be given Indian citizenship,” he added.

During the passage of the Bill, wrong facts, misleadingly information, wrong logic were produced by the HM. History was distorted. The idea behind the bill is to stoke fear in Muslims and divide the nation.

Rahman has been serving as the IGP of the Maharashtra State Human Rights Commission.

Notably, Rahman had sought voluntary retirement in August citing personal reasons. His resignation was rejected by the government. Rahman called the rejection “unfair” and “prejudiced.”
