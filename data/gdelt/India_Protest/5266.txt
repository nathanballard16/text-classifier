Jagan Mohan Reddy asking for a chance to loot people: N Chandrababu Naidu

Visakhapatnam: AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu alleged that YSRC president Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy was asking for one chance, which he would use to loot the people and the state.

Mr Naidu said that along with Mr Reddy, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao were displaying their anger at him.

Addressing public meetings in Vizianagaram district on Thursday, Mr Naidu said, “KCR has taken away assets that we built in Hyderabad for more than 60 years and is still trying to rule AP with the help of Jagan. KCR has already given Rs 1,000 crore to Jagan and he will try to pay Rs 5,000 for each vote. That is KCR’s return gift.”

Alleging that Mr Modi and Mr Rao were “worried” that AP would witness more development than Gujarat and Telangana, Mr Naidu said, “When we question about the special category status, Modi tried to threaten us with CBI, Enforcement Directorate and income-tax departments. They are still conspiring to attack Telugu Desam leaders using central institutions. NIA deals with terrorists and I’m surprised when they have taken up the case of Jagan’s ‘rooster knife’.” He has said that the youth at the TD meeting were responsible and would never let the state go into the hands of people who are trying to destroy it. “The youth supporting the YSRC are being served alcohol at every meeting. They should remember that the YSRC leaders will involve the youth in any wrong cases too,” Mr Naidu said.

“In my tenure I have brought several companies to the state. If Jagan becomes Chief Minister, industrialists will be worried about going to jail,” he said.

Mr Naidu said Jana Sena’s Visakhapatnam Lok Sabha candidate, former CBI joint director V.V. Lakshminarayana, knew about the cases against Mr Reddy, and demanded that he reveal the facts to the people.
