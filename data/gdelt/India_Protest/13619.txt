New Delhi, Sep 2 : Members of the Sikh community protested against the alleged forced conversion of Sikh girls in Pakistan, outside the Pakistan High Commission here on Monday.

The protesters were trying to submit a memorandum to the Pakistan High Commission when they were stopped.

This irked the Sikhs who launched violent protests near the premises of the Pakistan High Commission.

Sikh community members also burnt an effigy of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan in protest.

Two Sikh girls have been forcefully converted to Islam in Pakistan in the past few days.

The protesters demanded protection of the Sikh families residing in Pakistan amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan.
