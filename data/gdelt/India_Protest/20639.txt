DCW Chief Swati Maliwal's Health Deteriorates As Her Indefinite Fast Enters Day-12

New Delhi:

The health of Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal has started to deteriorate as her indefinite hunger strike entered the twelfth day on Saturday. She has lost around 7-kg weight so far and doctors have advised her to end the fast. According to them, uric acid has reached a dangerous level and there are chances of failure of both the kidneys.

Meanwhile, Maliwal on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding immediate implementation of Disha Bill in the entire country, which mandates disposal of cases of atrocities against women within 21 days and handing out the death penalty.

The Delhi Commission for Women chief also expressed sadness over the “indifferent attitude” of the central government till date over the issue of women’s safety.

“If the Andhra Government can take this historic decision (of passing Disha Bill), why can’t the Central Government show the same urgency and concern. I fervently appeal to you to immediately enact the Disha Bill for the entire country,” Maliwal said.

"Today is 12th day of my indefinite fast. I wrote to you on 1st day, seeking immediate action. I'm deeply saddened to note that despite this alarming situation and demands from across the country ,there has been hardly any response from you to these appeals," letter further reads.

Maliwal, who has been on a hunger strike for over 10 days to demand capital punishment for rapists, said she will not end her fast till the Disha Bill is implemented in the entire country.

On Friday, the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly passed the bill.

The proposed new law has been named the ‘Andhra Pradesh Disha Act Criminal Law (AP Amendment) Act, 2019 as a tribute to the veterinary doctor who was raped and murdered recently in neighbouring Telangana.
