Thousands of Kargilis protest over division status discrimination

Srinagar: Thousands of people from Kargil today held massive demonstration in Jammu over the discrimination while granting divisional status to Ladakh.

The protesters while chanting slogans like “Nahi chalegi nahi chalegi, na insaafi nahi chalegi,” said that the injustice with the people of Kargil will not be allowed anymore.

“Keeping all the offices in Leh is discrimination with highly populated Kargil region. We will not allow it to happen. This is sheer discrimination with the people of Kargil,” the protesters said.

The leaders leading the protests said they will take the protests to Delhi until justice is not done with the people of Kargil.

They said the decision to keep all the offices in Leh is politically motivated and it will insight regional imbalance in the otherwise peaceful region.

Senior National Conference leader and former minister Qamar Ali Akhoon said they will launch civil disobedience movement till the time justice is not given to the people of Kargil.

Akhoon was heading protests in Jammu along with other regional leaders of Kargil.

The leaders threatened a massive agitation and pledged they will protest in democratic ways to get justice.

“Kargil has always been overlooked and has been very underdeveloped. We will not allow it to happen again. We are as much part of the Ladakh division as is Leh. The distribution of offices or rotational arrangement should be envisaged than only we will call off our movement for justice,” the protesters said. (KNS)
