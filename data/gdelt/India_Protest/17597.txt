The Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Thursday arrested a 37-year-old man for allegedly robbing a courier company in Gujarat. The police said the accused, Sahil Shaikh, had entered the courier company along with 13 others with firearms and in their bid to escape, they had fired rounds at policemen when they tried to intervene.

According to police, the incident took place on August 13 at Patan district in Gujarat, when the robbers looted the courier company. “While they were inside the office, trying to pack the valuables, the police were informed and after they came to the spot, the 13 robbers fired bullets at them,” said an officer.

The police said the accused managed to flee with cash and valuables worth Rs 6.64 lakh, which they distributed among themselves. Later, Shaikh came to Mumbai and started staying with his family in Malvani.

“On Thursday, one of our officers was tipped off about his location in Malvani, following which a team was sent and he was brought in for inquiry,” said an officer. During investigation, the accused confessed to the crime. Upon checking his past records, the police learnt that he was earlier arrested by the Crime Branch Unit 8 in a robbery case in Jogeshwari, where he and his accomplices had robbed a doctor in broad daylight.

“As he remained absent for the case hearing, a non-bailable warrant was issued against him and he was wanted in that case…” said an officer. Shaikh has been handed over to the Crime Branch Unit 8 for further investigation. His custody will be given to the Gujarat Police as he is also wanted in a robbery case in the state.
