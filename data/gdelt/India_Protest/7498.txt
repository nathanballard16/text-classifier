Motorists protest as India imposes toll tax on Kashmir highway

Srinagar, May 07, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, following in the footprints of former ruler of Kashmir, Maharaja Hari Singh, India has started extorting the Kashmiri people by imposing harsh toll tax on Srinagar-Jammu highway. People told media that a toll plaza has been set up near Sangam on Srinagar-Jammu highway in South Kashmir, and every vehicle passing through it was charged toll of Rupees 85 for every light motor vehicle. Locals staged a protest demonstration on the highway against the cruel decision by the Indian rulers.

“How can government impose such a harsh order against people of Kashmir asking us to pay Rupees 170 per day from moving to and fro on the highway,” asked a person, showing a receipt of Rs 85 collecting as toll by National Highways Authority of India. Another person from Ganderbal said that he was shocked when asked to pay Rs 85 before being allowed to move.

“We don’t earn as much as what is being charged. Having already banned civilian traffic on highway by virtue of order on April 3, it seems that the authorities by imposing such harsh tax, have decided to completely shut the highway for the civilians throughout the week,” he said. Most of the people protested against the move and refused to pay, leading to the traffic jam on the highway around the toll plaza.
