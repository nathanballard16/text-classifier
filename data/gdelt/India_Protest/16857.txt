Anti-India protests expected to hit London, UK Police assures security to Indian High Commission

Anti-India protest are expected to be held in London, United Kingdom on Sunday. The UK Police has assured proper security for the Indian High Commission.

Pro-Pakistani groups have planned to protest outside the Indian High Commission in London today on the day of Diwali.

After being denied the permission to protests outside India House on Diwali, the protesters have now seem to have come up with another plan.

The protesters have planned to hold an alternative 'digital campaign' outside the Indian High Commission today.

With this, the pressure seems to mount on the British government to ban today's anti-India march in London.

London's Pak-origin Mayor Sadiq Khan has said that such a march will only deepen divisions among the people in the British capital.

Khan had said that the march must be canceled, maintaining that he does not have the power to ban it and passing the buck to the UK Home Secretary.

When WION tried to reach the British Home Secretary regarding the anti-India protests, the UK Home Office responded saying that neither the home secretary nor the police has the power to ban a static protest while ministers cannot initiate bans on marches.

On Thursday, the London Mayor wrote a letter to Navin Shah - a British lawmaker of Indian origin. Shah had actively campaigned for a ban on the anti-India march.

In his letter, the London Mayor admitted that the protesters could still breach the conditions and assemble at the Indian High Commission. The India House in London has already witnessed two violent protests this year.
