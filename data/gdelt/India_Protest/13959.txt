Until now 13 cities across the country from Delhi to Mumbai, Kolkata, and Chennai have announced of the hosting of the event.

The first Global Student Climate Strike was held on March 15th, 2019.

Greta Thunberg had started FridaysForFuture after observing major political inaction on the current global climate crisis. She began the initiative in August 2018 by sitting in front of the Swedish parliament every school day for three weeks to protest the alarming lack of action.

Thunberg's movement had its impact in India too and there have been climate strikes by school and college students in the country in the past few months, demanding that decision-makers take urgent action on the climate crisis. The May 24 climate strike saw a great turnout in cities like Mumbai, Bengaluru, Delhi and others.
