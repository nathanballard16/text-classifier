Parents protest against fee hike by schools

SURAT: The start of the new academic year has spurred an agitation by parents against fee hike by some schools in the city. School managements claimed that they are collecting fees as per the guidelines of Fees Regulation Committee ( FRC ) but parents are miffed at the sudden rise.Parents of children studying in Seventh Day Adventist School (SDAS) held a protest against fee hike outside the school premises with placards in their hands.“The school has increased fees by around 40 per cent which we want to be reduced. The school fee is already too high and many parents are finding it difficult to pay it,” said a parent taking part in protest outside the school at Athwalines.Representatives of school administration met agitating parents and tried to convince them that the fee has been hiked as per FRC guidelines. “The provisional fee has been hiked within the permissible limits and as per FRC guidelines. We have explained this to the parents,” said Navin Rao, vice-principal of SDAS.A group of parents held a protest outside at Vanita Vishram School to protest against hike in autorickshaw and van charges. They also took out a rally near the school campus holding placards.Recently, parents of children studying in Gajera School in Katargam also held a protest to oppose fee hike and wanted reduction in it. The school management is discussing the issue with the parents. Similarly, parents of children of Ashadeep School in Varachha too are protesting against fee hike and held a dharna too. Parents are trying to hold a massive protest together over the issue at a single venue in the coming days.
