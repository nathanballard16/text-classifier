London, November 26

The UK’s Labour Party today unveiled an add-on manifesto for the December 12 General Election which pledges to set up a new educational trust that would ensure that Britain’s colonial history and injustices of the Raj are taught in schools across the country. The party’s ‘Race and Faith Manifesto’ comes in the wake of its main manifesto last week, which had pledged to issue a formal apology for the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar by troops under the British Empire in April 1919.

“The creation of an Emancipation Educational Trust will ensure historical injustice, colonialism and role of the British Empire is taught in the National Curriculum,” notes the supplementary manifesto. “Only by acknowledging the historical injustices faced by our communities can we work towards a better future that is prosperous for all, that isn’t blighted by austerity and the politics of fear,” said Dawn Butler, Labour’s Shadow Equalities and Women’s Secretary.

Currently, the history of the British Empire is not a compulsory module in the United Kingdom school curriculum, an issue often highlighted by campaigners as a failure to present an accurate picture of the country’s history for schoolchildren. “It is important that children are taught about colonialism, injustice and the role of the British Empire. This is a major step that meets our long-standing demands,” said Harsev Bains, National Vice-President of the Indian Workers Association of Great Britain (IWA-GB), one of the oldest Indian workers’ groups in the United Kingdom. — PTI
