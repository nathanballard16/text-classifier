29 years of injustice: How Kashmiri Pandits were forced out of Valley on this black day

4/6

Actor Anupam Kher who himself is a Kashmiri Pandit had earlier expressed pain and anguish of unheard voices of Pandit community.

He had once said that as far as the future of the community is concerned, everything is in dark.

"As far as Kashmiri Pandit's future is concerned everything is in dark. I don't think even point one percent is also staying there. We need to go back but we cannot go back to an atmosphere of fear. We cannot go back to the atmosphere of false security. So we need to find a situation," he had said.

When asked as to how secure does he feel in Kashmir, the 61-year-old actor said that the removal of Article 370 is one of the solutions to make the situation better in the state.

"How can there be any safety? I have always told that may be after removal of Article 370 the situation might be better but I don't know how are these political things done. I believe if people are allowed to do business there if they are allowed to do start-ups if they are allowed to buy land then maybe the situation can be better. Also, Srinagar should be declared a smart city," he added.

The actor had also asserted that January 19, 1990, was a black day
