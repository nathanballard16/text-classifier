Trump in the middle

The decades-old disputed region has entered an intriguing new phase where, and the US is flirting with intervention., wherein Muslim-majority Kashmir had been allowed a parallel Constitution with a flag of its own. State governments in Kashmir had powers over law enforcement, residence and property rights. Central laws had no validity in Kashmir unless the local legislature approved them.. It strengthened the nearly seven million Kashmiri Muslims' feeling that they are not Indians but a different nationality who deserve to keep Indians out of their paradisiacal enclave except as visiting tourists.The armed secessionist movements in Kashmir against Indian rule from the late 1980s occurred in the context of this autonomous status, with local elite Kashmiri Muslim politicians of various hues hanging on to their privileges with the narrative that Kashmir is not really a part of India but an independent nation which, if pushed to extremes, will break away from India and declare itself as a new country or merge into Pakistan.Indian leaders before Modi stuck to the tacit bargain whereby Kashmir retained its special status and, in return, willy-nilly stayed within the territorial boundaries of India.Waves of anti-India uprisings and insurgencies, supported from across the border by Pakistan, kept Kashmir burning.Modi's bet is that by corralling Kashmir under tighter central government control, he will marginalise the secessionist politicians there, open Kashmir up for the return of Hindu Kashmiri minorities who had been ethnically cleansed by jihadists in the late 1980s, and alter the demographic mix in Kashmir through settlement of Indians of all religious and ethnic backgrounds.Demographically, the idea is to dissolve Kashmiri separatism in a sea of Indian nationalism through the intermixing of populations, blunting the sharp edge of separatism that comes from lack of ethnic heterogeneity in the Kashmir Valley, where 97 percent of the population is Muslim.Modi's decision has evoked opposition from some Indian political parties wedded to the old arrangement of special autonomy for Kashmir because they fear that assimilation will deprive them of vote banks of Kashmiri Muslims and enfeeble Kashmiri elites whose parties can be alliance partners during and after elections.Cancelling autonomy for Kashmir also risks escalating civil unrest in Kashmir, where anti-India elements like the Hurriyat Conference fear falling under tremendous pressure if Kashmir is centrally governed. ButWhether this momentous shift will pay off as Indian nationalists expect depends not only on how Kashmiri Muslim elite politicians adjust to the new administrative reality Modi has created, but also on Pakistan. Modi's slam dunk move is intended to yank the initiative away from Pakistan, which claims Muslim-majority Kashmir as its rightful territory, and usher in a new era of Indian consolidation over the contested Himalayan region.Pakistan, which has controlled one-third of Kashmir since the first India-Pakistan war of 1947-1948, has long relied on stoking Kashmiri Muslim alienation in the two-thirds of Kashmir held by India. Freeing Kashmir from India's clutches is a Holy Grail of the Pakistani military, which has funded, trained and armed thousands of Kashmiri Muslims as well as jihadists from Pakistani ethnic groups like Punjabis and Pashtuns who slipped back and forth across the mountainous militarised border dividing Indian Kashmir from Pakistani Kashmir.. If Kashmiri Muslims are reorganised and no longer grouped together as an exclusive ethnic entity, Pakistan will find it a lot harder to foment the flame of self-determination.Kashmiri Muslims may become further alienated from India as a result of this makeover, but Modi is calculating that, in years to come, they will no longer be numerically so dominant as to stymie Indian sovereignty.With the writing on the wall, Pakistan will look for drastic and urgent action in the near term to foil Modi's long-term blueprint.. Its 'options' include internationalisation of Kashmir as a dangerous flashpoint or hotspot that could explode in war and nuclear holocaust, and to knock on the doors of the UN and the Muslim world by appealing to alleged human rights violations in Indian Kashmir.Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan recently extracted a rhetorical giveaway from US President Donald Trump that he would "love to be a mediator" in the Kashmir dispute as an apparent quid pro quo for Pakistan's support to extricate the US military from Afghanistan.Khan's tweet that "this is the time" for Trump to intervene and prevent Kashmir from blowing up into "a regional crisis" indicates that Islamabad will try hard to inveigle Washington into the frame.A surge in military clashes with India along the 740-kilometre-long Line of Control (LOC) and attempted terrorist attacks inside Indian territory to provoke a harsh counter-reaction from Modi, which in turn will force Trump to meddle, is an ideal scenario for Pakistani hawks.Historically, the ebbs and flows of jihadist terrorism in Kashmir and India-Pakistan relations have been interlinked with the interests of great powers from outside the region and the situation in Afghanistan. Modi has dispatched diplomats to convince major powers around the world and ensure that the fallout of his 'Operation Kashmir' does not become unmanageable. If Pakistan's plan is to raise alarms about instability and human rights before the international community, India's talking points are about the dire threat posed by Islamist terrorism and legitimate security needs of sovereign states.. Modi has opened with a historic gambit, but many unknowns lie in store. To cite the mercurial Trump's favourite punchline, "we'll see what happens."
