: Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Saturday visited Jallianwala Bagh Memorial whose centenary is being observed today. Rahul, who was accompanied by Punjab Chief Minister Capt. Amrinder Singh and Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu, also paid floral tributes to the people who lost their lives in the massacre there. Earlier on Friday late night, he offered prayers at the Akal Takht, Golden temple. Rahul was accompanied by Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh during his visit to the Golden Temple.The brutal massacre had taken place on April 13, 1919, after the passing of tyrannical Rowlatt Bill which aimed to curtail civil liberties and the subsequent Satyagraha launched by Mahatma Gandhi. The crowd had assembled peacefully at the Bagh to condemn the arrest of two national leaders -- Satya Pal and Saifuddin Kitchlew -- when they were fired indiscriminately by tyrant British General Dyer and his men.
