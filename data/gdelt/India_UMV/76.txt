Kashmiri Pandit body thanks Modi for banning JKLF; holding Malik responsible for their ‘genocide’

A Kashmiri Pandit organisation has welcomed the Centre’s move to ban JKLF and holding its founder, Yasin Malik, responsible for their ‘genocide’

According to PTI the organisation thanked Narendra Modi for “his bold and honeststep” in recognising that the militant movement in ‘Kashmir is not about liberation, not about economic suffering, not about justice but a theo-fascist movement which has brought great suffering to the land and its people,” the statement added.

“It is so heartening to see that our Prime Minister means business as far as dealing with Pakistan’s machinations in Kashmir is concerned,” the statement reads.

The “victory” (ban on JKLF) has been achieved because of the sacrifices and hard work of the entire Kashmiri Pandit community, it said.

The GKPD has presented a MoU to Home Minister Rajnath Singh inSeptember, 2018, which articulated that the first and foremost demand of the KP community was to recognise Genocide and Ethnic cleansing of Kashmiri Pandits, the statement said.

The Yasin Malik-led Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) was banned on Friday for “promoting” secession of the militancy-hit state from the Union of India
