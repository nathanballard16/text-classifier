New Delhi: Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency in the world, hit a fresh 2019 high on Monday, April 8, 2019, within a week after the crypto asset saw a major bull run for the first time in this year. According to a cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, Bitcoin prices today touched a new 2019 high at $5,332.48, up 41.95 per cent from the December 31, 2018, level of $3,756.47. Bitcoin prices were on a falling spree in 2018 as the cryptocurrency bottomed to a low around $3,000 from a 2018 high level of over $15,000.

Reportedly, the last week’s spike in the bitcoin prices has been fueled by a big quantum order placed on cryptocurrency exchange. A Forbes report, mentioning Nicholas Cawley of DailyFX team and a technology advisor Kirill Bensonoff, has said that the recent surge in the bitcoin prices has been largely due to a large buying order to the tune of millions of dollars, believed to be around $100 million.

A similar surge in the per unit prices of other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Litecoin has been observed following the rally in bitcoin prices. The weekly return of bitcoin has soared to 26 per cent.

The dealing and trading in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have been disturbed after the stern warnings from the central bank, Ministry of Finance, Union Finance Minister. The Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said that bitcoin is not a legal tender and further cautioned investors as it is not regulated by any governing body.

In 2018, the Reserve Bank of India cautioned and warned the users about the risks associated with buying and selling virtual currencies such as bitcoin. In April 2018, the RBI ordered all the financial institutions, regulated by it, to cut the ties with individuals or entities dealing in virtual currencies within three months.

Earlier last year itself, the founders of Unocoin, a blockchain solutions firm, -- Sathvik Viswanath and B V Harish -- were arrested by Central Crime Branch after their company Unocoin Technologies set up a bitcoin ATM kiosk in Bangalore without getting necessary approvals and going against the stern warnings of RBI.
