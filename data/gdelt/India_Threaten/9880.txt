Payal Rohatgi says police blocked her on Twitter; CM’s wife joins discussion

The Mumbai Police on Thursday found themselves in the eye of the proverbial storm, after actor Payal Rohatgi claimed that they had blocked her from viewing their Twitter feed. While the police denied the allegation, the matter got complicated with the Chief Minister’s wife entering the conversation.

Ms. Rohtagi, from her official Twitter account, said, “Why has @MumbaiPolice blocked me ? Are U BFF with drug accused jailed minority tag actor As a #Hindu I am scared to live in Hindustan if Police has such baised behaviour. Now I understand why my family tells me 2 stop talking 4 Hindus @Sangram_Sanjeet @PMOIndia @HMOIndia (sic).”

She said actor Ajaz Khan “made a derogatory video” targeting her publicly in the media due to her pro-Hindu beliefs. She retweeted the video from her account, tagging the police, and claimed that this had led to her being blocked.

Even as Twitterati jumped into the fray, posting supportive and critical views, the actor emailed Union Home Minister Amit Shah, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, and his wife Amruta.

Ms. Fadnavis publicly endorsed Ms. Rohatgi, saying, “A citizen expressing personal views (not intending to hurt religious sentiments) on social media - should not be blocked by public entities/organisations. Request @MumbaiPolice to look into the issue of @Payal_Rohatgi (sic).”

However, the police did not apologise to the actor or accept having blocked her. Instead, they claimed that there was a “technical discrepancy”.

“Ma’am, Mumbai police has always stood for all citizens alike. Your account is open for access & as a policy and practice, we never restrict interaction with any Mumbaikar. Our technical team is investigating any discrepancy. We regret your experience (sic),” the police tweeted.

An officer with the Mumbai Police said the technical team of the web cell has been instructed to look into the matter and submit a report.
