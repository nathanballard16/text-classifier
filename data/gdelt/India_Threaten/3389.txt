ISLAMABAD: Opposition leader in the National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif said the entire nation is united and speaking with one voice.

“We should join our voices to convey a clear message to New Delhi and Modi that Pakistan is united and the entire nation is speaking with one voice. And taking all steps and measures to protect Pakistan’s vital interests. Pakistan will not tolerate any nonsense from the eastern border,” Sharif said during the joint session of Parliament on Thursday.

Shehbaz Sharif lauded the armed forces for their action against Indian Air Force warplanes.

"PAF fighters have made the nation proud," he said while adding that it has been proven that our armed forces will defend every corner.

The opposition leader warned that there can never be peace in Kashmir if occupied forces oppress citizens. "In this situation, I believe more Burhan Wanis will be born," he said.

Shehbaz asserted, "Pakistan should continue its diplomatic support to Kashmiris." He added, "We have to set our house in order to support Kashmiris."

"Kashmir issued should be resolved in accordance with the wishes of Kashmiris," he upheld.

During his address, Sharif was critical of the government’s decision to attend the OIC meeting in Abu Dhabi and not boycotting due to the invitation to Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj.

Prior to Sharif, Prime Minister Imran Khan addressed the session and cautioned India not to escalate the situation further. The prime minister stressed that Pakistan’s efforts should not be considered as weakness and called on the international community to play its role.

The prime minister also announced that the captured Indian soldier would be released tomorrow as a peace gesture.
