Google: Nearly 500 users in India warned of govt-backed phishing attacks in 3 months

Google sent out more than 12,000 warnings to users globally, including nearly 500 in India, between July and September this year to sound them out against being targeted by “government-backed attackers”.

Over 90 per cent of these users were targeted via ‘credential phishing emails’… These are usually attempts to obtain the target’s password or other account credentials to hijack their account.
