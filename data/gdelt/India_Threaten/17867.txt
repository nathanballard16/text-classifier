India Conducts Third Test in 24 Hours of Missile System Designated for Limited War with Pakistan

The upgraded version of the Pinaka-guided rocket system was test-fired from the DRDO’s Proof and Experimental Establishment Firing Test Range while the QR-SAM was tested from a mobile launcher at a launch complex of the Integrated Test Range.

QR-SAM can receive enemy radars and is capable of destroying aerial targets, tanks, bunkers and short-range missiles. Also, developed by DRDO, the missile has a strike range of 25 km to 30 km. It uses solid-fuel propellants and has the capability of engaging multiple targets.

The all-weather and all-terrain missile, which can be mounted on a truck and stored in a canister, is equipped with electronic countermeasures against jamming by aircraft radars.

The DRDO has been conducting a series of tests on the country's new missile system for the past month against the backdrop of mounting tensions at the western border along the Line of Control.

On Tuesday, the DRDO, Indian Air Force (IAF), and BrahMos jointly successfully conducted two BrahMos supersonic cruise missiles tests, one each from land and air platforms.

Indian Army Chief Gen. Bipin Rawat, on Wednesday, had warned that the situation could escalate at any time with Pakistan. The Pakistan military has also said that it is ready to respond to India in case of any misadventures by New Delhi.
