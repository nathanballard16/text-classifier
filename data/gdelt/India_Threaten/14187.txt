LUCKNOW: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra would be reaching Lucknow on Tuesday, in what could further escalate the ongoing stand-off between ruling BJP and Congress over the Shahjahanpur case.On Monday, the state government had foiled Congress' plan to hold a nyay padyatra from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow while house-arresting senior leaders including former MP Jitin Prasada besides detaining Congress legislative party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu Priyanka is scheduled to participate in the padyatra organised by the party to mark 150th birth anniversary of Mahatama Gandhi.Confirming the development, Ajay Kumar Lallu said that the party hopes to get relevant permission from the district authorities to hold the shanti yatra.Ajay Lallu also said that Congress would boycott the state assembly's special session on 150th Gandhi Jayanti . "Gandhi ji stood for truth, non-violence and justice none of which the BJP believes in," he said.Citing the example of government's action against Congress' Shahjahanpur Nyay Yatra, he stated: "The cancel order was served to at 1 am on the night before the yatra was to begin. Also, government's stand in the case has sided the accused former minister instead of the victim girl."
