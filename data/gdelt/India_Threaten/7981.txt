Rahul Gandhi news: ‘Don’t fall into BJP trap’, Lalu, Stalin tell Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: For the first time since Congress president Rahul Gandhi dropped the resignation bombshell, allies weighed in on the issue on Tuesday, with DMK chief Stalin and RJD leader Lalu Prasad issuing public statements that the Gandhi scion should continue to lead his party and quitting would be like walking into BJP’s trap.As confusion prevailed over Rahul Gandhi’s status for the fourth day, indications were that the issue of resignation has been put off for the moment. The party is planning an organisational overhaul of AICC which would be followed by appointments in the election-going states of Maharashtra, Jharkhand and Haryana.On Tuesday, Stalin spoke to Rahul over the phone and appealed to him “to give up the idea of resigning as Congress president”.According to DMK, Stalin told Rahul that while Congress had lost the polls, “you have won the hearts of the people”.At the same time, RJD supremo Lalu Prasad termed Rahul’s offer to resign as amounting to “falling into BJP’s trap”. He said it would be suicidal not just for Congress but all the social and political forces fighting against RSS.The RJD leader’s views formed part of an election analysis he shared on his Twitter handle. He warned if a non-Gandhi was installed in Congress as party chief, the BJP brass of Narendra Modi-Amit Shah would paint him as a puppet, remote-controlled by the Gandhi family.“The result in a particular election can never alter the reality in as diverse and plural a country as India,” Prasad said.As the stalemate appeared to continue, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot and state unit chief Sachin Pilot visited Rahul’s residence on Tuesday. Sources said they met AICC general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra and not the Congress president.
