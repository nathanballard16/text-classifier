PM Imran cautions AJK residents against crossing LoC, says will aid Indian narrative

I understand the anguish of the Kashmiris in AJK seeing their fellow Kashmiris in IOJK under an inhumane curfew for over 2 months. But any one crossing the LoC from AJK to provide humanitarian aid or support for Kashmiri struggle will play into the hands of the Indian narrative -

a narrative that tries to divert from the indigenous Kashmiris' struggle against brutal Indian Occupation by trying to label it as "Islamic terrorism" being driven by Pakistan. It will give India an excuse to increase violent oppression of Kashmiris in IOJK & attack across LoC

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday again cautioned the people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) against crossing the Line of Control (LoC) to support the struggle of the people of Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK).On August 5, India revoked occupied Kashmir's autonomy, dividing the disputed territory into two regions to be controlled by New Delhi. A draconian lockdown was imposed in the region and all communications were cut. The clampdown has entered its third month with reports of mass detentions and human rights abuses.The premier, in a tweet, said he understands the anguish of the people of AJK seeing their fellow Kashmiris in IOK under an inhumane curfew for over two months.Advising the people not to play into the hands of Indian narrative, he said any attempt to cross the disputed border to provide humanitarian aid or support "will give India an excuse to increase violent oppression of Kashmiris in IOJK & attack across LoC".The prime minister added that Indian narrative tries to divert attention from the indigenous struggle of the Kashmiris against brutal Indian occupation by trying to label it as "Islamic terrorism" being driven by Pakistan.Earlier in September, the premier had said that any bid to “wage jihad in Kashmir” would be an act of extreme enmity towards the Kashmiris, he said, adding: “Anyone, who thinks that he will cross the border to join the Kashmiris [fighting for their right], is a big enemy of them and Pakistan.”After the August 5 illegal move, India sent in tens of thousands of extra troops and detained thousands of people including minors as young as nine.Many of the region’s top politicians remain in custody. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said last month she was “deeply concerned” while Washington has called for a “rapid” lifting of restrictions.
