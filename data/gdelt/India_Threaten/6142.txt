NEW DELHI: Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi on Saturday refuted the allegations of sexual harassment levelled against him at a special bench hearing of the Supreme Court and asked the media to show restraint in reporting the subject.On Saturday morning, SC bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi, Justices Arun Mishra and Sanjiv Khanna announced that it would hear a "matter of great public importance", mentioned by solicitor general Tushar Mehta.The case relates to a few web-based media reports on sexual harassment allegations made by a woman against the CJI.The CJI during the hearing said there was a larger conspiracy to destabilise the judiciary which has remained independent. "There is some bigger force behind the woman, with a criminal track record, making sexual harassment charges (against him)", said the CJI.CJI Gogoi said that after 20 years of selfless service in judiciary he has a bank balance of Rs 6.80 lakh and Rs 40 lakh in his provident fund. "As the forces did not find anything against me, they have used this unscrupulous woman to level charges against me," said the CJI.Speculating the reasons behind the allegations, CJI Gogoi said that as he was to hear important cases next week and this was an attempt to dissuade him from hearing the important matters.Next week the CJI is scheduled to hear a contempt petition against Congress president Rahul Gandhi , release of the biopic made on PM Narendra Modi and also the petition seeking deferment of elections in Tamil Nadu on the charge of huge bribes being paid to voters.He said that some media outlets published unverified charges made by a woman who had criminal antecedents and had spent four days in jail because of her criminal record. CJI added that the woman had been warned against her behaviour by the police as well.CJI Gogoi recused from passing orders while the other two judges -Justices Mishra and Khanna - requested media to act responsibly and with wisdom and not publish the woman's complaint without verifying its truth.
