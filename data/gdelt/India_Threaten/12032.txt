Do not harass drivers unnecessarily on highways Mamata warns police

Kolkata: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee warned the police on Wednesday against harassing drivers and transporters on highways. During the meeting, Banerjee said she had received several complaints against police for harassing drivers. "The drivers may commit mistakes but cases are given against them arbitrarily. Once it is constructed the people visiting Digha will be visiting the temple and the place will be developed as a centre of religious tourism," she said. Ramnagar I and II, Contai I and II and Khejuri blocks are famous for betel nut, whose export is going up.
