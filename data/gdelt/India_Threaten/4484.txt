Mumbai: Raj Thackeray-led Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Sunday announced that the party will not contest the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections. In an official statement, the party said that it would not field its candidates for the upcoming general elections and would provide more details on the matter on March 19 (Tuesday).

“Everyone please take note that MNS has decided not to contest Lok Sabha 2019 elections. Rest will be discussed on March 19,” a press statement by the party said.

Thackeray is expected to hold a meeting with party leaders and workers on Tuesday (March 19) to brief them regarding the decision, a local daily reported. Meanwhile, reports suggested that the MNS could provide external support to the Nationalist Congress Party, led by Sharad Pawar, in Maharashtra.

On March 9, when the party observed its foundation day, Thackeray, cousin of Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, had refused to comment on what the party's role would be in the national elections. Presently, the party hold's a single seat out of the 288 Assembly seats in the state.

As per reports, NCP leaders Sharad Pawar and Ajit Pawar were keen to have Thackeray's MNS join the Congress-NCP alliance in Maharashtra in the run-up to the polls. However, the Congress reportedly refused to tie-up with the MNS in Maharashtra. Following Congress' refusal, Sharad Pawar and Thackeray are said to have met a couple of times in the past few days.
