Congress: CAA will hit diplomatic ties

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday dubbed the CAA discriminatory and violative of the Constitution which also imperils India’s diplomatic relationships as it questioned the Centre’s move to accept refugees from only three Islamic countries in the entire neighbourhood.AICC spokesman and lawyer Abhishek Singhvi told reporters that the CAA was objectionable on multiple grounds, prominent being violation of constitutional principles, international norms and two promises made by the Centre to the northeast. “Congress will not back down from this fight because CAA strikes at the foundation of India,” he said.Briefing about the petition filed by party member Jairam Ramesh against the CAA, Singhvi said selectively picking “persecuted minorities” from three countries creates an iniquitous system of providing citizenship. He questioned why Tamils from Sri Lanka , who are Hindu, and Christians and Buddhists from Bhutan and China have been excluded from the CAA’s purview.Singhvi said the iniquitous system was violative of global humanitarian laws as well as the Torture Convention to which India is a signatory. Also, Singhvi said the cut-off date of 2014 in the CAA violates Section 5.8 of Assam Accord and the All Tripura Tribal Force, two promises made by the Centre to the northeast in which the year mentioned is 1971. “How has it changed from 1971 to 2014,” he asked.
