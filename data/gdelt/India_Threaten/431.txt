Top cop, collector hold meeting with stamp vendors

VADODARA: City police commissioner Anupamsinh Gahlaut and district collector Shalini Agrawal on Wednesday met the stamp vendors and all the sub-registrars of the district in the city. The police and district administration directed the stamp vendors and sub-registrars to follow all the rules while issuing stamp papers and validating the property deals. The move seems to be a fallout of the high profile cheating case filed by a NRI Lopa Dave at the crime branch.During investigations, the involvement of a stamp vendor and notary surfaced in the cheating worth crores of rupees. Both Gahlaut and Agrawal also informed the stamp vendors about the fallout of selling stamp papers illegally and committing irregularities in property sale. The revenue department had earlier formed 18 separate teams to examine licenses of stamp vendors, registers recording stamp paper sale and purchase and their current stock of stamp papers.The stamp vendors and notaries were warned that if the administration finds any irregularities during the examination then action will follow. The administration has also decided to hold such meetings with stamp vendors and notaries regularly. Agrawal said that only the owner of the property or some person authorized by him or her should do the transaction. She also said that strict steps will be taken against those indulging in any type of cheating during the property dealings.Gahlaut said that usually in cases of cheating related to property deals, old stamp papers are used. He added that for deals done in 2018, stamp papers as old as five years were used whereas one has to get stamp papers revalidated after a period of six months. The sub-registrar will have to stop all the work related to any property dealing against which any complaint has been filed.
