The source report suggests that the Pune-based two-wheeler brand is currently awaiting the certification. The updated model range will arrive in the market by early 2020. Meanwhile, the company will aim to clear the existing stock of BS-IV range.

The upcoming Pulsar motorcycles will use fuel injection system, among other updates, to comply with the more stringent, BS-VI emission norms. The performance numbers are not likely to change drastically over the current models. The Pulsar family currently comprises nine bikes – ranging from the entry-level 125 to the RS200.

Check out the price list (ex-showroom Delhi) of the existing range below:

Model (ABS Variants) New Price Pulsar 125 INR 64,000 Pulsar 150 Neon INR 71,200 Pulsar 150 Classic INR 84,960 Pulsar 150 Twin Disc INR 88,838 Pulsar 180F INR 95,290 Pulsar 220F INR 1,07,027 Pulsar NS160 INR 82,624 Pulsar NS160 Twin Disc INR 93,094 Pulsar NS200 INR 1,13,056 Pulsar RS200 INR 1,40,237

Expect the addition of the new hardware to add 10-15% to the existing prices. India Yamaha Motors, too, expects a similar price increase on its BS-VI range that will start to roll into the showrooms from November this year. Regular readers would know that the government has set 1 April 2020 as the deadline to comply with the BS-VI emission norms.

Meanwhile, Bajaj Auto is also working on its scooter range that will arrive under the Urbanite brand. The upcoming range from the Pune-based brand will come in two versions – Petrol and Electric. The upcoming products have been photographed on various occasions in the past. The Urbanite range will come with retro-style scooters that will most likely compete in the 125 cc space. The 100-110 cc segment is heavily dominated by the Honda Activa. Once launched, the Urbanite branded products will compete against the Suzuki Access 125 and the Vespa 125 range.
