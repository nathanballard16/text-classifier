Viral Acharya: A strong votary of central bank's independence

Citing an Argentinian example, where governor Martin Redrados resignation over differences with the government was not taken kindly, Acharya had warned of the consequences that await. Governments that do not respect central bank's independence will sooner or later incur the wrath of financial markets, ignite economic fires, and come to rue the day they undermined an important regulatory institution; their wiser counterparts who invest in central bank independence will enjoy lower costs of borrowing, the love of international investors, and longer life spans, he had said in the October 26, 2018 speech delivered in Mumbai.

Viral Acharya was a strong believer in the central bank's independence and autonomy, which he considered crucial for economic progress and financial stability, and had even warned that any government undermining their monetary authorities would face the wrath of financial markets and economic fires. Acharya, who has quit six months before his three-year term as the deputy governor in-charge of the monetary policy department ends, had said many nations are seeing the central bank independence being compromised and asserted that independent central bankers will remain undeterred. The Reserve Bank has gone through a tumultuous time in the past two and half years, starting with a change in policymaking where rate-setting shifted to a six member panel that experts commended as a step in the right direction, to the surprise resignation of Governor Urjit Patel in December 2018. Speculation about Acharyas exit had started on the day of his boss resignation, forcing the RBI to deny it then. Acharya went public with his thinking on the sensitive topic of central bank independence during a speech at the peak of the run-ins between the Mint Road and the Government that culminated in Patels departure in December 10 last which included specific mentions of points of differences like government eying RBIs capital buffers.
