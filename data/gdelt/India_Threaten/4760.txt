Leaving A Li'l Mark

Every general election, a quaint Mysore company makes its way unfailingly into the newspapers. And, why not? After all, Mysore Paints and Varnish Ltd makes a humble little product so vital to an election—indelible ink. As most things Mysore, this government-run paint company too traces its days back to the city’s golden age of ­enterprise, helmed by Krishnaraja Wodeyar IV. It was set up in 1937 and has been supplying indelible ink to every election since 1962. Over 4.5 billion voters in India and elsewhere have been inked so far, says the firm. This election, MPVL rec­eived an order for 26 lakh vials of indelible ink. Each 10 ml vial can ink 700 voters. That’s good enough for 1.8 billion voters…twice the size of India’s 900-m-strong electorate!
