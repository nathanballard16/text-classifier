Two men who stole 100 new cars held

New Delhi, May 16 : Two men who were involved in stealing 100 new cars over the past two decades in Delhi and adjoining states have been finally arrested, a police officer said on Thursday.

Kunal, 40, a resident of Amar Colony here, and Shahid, 35, who hails from Uttar Pradesh's Muzaffarnagar, were caught on Wednesday night near the Hedgewar Hospital in Shahdara when they had come to steal a new Maruti Suzuki Brezza car.

Four new stolen Brezza cars were recovered from them.

"Working on a tip off, a trap was laid by the police," Deputy Commissioner of Police Meghna Yadav said.

"Our men asked them to surrender but they did not. Instead, Kunal and Shahid reversed their stolen car and hit the police vehicle. They also sped past three policemen. They showed a toy gun and tried to escape but were apprehended," Yadav said.

During interrogation, Kunal disclosed that he had stolen 100 new cars. Police said he was an expert in stealing a car within eight to 10 minutes.

He would sell the car to his contacts for Rs 50-60,000.

While stealing cars, Kunal always put on a mask so that he was not recognized in CCTV footage and wore gloves to avoid leaving fingerprints, the officer added.
