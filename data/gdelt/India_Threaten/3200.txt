A day after an air strike by the Indian Air Force on a terrorist camp in Balakot, America has warned Pakistan to take action against terrorism mushrooming on its soil.

Pakistan must act against the terrorist organisations, warned the USA on Wednesday.

After an air strike by the Indian Air Force (IAF) on a terrorist camp in Balakot, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has called a meeting of the National Command Authority (NCA) on Wednesday.

NCA controls the country's nuclear arsenal. Imran Khan has also called a joint meeting of Parliament.

In a pinpointed and swift air strike that lasted less than two minutes, India pounded Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp in Pakistan early Tuesday, killing up to 350 terrorists and trainers who were moved there for their protection after the Pulwama attack, officials said, reported PTI.

The pre-dawn operation described as "non-military" and "preemptive" struck a five-star resort-style camp on a hilltop forest that provided a dozen Mirage 2000 fighter jets of the IAF with a "sitting duck target" and caught the terrorists in their sleep, sources said.

After the 1971 war, the strike is the first by the IAF inside Pakistan.
