No deadline for EV transition

Leading two- and three-wheeler makers had opposed the proposal, stating that the transition was totally uncalled for which would hurt the industry and trigger job loss.

New Delhi: Echoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent assurance to the automobile industry on the issue of transition to electric vehicles, a top government official on Wednesday said the Centre has not set any deadline for change-over.

In a media interview earlier this month, Mr Modi had said that India has a large enough market and big enough policy space to ensure growth of internal combustion engine (ICE)-based automobiles and electric vehicles (EV).

“There is no need to speculate about the growth of either of the two. We are in a unique situation where both ICE and EV-based automobiles can co-exist, co-create and learn from each other,” he had said.

Now the official has reiterated the government stand on the issue.

The Niti Aayog has suggested transition to full electric vehicles for three-wheelers by 2023 and two-wheelers with an engine capacity of less than 150cc by 2025.

Moreover, in June it had asked conventional two- and three-wheeler makers to suggest within two weeks concrete steps for transition towards electric mobility keeping in mind 2025 deadline.

However, on Wednesday, replying to a question on this, the official said, "There is no such deadline."

Leading two- and three-wheeler makers had opposed the proposal, stating that the transition was totally uncalled for which would hurt the industry and trigger job loss. They had called for deliberations with all stakeholders before the adoption of EVs instead of imposition of such green vehicles.
