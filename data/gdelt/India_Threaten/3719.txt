The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) in Hyderabad on Monday issued a heat wave warning for Rayalaseema and the South Coastal region of Andhra Pradesh for the next two days. This comes as temperatures are set to soar steadily across the state.

The heat wave across the Rayalaseema region which is already witnessing temperatures of up to 39 degrees will increase in the region by another 2 to 3 degrees. Anantapur, Kurnool and Nandyal districts also registered high temperatures ranging between 38 to 39 degrees.

The heatwave condition will now intensify as dry weather is prevailing across the state. Some parts of north coastal Andhra may witness thunderstorm activity. Notwithstanding this, temperatures will go up and humidity will also intensify. As days go by coastal Andhra Pradesh will experience heatwave conditions,“ said K Nagarathna, weather forecasting officer with IMD to The New Indian Express.

However, in sharp contrast to the heat wave warning, the IMD has also issued a thunderstorm warning for north coastal Andhra Pradesh for Wednesday and Thursday.

The IMD predicts that for the next four days, light to moderate rain and thundershowers are likely to hit the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh due to a convergent activity over the Bay of Bengal.

Districts such as Srikakulam, Vizianagaram, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari and West Godavari can expect thunderstorms. Isolated places, mostly in the north coastal region could also expect light to moderate showers.
