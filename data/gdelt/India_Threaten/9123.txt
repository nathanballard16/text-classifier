4 held for killing woman

Body was found in Badwali Lake

Four persons have been arrested in connection with the murder of a woman whose decomposed body was recovered from a bag in Badwali Lake here earlier this month, the police said on Sunday.

Prime accused Surjeet had a grudge against the victim, Manisha, for blackmailing him and breaking his engagement, they said. Manisha had called the family of another accused Vimal and abused them. The other two accused in the case have been identified as Bhim Singh and Prince.

On June 13, the National Disaster Response Force team discovered the body while trying to recover a man’s body from the lake, also called the Death Valley. The man, Sachin, a resident of Parvatiya Colony was upset over his NIIT result and killed himself.

The police have ruled out any connection between the two deaths.

Manisha’s body was identified on June 19. Her father told the police that his daughter worked at a beauty parlour and was friends with Surjeet and Vimal. He also said Surjeet had threatened to kill Manisha, the police said.

Surjeet and Vimal were nabbed from Palla Pull in Faridabad on June 22.

Surjeet confessed to his involvement in the crime and told the police that he along with his three associates had conspired to kill Manisha. The four had gathered at the rented accommodation of Surjeet in Old Faridabad on June 9 and hatched the plan, the police added.

Next day, Surjeet and Vimal reached the rented accommodation of Manisha at Atmadpur village and strangled her. The duo hid the body in the bathroom. Later, the accused stuffed the body inside a bag and threw it into Badwali Lake.

The accused were produced before a court on Sunday and remanded in four days police custody.
