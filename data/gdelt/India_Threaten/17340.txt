New Delhi [India], Dec 13 (ANI): Maritime security is not the responsibility of one state and the cooperation of other countries is necessary, said Maldives Foreign Secretary Abdul Ghafoor Mohamed here on Friday.

"Maritime is a multi-faceted issue. Given the massive volume of trade, the security of Indian Ocean is crucial. It requires all countries to cooperate together. Maritime security cannot be a responsibility of one state," said Mohamed, while speaking to ANI.

Mohamed said: "If one country's shipping is endangered, it endangers shipping of other countries as well. So cooperation is essential. There has to be an eagerness to find solutions to combat emerging problems."

Maritime security is being threatened by maritime smuggling, illegal migration, drug trafficking, transnational crime and maritime terrorism.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an event last week had said that as a close friend and maritime neighbour, India is committed to partnering with the Maldives for its development.

"India-Maldives cooperation has gone to a different level since the formation of the new government. We have regained the momentum. It includes cooperation in maritime affairs, trying to make maritime a more peaceful and secure place," said Mohammed.

India and the Maldives concluded the 6th joint commission meeting after signing three MoU and agreements.

India is undertaking a number of major projects and also providing training in human resources development, capacity building, different infrastructural projects. It has also energised Indo-Maldives relationship in recent months.

The theme for Indian Ocean Dialogue is -- Indo-Pacific: Re-imagining the Indian Ocean through an Expanded Geography. It also hosts Delhi Dialogue XI.

For the first time, these two dialogues are being held consecutively on similar Indo-Pacific themes. (ANI)
