Responsibility of High Court

Responsibilities of Bar Councils

The general superintendence, of the ethics and etiquette of the members of the profession, is the responsibility of the State Bar Council created under the 1961 Act, and a statutory duty is imposed on it to ensure that the rules laid down by the Bar Council of India, in this regard, are upheld and not violated.

The State Bar Council is duty bound to enforce discipline among its members, and to take disciplinary action for acts of misconduct by the concerned Advocates. As calls for strikes/boycott of Courts amounts to misconduct, any such call, given by the Bar Associations, would require the State Bar Council to initiate disciplinary action against the office bearers of such a Bar Association who, by giving such a call, have instigated and encouraged other Advocates to follow suit.

One of the principal functions of the State Bar Council is to receive complaints against advocates, and if it has reasons to believe that any advocate has been guilty of professional or other misconduct, it shall then refer the case for disposal to its Disciplinary Committee.

The State Bar Council's role in this regard is first to receive complaints, second, in forming the reasonable belief of guilt of professional or other misconduct, and finally in making a reference of the case to its Disciplinary Committee.

The Bar Council of a State, which initiates disciplinary proceedings, may also of its own motion, if it has reason to believe that any Advocate has been guilty of professional or other misconduct, refer the case for disposal to its Disciplinary Committee.

The State Bar Council is obligated, with a view to maintain discipline, to complete the disciplinary proceedings, initiated against the errant Advocates; and, if the Advocate concerned is found guilty of having indulged in, or in calling upon others to go on, strike/boycott of Courts, to impose appropriate punishment upon them within a reasonable time frame of around three months. The State Bar Council also has the power to take action against the Bar Associations under the Advocates Welfare Fund Act, 2001, and to de-recognize errant Bar Associations.Section 7(1) of the 1961 Act obligates the Bar Council of India to lay down standards of professional conduct and etiquette for Advocates, and to exercise general supervision and control over the State Bar Council.Besides its duty to supervise and control the working of the State Bar Council, the Bar Council of India is required to exercise discipline and control over members of the profession.When it is made aware that the concerned State Bar Council has not taken action against Advocates, who have gone on strikes, prompt action should be taken by the Bar Council of India both against the State Bar Council and the concerned Advocates.In its Resolution dated 29.09.2002, the Bar Council of India has held that abstention of work in Courts should not be resorted to, except in exceptional circumstances; and, even in such exceptional circumstances, abstention should, normally, not be resorted to for more than one dayThe said Resolution also provides that, as far as possible, legal and constitutional methods should be pursued such as representation to the authorities, holding demonstrations and mobilizing public opinion etc. It also provides that, in case the Bar Associations deviate from the said resolution dated 29.09.2002 and proceed with cessation of work, except in the case of emergency, the Bar Council of the State should take necessary action.
