India on Alert as Afghan Origin Terrorists Enter Kashmir

The Indian government has alerted its security agencies in northern states, including Jammu and Kashmir after intelligence reports suggested that Afghan-origin, Pashto-speaking terrorists have entered the country. Intelligence agencies have also observed an increase in the number of non-Kashmiri and non-Urdu speaking terrorists in the Kashmir valley recently.

The report warned of the presence of "non-Kashmiri and non-Urdu speaking (Afghan and Pashto speaking) terrorists in Kashmir". Government sources said that security agencies had been asked to provide input on the targeted action against them.

Agencies fear that Pakistan has been actively taking an interest in vitiating the atmosphere in Jammu and Kashmir.

Sources say that instructions were issued to dreaded terrorist commanders operating in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa area to maintain the preparedness of their members to perpetrate jihad (holy war) suicide attacks in the Kashmir valley.
