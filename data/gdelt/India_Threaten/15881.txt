While talking to the press on Sunday, he has said that Owaisi is always attacking India and Hindus.

Mahant Narendra Giri said that if Owaisi does not like India, he should go to Pakistan. Mahant Narendra Giri said that if Owaisi uses such language again, Sant Samaj and Akhara Council will not tolerate it. He accused Owaisi of always despising Hindus and saints. He has said that if Owaisi has to live in India, then the Constitution of India and the judiciary must obey and respect it.
