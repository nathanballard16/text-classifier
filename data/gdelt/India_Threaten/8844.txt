West Bengal doctor strike: Mamata directs formation of grievance redressal units in all West Bengal hospitals: Highlights

* During the meeting with the representatives of doctors in Nabanna, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday directed Kolkata police commissioner Anuj Sharma to deploy a nodal police officer in every hospital.* The chief minister also accepted the proposal of doctors to set up grievance redressal cells in all the government hospitals in the state.* Earlier, Mamata Banerjee gave consent for live coverage of the proposed meeting with agitating junior doctors on Monday, paving way for a solution to the week-long impasse. The state government had earlier turned down the striking doctors' demand for live telecast of the meeting.* The CM met two representatives from each medical college of the state in Nabanna later on Monday.* Banerjee on Saturday had extended an olive branch to the agitating doctors by promising not to invoke the stringent Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) and appealed to them to resume work immediately.* She also said that the state government would bear all medical expenses for the treatment of the two junior doctors, who were assaulted in a Kolkata hospital that triggered the strike.* The Resident Doctors' Association (RDA) of AIIMS announced on Monday that it will withdraw elective services from 12 noon today till 6 am on Tuesday, thus joining the nationwide strike. However, on Sunday, AIIMS had said that it will not participate in Monday's strike by doctors.* Emergency services including casualty, ICU and labour room services at AIIMS will however not be affected.* AIIMS' decision changed following allegations that a junior resident doctor at the emergency department of Jai Prakash Narain Apex Trauma Centre (JPNATC) at AIIMS, Delhi was abused by the relatives of a patient at around 1:30 am on Sunday for "performing his rightful duty of giving preferential care to a critical patient."* In the RDA statement, doctors observed,"... this event made us rethink about the warfront like conditions faced by our fellow medicos elsewhere, where they are usually left alone to fight for their lives while saving those of the sick and even where the basic security measures like CCTV surveillance and special security deployment at Emergency and ICU's are nonexistent."* The RDA further urged the West Bengal administration to fulfill the demands of striking doctors and resolve the matter amicably at the earliest. Indian Medical Association (IMA), country's largest medical body is holding a nationwide strike today against the alleged attacks on doctors in West Bengal.* Doctors have urged for the formulation of a comprehensive law for the enactment of protection law for the doctors and amendment in the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). It also wants security measures to be specified.* The doctors' strike in West Bengal has entered its seventh day today and has spread to other parts of the country.* Doctors at Jaipuria Hospital in Jaipur are also on strike today. Doctors at Sir Sayajirao General Hospital in Vadodara held protest outside Out Patient Department today. Doctors at IGIMS, Patna, Victoria hospital, Banglore , Guwahati Medical College Hospital, Ludhiana Civil Hospital, PGI Chandigarh, and RIMS Ranchi were among those who held protests.* Meanwhile, Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday, a PIL filed by Alok Shrivastav, seeking provisions for security and protection of the doctors. Srivastava has further sought strictest action against the alleged attackers who assaulted a junior doctor at NRS Hospital, Kolkata.* Kolkata's NRS Medical College has been the epicentre of the recent stand-off as well as its origin, where the murderous assault on two young interns — Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani — on June 10 set in motion the sequence of events leading to the paralysed state of Bengal’s public-sector healthcare system and affecting other states too.* The major cause of why the stand-off has lasted for a week now is the stalemate situation between the striking doctors in Bengal and the Mamata Banerjee-led government. For a week, the doctors and the state government have gone back on forth on holding talks but have failed to materialise a face-to-face meeting.* Now, the striking junior doctors in Bengal have agreed to hold talks with CM Banerjee and has asked her to choose a venue for the meeting. The doctors have expressed willingness to join work, "as early as possible in the best interest of the common people once our demands are addressed".
