Sitaram Yechury, a local get conditional Supreme Court nod to visit Kashmir

Amid the ongoing clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir, the Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed two persons — a son seeking to enquire the well-being of his parents and CPI(M) leader Sitaram Yechury who wanted to check on the health of his party colleague — to visit the new Union Territory and submit a report about their experience after returning.

This was a novel method adopted by a bench who was faced with two habeas corpus petitions filed by a Jamia University law student Mohammed Aleem Syed and the CPI (M) leader, who was worried about the health of his colleague and former member of J&K Assembly Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami.

Without questioning the present clampdown, the bench asked the lawyers appearing for the two petitioners, "What is the position today?" followed by another query, "Would you like to go to J&K?"

Appearing for Syed, senior advocate Sanjay Hedge said that he would love to, but the clampdown posed a challenge. "You have a right to visit your parents and enquire their well being." Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appearing for Yechury, sought permission to bring Tarigami to AIIMS Delhi. The Court directed Imtiaz, SSP, Security in J&K to facilitate visit and provide security to both petitioners.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Court that Yechury's visit will adversely affect the situation in the state where normalcy is returning. So the bench put strict conditions on both petitioners, extracting an undertaking from Yechury that he will go for no purpose other than to visit his colleague. Both petitioners have to submit a report to Court upon return.

Meanwhile, The apex bench also sought an affidavit from the Centre on the two petitions that have questioned the clampdown, within a week.
