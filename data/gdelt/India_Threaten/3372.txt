India-Pakistan: Author Sees Opportunity for Lowering Tension Amid Chaos

This afternoon, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan issued a statement saying that a war isn't in anybody's interest and let's talk and let's try and do any kind of reconciliation that's possible. And despite the fact that today the two air forces almost had a dogfight over Indian airspace in the morning. Both sides have lost at least one aircraft, and one of the Indian pilots is in Pakistan's custody as we speak. Therefore, I see that in this chaos there is an opportunity for lowering the tension in the coming 48 to 72 hours.

Sputnik: India's Foreign Ministry says the airstrike was absolutely necessary due to what it said was Pakistan's inability to destroy terrorist infrastructure. What is your take on this? Was this violation of Pakistani airspace justified?

Nitin Gokhale: It was justified because for years, especially after the Punjab attack, India had asked Pakistan for big action against Jaish-e-Mohammad leader and these soldiers, the terrorists southward. And yet, Pakistan didn't take any visible action or show any intent to do anything against them. And then India had definite information intelligence from both its human intelligence sources and technical intelligence that the same outfit was trying more suicide attacks in the coming weeks and days.

And therefore India had to take the preventive actions. Therefore India didn't use this term; it was a non-military preventive action against a specific target, not against the Pakistani military or against Pakistani civilians. Therefore I think it was very well-justified.

Sputnik: New Delhi has repeatedly accused Islamabad of harbouring terrorists, while Pakistan denies the charges. However, Pakistan has recently confirmed that it is ready to cooperate with New Delhi on the Kashmir attack. In view of this, how likely is the situation to get worse?
