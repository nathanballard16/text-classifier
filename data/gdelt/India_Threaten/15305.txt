A 34-year-old jeweller in Manimajra was arrested for allegedly firing in the air outside his shop on the Diwali day. Nikhil Bansal was arrested and granted bail from the court of a duty magistrate on Sunday. The incident happened on Saturday, when Nikhil fired a gunshot with the double barrel gun of one of the security guards outside his jewellery showroom, Sparkle Diamonds, at NAC Market, Manimajra.

The double-barrel gun along with the empty shell was seized. Police registered a case of endangering the life with dangerous act and under Arms Act at PS Manimajra.

A police officer said, “By the time the police reached the spot, Nikhil Bansal had gone to his house. The security guard, Mahesh Tiwari, was questioned and he confirmed the incident. The guard claimed that he tried to stop Nikhil Bansal but he fired in the air. Though Nikhil Bansal denied the incident, when he countered with the guard and other witnesses, he had to confess.”

The incident was also captured in the CCTV cameras installed at the NAC market.

‘The double barrel gun was seized along with a live cartridge, which was already in the gun. A report will be send to the Chandigarh deputy commissioner with the recommendation of cancellation of arm license issued to guard Mahesh Tiwari.” the officer said.

SHO Manimajra, Inspector Jaswinder Kaur, is probing the case.

The double barrel gun belongs to the private security agency, which provided the guards for jewellery showroom. Police said when firing took place, neither guard Mahesh Tiwari or Nikhil Bansal was possessing any arm license. The license was produced later.
