UP Govt To Take Strict Action Against Hindu Men For Having Extra-Marital Affair, Says CM Yogi

Uttar Pradesh is witnessing a spurt in triple talaq cases, with over 216 FIRs filed by Muslim women since the enactment of a law which makes the practice of instant divorce a punishable offence. Earlier in the day lauding the welfare schemes of the government, Yogi Adityanath said that RSS ideologue Pt Deen Dayal Upadhyay's dream of making the policies of the government reach out to all citizens has come true. He was addressing a gathering on the occasion of the birth anniversary of Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. "The Central and the state government has introduced several schemes through which the poor have got permanent houses, toilets, electricity, food and better healthcare. Pandit ji's dream has been fulfilled by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi," he said.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday said that the government will take a strict action against all men including Hindu men, for having illicit affair outside marriage. Yogi said that the government would introduce punishment for such men for having an extra-marital affair, while addressing an outreach programme with the victims of triple talaq. Yogi said that the government will fight the cases of women suffering from Triple Talaq. Scheme to provide a grant of Rs 6000 to women suffering from triple talaq will be implemented soon, Yogi said.
