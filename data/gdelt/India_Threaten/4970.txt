My symbol was lion, when I stood for Head Boy, now opportunity to work under Lion: Tejasvi Surya recalls his first poll

BJP young gun Tejasvi Surya who is contesting from Bangalore South seat is garnering massive traction online. With an impressive Twitter follower count of 78 thousand, Surya is an upcoming leader of BJP who has been entrusted to contest from one of the most prestigious seat in the country.

He is contesting from Ananth Kumar's seat, who passed away in November last year. The party has taken a leap of faith by choosing Tejasvi over the safer bet of opting for Ananth Kumar's wife Tejaswini. The challenge for Tejasvi will be to get the party united and fight as one from Bangalore South. He said after the announcement of seat that only in New India, is faith reposed on a 28-year-old guy.

The young turk is currently gaining a lot of eyeballs with his candid posts on social media. On Wednesday, he posted about how many teachers from his school have joined the campaign for him.

Tejasvi shared a note written by a teacher who is delighted that the predicted made by her close to 15 years ago has come true as the BJP nominee from Bangalore South is taking the 'country by storm'.

Even as Tejasvi is attracting a dedicated band of followers by dint of his powerful oratory, knives are also out for him, with detractors sharing tweets from the past to embarrass him. Tejasvi also retweeted a tweet which said that opposition is doing so as they are afraid of him and want to discredit him.
