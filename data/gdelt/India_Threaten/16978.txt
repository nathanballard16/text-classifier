New Delhi: Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday said the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP’s) slogan for the upcoming Assembly elections would be ‘abki baar 3 paar (beyond 3 this time)’ taking a jibe at the saffron party. The BJP had won just three seats in the 2015 Assembly elections.

Speaking at an event in New Delhi, Kejriwal said his party Aam Aadmi Party (AAP’s) slogan will be ‘abki bar 67 par (beyond 67 this time)’ in the state elections slated to be conducted early next year.

Kejriwal claimed that the political discourse has changed in Delhi as critics of AAP have now turned its favour.

"After five years of being in power, our critics have started loving us. We will win more hearts in the next two months (till elections)," he said.

The Delhi Chief Minister said the next target of his government would be to clean Yamuna river and improve the transport infrastructure in the state.

He claimed that pollution levels in the city have come down as there was no use of generators because of 24-hour electricity supply.

"In the last five years, two things have happened - traffic and industrial activities have increased. But in the last five years, pollution in Delhi has gone down. There can be a debate on how much, but it has gone down," he added

The Chief Minister said Delhi remains helpless in cutting the pollution levels drastically since farmers in the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana burnt more rubble this year.
