Produce potatoes on our terms and we will withdraw suit, PepsiCo tells farmers

Court restrains farmers from growing potato variety concerned

AHMEDABAD: After suing four farmers of north Gujarat for cultivating a potato variety - FC5 - that the US food and beverages giant claims infringes its patent, PepsiCo on Friday proposed the farmers to enter into a contract with it for purchase of FC5 potato seeds and sale of the produce to it on its terms and conditions.PepsiCo India Holdings Pvt Ltd's advocate said in the commercial court that if the farmers agree to the company's conditions and draw a buyback contract, the company would withdraw the suit.The company also submitted that if the farmers give an undertaking that they would not use the seeds registered by the company to grow FL2027 type of potatoes, it would refrain from taking legal action against them.Upon notice issued by the commercial court earlier this month, advocate Anand Yagnik appeared in the court on behalf of the farmers – Bipin Patel, Hari Patel, Chhabil Patel and Vinod Patel. All four have been sued by the company for violation of the Plant Varieties and Farmers’ Rights Act, 2001. He sought time from the court to file reply to the company’s proposition and court notice. The commercial court posted further hearing on this matter on June 12.Advocate Yagnik said that the farmers would decide whether they would like to continue to use FC5 seeds, which the company claims to have registered in its name. “If it is important to the farmers, we will fight the case on merit. We will have to evaluate the position of law in India because section 39 of the Farmers’ Rights Act grant protection to farmers against such claimed exclusive rights.”Meanwhile, upon PepsiCo’s objection that the specially grown potatoes are to make Lay’s chips, the court has restrained the farmers from growing and selling the potatoes. It has also appointed a court commissioner to visit the farmers’ premises and create an inventory of stock of potatoes, the allegedly infringing product.On April 8, while asking the court commissioner to inquire into the ground situation, the court also ordered police protection for the commissioner during his field visit.The suits filed by PepsiCo have evoked strong reactions among activists and farmers’ groups. They have sought the government’s intervention in this issue and threatened agitation, if the multinational company continues to “harass” farmers.
