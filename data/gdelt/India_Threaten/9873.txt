Never been in race for either chair or government: Jyotiraditya Scindia

BHOPAL: Appointment of the next state Congress president will be after the Congress Working Committee appoints the next AICC president. This was cleared by senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia on Thursday afternoon . Scindia on a day’s visit here was speaking to reporters in the state assembly premises. He said there are “three simple criteria” for selection of both the AICC president and the state Congress president.“The next PCC chief can only be appointed after the next AICC president is appointed,” he told TOI. “Criteria for the next PCC chief is the same as criteria for the next AICC president. It has to be someone who has organizational and administrative experience. It has to be someone who can enthuse the people of the country in case of AICC president and enthuse the people of Madhya Pradesh as PCC president.”Scindia further argued that the most important criteria will be honesty of purpose. “The person who has the honesty of purpose and who is truthful from his heart toward where he wants to lead not only the party but also the country in case of AICC president and not only the party but also the state in case of MP PCC president,” he said.Asked if he is in the race for either of these posts, the senior Congress leader said, “In the past 17 years, I have never been in the race for either government or chair. I have been fortunate that my leader has given me the opportunity and people have blessed me. I have worked my best to fulfil that responsibility. I will fight for progress and development but never fight for government or position.”
