‘Sala Congressi’: Hardeep Singh Puri’s brutal dig at ‘back against the wall’ Congress

Hardeep Singh Puri, the new aviation minister couldn’t resist a dig at Congress – which just managed 52 seats in the 2019 LS election – today.

Hardeep Singh Puri, the new aviation minister couldn’t resist a dig at Congress – which just managed 52 seats in the 2019 LS election – today.

The bureaucrat-turned-politician tweeted a photo of a signboard in which he wrote: “This is what they call a 'Conference Room' in Italian. Interestingly, it also has its back against the wall!”

Puri’s jibe came a day after Rahul Gandhi visited his Lok Sabha constituency Wayanad in Kerala.

Stepping up his attack on the Prime Minister on the second day of his visit to Wayanad, Congress president Rahul Gandhi said Narendra Modi's Lok Sabha election campaign was filled with "lies, poison and hatred", but his party stood for truth, love and affection.

Gandhi, who is in his constituency on a thanksgiving three-day visit after being elected to the Lok Sabha, addressed party workers at Kalpetta, Kambalakkad, Panamaram, Mananthavady Pulpally and Sulthan Bathery.
