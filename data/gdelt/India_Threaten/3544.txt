Pakistan - India news as it happened: Live updates as images show madrasa buildings still standing at scene of Indian bombing

S atellite images have emerged showing that a religious school run by Jaish-e-Mohammad in Pakistan appeared to be still standing days after India claimed its warplanes hit the Islamist group's training camp on the site.

The images produced by Planet Labs Inc, a San Francisco-based private satellite operator, show at least six buildings on the madrasa site on March 4, six days after the airstrike.

The images cast further doubt on statements made over the last eight days by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the raids had hit all the intended targets at the madrasa site near Jaba village and the town of Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

Pakistan has disputed India's account, saying the operation was a failure that saw Indian jets, under pressure from Pakistani planes, drop their bombs on a largely empty hillside.
