Pakistani Troops, People Ready to Fight India Till Last Breath - Prime Minister Imran Khan

The prime minister said in case of war breaking out between Pakistan and India, the world community would be responsible for it as it had failed to do anything despite being aware of the seriousness of the situation in Kashmir.

"If this region goes to war, the world will be responsible. Those institutions responsible for keeping world peace, this is a trial of the UN. Will you stand by the 11 resolutions of the Security Council," said Khan.

While comparing Modi with former German dictator Adolf Hitler, Khan said that the scrapping of Article 370, which granted special status to Kashmir, was a betrayal of Kashmir and a betrayal of promises made to the people of Kashmir by former Indian Prime Minister Jawahar Lal Nehru.

"It is simply about their Nazi-like ideology and then their arrogance," Khan said.

Khan said he wanted to reassure the people of Kashmir, saying that "new momentum continues where Kashmir is in the global narrative."

Islamabad has already scaled down diplomatic contacts with New Delhi and suspended trade and communication links. It has also complained to the UN Security Council, claiming India is in violation of UN resolutions.

Kashmir has been a bone of contention between India and Pakistan since the countries gained freedom from British rule in 1947. Both countries govern only part of the region, but claim it in full.
