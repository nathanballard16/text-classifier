Vodafone raises profit outlook despite €1.9bn loss

Vodafone has raised its annual profit guidance despite posting a €1.9bn loss for the six months to September that was largely caused by problems in India.

The Supreme Court of India last month ruled in favour of a government demand to pay at least $4bn in levies and interest within three months.

Vodafone Idea, its joint venture with Idea Cellular that has debts of $14bn, said at the time that the “judgement has financial implications, which we are reviewing”.

Chief executive Nick Read warned on Tuesday that the company could pull out of India due to the "critical" situation.

"We are India's largest foreign direct investment investor and I think there's a moment where you have to say we've been commercially successful and our brand is strong. What we need is a supportive regulator environment and prices that are sustainable," he said.

"It's been a very challenging situation for a long time and, if you look at the share price in India, it is effectively has zero value."
