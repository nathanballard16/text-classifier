Raj Thackeray warns of another ‘strike’

‘Attack during LS polls imminent’

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray has warned of another “Pulwama-like attack” during the peak of Lok Sabha polls.

Attacking Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for failing to implement policies and construct a Ram Temple, Mr. Thackeray claimed these “failed” forces would now do anything to divert people’s attention from real issues. In less than two months another tragedy is imminent, he claimed.

“Mark my words — another ‘Pulwama-type’ strike will be organised in the next two months, during the Lok Sabha elections, to divert peoples’ attention from all problems to patriotism,” he said, addressing the party’s 13th anniversary celebrations here in Mumbai.

Raising questions on why incidents like Uri, Pathankot, Doklam and Pulwama happen just before elections, the MNS chief said it was important for the BJP to whip up nationalistic frenzy.

“Months ago I had predicted a war-like situation would be created before the Lok Sabha polls 2019. And those predictions have come true,” he said, adding that even if 10 people had been killed in the recent air strikes, Pakistan would not have returned the Indian pilot safely.
