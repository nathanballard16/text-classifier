NRC Update Erring Officials To Face Disciplinary Action

GUWAHATI: The Supreme Court has ordered that the NRC staffs assigned to the recently concluded three-phased Lok Sabha elections duties in Assam, must be redeployed exclusively for the NRC update exercise.

In view of the apex court’s order on April 10, 2019, the State Coordinator of NRC Prateek Hajela has written to deputy commissioners and District Registrar of Citizen Registration (DRCR) of all districts, requesting them to ensure that topmost priority is accorded to National Register of Citizens works and the officials are redeployed for the NRC update exercise as per requirement. Hajela has told the DCs that the final NRC to be published in their districts has to be error-free and of the quality expected of a Supreme Court-monitored project of national importance. The Supreme Court has set July 31 as the deadline for publication of the final National Register of Citizens.

The letter has warned that exemplary disciplinary action will be initiated against any officer of any rank found to be violating or ignoring or not giving adequate attention to any National Register of Citizens duty or any instruction issued regarding NRC works from the office of the Registrar General of India or State Coordinator of National Register of Citizens.

According to the Hajela’s letter, an additional draft National Register of Citizens list should be published on June 15, 2019. The persons concerned should be informed through an additional notice to be delivered at his/her residence. The receipt of claims should be within June 30, 2019 and the disposal of such claims and the National Register of Citizens final list should be brought out by July 31, 2019.
