Madhya Pradesh is not Karanataka, says Kamal Nath on his govt's stability

New Delhi [India], Dec 12 (ANI): Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath made a startling claim on Friday as he alleged that the BJP tried to allure his MLAs to cross over to them but failed in its attempt as his state is not Karnataka.



During an interaction in the national capital, he said that BJP's first target was not Karnataka but Madhya Pradesh. "But Madhya Pradesh is not Karnataka," quipped Nath.



"When they (BJP) could not do anything in Madhya Pradesh. They went to Karnataka, " he said.



Nath was responding to queries about the stability of his government and how long it can continue as senior leaders like Jyotiraditya Scindhia are drifting away.



Nath alleged that BJP had tried to allure his MLAs and 'tried everything' to see that they cross over to them. Nath had also listed events where he faced challenges in ensuring hold over the government.



"BJP has tried everything. They lured MLAs. My first challenge was to elect a speaker. I was confident as I know my party and MLAs. Then came the election of deputy speaker. I demanded election for this post as well. Then there was some bill that we need to pass, all MLAs came to me and said that BJP is offering us money, I said to take the money. It was not just that all MLAs were with me but I also got two BJP MLAs voting for me, " Nath stated. (ANI)
