Barter System for Iranian Crude Import a Win-Win Option for All - Market Expert

With the US withdrawing the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) from India, which allowed a duty free entry of $5.6 billion worth of Indian goods into the US market, there are voices from some quarters of Indian experts who believe that India could make a strong retaliatory statement to the US by going ahead and importing crude oil from Iran.

Saraogi, however, was quick to warn that India, in the process of dealing with Iran, should not invite the wrath of the US. "Looking to make a retaliatory statement towards the US against the withdrawal of GSP may invite a more aggressive approach from the US, which would certainly not be beneficial for the Indian economy. The GSP withdrawal is a completely different issue from the Iran oil crisis. We should rather aim for back channel diplomacy with the US. They have understood our problems in the past and issued a sanctions waiver. Proper talks through concerned channels may again lead to some positive outcome", he added.

India over the years has received tangible benefits from importing oil from Iran, which happens to be the third largest source of oil imports for India, after Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Iran provides free shipping of oil, insurance, freight and longer credit periods.
