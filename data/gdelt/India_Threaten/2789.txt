New Delhi, February 22

Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey will not appear before the parliamentary panel on information technology on February 25 and instead the company is sending its head of public policy Colin Crowell.

The parliamentary panel had summoned Dorsey and refused to meet “junior officials” of the microblogging site during its meeting on February 11.

The meeting had been called against the backdrop of growing concerns about safeguarding citizens’ data privacy and the possibility of social media platforms being used to interfere in the forthcoming elections.

Ahead of the LS poll, the government has been warning social media platforms of strong action if any attempt was made to influence the electoral process through undesirable means. — PTI
