Cong. pulls up Rayaraddi for comment on Chief Minister

Dinesh Gundu Rao says it’s completely inappropriate

Two days after chastising Yeshwanthpur MLA S.T. Somashekar for raising a dissenting voice against the coalition government, the Congress on Wednesday termed the comments by former Higher Education Minister Basavaraj Rayaraddi against Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy as “inappropriate”.

Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president Dinesh Gundu Rao on Wednesday tweeted: “I’ve seen Basavaraj Rayaraddi’s statement. It’s completely inappropriate. I’ve spoken to him & have strictly told him to be careful with any future comments. @INCKarnataka+@JanataDal_S are committed to work together & our goal is to see the end of this despotic rule of Mr Modi.” Mr. Rayaraddi on Tuesday criticised Mr. Kumaraswamy’s frequent outbursts on resignations and and told him to “show leadership” instead of “inferiority complex.”

On Monday, Mr. Kumaraswamy threatened to resign after Congress legislators, including Cabinet Ministers N. Nagaraju and C. Puttarangashetty, hailed Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah as their Chief Minister.

Meanwhile, Mr. Siddarmaiah, who had gone to New Delhi, reportedly held talks with K.C. Venugopal, AICC general secretary in-charge of Karnataka.

As the BJP has been making attempts to topple the government, sources said the Congress has decided to hold its legislature party meeting ahead of the budget session of the State legislature which is commencing from February 6.
