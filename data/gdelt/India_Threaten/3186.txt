Mr Khattak told reporters the Pakistani air force was ready to repel the Indian attack. However, he explained “it was dark” at night. Yesterday's Indian Air Force attack targeted a Jaish-e Mohammed terror training camp at Balakot in Pakistan.

In a press conference, Mr Khattak reportedly said: “Our air force was ready, but since it was happening in the night and it was dark, they could not gauge the extent of the damage.

“So they waited and now they have received clear directions.”

Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, next to him, added: "May I just add. The Pakistan Air Force was already air-bound. We were ready for all eventualities."

Responding to the comments, one Twitter user said: “Pervez Khattak is defence minister. Didn't we know he's got no capacity to be defence minister.”
