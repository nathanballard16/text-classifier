As Pawar visits ED, Rahul accuses govt of vindictivenes

In a tweet, Rahul Gandhi said: "Sharad Pawar Ji is the latest opposition leader to be targeted by a vindictive government. The timing of this action, a month before elections in Maharashtra, reeks of political opportunism."

The NCP Supremo is slated to voluntarily visit the Enforcement Directorate on Friday in its Mumbai office after the agency named Sharad Pawar in the case of alleged irregularities in a cooperative bank.
