Narayan Rane included in BJP’s manifesto committee

Amit Shah announced a list of different committees for the preparation of elections.

Mumbai: The inclusion of Narayan Rane in the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto committee indicates that the party’s rift with the Shiv Sena is beyond repair now. This was underlined after BJP national chief Amit Shah used strong words against the Sena and in reply, Sena leaders slammed him.

Mr Shah announced a list of different committees for the preparation of elections. He included Mr Rane in the BJP’s manifesto preparation committee.

Mr Rane has his own party, Maharashtra Swa-bhiman Paksha. Howe-ver, his inclusion in the committee of the BJP is likely to have political implications in the state.

Mr Rane started his political career with the Sena before joining the Congress in 2006. Hence, he shares a bitter relationship with the Sena. The saffron party is also an alliance partner of the BJP. It was claimed that the Sena opposed the inclusion of Mr Rane in the cabinet and hence, he was sent to the Rajya Sabha.

Mr Rane’s inclusion in the BJP’s manifesto committee implicates that the BJP leadership has now come to the conclusion of snapping pol-itical ties with the Sena.

On the same day, Mr Shah said, in Latur, that his party was ready to contest on its own in the state. In reply, the Sena too said that it was ready for any such battle.

All this implicates possibility of Mr Rane being BJP’s choice for candidature in the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg LS constituency, if Sena doesn’t partner with the party.
