Both incidents took place in March this year and the recipients had submitted all the evidence to the fisheries department and the mangroves cell for compensation, as per government rule.In order to protect marine biodiversity and to shield fishermen from incurring loss, the state government in December last year had announced compensation for those who cut their expensive nets to release turtles, shark orback into the sea.“My boat was fishing around 350 metres off the coast of Vasai when angot stuck in the net. We immediately freed it and recorded the video of the release. We had to cut the fishing net, but because it is an endangered species we didn’t hesitate,” Raje told Mirror.For compensation, a fisherman will have to give details of his fishing license, boat license, exact location of the incident, including GPS, details of the exotic fish or animal that was caught and photographs of the release. “Many times, turtles, dolphins and even protected fish like sawfish and guitarfish get trapped in fishing nets. Catching and selling of these species is a crime. But these fisher folks also incur losses when their nets are damaged. So, we have started compensating them,” an official from the mangrove cell said.Marine activists said that though compensation will save the lives of many dolphins and sawfish, the government should spread awareness about this scheme.
