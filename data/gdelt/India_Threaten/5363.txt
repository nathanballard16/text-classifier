Mehbooba Mufti reacts to BJP's plan to scrap Article 370 in occupied Kashmir

ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Former chief minister of Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK) Mehbooba Mufti on Friday has strongly reacted to the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) plan to end Article 370 in the valley, saying that India will be an occupational force if it scrapes this article.



Addressing a poll rally in Pattan area of north Kashmir’s Baramulla district, the ex-CM said, "If Article 370 is scrapped then India’s relation with Jammu and Kashmir will be same as Israel’s occupation in Palestine."



Lashing out at BJP’s national president Amit Shah, Mehbooba Mufti said, "Removal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), protection of Article 370, dialogue with Pakistan, dialogue with Hurriyat leaders and return of the state’s power projects were part of the agenda of the alliance."



She further said that Kashmiris would continue to fight for their constitutional right.

It is to be mentioned here that Article 370 grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
