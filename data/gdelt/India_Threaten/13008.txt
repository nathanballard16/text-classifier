PUNE: General Officer Commanding-in-Chief of the Southern Command, Lt Gen S K Saini, said on Monday that the Army is alert to inputs it has received about a possible terror attack in southern and peninsular India.“We are taking adequate precaution to ensure that any design of the inimical elements or terrorists is stalled, and they do not succeed,” Lt Gen Saini told reporters on the sidelines of the foundation stone-laying ceremony for the phase-II project of the Army Law College (ALC) at Kanhe, about 45km from here.The Army Southern Command covers 41% of the country’s land mass in 11 states and four Union territories.On the intelligence reports about enhanced deployment by Pakistani forces in the disputed Sir Creek area, which divides Gujarat from the Sindh province, Saini said, “We have recovered some abandoned boats in the Sir Creek region. We have undertaken measures for capacity building and capability development in this area keeping in mind the enhanced threat perception.”Asked about the demarcation of boundaries in the creek area, Saini said, “It is for the two governments to resolve the dispute. As of now, there is no agreement over the boundary in Sir Creek. The issue was part of the composite dialogue between the two governments for which several rounds were held.”On Jammu and Kashmir, Saini said, “The external dimension to the issue is much more pronounced than the internal dimension. We have a very clear-cut policy based on which we have been dealing with insurgency. The government takes a comprehensive view of every conflict and undertakes political, economic, social and diplomatic measure to resolve it. The Army’s role is to create conducive conditions for such initiatives by the government. At the moment, the Army is fully geared to challenge any contingency arising in J&K.”On a series of statements, including threats by Pakistani political leaders and senior army officers, Saini said, “Any threat does not make a difference to us. We are fully prepared to fight any situation.”Earlier, addressing undergraduate students at the ALC, Saini said there are a number of issues connected with justice in our country at present and students must focus on ‘justice for all’.
