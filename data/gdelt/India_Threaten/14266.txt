Pakistan: Kashmir's only hope

Pakistan has always supported Kashmiris in their struggle for freedom. Recently, the prime minister said that those who wanted to cross the Line of Control (LoC) and wanted to fight in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) would be the worst enemy of his homeland and Kashmir. He added that India would definitely blame Pakistan if any misadventures take place inside the region. The same words were repeated in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). Washington praised the words of PM Imran Khan and asked India to lift the inhumane curfew.The United States (US) has to play an important role on the Kashmir issue. The US president has already made offers of mediation but India didn’t respond positively. Diplomatically, Pakistan has taken some bold steps such as the foreign minister contacted his counterparts in other countries and informed them regarding the situation in Kashmir.The US planted the seed of extremism in Afghanistan, leaving Pakistan in a situation of disarray. India has always blamed Pakistan for every misadventure that took place. The PM warned the world that India would blame Pakistan again. It is a test of UNSC to give the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir. Keeping the current situation in mind, Pakistan needs to be very careful as India will not remain silent and will definitely try to create tensions between the nuclear-armed states.Omar ShahkarPublished in The Express Tribune, October 3, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
