The Farooq Doctrine

The Farooq Abdullah doctrine on Kashmir's relations with New Delhi denies to the people of Kashmir the fundamental right of citizenship to change, choose and oppose the government in Delhi. By denying this right to them, Farooq reminds the people of Kashmir that they are less than full citizens of the country.

In November 1986, Farooq Abdullah, on returning to power for the second time, after signing an accord with Rajiv Gandhi, realised that “any one who wants to form a government in Kashmir cannot do so without sharing power with New Delhi. For the people did not matter much.”

The parties that formed the government in New Delhi later did not insist on sharing power with the party in power in the state. For they did not have much of a presence there. Farooq reframed his doctrine on Kashmir’s relation with the centre by declaring his loyalty to any party that came to power in New Delhi; thus reaffirming his basic thesis that people of his state did not matter in forming a government.
