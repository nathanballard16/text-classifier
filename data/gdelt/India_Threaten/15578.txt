Union Ministerhas taken contractors and authorities of the Highways Ministry to task over the extremely poor condition of the road that falls on the way to worldThe minister's action came in after several social media users posted pictures of the Aurangabad-Silode-Jalgaonwhich is filled with potholes and dust made worse by the rains.In one of the images, the Maharashtra State Regional Transport Corporation () bus can be seen stuck in knee-deep mud.Due to the poor condition, it takes commuters nearly 8 to 9 hours to cover a distance of just 150 KM.The road has been under construction for nearly 2 years.Taking note of the posts in which he was tagged, Gadkari tweeted, "The poor condition of Highway connecting Aurangabad -Sillod- Jalgaon has come to my notice. I have instructed Chief engineer NH division PWD Maharashtra & RO, MORTH ( Ministry of Road Transport and Highways) Mumbai to take immediate action and make sure that road is in good condition within 8 days."In another tweet, he also warned the concerned authorities to face consequences if the road is not repaired. "This is not acceptable. Officer or contractor nobody shall be spared for negligence."The road has not only affected daily commuters but it is also keeping thousands of tourists, especially foreigners, away from the World Heritage Site.
