Goa: IMD Advises Tourists to Avoid Visiting the Coastal State Till Oct 27

Panaji: The Indian Meteorological Department’s (IMD) Goa observatory on Thursday advised tourists to avoid visiting the coastal state till October 27, citing rough weather conditions, an official said.

Goa was put on red alert for Thursday, as it has been receiving heavy to very heavy showers because of a cyclonic depression in the Arabian Sea.

Tourists are advised not to visit the state for the next four days, from October 24 to 27, as weather conditions are likely to worsen, IMD’s Goa director Dr Krrishnamurty Padgalwar said.

“The depression in the Arabian Sea and its movement towards east-northeast may cause heavy rainfall in the state,” he said.

On Thursday, Goa received almost 90 mm of rainfall.

The state has recorded 144% surplus post-monsoon showers from October 1 till date, the official added.
