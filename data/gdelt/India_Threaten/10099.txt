Why is H D Kumaraswamy still smiling?

Bengaluru: Ever since he proposed to move a confidence motion in the legislative assembly, Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy seems to have suddenly changed-he has a perpetual smile on his face and looks much more confident than he ever was in the last 14 months after taking over as CM!

Sources in the JD (S) claimed that though the numbers seem to be heavily stacked against him, Mr Kumaraswamy could have a secret plan up his sleeve which explains his unusual smile. The plan is top secret and he has not ventured to discuss this even with leaders of the coalition partner, Congress including fellow Vokkaliga leader D.K. Shivakumar.

The only one who seems to know about HDK’s strategy to pip the BJP in the race for the numbers is his father and JD(S) supremo H.D. Deve Gowda.

The smile does not seem to be misplaced with TV channels airing a story about how Minister H.D. Revanna's wife Bhavani reportedly convincing rebel JD(S) MLA Gopalaiah's wife to bring her husband back to the party fold. Sources said JD(S) is targeting seven other legislators, who it believes, will cross vote.

There are, however, some in the Congress, including two ministers, who claim that the CM is only putting up a show before bringing down the curtains on his government. “Two days before the confidence motion is moved in the assembly, he cannot afford to give up the fight. But, as things stand now, he is unlikely to pass the test,” a minister said.
