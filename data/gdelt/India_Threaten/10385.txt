Heavy rain alert, flood situation may worsen in Bihar

PATNA: Flood situation in north Bihar is likely to aggravate as the Patna Meteorological Centre has issued a warning for heavy rainfall across the state, especially in the northern districts, over the next 48 hours.The expected rainfall is being attributed to the position of monsoon trough line, which is a low-pressure area that stretches from west to east and monsoon rainfall normally hinges on it.The trough line was passing through Ganganagar and Pilani in Rajasthan, Agra and Gorakhpur in UP and Muzaffarpur, Cooch Behar and eastwards to Nagaland on Monday.“The trough line was positioned at its ideal position on Monday, starting from Ganganagar in Rajasthan and passing across north Bihar. However instead of culminating in the Bay of Bengal, it is ending in Nagaland. We have issued a warning for heavy rainfall in Bihar, especially in the northern parts, for the next two days,” a senior official at Patna meteorological centre told TOI. He added that an alert has been sounded to the water resources and disaster management departments.However, the cumulative monsoon rainfall figures have again gone into deficient mode. After making a swift recovery from 45% deficiency on July 3 to 9% surplus on July 12, the figure has come down to 1% deficiency as on Monday.As per data available on the official website of IMD, Bihar has received 418.3mm between June 1 and Monday, against the corresponding normal of 421.9mm for the same period, leaving 1% deficient. However, the IMD considers +/- 29% of the normal rainfall in normal category.It was the position of the trough line close to the foothill of the Himalayas that the Terrai region in Nepal and districts in Bihar along the Indo-Nepal border received torrential rainfall around July 11-14, which led to the floods in 12 districts in Bihar.An all-India weather bulletin issued by IMD on Monday afternoon stated that rainfall activity is likely to increase over central India, adjoining northern parts of peninsular India and also along the northern plains from July 24 for the subsequent three to four days.The showers have already started in Patna giving a respite from the sultry weather as the city received showers in the morning and skies remained overcast throughout the day.
