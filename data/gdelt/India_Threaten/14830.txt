NEW YORK - Pakistan has warned at the United Nations (UN), that India 's "hegemonic pretences and aggressive actions" present threat to regional peace and security.

Speaking in the UN General Assembly's First Committee, dealing with disarmament and international security issues, Pakistan's outgoing Permanent Representative to UN Dr Maleeha Lodhi said India's conduct pose threat to Pakistan.

She said India's "belligerent" military posture was demonstrated in February this year in the wake of the Pulwama incident in occupied Kashmir, it resorted to aggression against Pakistan on a completely false pretence, the Radio Pakistan reported.

Maleeha Lodhi said the recent unilateral action by India to further consolidate its illegal occupation of the internationally-recognized disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir, in flagrant violation of multiple Security Council resolutions, has further engendered the volatility in South Asia.
