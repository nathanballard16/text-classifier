That if agreed upon, the AAP wants to leave only two seats in Delhi, where it had suggested allowing three constituencies to the Congress.

The AAP’s emphasis is to get the Congress to agree for an alliance in Haryana and stretch it to Punjab.

In Haryana, the AAP was eyeing Karnal and Faridabad.

“If the Congress sends a proposal to us, then we will consider. In Haryana, we are willing to contest on only one seat and the Congress can fight on six. But still they are not willing to consider. All our surveys show that if there is no alliance in Haryana, then the entire opposition vote will be split,” said a senior AAP leader.
