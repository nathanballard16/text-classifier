We never get to see his face, but there are graphic glimpses of his victims – attacked, tortured, raped and murdered.

Mukerji’s character has been tasked to find the killer who is mocking the police force by challenging them and killing female students. Further, she herself is targeted by the criminal, whom she calls a ‘monster’ in a press conference..

The teaser of the film was released during Navratri. Mukerji had said in a statement to IANS: “The film will see a female cop fighting an evil person to end crimes against women. As we all know, Navratri stands for the victory of good over evil all over India. Whether it is Goddess Durga defeating the demon Mahishasura or Lord Rama’s victory over Ravana, Navratri’s significance is key to this asset launch. So, we decided to start the journey of Mardaani 2 on this auspicious occasion.”
