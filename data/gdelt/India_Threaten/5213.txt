From the Archives: Dalai Lama's great escape

The young "god-king" escaped from his war-torn fairytale land with 20,000 Red Chinese troops pursuing him.

LONDON, Saturday.— The incredible story of how the twenty three-year-old Dalai Lama reached India was being pieced together in New Delhi last night.

As he reached safety there were reports that the Chinese were bringing up 100,000 reinforcements in Central Tibet for an all-out attempt to smash the rebellion.

For the way the Dalai Lama escaped shows that the Chinese have far from crushed the Tibetans.

On the morning of March 17 the Dalai Lama got away from his summer palace in Lhasa and "walked right through the Chinese Army."

His mother, the 57-year old Gyuam Chemo, and his 26-year-old sister, Tsering, and 14-year-old brother, Ngari, met him outside the city with a band of devoted followers, including four Cabinet Ministers.

The long march—partly on foot, partly by yak, pony and mule—began.

The escapers, winding their way over mountains and through thick jungle, knew that the worst part of the journey was the first 50 miles.
