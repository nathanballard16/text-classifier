Bhopal: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA from Ganjbasoda area in Vidisha district in Madhya Pradesh has received a hand-written note that threatens to blow up Home Minister Amit Shah if he ever visits the area. The MLA has approached the police regarding the matter.

BJP MLA Leena Jain has complained to the police that she has received a hand-written letter threatening to kill her and also BJP president and Union Home Minister in a bomb blast, Vidisha superintendent of police Vinayak Verma told a news agency.

Apart from the threat to kill Amit Shah, the note also contains warnings to blow up a local bus stand, railway station and government hospital, the police official said. According to reports, the threat has been taken seriously by the police and security has been tightened in the entire district.

"Search operations are being carried out. As a precautionary measure, the bomb disposal and dog squads have been called in from Bhopal for deployment," Verma said. Further, the police conducted searches at the local railway station and several health centres in the area, he added.

This is not the first time a threat to kill a BJP leader has been made. Recently, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari received an SMS that threatened to kill him and PM Modi. The SMS read, "Although I never thought of doing this, it's my compulsion and I have to do this. Not just Manoj Tiwari, if the need be, I will also kill our country’s prime minister Narendra Modi."

Similarly, in June, another letter threatening to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi had surfaced. Rajasthan BJP chief Madan Lal Saini had received the letter on May 29, wherein the sender had vowed to shoot PM Modi.
