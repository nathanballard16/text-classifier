70-year-old school in Tirupur to make way for parking lot

TIRUPUR: Parents and activists are up in arms against the Tirupur corporation ’s decision to demolish a 70-year-old school on Palladam Road to make way for a multi-level parking lot as part of the bus terminus project under the Smart City scheme.They say the civic body did not consult all stakeholders before taking the decision that will affect several students.The Muthupudur Corporation Middle School, which was functioning near the old bus stand on Palladam Road has a strength of 196 students from LKG to Class VIII. According to the school education department, the school was inaugurated in presence of the father of Tirupur, K N Palanisamy Gounder, in 1949. It had a strength of more than 800 students then.The corporation plans to demolish the old bus stand and re-construct the terminus at a cost of Rs36.5 crore. The smart bus terminus, as per the civic body, would not have enough space in the available 5.5 acres of the land. Hence, it decided to take over the land on which the school stands.School education authorities say the school was functioning in an acre of land gifted for the purpose. But the civic body has already constructed a multi-level two-wheeler parking lot, the corporation’s sanitary inspector’s office and Amma Unavagam. Now, the authorities have decided to take the rest of the land shut down the school.A senior corporation official said, “The land belongs to the corporation, and the school was functioning without contributing to the revenue of the civic body.”
