Reports of India influencing SL players false: Harin - Breaking News

Sports Minister Harin Fernando today rejected the reports which said that India influenced Sri Lankan players not to play in Pakistan.

In a tweet, the Minister said, “No truth to reports that India influenced Sri Lankan players not to play in Pakistan. Some decided not to play purely based on the 2009 incident. Respecting their decision we picked players who were willing to travel. We have a full-strength team and we hope to beat Pakistan in Pakistan.”

Earlier, Pakistani Science and Technology Minister Fawad Hussain Chaudhry said India had threatened the players from Sri Lanka against participating in the upcoming series in Pakistan.
