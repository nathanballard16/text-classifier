Key Highlights WB Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee warns Centre over NRC Mamata says the Centre trying to divide people in the name of religion The West Bengal CM says she will never allow NRC in her state

Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Thursday issued a warning to the Narendra Modi government over the National Register of Citizens (NRC), saying the Centre won’t be able to shut Bengal’s mouth. Mamata said those trying to divide the people in the name of NRC are playing with fire, adding that she would never allow the exercise to be conducted in her state.

Speaking at an anti-NRC rally after holding a protest march, Mamata said people were still being asked to give proof of their identity after 76 years of independence.

"We will never allow NRC in Bengal. We will not allow them to divide the people on religious and caste lines. We will not accept NRC in Assam. They have silenced the people of Assam by using police administration but they cannot silence Bengal," she said here.

“19 lakh people have been left out of the final list (of Assam NRC), including Hindus, Muslims and Buddhists. It's 76 years of independence and still we've to give proof of our identity. Why?” the West Bengal CM asked.

“You won't be able to shut Bengal's mouth as you did in Assam by using your police,” she added, issuing a warning to the Centre.

Alleging that there was an attempt to divide the people in the name of religion, Mamata said the Centre was trying to preach faith now.

“Suddenly, you are teaching us religion as if we don't celebrate Eid, Durga Puja, Muharram and Chhath Puja. For the sake of religion, for the sake of Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs and Christians, I don't agree with NRC,” she said.

Mamata, who has been one of the vociferous critics of the NRC, even dared the Bharatiya Janata Party and its leaders to touch one citizen of West Bengal in the name of the NRC.

The Bengal CM, who is also the chief of the ruling Trinamool Congress party, earlier led a protest march from Sinthee to Shyambazar five-point crossing, in North Kolkata.

Mamata’s fresh attack against the Centre over NRC came after names of more than 19 lakh of the 3.29 crore applicants in Assam were omitted from the final National Register of Citizens, which was published on August 31.
