Police lobbed teargas shells and fired in the air to disperse protesters.BJP offices were also vandalised in Golaghat town and Teok in Jorhat district. In Cachar and Karimganj districts of Barak Valley, the strike failed to elicit any response.Indigenous People’s Front of Tripura , a member of the BJP-led Northeast Democratic Alliance, extended moral support to the shutdown. In Mizoram , Aizawl wore a deserted look. In Meghalaya , sporadic incidents of stone-pelting were reported and several roads were blocked.Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma defended the bill. “We are grateful to PM Narendra Modi for the bill and saving 18 assembly seats in Assam from going into the hands of Jinnah or the AIUDF’s Badruddin Ajmal,” PTI quoted him as saying.“We have to do it on the basis of religion. On the basis of what else can we stop illegal immigration. It is well known that our land has been taken by Muslim migrants and now we cannot allow anymore encroachment of our assets monasteries and Kaziranga,” said Sarma, BJP’s face in the Northeast.Congress and Trinamool Congress want that land rights be given to Muslims but, this cannot be accepted, he said.
