Salman Khan prepares to shoot for a shirtless climax sequence of Dabangg 3

Back in May, actor Kiccha Sudeep who reportedly plays the villain in Dabangg 3, shared on social media that there will be a shirtless fight sequence between Salman Khan and him. Salman Khan has been reportedly preparing for this climax scene for almost six months now. And the said sequence will be shot this month. Salman wants to be in his best shape for the long shirtless scene in the film. As per reports, the scene requires a lot of hand-to-hand combat action and the superstar has been training for the same for a while now. Since there’s a gap of seven years between Dabangg 2 and Dabangg 3 and a portion of the film goes into flashback as well. The shirtless climax scene will present Salman in a heroic avatar. As per the reports, it is stated that Salman understands the expectations from his fans and ever since the film’s shoot has started, he has begun working on his physique to look his best for the film.

Dabangg 3 happens to be one of Salman’s most anticipated films. The shooting of the film kick-started in Maheshwar in MP and the cast and crew then shot some portions in Pune, Mumbai and Rajasthan as well.

Since Salman wanted a perfectly chiseled body, he did weight lifting in the mornings and cycled to the shoot locations as part of his exercise regime.





The revelation that Salman will be seen shirtless in the climax of Dabangg 3 which is set to release in December this year makes the wait even more difficult for all Salman Khan fans!
