The Chennai District Collectorate released a list of 331 play schools on Monday, which are unrecognised by the state government and do not have the necessary certification. Euro kids, Kidzee, Smart kids play school, Pearl nursery and primary school, Little Millennium play school, are some of the schools which are included in the list.

The Block Education Officers (BEO) and the Block Resource teachers submitted a report that these schools were functioning without obtaining the mandatory recognition of the school education department. Although, there are no strict rules regarding inspections, these officers conduct frequent visits and inspections every 6 months to identify unrecognized schools. Their reports are then submitted to the district administration, Chennai District Collector A Shanmuga Sundaram told TNM.

Schools which do not possess the necessary documents, infrastructure and do not comply with the safety norms, have been issued a closure notice after giving them two notices within a timeframe of every three months, by the school education department. Along with a police escort, the District Education Officer (DEO) will personally ensure the closure of these schools.

The District Collector has appealed to the parents of the students, to verify and demand the recognition status of schools which must be put up on their notice board, before admission. If the institution is unrecognised, they should intimate the district authorities about it and action will be taken as per norms. To further inform the parents, the list of unrecognised schools will be published in the newspaper and it will also be put up on the district website of the education department.
