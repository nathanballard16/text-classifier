India elections: Andhra campaign ends on a bitter note

Hyderabad: A bitter and acrimonious campaign for Lok Sabha and state assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh came to an end when Telugu Desam supremo and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu called his political rivals YS Jaganmohan Reddy and Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao as “pet dogs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi waiting for him to throw biscuits at them”.

On the last day of the campaign on Tuesday, Naidu also called KCR “a chameleon” and quipped that he was declaring his support to Special Category Status for Andhra Pradesh to only benefit Jagan in the polls.

Nexus among Modi, KCR and Jagan was a recurring theme in Naidu’s speeches all through the campaign. Addressing election meetings in Krishna district, Naidu targeted both the rivals saying, “Shameless Jaganmohan Reddy is eating dog biscuits and he is trying to distribute them to us also. Jaganmohan Reddy and KCR are pet dogs of Modi, they will be at his feet for a single biscuit. Jagan is going to share those biscuits with you too, beware”.

Krishna district, where he campaigned till late Tuesday night, is the traditional fortress of the TDP. In an all-out effort to woo the voters he warned that if Jagan comes to power, Andhra Pradesh would be at the mercy of KCR. He also charged that KCR was providing funds to Jagan’s party in the election.

“Modi and KCR have spent Rs10 billion [Dh530 million] [to help Jagan in election]. KCR whey did you send this money? Whey did you send your state money to us. Even if you send Rs100 billion [Dh53 billion] you wouldn’t get a single vote here,” Naidu said.

Jagan on the other hand urged the people to put an end to the “corrupt rule” of Naidu by defeating the TDP in the elections.

Along with Jagan, his mother Vijayamma and sister Sharmila also campaigned in different parts of Andhra on the last day of the campaign seeking support for YSR Congress.
