Student leaders snub AU talks bid

Allahabad: The fast-unto-death being observed by a group of student leaders of Allahabad University, to press for reinstatement of the students’ union on the campus, entered its seventh day on Saturday.Varsity officials, including dean of student welfare professor Harsh Kumar, met the protesters and tried to convince them to call off the hunger strike, besides withdrawing the demand.“We told them that student welfare would not be compromised in the new body, but they were not ready to listen,” professor Kumar said. The student leaders instead warned the varsity administration not to test their patience.Vice-chancellor Ratan Lal Hangloo has also appealed to the protesters to break their fast.The AU had in June set the ball rolling for replacement of the 96-year-old students’ union with a students’ council, triggering a relay protest.“We have been protesting since the day AU decided to replace the union with a council. We shall not rest till our demand is met,” said vice-president of AU Students’ Union Akhilesh Yadav.The current agitation, which also received support from Priyanka Gandhi on Twitter on Friday, is being observed by both sitting and former office-bearers of the students’ union at Union Hall. Some protesters though had to leave the fast midway after they took ill.
