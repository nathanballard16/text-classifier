Pakistan PM Imran Khan warns of Kashmir escalation, offers talks with India

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday (Feb 27) called for talks with India and said he hopes “better sense” would prevail.

Mr Khan was speaking on national television after Pakistan claimed it shot down two Indian jets over its airspace in disputed Kashmir.

One fell into Pakistani-held Kashmir, while the other came down on the Indian side, Pakistan said. Both India and Pakistan lay claim to all of Kashmir, but only control parts of it.

There are fears it could lead to an all-out conflict between both nuclear-armed countries.



Pakistan said earlier on Wednesday that it had captured the pilots, but insisted it did not “want to go towards war” with its neighbour. India confirmed one pilot was missing.
