Weather forecast for Jan 25: Scattered rains likely in Bengaluru

Uttar Pradesh was experiencing dry weather conditions since the last few days. However, western parts of Uttar Pradesh had received few spells of good rains therefore the state's rain deficiency was dwindling somewhere at 10% as on January 22.

During the last 24 hours, however, moderate to heavy rains have occurred over the state therefore we expect this deficiency to fade away as well. Moreover, there are chances of West Uttar Pradesh to even become surplus in rains by a few percent. East Uttar Pradesh was also running on the same lines and the rain deficiency here stood near to 90 percent.
