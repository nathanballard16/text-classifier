BJP Workers Beat A UP Student and Called Him A Terrorist After He Complained About Jobs

A video went viral on almost every social media platform that showed a group of BJP workers beating up a student from UP after he complained about the lack of jobs in India in an interview. The workers of the party also called him a Terrorist.

The student was harshly beaten up by the workers of BJP in Muzaffarnagar, Uttar Pradesh on Wednesday.

He was in Muzaffarnagar to attend his board exams, he was being interviewed by a couple of news companies.

But it was interrupted after he gave out comments about the government. A group of BJP workers started to beat him up. The news broadcasters recorded the entire incident, and it seemed like they did not really care about it.

The student said “I just said there are no jobs. They started saying you are a terrorist, you are against India and the BJP.”

The police of Muzzafarnagar promised to take action against those people who thrashed the student, but so far no one has been arrested. You can clearly see the faces of those people who beat up the student in the video.

Asaduddin Owaisi, a politician from Hyderabad was frustrated about the happening and said “BJP workers know that they cannot defend Modi’s development track record. So the only thing they can do is call someone an ‘aatankwaadi’ & beat them up (sic).”

Jobs in India has become a major issue, with the general elections approaching fast, there are a lot of bashes that are being made against the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi after they failed to generate employment as they promised during their pre-election campaigns.

In February, the unemployment rate in the country increased to 7.2 percent, this is the highest percentage since September 2016, these numbers are from the data that was compiled by the CMIE (Centre for Monitory Indian Economy).
