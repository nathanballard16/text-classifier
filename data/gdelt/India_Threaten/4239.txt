RJD and Congress intensify war of words over seat sharing in Bihar

RJD has authorized Lalu for finalizing seat-sharing arrangements with at least six other anti-BJP parties, including the Left, in Bihar. PATNA: A day before the crucial Grand Alliance meeting on seat-sharing in Delhi, its major partners RJD and Congress indulged in a fierce muscle-flexing exercise on Tuesday. “Rahul Gandhi had already said in Patna rally on February 3 that Congress will fight from the front. Nonetheless, I am bit perturbed by the way Congress is negotiating with anti-BJP parties in the country. The huge turnout of people in Rahul’s rally also reflected the fact that common people were now choosing Congress.”Reacting to Sadanand’s comments, RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari said RJD is not dependent on Congress.
