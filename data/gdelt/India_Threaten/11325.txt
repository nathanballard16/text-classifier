Modi’s radical move on Kashmir takes India into uncharted territory

“In some ways, this is shock and awe,” said Amitabh Mattoo, a professor of international relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and a longtime observer of the Kashmir conflict. Few thought the BJP would follow through on its promise to remove Kashmir’s autonomy, let alone end its status as a state, he said. “This is totally out of the box.” Modi has made dramatic moves shrouded in secrecy before: In 2016, he abruptly announced a decision to invalidate most of India’s currency.
