Lucknow, June 5

A day after the SP and the BSP decided to contest alone all 11 seats in the upcoming Assembly bypolls, their third alliance partner in the recent Lok Sabha elections--the RLD—on Wednesday announced it too would go solo.

Rashtriya Lok Dal UP president Masood Ahmad, however, expressed hope that the ‘gathbandhan’ remained intact.

“The Rashtriya Lok Dal will contest the UP assembly bypolls on its own whenever they are held. However, it is too early to comment on the political scene of the state,” he told PTI.

Party chief Chaudhary Ajit Singh and Jayant Chaudhary will decide on the number of seats the party will contest and the matter may be discussed during a meeting in the next few days, Ahmad said.

When asked about the RLD’s role in the new political landscape of the state, which sends the highest number of 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha, Ahmad said, “The RLD was with the Samajwadi Party. We got the seats from the quota of Akhilesh.”

The UP RLD chief said the Congress should also be a part of the ‘gathbandhan’.

When asked who would gain from the recent spate of political developments, Ahmad said, “The profit and loss analysis will be done later. Our wish is that the ‘gathbandhan’ should increase its ‘kunbaa’ (clan), so that we can emerge as a strong anti-BJP force.”

The UP assembly bypolls will be important for the RLD as it has no representation in the UP Legislative Assembly.

In the just-concluded Lok Sabha election, the RLD had contested from three constituencies, but faced defeat on all.

RLD candidates Ajit Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary lost from Muzaffarnagar and Baghpat Lok Sabha seats respectively, while Kunwar Narendra Singh lost from Mathura. PTI
