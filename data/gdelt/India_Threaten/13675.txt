SC sets October 18 as deadline to conclude Ayodhya hearing

The Supreme Court of India has fixed October 18, 2019 as the deadline for the conclusion of hearings in the Ram janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title dispute. The decision indicates the Supreme Court’s keenness in delivering the verdict in Ayodhya case before CJI Ranjan Gogoi’s retirement in November 2019.

The constitution bench hearing the Ayodhya dispute is headed by CJI Ranjan Gogoi, who is set to retire on November 17, 2019. If the judgement on the case is not delivered before the CJI’s retirement, then the entire case would have to be heard afresh with a new judge replacing Justice Gogoi.

The SC bench had earlier sought a tentative time frame from all the concerned parties for the completion of their arguments in the Ayodhya land dispute case so that the judges could estimate how much time they would have to write the judgement. After consulting all the parties and getting their tentative timeframes, the five-judge constitution bench decided to set October 18 as the deadline.

The CJI said that the Supreme Court bench is willing to put in extra hours to complete the hearings in the Ayodhya case before the set deadline. “Let us make a joint effort to conclude the same by Oct 18. If need be, we can extend our sitting by an hour”, CJI Ranjan Gogoi appealed to all the parties and their lawyers.

The constitution bench also reopened the possibility of mediation to resolve the decades-old issue and stated that the concerned parties are free to mediate and come to a settlement during this time. The mediation panel had earlier written to the constitution bench after it received a letter from one of the parties asking the panel to give mediation one more shot.
