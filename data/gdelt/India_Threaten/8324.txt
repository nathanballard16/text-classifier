‘Jan Mahal’ row: MSU warns VMC against delay in constructing retaining wall

VADODARA: The controversy over the compound wall of M S University adjacent to the ‘Jan Mahal’ project of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation VMC ) is far from over.In the latest round, MSU has sent a missive to the VMC stating that the civic body is yet to construct the retaining wall which it had agreed to do last year. MSU warned the civic authorities that if the compound wall is not constructed, it will lead to another controversy.“Till date, the VMC has not constructed the wall. The monsoon is fast approaching. The university wall with steep fall, without any vertical support will further collapse and get eroded and then there will not be any demarcation which will lead to another controversy,” the letter written by MSU’s in-charge registrar N K Ojha to municipal commissioner Ajay Bhadoo states.It was in December last that VMC and MSU had locked horns when the compound wall of the university located right adjacent to under construction site of ‘Jan Mahal’ had got demolished. The developer of ‘Jan Mahal,’ which is being developed by VMC as integrated transport hub had demolished the compound wall, which is adjacent to the old law faculty building keeping MSU completely in the dark.After the row, there was truce between the two bodies as VMC had agreed to construct RCC retaining wall, a demand which the university had made.MSU’s letter states that the matter was resolved as VMC had submitted a layout plan showing building line 6 metres away from university compound wall. Earlier this building line was shown as falling on university compound wall.“Hence, university had no issue if building line is 6 metres away from compound wall,” the letter states, adding that the civic body was also asked to submit approved layout plan, building plan and copy of building permission.Through the missive the university has asked the municipal commissioner to direct the concerned to complete the work of retaining wall immediately before monsoon.
