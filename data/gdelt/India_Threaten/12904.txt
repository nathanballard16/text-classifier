Indore: The debate over the final NRC list continues to bicker within the Congress camp, with senior party leader Digvijaya Singh today questioning the authenticity of Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s claims that there were over 40 lakh illegal immigrants in Assam, this before the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) list was published on August 31.

“Amit Shah would say that there are 40 lakh immigrants in Assam. Where are they now? One should also ask this question to BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya, who is considered (Amit) Shah’s number two,” Singh said on Saturday.

The Member of Parliament from Rajya Sabha also said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led central government is misleading people on the NRC issue.

The final NRC list saw over 19 lakh people being left out for lack of a valid proof of their Indian citizenship. “It is an old habit of the BJP to create confusion across India by engaging in politics based on religion,” he added.

In wake of the massive debate over the next Madhya Pradesh Congress chief, Digvijaya Singh revealed that there are no concerns of factionalism within the party as is being portrayed in the media.

“There was no factionalism in the Congress unit of Madhya Pradesh earlier and it is not there today as well. The media just keeps carrying such stories,” he said.

Madhya Pradesh Congress has been in a soup lately after loyalists of Jyotiraditya Scindia threatened to resign from the party if he is not made the state Congress chief. Chief Minister Kamal Nath has also met interim Congress national president and UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi in this context.
