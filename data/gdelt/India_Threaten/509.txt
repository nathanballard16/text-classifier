She Wanted to See Her Boyfriend. She May Have Been Beheaded for It.

NEW DELHI — The 16-year-old girl had simply decided to go to her boyfriend’s birthday party. A week later, her body was found along a highway, her head and one of her arms chopped off. Her face may have been burned with acid.

In her small town in eastern India, it is forbidden for a teenage girl to date, and the police believe the girl’s father arranged for her to be killed — supposedly to protect the family’s honor.

It was yet another stomach-turning case of extremely sadistic violence against a woman or a girl in India. On Friday, the police said the girl’s father, Turaj Prasad, had been formally arrested, along with a friend of his who was suspected of carrying out the killing. Charges were expected to be filed later. (The police are withholding the girl’s name.)

“It will be a long fight for the girl’s human rights,’’ said Gopal Patwa, an activist in Gaya, the main town in the area where the killing took place. “The condition her body was found in is inhuman, and I do not have words to describe the gory details.”
