India is threatening lives of millions of Kashmiris: FO

Foreign Office (FO) Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal has warned that the lives of millions of Kashmiris are in imminent danger due to India's nefarious behaviour after the revocation of Occupied Kashmir’s special status on August 5.Briefing the Senate Committee on Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan Affairs on Wednesday, the FO spokesperson said, “The Kashmiri people are in danger in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK). New Delhi wants another Pulwama-like attack to justify its atrocities as anti-terrorism measures."Dr Faisal informed the committee that Indian forces have jailed more than 4,000 people in IOK to quell anti-India protests."Kashmiris remain trapped in their homes; there is a communication blackout and no freedom of movement. There is one soldier outside each and every house in IOK.”On India's ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC), the FO spokesperson said, “The situation is becoming increasingly dangerous as ceasefire violations are occurring every day. Both sides are suffering loss of lives; some of our soldiers have been martyred and the Pakistan Army has retaliated with courage to kill several Indian soldiers."Dr Faisal said Islamabad is closely monitoring the situation in IOK and has downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi in light of the decision taken by the National Security Committee (NSC).He informed the committee that Pakistan would also be raising the Kashmir issue at the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation's foreign ministers' meeting.On the impact of worsening Pak-India ties on the Indus Water Treaty and the flood alert in Pakistan due to India's release of water, Dr Faisal said, “The Indus River System Authority (IRSA) is looking into the matter and not the FO.”“We know that India has released water into River Sutlej and we are closely following the technical aspects of the issue. We are also convening a meeting on the matter which will be attended by all stakeholders.”
