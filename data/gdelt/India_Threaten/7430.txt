PM Modi attacks opposition in last poll public meeting in Bihar

In his last public meeting related to election at Paliganj in Patna district, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday attacked opposition parties on corruption issues.

“Whether it Congress party or corrupt family of Bihar they gobble-up thousands of crore rupees of poor people…these mahamilawati (contaminated) people do not understand the pain of poor people. Even though the people of Bihar put their trust in them for decades, what did they do for Bihar?” PM Modi said.

The NDA candidate from Patna and Patliputra, Sahib Ravi Shankar Prasad and Ram Kripal Yadav, along with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and other senior State BJP leaders were present on the dais.

While making a veiled reference to RJD chief Lalu Prasad and his family, PM Modi said, “they even betrayed their own caste… they engaged the young bright youths of their caste in dabangai (arm twisting activities).” The mahamilawati (contaminated) opposition parties practice only negative politics, he said, adding that removing Modi is their only agenda.

PM Modi said that NDA government introduced 10% reservation for the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) for their development. He listed development works and welfare schemes of NDA government for the common people. “When they see roads, electricity, metro, AIIMS, medical colleges, then they feel development,” he said. “India has the cheapest Internet in the world as part of Digital India campaign by the NDA government,” he added.

PM Modi announced that his government has decided to form a separate ministry for the fishermen community.

Raising the issue of terrorism and nationalism, he said “now our brave sons will enter into terrorists home and strike” as the crowd cheered.
