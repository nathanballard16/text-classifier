Day 9: Talks fail, students’ protest continues at PAU

Ludhiana: The PAU students’ protest continued for the 9th consecutive day as talks between student representatives and university authorities failed on Thursday.

Though the authorities said issue of revision of the fee structure could be taken up with the board of management, students were adamant on the car pass issue and parking facility near Thapar Hall.

Though the meeting was supposed to take place in the morning, it was deferred till 4pm due to absence of PAU authorities. The evening meeting, which was attended by four deans, director of students’ welfare, estate officer and student representatives, lasted till 6.30pm.

Students said PAU should allow cars to their hostels and field areas and designate a parking lot behind Thapar Hall as parking near Gate No 1 doesn’t help the cause.

Karanvir, a student representative, said, “Thapar Hall is situated close to departments. Most of our issues will be resolved if the authorities allow parking near the hall. Also, we want cars should be allowed in the field areas.”

On the prospectus fee issue, Lovepreet Singh Brar, a student, said, “The authorities should charge for the application. They can charge the rest of the amount if the candidate clears the entrance test and reaches the counseling stage.”

Students said they would continue the protest till their demands are not fulfilled.

Estate Officer Dr Vishavjit Singh Hans said, “Though we looked at all the demands of students, we won’t soften our stand on the car ban issue. We listened to them and asked them to come up with a proposal that will ease their issues of car parking. The committee has proposed a parking near Thapar Hall, but that is an experimental area of plant breeding department. Besides its feasibility, we also discussed different options to come up with a parking lot that will be convenient for everyone.”
