Country stands to lose if Modi no longer PM: Devendra Fadnavis

Sources said that 15,000 chairs had been placed at the ground. However, a few chairs were vacant.

Mumbai: Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said that if Narendra Modi were not voted to power again, he would have nothing to lose but the country would face a heavy loss. Referring to the general election, Mr Fadnavis termed it a historical one, which would decide the future of the country.

Addressing a Yuva Mahasangam, which was organised to felicitate state-level winners of chief minister Chashak tournaments, he said that the party youth should work as soldiers in the 2019 election to ensure the victory of the party for the development of the country under the leadership of Mr Modi for the next five years.

Despite booking three special trains, the state Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) was unable to gather around 15,000 youths from across the state at Somaiya Ground. Sources said that 15,000 chairs had been placed at the ground. However, a few chairs were vacant. The BJP had claimed that 50,000 youths would participate in the event. Quoting the Economic Survey of India’s report, he said that the country had saved Rs 95,000 crore through the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme. Hence, thieves were not getting an opportunity to steal money. And now they have united to unseat Narendra Modi.

Mr Fadnavis had compared the opposition with jackals and termed Mr Modi a tiger. He said, “Even if animals come together, they can’t defeat a tiger, who is the king of the jungle. Our Modiji is a tiger, and let the jackals unite all they want. But Mr Modi can’t be defeated.”

Attacking the Opposition parties, including the Congress, Mr Fadnavis said that if the Mahagathbandhan government comes to power, the PM would be changed every day of the week. NCP Chief Sharad Pawar would be made PM on Sunday as this is a holiday, he said.
