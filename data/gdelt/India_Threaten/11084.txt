Gangster who threatened Salman’s bodyguard nabbed

Allahabad: Two wanted men — one of whom had hogged headlines for issuing threats to actor Salman Khan’s bodyguard last year — were arrested by a joint team of Crime Branch and Shahganj police on Sunday.

A countrymade pistol of .315 bore along with two live cartridges were found on Shahrukh, alias Shera, and Sharim who are residents of Dayrashah Ajmal and Mohatsimganj, respectively. A scooter was also seized.

SP (Crime) Ashutosh Mishra said both Shahrukh and Sharim were wanted in more than a dozen cases and carried a reward of Rs 25,000 each. “We acted on a tip-off that they were planning unlawful activities near Leader Road. A joint team swung into action and cordoned off the area after which the two were nabbed,” the SP said.

Shahrukh, police said, had made news in November 2018 when he failed to secure a movie role in Mumbai and allegedly threatened the bodyguard of Salman. His Bollywood dreams dashed, he returned to his hometown and indulged in petty offences. A few months later, he formed his own gang.

Police records show Shahrukh is wanted in at least 15 criminal cases.
