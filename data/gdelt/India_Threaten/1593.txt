'Political crisis will strike coalition govt if Parrikar steps down from CM post'

Panaji (Goa) [India], Feb 4 (ANI): Deputy Speaker of the Goa legislative assembly Michael Lobo on Monday said the day Chief Minister Manohar Parrikar steps down from the post or "something happens to him", a political crisis will strike the incumbent BJP-led coalition government.

"As long as Manohar Parrikar is chief minister of Goa, there is no crisis. The day Manohar Parrikar steps down as the Chief Minister or something happens to him, that day political crisis will strike in Goa. People have to understand that he is sick, he is unwell. The ailment that he has got has no cure. With God's blessings, he is living on the strength of God. Some God has given him blessing to work. As long as he is here, there will be no political crisis," the BJP MLA also said.

Parrikar is suffering from a pancreatic ailment and has been in and out of hospitals in Goa, Mumbai, Delhi and New York since February 2018. He was reportedly admitted to the cancer department of AIIMS, Delhi on February 1.

With a tube in his nose, ailing Parrikar on January 30 presented the Goa Budget in the Assembly, asserting that he was "high on josh (enthusiasm)".

In his about six-minute speech giving the operative part of the budget, the chief minister vowed to serve the state with sincerity, integrity and dedication till his last breath.

For long, the Congress has been demanding that it should be allowed to form the government in the state, claiming that Parrikar's prolonged illness and inability to attend office was taking a toll on administration and governance. (ANI)
