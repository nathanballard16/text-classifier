Six civilians killed as India and Pakistan resume shelling in Kashmir

Recent fighting has been the worst escalation between India and Pakistan in nearly two decades

Indian and Pakistani forces have killed at least six civilians and two Pakistan soldiers in fighting at their border in Kashmir, officials said today.

Fighting resumed overnight, after hopes that tensions would be eased by the release of an Indian pilot shot down and captured by Pakistan.
