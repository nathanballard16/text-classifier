A young doctor was brutally attacked by a violent mob at NRS Medical College, Kolkata. He is fighting for his life. We condemn any form of violence, especially against medical professionals. It’s counterproductive, demoralising healthcare providers, taking away their confidence and courage, especially in critical situations,” reads the memo addressed to the PM.In another appeal, addressed to Union home minister Amit Shah, they asked for a central legislation in the matter. “We demand a special law to deal with violence against doctors, with a minimum jail term of seven years,” read that memo.
