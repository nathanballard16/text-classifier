I&B advisory to channels: Don’t incite divisive sentiments

NEW DELHI: The infor mation and broadcasting ministry on Saturday issued an advisory to all news channels in the wake of the Supreme Court judgment on Ayodhya case to desist from telecasting any debates or visuals which could hurt sentiments of any section of the people.In a single page advisory, the ministry said in view of the verdict it becomes “imperative to ensure that debates/discussions/visuals carried on electronic media do not incite any divisive or anti national feelings or sentiments”.Citing the Cable Television Networks (Regulation) Act, 1995, the ministry also listed out seven no-go areas for all news channels.It said channels must ensure that none of the content telecast should “contain attack on religions or communities or visuals or words contemptuous of religious groups which promote antinational attitudes”.It asked them to refrain from showing “defamatory, false and suggestive innuendos and half truths”, or any content that is “likely to encourage or incite violence or contains anything against maintenance of law and order”.The ministry also said channels should steer clear of telecasting anything that amounts to “contempt of court” and cautioned them against “criticising, maligning or slandering any individual in person or certain groups, segments of social, public life of the country”.
