New Delhi: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has blamed the "outsiders" for the ruckus created at a Kolkata hospital which snowballed into a pan-India doctors’ strike.

“We have to bring Bangla forward. When I go to Bihar, UP, Punjab, I speak in their language, if you are in Bengal you have to speak Bangla. I will not tolerate criminals who stay in Bengal and roam around on bikes,” Barnerjee said.

Earlier, Mamata Banerjee gave an ultimatum to the agitating doctors to return to work in a few hours, after which 53 junior doctors in the state resigned en masse. Following the incident, doctors from medical colleges and state-run hospitals went on a strike across different states.

During hearing of a public interest litigation (PIL) in the case, the Calcutta High Court refused to pass an interim order on the strike but remided the agitating doctors of the Hippocratic oath that they take to ensure the welfare of all patients.

Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan urged Mamata Banerjee not to make it a "presitige issue" as the agitating doctors were only demanding security after getting beaten up badly and action against perpetrators of the violence. But instead of doing that, she threatened them and gave them an ultimatum, the Union minister said.

Doctors from Delhi, Mumbai, Chandigarh, Hyderabad and now Cuttack joined the ongoing strike.

On Monday, two of the junior doctors at Nil Ratan Sarkar Medical College in Kolkata were attacked by alleged relatives of an 82-year-old patient who died there. One of the junior doctors was severely injured and hospitalised due to a head injury.
