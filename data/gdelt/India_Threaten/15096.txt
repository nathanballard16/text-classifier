Bhopal: 21-year-old college student raped at Van Vihan National Park

A 21-year-old BA first-year student was allegedly raped by a distant relative at Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal.

A rape case has been registered against the accused at the Shyamla Hills police station where the crime was committed.

The accused has been identified as Vikram Jatav. He is married and works as a driver in a private company.

The accused is a relative of the victim's cousin sister's husband. The accused and the victim had met earlier on a couple of occasions.

According to the Shyamla Hills police station in-charge, Bharat Pratap Singh, "The victim knew the accused and they had met earlier on a couple of occasions."

"The victim, in her complaint, has alleged that the accused called her in August and they went to the Van Vihar National Park in Bhopal for a stroll where the accused first thrashed her and then raped her. He then fled the spot after threatening to kill the victim if she approached the police," Singh added.

The accused initially did not call the victim but he got emboldened when he realised that she had not complained to anyone. He then started calling her and insisting on meeting alone.

After their first meeting, the victim didn't turn up for the second time which enraged the accused and he started blackmailing her with threats that he would disclose everything to his friends.

The victim, on Sunday, told the same to her family members who approached the Khajoori police station where a case was registered. The case diary was transferred to Shyamla Hills on Monday.

The accused is still at large. A team had raided his residence on Monday but he had fled the spot before their arrival, police said.
