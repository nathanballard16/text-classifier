Prachi was doubted on for stealing Rhea’s necklace.

While checking the pockets, Aaliya found the diamond necklace in Prachi’s pocket, looking at which Abhi and the rest were shocked. Prachi stood shell shocked and wondered how did the necklace come in her pocket.

In the meantime, police come and Aaliya tells them to arrest the thief, Prachi. Shahana begs the police not to arrest Prachi as she was innocent.
