Governor okays 16% Maratha quota law

MUMBAI: Clearing the way for a Maratha quota in all admissions involving a national test, Governor C Vidyasagar Rao on Monday signed an ordinance providing 16% reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs) in educational institutions from 2019-20 in Maharashtra The ordinance is intended to be applicable to even MBBS and allied courses such as dentistry, for which an entrance test notification was issued before November 30 when an SEBC Act became law. An official explained that when the NEET test for MD/MS/DNB/MDS courses was announced on November 1, the state’s Maratha quota was not in force as the reservation was notified after the central admission process commenced. The 16% quota in the state’s share of PG medical seats was notified only in February , said an official.The ordinance would now apply to all streams and courses where national entrance exams are held. For courses which come under state-run entrance tests, the SEBC Act is meant to provide the legal basis. Students from the open category, who will be hit because of the new quota, plan to continue their protest against the ordinance.
