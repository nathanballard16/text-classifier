Sabarimala women entry: Opinion makers react

Menstruation is a natural process and women's entry needs to be accepted. This is a socially important gesture and we must implement the Supreme Court order well. We will fight it out in the Supreme Court on January 22. Through such little things the world of the Malayali women should be broadened, deliberately.It’s Neil Armstrong’s words after setting foot on the moon that came to my mind, as I learnt about Sabarimala women entry . As a citizen of India, I believe that this is another small, yet big and powerful step towards women empowerment.
