GHAZIABAD: ‘Anti-Romeo’ squads have taken action against 45 people under Section 151 (arrest to prevent the commission of cognizable offences) of the CrPC during the first 12 days of their drive in the district.Police said that under the one-month “girls/women security” campaign, the squads checked 7,529 people around schools, colleges and public places and issued warnings to 1,351 of them. “We mainly checked people roaming on motorcycles near educational institutes. Those who could not give any valid reason for being there were issued warnings. Those who were found drunk and following girls were booked under 151 CrPC and produced before a magistrate,” said SP (rural) Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, also the nodal officer of ‘anti-Romeo’ squads in the district. Jadaun added that so far, awareness campaigns have been conducted at 143 schools.Ghaziabad police have installed pink letterboxes in all private and government schools where girl students can drop anonymous complaints. Jadaun said 100 such letterboxes have been checked and five letters were found. “Action was required in two cases and that has been done,” he said.One girl wrote that on one hand police are asking them to register complaint, but on the other, they misbehave with complainants and make them feel guilty for doing so. SP (city) Shlok Kumar wrote back to the girl and also sent her a box of chocolates. “The police is for citizens security and no police officer worth his/her salt would misbehave with the aggrieved, especially if it is a brave girl like her,” he wrote.
