New Delhi: The Supreme Court (SC) on Friday issued a notice to the Central government and 11 states to prevent assault and social boycott of Kashmiris and other minorities are in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack.

SC advocate Tariq Adeeb filed a petition on Thursday requesting the apex court for an urgent hearing of the plea. He also cited the tweet of Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy who called for a boycott of Kashmiris after the Kashmir attack.

On Tuesday, the controversial governor of Meghalaya, who has made communally-charged statements in the past, called for a boycott of "everything Kashmir". “An appeal from a retired colonel of the Indian Army: Don’t visit Kashmir, don’t go to Amarnath for the next 2 years. Don’t buy articles from Kashmir emporia or Kashmiri tradesman who come every winter. Boycott everything Kashmiri. I am inclined to agree,” Roy tweeted on February 19. The statement caused a huge furore as rights activists alleged that such treatment will further lead to alienation of Kashmiri citizens.

The apex court directed chief secretaries and DGPs to "promptly" take action against assaults and social boycott of Kashmiris and other minorities. The SC bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi also directed the nodal police officers previously appointed to deal with cases of mob lynching to look into cases of assault on Kashmiris.

"The chief secretaries, the DGPs and the Delhi Police Commissioner are directed to take prompt and necessary action to prevent incidents of threat, assault, social boycott etc. against Kashmiris and other minorities," Justice Sanjiv Khanna said.
