‘Remote control of power is in our hands’ Shiv Sena warns BJP

New Delhi: With Maharashtra Assembly results out, Shiv Sena has warned BJP of holding the “remove control of power in Maharashtra,” though it had secured fewer seats in this elections.

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut in the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana wrote, “Though the Sena has won a fewer seats this time, 56 as compared to last time’s (2014) 63, but it has the remote control of power”, ST reports.

Previously the Shiv Sena party had demanded a 50-50 seat share in Maharashtra on Saturday.

Not only a 50-50 seat share but the party has also demanded that both the allies should get a chance to run government for 2.5 years each so that Shiv Sena can also have a chief minister.

The two parties together secured 160 seats in Maharashtra, way below their expectation of crossing the 200-mark.
