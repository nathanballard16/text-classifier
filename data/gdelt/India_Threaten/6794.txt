A foreign hand afoot in the Himalayas?

At a time when many people are not willing to believe India’s armed forces identified an F16’s electronic imprint on its radar, news that an Army team claims that it has proof of the legendary yeti is not very helpful.An F16 is a more accepted object than Nessie or yeti, and more easily identifiable too, yet there are quibbles. And now a single line of giant prints of one foot near the base camp of Mt Makalu on the snowbound Nepal-Tibet border is being cited as definitive proof of a creature whose only known image is in Tintin in Tibet.It has, of course, always been alternatively known as Big Foot, not Big Feet, so the trail may well be genuine; but a hopping mad — and, therefore, abominable — snowperson (gender unknown) traipsing around near India is not welcome news either.This week, Norway claimed to have found a beluga whale strapped with a Russian-made camera lurking in its Arctic waters, giving credence to the theory that President Vladimir Putin has more than just furry Navy seals at his disposal for deep-sea espionage.Just because the Indian Army has not announced the recovery of incriminating equipment near the footprints, the involvement of a foreign bigfoot surely cannot be ruled out. If it is ever caught, hopefully India’s policy will be Yeti bachao, yeti bachao, so that it can offer information about its past.
