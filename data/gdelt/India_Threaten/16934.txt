IMD issues warning in the wake of Cyclone Pawan

The India Meteorological Department (IMD), on Friday, issued a warning for fishermen in Gujarat, in the wake of the cyclonic storm “Pawan” over the south-west Arabian Sea near the African coast that is likely to bring unseasonal rain in parts of Gujarat on Saturday.

“Light rain would occur at isolated places in some districts of Saurashtra and Kutch on Saturday,” said IMD in a release.

It has also warned the fishermen to not to venture into the area for the next two days. The weather department has also advised the authorities to hoist “Distant Warning” signal number 2 (DW-II) for the boat owners at all the ports in northern and southern parts of Gujarat to warn them of the rough sea conditions.

A warning of bad weather has also been issued by IMD because of a depression over east-central Arabian Sea that is “very likely to move west-northwestwards and weaken into a well-marked low pressure area during the next 3 hours.”
