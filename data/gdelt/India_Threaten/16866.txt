Rajkot screams winin helmet relaxation

Rajkot: Nothing has met with a bigger Hamletian dilemma However, ‘to wear or not to wear’, never seemed much of an option in front of the ‘headstrong’ Rajkot people who seem sworn not to wear the humble headgear, ever since rules made it compulsory for riders in city areas.Such has been the spate of opposition here, that if the city decided to rise to another chapter of civil disobedience, the reasons this time can be put squarely on the head.If sources are to be believed a few prominent industrialists too had warned chief minister Vijay Rupani in Rajkot that the prevailing resentment may even prove to BJP’s biggest nemesis in the upcoming local body elections, including the Rajkot Municipal Corporation (RMC).Congress was quick to grab credit for the latest development and claimed that it’s a victory of their agitation. Party workers, who joined the public protest, broke helmets in Trikonbaug of Rajkot and even burst firecrackers to celebrate their win.Rajkot Chamber of Commerce and Industry president, V P Vaishnav, said, “We represented the government to give exemption from wearing helmet in city area and aggressively opposed the compulsory rule. We are happy that our voice is heard finally.”Rajkot has been the most vociferous in the opposition to the helmet rule.Public resistance to the new rules was, however, equally checkmated by the police department.Traffic cops started collecting stiff penalties at every possible crossroad, thus aggravating people’s ire even further.Rajkot citizens had been continuously demanding exemption from wearing helmets within city limits.Their chorus was also joined by prominent people and organization like RCCI and Rajkot Bar Association. In fact, the bar association members took out a rally in this regard and met the collector demanding exemption.The police commissioner was forced to issue ‘helmet’ guidelines for the cops and even impose fines on rule breakers within the department.Wednesday’s decision, however, didn’t soften Ashok Patel, a man who has been spearheading the opposition against helmet for the last one decade. Last week he announced a civil disobedience programme on December 11.“We will go on the highway without wearing helmets. The government exempted urban people. So, why should the rural people, whose only source of commuting from one village to another is a two-wheeler, pay fine for not wearing helmets?” Patel questioned, while talking to TOI.
