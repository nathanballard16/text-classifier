AIIMS, Safdarjung doctors end strike; warns of indefinite stir if demands not met by Mamata in 48 hrs

On Friday, doctors held protests across the country in solidarity with their colleagues in West Bengal. In Delhi, doctors from AIIMS, Safdarjung, Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals and several private hospitals went on strike, demanding security for their colleagues in West Bengal. According to reports, these doctors have also turned down Banerjee's invitation for a meeting at the state secretariat, which was called to resolve the impasse and continued with their protest for the fifth consecutive day on Saturday.

The resident doctors at the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences and Safdarjung hospital called off their strike on Saturday and agreed to go back to work. However, the AIIMS Association of Resident Doctors have threatened to sit on a indefinite stir if the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee fails to meet the demand of medical practitioners in the state within 2 days. “All resident doctors are back to work but we will continue with symbolic protest by wearing black badges, bandages and, helmets. If condition worsens we will go on indefinite strike from June 17,” Amrinder Singh Malhi, President, Association of Resident Doctors, AIIMS told news agency ANI. However, the Federation of Resident Doctors Association informed that the resident doctors of as many as 14 government hospitals across the national capital will remain on strike today. Resident doctors in West Bengal, Delhi and different parts of the country are protesting against the assault on two of their colleagues at NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata and have sought unconditional apology from Banerjee and set six conditions for the state government in order to withdraw the stir.
