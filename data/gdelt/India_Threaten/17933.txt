"As these protests (against the CAA) are increasing, threat to Pak from India is also increasing. Indian Army Chief's statement adds to our concerns of a False Flag operation," Khan tweeted.

"I have been warning the int community of this for some time & am reiterating again: if India does such an operation to divert attention from its domestic chaos plus whip up war hysteria to mobilise Hindu nationalism, Pak will have no option but to give a befitting response," the following tweet read.
