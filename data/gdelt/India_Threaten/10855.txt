Govt calls on industry to make robust investments in 5G tech

The government has called on the Indian telecom industry and other stakeholders such as SMEs and startups to make “robust” investments in 5G technology to ensure innovation and development of India-specific products.In his inaugural address at the ET Telecom 5G Congress on Thursday, minister of state for communications Sanjay Dhotre said the government was doing its part to improve ease of doing business in the sector and to ensure fair competition in the private sector.But the states at their level also need to make 5G a priority since this will be the infrastructure of the future, he said."There is need of robust investment of industry in 5G innovation, startups and creation of 5G products that can create India-specific patents," the minister said.He said the department of telecommunications (DoT) was working with different ministries to create India-specific use case in areas like education, healthcare and public safety, and that the private sector stakeholders have a new opportunity to develop 5G ecosystem."From our side we will do our best for ease of doing business... We want fair competition," the minister said, underlining the government's efforts to improve the environment to do business in the sector.Aruna Sundararajan, who was telecom secretary until her retirement on July 31, cautioned that if India falls behind, there could be a deceleration in GDP. “We should ensure that 5G trials begin without delay... and get on with roll outs," she said. “Any industry that is not geared up for 5G will pay a heavy cost," she said, highlighting that the technology platform will be critical for all industries, not just telecom, for future growth.Besides ease of doing business, the government has to look at aspects of national security while introducing 5G in India, said Sundararajan."India must look for the best bargain it can get in terms of technology transfer, local manufacturing, etc while not compromising on security," she said.Security remains a major concern, even for the European Union, though a comprehensive 5G policy package has been in the works since 2012, said Tomasz Kozlowski, ambassador of the European Union to India."In March this year, the EU released its security risks assessment and plans to finalise mitigation efforts to address these risks by the end of this year," he said.India has a lot to gain from collaborations with the EU in terms of sharing of information, expertise and best practices, especially when about 150 5G trials have been conducted in more than 20 member states.As per the 5G Action Plan of 2016, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) envisages 5G services roll out in at least one city of each member state by 2020, he said.The EU engages with India on topics like net neutrality, internet governance and data protection and privacy, and is one of India’s biggest trading partners with $140 billion of total trade in goods and services.There are over 6,000 EU companies investing in India while in the ICT sector, European companies have created over 100,000 jobs in India."India should adopt strong data protection laws to facilitate increased collaboration and improve data flows with the EU," Kozlowski added.
