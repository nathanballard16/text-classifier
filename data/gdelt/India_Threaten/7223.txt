Warning over global failure to act on deaths from drug-resistant TB

The spiralling number of deaths from drug-resistant tuberculosis (DR-TB) is set to cost the world economy nearly $20billion annually.

A report from the Economist Intelligence Unit warned that despite the fact that DR-TB is a huge global health threat, the fight against the disease lags behind others in terms of both money and attention.

In low and middle-income countries, where 97 per cent of the TB cases took place in 2018, there was an estimated $3.5billion shortfall in the total $10billion budget required to address the disease.

TB receives about an eighth of the amount of international funding that HIV does, and about half of the funding of malaria.

There were 230,000 deaths from DR-TB in 2017, compared to 49,500 in 2014, and the EIU report estimates that deaths attributed to DR-TB in one year will cost the global economy at least $17.8 billion in future GDP loss.

Work absences caused by people having treatment for DR-TB were estimated to have resulted in a loss to global GDP of at least $3 billion in 2018 alone.
