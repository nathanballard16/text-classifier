Don't cut, translocate trees: Hyderabad's Nallagandala sees fierce protests

Residents of Nallagandala, a fast developing suburb of Hyderabad, took to the streets on Thursday to protest against authorities for cutting several trees to widen roads in the area.



The unprecedented felling of trees started on November 8 for the widening of Nallagandla-Tellapur Road by the Roads and Buildings Department, which irked locals as well green activists.



"More than 70 trees have been cut and another 300 odd trees are under threat for road expansion," said one of protesters, holding a placard against the authorities.



More than 100 people, including residents of Nallagandla, environmentalists and civil societies from across the city of Hyderabad gathered to protest against the deforestation drive and call for protection of the green cover.



Denizens have also stated an online petition under #SaveNallagandalaTrees.



Activists have also pitched for translocation of the trees instead of chopping them down.



Amid opposition, forest department officials visited the site to look into the matter and assured to immediately suspend the felling of trees.
