UAE Embassy issues gold warning to Emiratis

Dubai: A new travel advisory with respect to carrying gold to India has been issued by the UAE Embassy in the subcontinent.

The UAE Embassy in India is urging all UAE nationals to disclose all their gold jewellery at the airports.

The move is expected to help travellers avoid legal hassles.

In its tweet, posted a day ago, @UAEembassyIndia said it “urges UAE nationals wishing to visit India to disclose their gold jewelery to the relevant authorities at Indian airports in order to avoid legal accountability.”
