SP-BSP alliance will make PM Modi rethink plans to contest from Varanasi, says Tejashwi

Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Yadav said on Monday that the alliance between Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samata Party (BSP) will force PM Narendra Modi to give his plans of contesting Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi a rethink.

Tejashwi, who was former deputy chief minister of Bihar, met BSP supremo Mayawati and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav after the two announced their seat-sharing formula for the 2019 elections.

In an exclusive interview to India Today TV, Tejashwi said that the alliance between SP and BSP was historic.

"BJP is jittery after the BSP-SP alliance and they should be asked whether Narendra Modi will fight elections from Varanasi again," Tejashwi Yadav said in Patna.

He said he did not think that SP-BSP came together for political gains.

The Congress is not part of the alliance forged by SP and BSP in UP, but Tejashwi firmly maintained that they are an integral part of any such coalition in Bihar.

He said that his father and RJD chief Lalu Prasad always stood with former Congress president Sonia Gandhi in bad times.

"One should never think that Congress will not be part of mahagathbandhan in Bihar. We are together but all the parties in this grand alliance will have to make compromises," said Tejashwi.

The Yadav scion lashed out at Narendra Modi government earlier in the day when he addressed media in a joint press conference with Akhilesh Yadav.

"My father is also in jail because PM saw him as a threat," said Tejashwi.

He alleged that institutions like CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) have become alliance partners of the BJP.
