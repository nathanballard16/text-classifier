TheUnion had sought quashing of an order that had set a 2018 deadline for these vehiclesThe government has informed the High Court that two-stroke auto-rickshaws will be allowed to ply on city roads till March 2020. The earlier deadline was March 2018 which was under challenge before the court.TheAuto Drivers Union had challenged the government order (GO) dated May 15, 2017, which permitted auto-rickshaws having two-stroketo ply only till March 31, 2018. The petition before the HC was filed in 2018 but was disposed only two weeks ago. The Union had also approached theand the Government with a representation to allow the use of these autos beyond the restricted date.The Additional Government Advocate submitted to the court that the last date had been extended till March 31, 2020. So this aspect of the prayer was not considered by the HC.The government plans to ban all two-stroke auto-rickshaws after March 2020. There are over 25,000 such autos inand are a major cause of air and noise pollution. The government also provides a subsidy of Rs 30,000 if two-stroke auto owners scrap their vehicles or convert them to gas-run vehicles. Very few have opted for the scheme.Since 2011, there is a freeze on fresh permits for auto rickshaws in the city. The Transport Department has so far issued 1.25 lakh permits. However, the actual number of auto-rickshaws in the city is estimated to be nearly two lakh. Earlier this year, the department said that it would issue fresh permits for 5,000 CNG auto-rickshaws. The permits cost on Rs 500. But due to the freeze a black market for transferring permits thrives in the city.
