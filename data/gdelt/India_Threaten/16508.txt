Techie crushed to death by TSRTC bus in Hyderabad, angry mob thrashes inexperienced driver

A woman software engineer working with Tata Consultancy Services in Mumbai was crushed to death under the wheels of a rashly driven TSRTC bus on Tuesday afternoon at Banjara Hills Road 12 in Hyderabad.

Sohini Saxena, 24, was on her way to the local office when the two-wheeler which she was driving was hit by the bus driven by a new and inexperienced driver hired by the state government on contract basis as the TSRTC employees were on strike. She died on the spot.

Angry passersby and residents who witnessed the mishap stopped the bus even as the driver tried to drive away. They pelted stones at the bus and beat up the driver but police rescued him. However, the police could not take away the driver from the spot as people blocked them.

Although the TSRTC employees withdrew the strike on Monday, the state government has not allowed them, especially drivers and ticket collectors, to resume duties stating their strike was illegal and the Labour Commissioner would take a decision on whether they are still considered employees of TSRTC.

Today morning, hundreds of TSRTC employees were detained by cops all over Telangana for protesting outside their respective depots for not being allowed to resume duties. Hundreds of employees were also detained outside Jubilee and MGBS depots in Hyderabad.
