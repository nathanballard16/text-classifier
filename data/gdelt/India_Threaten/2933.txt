Saharkarnagar residents threaten Lok Sabha poll boycott

VADODARA: Residents of Sahakarnagar in Tandalja, who had lost their dwellings during razing drive, have given a call for boycotting upcoming Lok Sabha polls and go on hunger strike if construction of their houses does not begin soon.In a series of agitation program against the stalled work, the residents took out a huge rally from Tandalja to Trident Complex on Sunday morning. A scheme was to come up at the site on a public-private partnership (PPP) mode, but it is yet to take off.Residents alleged that on the promise of better houses and settlement within 18 months, they vacated the land, but the construction work at the site is yet to start. Around 1,428 houses and 75 shops were demolished by the civic body in 2017 and 1,400 houses were to be constructed under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana. However, a petition filed in the Gujarat high court stating that the land is a recognized waterbody stayed the project.Residents state that the irrigation department has to submit its report which can help in restarting the construction work, but it is only dragging its feet. Presently only a small pond filled with sludge exists on the spot as the remaining portion has been filled up over the years.The disgruntled residents had earlier taken out rallies to the district collectorate and the headquarters of Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) to submit memorandums and had also submitted postcards to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November last year.
