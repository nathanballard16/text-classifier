Cong MLAs illegally confined in Mumbai hotel: AICC to cops

The All India Congress Committee (AICC) has filed a complaint stating that rebel MLAs of the party from Karnataka have been illegally confined at a hotel in Mumbai, a police official said Wednesday.

He said action would be taken accordingly.

"Mumbai Police have received a complaint from the AICC Wednesday of illegal confinement of rebel Karnataka Congress MLAs at a Powai hotel," the official said.

Earlier in the day, as a high drama unfolded outside the hotel when senior Karnataka minister D K Shivakumar arrived there to meet the legislators, police officials told him that the rebel MLAs had written to the city police commissioner fearing a threat to their lives due to his arrival.

The letter signed by 10 MLAs of the Congress-JD (S) combine stated they have heard that Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy, Shivakumar and others are going to storm the hotel premises they are staying in and they feel threatened by this.

However, only Shivakumar turned up.

He was subsequently detained and sent packing back to Bengaluru.

Of the 14 MLAs from Karnataka who have resigned, 11 are from Congress and three from JD(S). The ruling coalition faces the threat of losing its majority if the resignations of the rebel MLAs are accepted.
