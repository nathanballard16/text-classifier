MUZAFFARABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan says the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) has set aside India's oppressive approach on the Kashmir issue, supporting a peaceful resolution of the dispute through dialogue.



"The Kashmir movement is gaining recognition in the international community with India's war crimes in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK) being castigated," he told media on the sidelines of the summit.



He said peace in the region hinged on a solution being found on the Kashmir issue, adding that "the only way forward is through dialogue between Pakistan and India".



The AJK president warned against further conflicts between the two nuclear armed neighbours which could have "dangerous consequences".



Earlier, speaking at the Ministerial Meeting of the OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir, the AJK president floated a nine-point formula for a diplomatic solution to Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.



He maintained that a multilateral diplomatic process for the resolution of the Kashmir dispute must be reactivated. In this regard, he urged the UN secretary general to play his role to resolve the Kashmir dispute and appoint a special envoy on Kashmir.



The 14th session of the OIC Summit in Makkah reiterated its principled support for the legitimate right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with UN resolutions, said a statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office.



“Referring to the UN Kashmir report of 2018, the final communique of the conference called for expedited establishment of a UN Commission of Inquiry to investigate the grave human rights violations and urged India to allow the Commission and other international organisations access to IoK,” it read.
