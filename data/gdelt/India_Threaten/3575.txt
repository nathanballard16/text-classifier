Army test fires anti-tank guided missile during training exercise

An anti-tank guided missile detachment fired at a mock target during a field live firing training exercise undertaken for troops of the Army's Eastern Command on Saturday.

This comes in the wake of the ongoing tensions between India and Pakistan.

Less than two weeks after 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives in a terror attack in Pulwama on February 14, the Indian Air Force carried out air strikes in Pakistan's Balakot targetting terror launch pads.

The targets included the control rooms of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) which claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack.

Pulwama terror attack had led to nationwide outrage and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had vowed to punish those behind the attack.

The international community, too, extended support to India in the wake of the attack.
