15 QRT personnel and the driver of the private vehicle they were in were killed in an IED blast on May 1

Interrogations reveal that two teams of armed and unarmed personnel were deployed near the blast site to kill those who survived the blast.The alleged perpetrators of the May 1 blast in Gadchiroli that claimed the lives of 15 security personnel had a ‘Plan B’ in place to eliminate potential survivors, investigations have revealed.Fifteen Quick Reaction Team (QRT) personnel and the driver of the private vehicle they were travelling in were killed when operatives of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) allegedly triggered an improvised explosive device (IED) blast at Jambhulkheda on Kurkheda-Purada Road on May 1.Maoists had also allegedly stationed a team of 15 armed personnel from its militia, the People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army (PLGA), close to the blast site to kill any potential survivor, said police sources.Apart from the 15 armed men, 20 more were reportedly deployed along the entire stretch of the route that the QRT team had taken after setting off from a police station in Purada. The team was being sent as “reinforcement” to Kurkheda to participate in operations against Maoists who had allegedly orchestrated an arson incident at Dadapur said a police source.About 12 hours before the blast, 27 vehicles had been set ablaze along with machines belonging to a construction contractor. According to the source, the blast was allegedly a part of their ‘bait-and-ambush’ tactic. The arson incident was meant to create an emergency that called for reinforcements to be sent from Purada in haste.Interrogations of the seven accused persons who have been arrested in the case so far have led to the disclosure of the strategy, the source said. “As part of the conspiracy, the Maoists used two types of operatives – unarmed ‘spotters’ or scouts, and armed PLGA men. Around 35 PLGA men were positioned across the route that the QRT men had taken, including 15 of them at the spot in Jambhulkheda where the IED was planted, and the rest at key points on the stretch, like toll nakas and road squares.”He said, “The armed PLGA men stationed at the blast site had been tasked to kill those who may have survived the blast.”“The Maoists had also positioned another operative near the IED, an unarmed scout whose job was to trigger the blast after confirming the identity of the marked vehicle,” the source said. “The perpetrators had calculated that any likely reinforcement would be sent by the police via the Kurkheda –Purada road as it was the only one available route for the purpose. The road was also an unlikely target in the eyes of the police as it had not seen any Maoist attacks over the past several years.”Sources added that Maoist ‘scouts’ had reportedly tailed the vehicle carrying the policemen the moment it set off on its journey. “Vehicle markers were stationed throughout to keep updating teams of its location till it reached the spot where the bomb was planted,” he said.The police achieved a breakthrough in the case a fortnight ago with its first arrests. Two allegedly senior CPI (Maoist) operatives, Uppuganti Nirmalakumari, 58, alias Narmadakka and her husband Satyanarayana, 70, alias Kirandada, members of the ‘’, had allegedly played “major roles” in planning the attack, according to the police.It was based on their interrogation, and intelligence gathered from local informers and technical intelligence, five more accused were arrested later on charges of conducting “reconnaissance” for targeting the QRT men. “One of the arrested men was at the blast site as a scout and we suspect he pulled the trigger of the IED,” the source said.
