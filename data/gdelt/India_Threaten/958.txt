Accident stalls traffic for 2 hours on Mumbai-Nashik Highway

Truck carrying white sand from Thane to Nashik crashes into boulder, overturns

Traffic was stalled for two hours on Mumbai-Nashik Highway on Monday after a truck crashed into a boulder and overturned at 5.30 a.m. near Ranjnoli Naka.

Motorists alerted the police control room and the information was relayed to the Thane police, which rushed personnel to the spot. The Thane police said the truck was transporting white sand from Thane to an industrial unit in Nashik. The road covered with sand was cordoned off as it was slippery and unsafe for driving.

Vehicles diverted

Amit Kale, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Thane Traffic Police, said, “It took two hours to clear the road. We first removed the truck and then arranged for JCB machines to scoop the sand. All vehicles were diverted through alternate routes such as Mankoli, Kharegaon and Pipeline Road.”

Personnel from the Kongaon police station, in whose jurisdiction the accident took place, and nearby police stations assisted the traffic police in crowd management and maintaining law and order. Senior police inspector R.T. Katkar of the Kongaon police station said, “Inquiries indicate that the driver erred while negotiating a turn and rammed into a boulder. The driver escaped with minor injuries.”

The police said the driver would be booked for endangering life due to rash and negligent driving under the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Motor Vehicles Act. Police officers said that he has been subjected to medical tests to check if he was driving under the influence of alcohol.

Meanwhile, the police had to dispel the fears of residents and motorists after rumours spread on WhatsApp that the truck was carrying dangerous chemicals.
