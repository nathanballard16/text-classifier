Citizenship bill protesters threaten 'do or die' agitation

Reports that the Centre is considering the ST status demand has been making rounds in the state recently. "Every native of Assam should understand that if the bill gets passed, it will pave the way for entry of 1.9 crore Bangladeshis into Assam. Assamese nationalism will die for ever and people of the state would no more be able to raise their voice before Delhi so vigorously. But, at the same time, the 70 organizations warn the BJP-led government not to play with our sentiments," he said. They have expressed apprehensions that the bill is going to be tabled in the Lok Sabha during the ongoing winter session of the Parliament itself.
