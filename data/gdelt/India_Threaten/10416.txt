UGC Identifies 23 'Self-Styled, Unrecognised' Universities

List Of Fake Universities: UGC Declares 23 Universities ; Maximum In UP Followed By Delhi

The higher education regulator, University Grants Commission (UGC), has released a list of 23 "self-styled, unrecognised" universities. Students and public at large are hereby informed that at present 23 self-styled, unrecognised institutions are functioning in various parts of the country in contravention of the UGC Act," UGC Secretary Rajnish Jain said. The UGC has warned students against taking admission in these fake universities, eight of which are in Uttar Pradesh, the highest in a state so far. Delhi has seven such counterfeited universities running.

Kerala, Karnataka, Maharashtra and Puducherry have one fake university each.

Also as per the Section 23 of the UGC Act, unrecognized institutions can't use “University” in their names. In 2017, a letter dated November 10 by UGC had asked 123 Deemed-to-be-Universities to drop the word 'University' from their names. The letter cited a Supreme Court order dated November 3, 2017 and said that the use of word 'University' by Deemed-to-be universities is in violation of the Section 23 of the UGC Act.

In Delhi, Commercial University Ltd, United Nations University, Vocational University, ADR-Centric Juridical University, Indian Institution of Science and Engineering, Adhyatmik Vishwavidyalaya (Spiritual University) and Viswakarma Open University for Self-Employment have been declared as fake.
