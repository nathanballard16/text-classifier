Firing creates panic in Dugri

Ludhiana: Panic gripped Dugri area when two men opened fire outside an immigration office on Wednesday afternoon. Nobody was injured in the incident.

Dugri police lodged an FIR against the unidentified accused under Sections 336 (Act endangering life or personal safety of others) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC.

ADCP-1 Jaskiranjit Singh said at 3.30pm, two men entered Evaa Immigration office in Dugri and asked for its owner Baljeet Singh. Even as office staff told the men that Baljeet Singh is out of town, the duo waited at the office for 10 minutes and then asked the staff to call him. A little later, the accused went out of the office, fired twice in the air and escaped in their car.

Official said Baljeet Singh, owner of immigration office, was a resident of Canada. Though Baljeet could not identify the accused whose images were captured in CCTV cameras installed in the office, police suspected personal or professional rivalry behind the incident.

The police are trying to trace the accused.
