Environmental impact study of Tallah Bridge demolition likely

Kolkata: The West Bengal government is planning to conduct a study to assess the environmental impact of demolishing the Tallah Bridge, located in the northern part of the city, a senior Public Works Department (PWD) official said on Wednesday. The measure is being considered as suggested by bridge expert V K Raina, who was in the city earlier this month. "It is mandatory to study the aspects of pollution in an event of the demolition of a huge structure like Tallah Bridge," the PWD official said. The department is also considering a study of the existing electrical and communication cables below the bridge to ensure that no service gets hampered due to the demolition, he said. The PWD department has already floated a tender for mapping the existing underground utility services below the bridge.
