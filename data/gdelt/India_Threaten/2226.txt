The official website of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Army and few others were reportedly hacked on Saturday night. Mohammad Faisal, the foreign ministry spokesperson, said they received complaints about the site being inaccessible by users from several countries but was functioning without any problem in the country. According to a report by Dawn the cyber-attack allegedly originated from India.

"The IT team is currently occupied in thwarting the hackers' onslaught," Faisal was quoted by Dawn as saying.

However, users from Australia, Saudi Arabia, United Kingdom and the Netherlands reported facing difficulty in accessing the site, reported ANI.

While the website of Pakistan MFA is not up yet, the Army website is showing Error 1009 and reads: “The owner of this website (www.pakistanarmy.gov.pk) has banned the country or region your IP address is in (IN) from accessing this website.”

The hacking of the website of Pakistan's foreign ministry and the army comes after India faced one of the deadliest terror attacks on its soil in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday. 40 CRPF personnel were killed in a suicide bomb blast after an explosives-laden SUV rammed into the convoy.

So far, more than 50 countries have condemned the barbaric attack and have pledged their full support to India in its fight against terrorism. Immediately after the attack, India withdrew the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status which was accorded to Pakistan in 1996.

Issuing a clear warning to Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that "the blood of Indians is boiling" and declared that the “protectors” of the people responsible for Pulwama terror attack will definitely be punished.
