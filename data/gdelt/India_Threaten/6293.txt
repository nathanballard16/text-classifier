Sangrur, April 22

Robbed by a chit fund company and having failed to see any action despite repeated efforts, Mahinderpal Singh Dangarh, a victim, today filed his nomination papers from the Sangrur Lok Sabha seat under the banner of Bharti Lok Sewa Dal (BLSD).

The party has fielded seven ponzi scheme victims in Punjab and given ticket to 50 candidates nationwide. Besides Sangrur, the party has fielded greenhorns from Anandpur Sahib, Fatehgarh Sahib, Bathinda, Ludhiana, Ferozepur and Faridkot seats.

“Only a member of the BLSD can understand the pain of ponzi scheme victims as it has been formed to fight for justice. I have lost lakhs of rupees to ponzi fraud and will take our fight to a logical conclusion,” says Dangarh, national president of the BLSD.

Before forming the party, Dangarh along with other victims struggled for around four years for justice under an NGO, Insaaf Di Awaaz. They then got the party registered to fight for justice through political means.

Apart from fighting for fraud victims, the BLSD is also highlighting the issues of farmer suicide and lack of health and education facilities in Punjab.

“On assurances of getting Rs 92 lakh in return, I invested Rs 25 lakh in a company in 2008, but have not received even a single penny as yet,” says Subedar Major Jagdev Singh Raipur (retd), party candidate from Bathinda.
