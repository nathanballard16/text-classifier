NEW DELHI, Dec. 29 (Xinhua) -- The India Meteorological Department (IMD) on Sunday issued a red-coded warning for parts of the country as a cold wave continues to sweep across the country.

"Red coded warning has been issued for Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar today," IMD said. "Red colour warning does not mean Red Alert, instead it means take action."

Officials said an IMD red warning means "extreme weather conditions."

According to IMD, Delhi recorded a low of 2.4 degrees Celsius on Saturday, the lowest in decades.

"Cold day to severe cold day conditions very likely in most pockets over Punjab, in many pockets over Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi, in some pockets over Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, in isolated pockets over Rajasthan ... " reads a statement issued by IMD on Sunday.

According to IMD, dense to very dense fog was likely to cover some pockets over Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh and Delhi.

Meanwhile, the air quality in Delhi on Sunday fell to the severe category mark, with the air quality index dangerously high at 412.

Officials attributed the deterioration in air quality and accumulation of pollutants in the city to low temperature along with high humidity and low wind speed.

Reports said the average maximum temperature this month is likely to be at 19.15 degrees Celsius. If it happens, it will be the coldest December since 1997 when it was 17.3 degrees Celsius and the second-coldest December since 1901.

Officials said a respite from the cold was expected from Dec. 31 to Jan. 2.
