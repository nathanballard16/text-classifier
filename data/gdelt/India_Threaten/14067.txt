New Delhi, September 28

A Delhi court on Saturday asked American multinational Apple Inc to furnish by October 9 the details of expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s location on the day he allegedly raped a 17-year-old girl from Unnao.

District Judge Dharmesh Sharma, holding in-chamber proceedings, gave the iPhone maker time till October 9 after the technology firm sought two weeks to locate and access the requisite data, said lawyers related to the case.

Counsel for Apple India Pvt Ltd told the court they needed to seek instructions regarding availability of the data because as of now it was not known whether the data was stored, and if yes, where and whether it was available. The company counsel further said they were yet to take a decision on the format in which the data, if available, could be supplied to the court.

The court directed the Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) to assist the rape survivor’s family in getting accommodation in the national capital after reportedly being told that landlords were unwilling to give their premises on rent to the family.

The court asked the chairperson of the DCW to nominate two counsellors to assess the family’s residential requirements and assist them in finding a suitable place in Delhi at a reasonable rent, or in any government accommodation for at least 11 months, the sources said. — PTI
