Bihar news: Tej Pratap Yadav breaks away as father-in-law gets ‘family’ seat

PATNA: The rift within RJD widened on Monday with party chief Lalu Prasad 's elder son Tej Pratap announcing the formation of a ' Lalu-Rabri Morcha ' and hinting at contesting against his father-in-law Chandrika Rai from Saran. Tej, whose divorce petition against his wife Aishwarya Rai is pending in a Patna family court, also made public his anguish over RJD giving the ticket for Saran to his father-in-law."My father Laluji had won from there. Even my mother had contested. This is our family seat just like Rae Bareli is for Rahul Gandhi . So, I request my mother with folded hands to contest from Saran, or else I will contest under the banner of Lalu-Rabri Morcha. I am sure of winning," he told reporters at his Patna residence on Monday.Tej said his front would scrutinise all 20 seats in the RJD's kitty: "Youth, women and dedicated party workers cannot be ignored. Many people are in touch with me for tickets. One thing is clear that a party runs with the help of workers and they shouldn't be overlooked."He named Rajan Tiwari as his candidate for Paschim Champaran and Ballinder Das for Hajipur. Both were present at the press conference with him.However, at the recent grand-alliance press conference, Tejashwi had announced the name of Shiv Chandra Ram for Hajipur, while Paschim Champaran was given to RJD ally RLSP.Tej said he was unhappy with denial of tickets to his other associates - Chandra Prakash from Jehanabad and Angesh Singh from Sheohar. "Tejashwi ji had said he would meet me and the issue would be sorted in two days. But he did not call me, though election is approaching. They (Angesh and Chandar Prakash) will be contesting under the Lalu-Rabri Morcha," the Mahua MLA said."I am with my Arjun (Tejashwi) but a few people sitting at his feet and chair are creating a rift between two brothers."
