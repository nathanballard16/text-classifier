Jammu and Kashmir parties slam 10 per cent quota move

J&K is under President’s Rule since June 2018.

SRINAGAR: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and president of Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) Mehbooba Mufti on Friday accused the Narendra Modi government of making “sinister” moves by using the governor’s office to further disempower the state. “This will not be tolerated and the entire state will fight against this criminal and illegal move of government of India,” she said.

The PDP leader was reacting the government’s giving its consent to extension of two Central constitutional amendments to J&K on recommendations of the state’s governor Satya Pal Malik for granting reservation in promotions and reservation for economically-weaker sections of the society.

National Conference (NC) vice-president and former chief minister Omar Abdullah also criticised the government’s move. He wrote on micro-blogging site Twitter, “The government means an elected government. President cannot seek concurrence of governor who is a representative or agent of President. Same will apply even where only consent is required.”

The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, on Thursday had approved the proposal to extend Constitution 77th amendment (reservation in promotion for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes) and Constitution 103rd amendment (reservation for economically-weaker sections of society) to J&K. The concurrence for extending these amendments was given by Mr Malik after the State Administrative Council (SAC) approved the proposal last month. J&K is under President’s Rule since June 2018.
