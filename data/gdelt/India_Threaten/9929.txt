‘Either you meet queer people in the pride marches, or you meet them at gay parties, or you would meet them at film festivals,” Pride Circle co-founder Srini Ramaswamy told CNN Business.

‘And in all these three big spaces, you would probably not go and ask: “Hey do you want a job?”‘

The program includes a day-long conference with renowned speakers and booths by 20 queer-owned businesses.

Former Mr Gay India and renowned drag queen, Sushant Divgikar, spoke on Friday.

Ramaswamy is also working on a database of LGBTI talent.

He previously said they launched in Bengaluru, also known as Bangalore, because of its reputation as an open city.

He has plans to hold similar job fairs in Mumbai, New Delhi and Kolkata.
