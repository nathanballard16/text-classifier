Two Delhi-based thieves had been held here after a gunfight with police in which the duo got injured, officials said on Wednesday.

The accused were held late on Tuesday night when they were intercepted in Sector 144 by a team from the Surajpur police station, they said.

They had been identified as Rahul and Mahesh, both residents of Madangir in Delhi, a police spokesperson said.

“They were fleeing on a scooter and held on the Hindon Pusta road when the gunfight broke out. Both were injured in the retaliatory firing by the police,” he said.

“The accused are members of an NCD gang which steals valuable items from vehicles after breaking down their windows,” the official said.

Six laptops and two illegal firearms, along with ammunition, were seized from them, and their scooter had been impounded, the spokesperson added.

Further proceedings against them are under way, the police said. PTI
