More than 150 residents of Rejendra Nagar inassembled on Sunday morning to attend the funeral of a. The funeral rites were conducted as per Hindu rituals.The tree whosewere performed was one of the seven in the area that the residents allege were poisoned.In the complaint made to the police as well as the civic authorities, the residents have claimed that the alleged poisoning was done at the behest of builders that are taking the area up for redevelopment.“We have registered complaints with the authorities. However, almost a month after we first noticed that holes had been drilled in the trees to deliver the poison, they have not been able to find the culprits,” said environmentalist Subhajit Mukherjee.He added that the funeral procession was a symbolic one, meant to warn the authorities that the citizens would not relent until the culprits are brought to book.Mukherjee said that theirs is not the only area where trees are being targeted and fell off without permissions by poisoning. “Ever since we have started discussing the issue on social media and it has been written about by newspapers, I have got several calls from acrosstelling me of similar incidents in other parts of the city,” he said.According to Mukherjee, this strategy is being used by several builders who would want to save the cost of replanting, or go through the process of getting permissions for cutting down trees. “This is much easier, quicker and cost effective way to get the trees out of their way,” he said.
