On Kargil Day, Gen Bipin Rawat Warns Pakistan; Says Future Conflicts Will Be More Violent, Unpredictable

The event was organised by the Centre of Land Warfare Studies (CLWS) and Army Chief was speaking about the lesson learnt from the Kargil War. The Kargil war was triggered between India and Pakistan in May-June 1999 after the Pakistani army was found to having intruded into Indian territory across the LoC and occupying various strategic peaks, including Tololing Heights, Tiger Hill and Point 4875 (Batra Top), overlooking the Srinagar-Leh National Highway and targeting traffic on it.

In a stern warning to Pakistan, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat on Saturday said that future conflicts will be more violent and unpredictable with technology and cyber intelligence playing a major role and Indian Army would not take into account the human factor. "Pakistan army time and again resorts to misadventure either through flawed proxy wars and state sponsored terror or intrusions. Indian Army stands resolute to defend our territory. Let there be no doubt that any misadventure will be repelled with a punitive response," Rawat said while speaking at a seminar to mark the 20th year of Kargil War. "Future conflicts will be more violent and unpredictable where the importance of human factor shall remain undiminished. Our soldiers are and will remain our primary assets,” Army Chief said in the national capital today. Further speaking about the surgical strikes conducted by India in 2016 and 2019, Rawat said that the attacks show that the political resolve of the country is also dealing with terrorism. "Battlefield will be severely contested and seamlessly connected. In future even conventional conflicts are likely to have a large asymmetric component leading to now what is being termed 'hybrid war'. Technology has become key driver of future wars," he added.
