Will quit AAP, fight elections as Independent: Alka Lamba

New Delhi: Aam Aadmi Party’s Delhi MLA Alka Lamba Sunday announced that she will resign from the party and contest the next Assembly election as an Independent candidate.

Lamba, who has not been on the same page as the party on various issues since past several months, said she took the decision after consulting the people of her Chandni Chowk constituency.

In a tweet in Hindi, she said that people from her constituency have agreed that instead of compromising with her self-respect, she should resign from the party’s primary membership and secondly, that she should contest the next election as an Independent candidate.
