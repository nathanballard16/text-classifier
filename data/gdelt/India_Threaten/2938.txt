Sh Rasheed warns India against warmongering, threats

LAHORE: Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad on Saturday strongly responded to threats being given by India to Pakistan for a possible strike.

The minister warned India to be cautious against warmongering threats, alerting that the time has come, “now Pakistan will take revenge from India for all misadventures. The Indian prime minister is provoking religious extremists,” he added.

“If India attacks, we will pay all our debts in one go, along with the interest,” the minister sternly remarked. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi has contributed to 70 percent of the chances of war,” he lamented, adding that after losing the grounds in four states, Modi has been creating war hysteria. He warned that if India prompts Pakistan, a fierce response will be given. “Pakistan stands with the Kashmiri nation in its struggle for freedom,” he said.

Schooling an Indian TV anchor, Rahul Kanwal, Shaikh Rasheed Ahmad said, Pakistan would have executed Kulbhushan and sent his body wrapped in an Indian flag.” During a TV interview, Shaikh Rasheed grilled the anchor on a baseless question as to why Pakistan did not punish the alleged perpetrators of 2008 Mumbai Attack. “Had executing someone been a simple procedure, then we would have hanged Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav in the first place and his body would have been sent to you wrapped in Indian flag.
