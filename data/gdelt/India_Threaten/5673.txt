Mumbai: Guzderbandh pump station gets new deadline

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) administration has set a fresh deadline to make the Guzderbandh pumping station at Khar operational at full capacity. Ajoy Mehta, municipal commissioner during his monthly review meeting had set May 15 as the final deadline to start the pumping station.

The station in Khar has been partially operational since last year, after missing two deadlines. The civic body awarded a fresh contract to complete the remaining work.

"We have initiated action against the contractor for not completing pumping station work on time. Now, we have appointed a new contractor tp complete the remaining work," said a senior official from SWD.

The pumping station in Khar, which can flush out around 6,000 MLD water per second if it functions in full capacity, can prevent water logging in some areas like Khar (W), Bandra (W), Santa Cruz, Vile Parle, and Juhu.

The BMC administration has also set May 15 deadline for completion of widening work of Chamdawadi nullah at Dharavi.
