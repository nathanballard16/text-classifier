Chennai firm slammed for posting ‘Brahmins only’ recruitment ad in newspaper

A Chennai-based company was slammed after an ad it shared in a local newspaper went viral on social media.

According to a report in The NewsMinute, Acor, an interior design firm, had placed an advertisement in Adyar Talk, a hyperlocal newspaper for a position in its firm.

The ‘Brahmin Only’ demand ad went viral on social media where people even contemplated legal action against the company - which termed the incident as a ‘human-error’.

People on social media are calling it blatant casteism and unconstitutional. A day later, the company posted an apology stating that it meant ‘pure vegetarian’ and not ‘Brahmins only’.

The company also posted the clarification on Facebook which read, “Hope everyone is understanding! We meant Pure vegetarian and the media guy wrote 'Only Brahmins' so let’s get that out of the way.”

The post was later updated as an apology to say: "Hello, As originally mentioned it was a Human Error. We are an international brand with multiple offices in China, Europe, and India. Actions will be taken against the HR department for this. A request has been put to our CEO, Sorry for the mistake."

However, many social media users seemed to be unconvinced as the apology looked like the company wanted to make a specific requirement of a caste for a job position.

Users on the social media lashed out calling for a boycott.

"You guys are shamelessly discriminating between veg and non-veg. 70% of India is non-vegetarian. Of course, you did casteism first. This is against the constitution and you may face court proceedings,” said a user.

Another user added, “I had no idea how bad institutional racism in India was until I saw your ad.”
