EXCLUSIVE: Salman Khan's next is a biopic on a BSF jawaan; read details inside

Salman Khan is definitely in an interesting phase in his career. While many might claim that he sticks to the usual song and dance routine, the superstar has changed course when it comes to his choices in films. For every Dabangg, there's a Bajrangi Bhaijaan and a Bharat. Now, right after Dabangg 3, he has Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Inshallah lined up.

But we hear that he has liked another project and is keen on doing it. A source, close to the actor, reveals, "Salman has always been extremely driven by stories that centre around India. Recently, a big banner approached him for a biopic they wish to produce. It will revolve around the life of a BSF jawaan and will be set in Kashmir."

Salman has donned the army uniform quite a few times on screen, whether it's in Heroes or Kabir Khan's Tubelight. But this story is different. Our informer adds, "It's an extremely brave and inspirational story of this one man - an Indian soldier - who single handedly ended the entire camp of Mujahideen militants around 12-14 years ago. Salman loved the entire idea and felt it was an untold real life story that needed to be told. He has given a verbal nod to the film already but his dates need to be figured out." Interestingly, after this BSF jawaan fought valiantly against all the terrorists in the early 2000s, there wasn't any threat to India from the Mujahideen, till the recent Pulwama attack. "That's why the story is even more relevant today. People would want to know the back story and what happened, years before the Pulwama attacks happened." The film can only go on floors sometime around mid next year, after SLB's project that also stars Alia Bhatt.
