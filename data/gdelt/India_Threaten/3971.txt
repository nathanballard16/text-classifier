No threat from Congress-AAP alliance: Harsh Vardhan

Union minister Harsh Vardhan on Friday said the Congress-Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) alliance will not pose any threat to the BJP and that it would win all seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi.

"We do not see any challenge regardless of an alliance. We will win all seven seats in Delhi," he told reporters here.

The Bharatiya Janata Party will break all records of the past in the upcoming general elections, the MP from Chandni Chowk Lok Sabha constituency said.
