Don't fiddle with Article-35A, unsure which flag people will be forced to pick up instead of tricolour: Mehbooba Mufti

Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti has warned the Centre not to fiddle with Article 35A else they will witness what they haven't seen in J&K since 1947.

After pleas challenging the constitutional validity of the Article 35A (relating to the special rights and privileges enjoyed by Jammu and Kashmir) in Supreme Court was listed for hearing between Feb 26-28, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister and Peoples' Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti on Monday in a warning to the Centre said that don't play with fire and don't fiddle with Article-35A, otherwise you will see what you haven't seen since 1947. In her message which seemed to be a stern warning for those trying to fiddle with Article 35A, Mehbooba Mufti said that if it's attacked then she don't know which flag people of Jammu & Kashmir will be forced to pick up instead of the tri-colour.

Hitting out at the Centre, former J&K Chief Minister and National Conference chief Omar Abdullah said that the only responsibility of the Centre and the Governor in Kashmir is to hold to elections right now. He added that the Centre should hold elections and let people take the decision, the new government will itself work towards safeguarding Article 35A.

Though Article 35A has been listed for hearing in the Supreme Court in the coming week between February 26-28, several reports suggest that it is unlikely that the issue will come up for hearing. Not a first time when Article 35A dealing with the special rights granted to Kashmiris has been invoked. In previous occasions, political parties and leaders have talked about scrapping the law.
