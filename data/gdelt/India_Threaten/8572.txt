NIA conducts raids at 7 locations in Coimbatore in connection with ISIS module

New Delhi:

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday conducted raids at seven locations in Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore in connection with a suspected ISIS module. According to sources, the raids are being carried out by the NIA to arrest one Mohammad Azharuddin, believed to be the head of ISIS’s Tamil Nadu module.

The raids also have a connection with the recent Sri Lanka blasts. The agency sources said that Mohammad Azharuddin was in touch with Sri Lankan bomber Zahran Hashim through social media.

Earlier on April 30, the NIA had arrested Hasim’a aide Riyas Aboobackar for allegedly planning a suicide attack in Kerala. 29-year-old Riyas, a resident of Palakkad was following Hashim’s speeches and videos. He had reportedly admitted that he had been planning an attack in the Kerala.

Following the arrest of Riyas, the NIA officials had said that the suspect had also tried to radicalise more people but failed to convince them in joining his evil designs of hate and violence.

"The suspect is well versed with Tamil and followed Hashim speeches and videos inspiring. He tried to rope in others but could not convince as they didn't knew Tamil," an NIA official had said.

The Sri Lankan Cleric, who was behind the deadly Easter Sunday blasts in Colombo, has radicalised several youths in different parts of South India. The Easter Sunday blasts in Sri Lanka, claimed by ISSI, had resulted in death of over 250 people.

Earlier, the NIA had received intelligence inputs that a group of four people, including Riyas, was in contact with Abdul Rashid Abdulla, an absconding suspected ISIS terrorist.
