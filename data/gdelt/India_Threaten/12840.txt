Gujarat going to the dogs, reports 1,000 dog bites a day

‘Dogs get aggressive in this season’

GANDHINAGAR: Dog bites seem to have assumed epidemic proportions in the state. In four weeks between July 22 and August 18, 27,299 dog bite cases were registered across Gujarat , according to state health department data. This comes to an average 1,000 dogs bites a day.Ironically, Bhavnagar district in Saurashtra turned out to be a safe haven for people as not a single case was recorded in this period. Of the eight municipal corporations, Ahmedabad registered the maximum 3,920 complaints. This number was three times the canine attack cases registered in Surat and Vadodara and eight times more than the number of cases in Rajkot.Such a high number of dog bites is a cause of concern especially when rabies vaccine is not easily available in the market. “While the stock is adequately available in government hospitals, there is certainly a short-supply of anti-rabies vaccines in the market. Getting them in private hospitals and clinics is not as easy,” said Alpesh Patel, president, Gujarat State Federation of Chemists and Druggists' Association (GSFCDA).Ahmedabad-based naturalist Hasseeb Sheikh warns that August-September is mating season of canines when they are known to demonstrate more aggressive behaviour while some take care of their puppies.“Testosterone levels are high as dogs generally compete for a partner in these months. People should avoid passing by roads which is a meeting place of dogs.“If it is unavoidable, it is advisable to keep some treat in hand to distract them if they start barking,” says Sheikh.A senior Ahmedabad Municipal Coproration (AMC) official told TOI, “Many people feed stray dogs out of compassion which is one of the key reasons behind the drastically rising population of dogs in the city.”Between 2010 and 2017, Ahmedabad had recorded a 87% increase in the number of dog bite cases.
