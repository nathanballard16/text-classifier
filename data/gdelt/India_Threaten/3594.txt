Indian Congress leader says he hasn’t seen a 'bigger liar than Modi'

A senior leader of the Indian National Congress has said “he has not seen a bigger liar” than Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.



Speaking to reporters in west-central city of Indore, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh demanded the Modi government to present evidence of the Indian Air Force's “air strike” on alleged terrorist camps in Balakot, Pakistan.

"I am not questioning the recent IAF action against Pakistan-based terrorist camps. But pictures of any incident in open space can be accessed through satellite technology. So we should also give evidence, the way the United States government presented evidence of Osama bin Laden's killing before the world," NDTV quoted him as saying.

Singh also congratulated Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for releasing IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.

"I also congratulate the honourable Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan for showing us a new way of being a good neighbour and returning the brave Indian Air Force officer to us," the Congress leader said.

The politician also refuted Modi's claim that after the 26/11 Mumbai attack, the Indian Air Force wanted to conduct a “surgical strike” against Pakistan, but the Congress-led UPA government nixed the idea.

"I can only say that we have not seen a bigger liar than Narendra Modi," he said.
