NEW DELHI — About 8,000 supporters of a Pakistani Islamist party are marching toward the Indian embassy in Islamabad to denounce New Delhi's actions to change the special status of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.

The supporters of the Jamaat-e-Islami party vowed to protest in front of the embassy.

Authorities say they will not allow them to approach the embassy and deployed about 2,000 police and security forces.

Members of the group have clashed with police during previous rallies in Islamabad.

Hundreds of activists from Pakistan political parties on Friday held peaceful rallies across the country against the decision by India to downgrade Muslim-majority Kashmir's status from a state to a federal territory.
