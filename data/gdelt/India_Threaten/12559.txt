World News: Pakistan Prime Minister warns of possible military confrontation with India

New York: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has urged the international community to step in to deal with the Kashmir issue after India abrogated article 370, warning of a possible military confrontation between the nuclear-armed countries amid escalating tensions in the region.

“If the world does nothing to stop the Indian assault on Kashmir and its people, there will be consequences for the whole world as two nuclear-armed states get ever closer to a direct military confrontation,” he wrote in an opinion piece in The New York Times.

Titled “The world can’t ignore Kashmir. We are all in danger,” was published on Friday, coinciding with Pakistan government’s call to observe Kashmir Hour across the country to show solidarity with Kashmiris.

"I wanted to normalize relations with India through trade and by settling the Kashmir dispute, the foremost impediment to the normalization of relations between us," Khan said.

Imran Khan said: “With the nuclear shadow hovering over South Asia, we realize that Pakistan and India have to move out of a zero-sum mind-set to begin dialogue on Kashmir, various strategic matters and trade. On Kashmir, the dialogue must include all stakeholders, especially the Kashmiris. We have already prepared multiple options that can be worked on while honouring the right to self-determination the Kashmiris were promised by the Security Council resolutions and India’s first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru.”

The Pakistani prime minister said if the world does nothing to stop the Indian assault on Kashmir and its people, there will be consequences for the whole world as two nuclear-armed states get ever closer to a direct military confrontation.
