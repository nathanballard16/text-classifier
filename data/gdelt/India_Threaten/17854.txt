Anti-CAA Protests: US, UK, Russia & other countries issue travel advisory for citizens visiting India

As anti-CAA protests continue across several parts of India, many countries, including the US, UK, Russia, Israel, Canada and Singapore have issued a travel advisory for people travelling to India.

Earlier, these countries had asked their citizens to exercise caution while travelling to Northeast India which has witnessed violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

On Thursday, the US embassy in New Delhi issued a travel advisory for its citizens in the country.

"The government imposed the law that prevents gatherings of four or more people – known as Section 144 – in Uttar Pradesh and according to press reports in parts of New Delhi as well, including the Red Fort. Curfews remain in place in some areas. Internet, mobile communications services, traffic, and public transport continue to be affected," the advisory said.

The statement also advised caution and listed a few actions to take:

* Avoid areas with demonstrations and civil disturbances.

* Keep a low profile.

* Be aware of your surroundings.

* Monitor local media for updates.

* Review your personal security plans.

* Notify friends and family of your safety.

* Follow the instructions of local authorities.

On Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia said on Twitter, "Russian nationals currently in India or planning to visit the country soon are advised to be vigilant and cautious, avoid crowds and refrain from visiting areas controlled by protestors. Follow our updates."

The UK government updated its travel advisory for India to warn its citizens against travel to the states in the Northeast.

Canada has advised its citizens to avoid "non-essential" travel to Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland due to the protests.

Israel has warned its citizens to "completely avoid" going to Assam because of violent protests.

Israel last week warned its citizens to "completely avoid" going to Assam because of violent protests. Israeli citizens currently in Assam have been advised to act according to instructions by officials.

Singapore's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) last week issued a travel notice for Northeast India, advising Singaporeans travelling there to "exercise vigilance and caution".
