Moradabad: To do their part in ensuring the safety of women, the students of an engineering college have come up with a new invention. The students have invented a sandal-drone which has a GPS installed in it. The students call it 'flying cop and women defence system.'

The invention operates on electric shock. The pre-installed GPS sends a distress signal and launches the drone movement of the sandal-drone.

While talking to ANI, Diwakar Sharma, a student who participated in the project acknowledged the threats posed to women in the county and said," In India, rape and sexual assault is a big problem. Hence we have made use of a sandal and drone to create a safety system."

Sharma explained the mechanism of the invention and said that the panic button on the sandal can be pressed by putting just a light force on it. After the button is pressed, the sandal creates a shock system which can be used to attack a miscreant.

The sandal system is also connected to a drone and police station. After it is activated, a message about the location of the girl is sent to her family and the police. The system will automatically send a signal to the drone. After receiving the signal, the drone will fly to the person in distress and will alert the people in surrounding areas.

The drone is also capable of recording a video which will help in identifying the miscreants. The professor who guided the students said that the invention is capable of being transformed into a product for the market. Some of the female students of the college will also be given a prototype to test the product.
