NC told to give up divide and rule politics

Sunsari, November 27

Nepal Communist Party (NCP) chairperson Pushpa Kamal Dahal has cautioned the main opposition against indulging in divide and rule politics, saying such a proclivity would be detrimental to the party.

“I hereby suggest that the main opposition party stop doing the politics of divide and rule and care about its own affairs instead; otherwise, there will be a day when it will be consigned to museum and history only,” said the leader, speaking at an election gathering in Sunsari’s Dharan today.

“As we want the NC to be a genuine opposition party, I urge the party not to play against the communist party. I would rather it paid attention to its own affairs,” he added.

The ruling party leader also clarified that border encroachment was totally intolerable.

“Limpiyadhura is our border with India. We don’t encroach others’ land and can’t entertain others doing anything of that sort to us either,” he said.

On the occasion, NCP (NCP) parliamentary party Deputy leader Subas Nembang, while referring to the NC, argued that it was better for a party that lacked courage to speak against India’s blockade to not talk about nationalism.

“What can we expect from a party that didn’t have the courage to even to call a spade a spade during the crippling embargo imposed by India,” he said.
