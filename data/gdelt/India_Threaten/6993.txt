Warnings lowered as cyclone Fani weakens into land depression

Cyclonic storm Fani over Faridpur-Dhaka region has weakened into a land depression, prompting the authorities to lower warnings for maritime ports in the country.

Moved north-northeastwards further, it was located over Pabna-Tangail-Mymensingh region and adjoining area 12 noon, the Meteorological Department said in a marine warning on Saturday.

Maritime ports of Mongla and Payra have been advised to lower danger signal number seven but instead hoist local cautionary signal number three.

Maritime port of Chattogram has been advised to lower danger signal number six but instead hoist local cautionary signal number three.

Maritime port of Cox’s Bazar has been advised to lower local warning signal number four but instead hoist local cautionary signal number three.

Under cyclone Fani's influence, the sky remains overcast and rain/thunder showers with gusty/squally wind is continuing at many places over the country.

All the fishing boats and trawlers over north bay and deep sea have been advised to remain in shelter till further notice.

Though fears of a major disaster have gone away with the very severe cyclonic storm Fani weakening into a cyclonic storm this very morning, five people died and many others were injured this very day, taking the death toll to at least 12 since Friday morning, when peripheral effects of the cyclone started being felt in major parts of the country.

The extent of losses from destructions of things like houses in monetary terms is yet to be ascertained.

Cyclones typically quickly lose power as they move inland.

Recent technological advances have helped meteorologists forecast weather patterns more accurately and prepare before any looming disaster.

As such, India and Bangladesh evacuated to safety millions of people in efforts to minimise the casualties and took up huge preparations to tackle the post-calamity situation.
