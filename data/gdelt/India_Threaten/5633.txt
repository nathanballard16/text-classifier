After Slamming Modi, PM Khan Concedes He Wants Him to Win Election – Report

Expressing fear that the resolution of the Kashmir issue would be endangered should the Indian National Congress party win, Khan said, "If the next Indian government is led by the opposition Congress party, it might be too scared to seek a settlement with Pakistan over Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK), fearing a backlash from the right."

Khan concurred that there was no military solution to the Kashmir problem. He reiterated that his government was ready to dismantle all terror camps that are operating on Pakistani soil and that the Pakistan Army had agreed with him on this.

During the interview, Khan said that he was apprehensive about the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party in India, which recently released its election manifesto, in which it spoke about abolishing special rights given to the Kashmir region, including those that prevented outsiders from buying property in the state.

He also took a dig at Indian Prime Minister Modi's re-election bid, saying that if Modi perceived that his chances at winning the elections are showing signs of dwindling there might be a chance that India would attack Pakistan to provide an electoral boost to his campaign.
