LAHORE: Prime Minister Imran Khan says Pakistan will facilitate Sikh Yatrees from all over the world, easing visa regime for them.

The Prime Minister said all minorities are enjoying full basic rights in Pakistan and all possible facilities are being provided to them including Sikh community and yatrees.

About Kashmir issue, Imran Khan said the Indian government has put eighty million innocent people under siege in Occupied Kashmir for the last 29 nine days.

He said war is no solution to any issue but the prevailing situation in Occupied Kashmir is not acceptable.

He said establishing good relations with India was his priority after coming into power but unfortunately Indian response remained negative.

Imran Khan said RSS has racist ideology, inspired by Hitler’s Nazism.

He said this ideology is not only a threat to Muslims but to other religions too.

He said RSS is victimizing Muslims and Christians and later it will also be targeting Dalits and Sikhs in India.

Imran Khan said the RSS ideology is also a threat to India itself.

The Prime Minister warned the world nations that any further escalation between Pakistan and India over the Kashmir issue could lead to a nuclear war.
