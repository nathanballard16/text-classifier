A day after an(IED) blast on a road in Gadchiroli, suspected to have been orchestrated by the banned Communist Party of India ()’s operatives, those conducting the probe into the attack suspect that the culprits could have had precise, real-time information on the private vehicle carrying 15 jawans and it was marked for targeting. It has emerged that about 45 minutes before the ill-fated vehicle was blown into smithereens at around 12.30 pm on Wednesday, a vehicle carrying one of the local sub-divisional police officer had passed the spot, where the bomb was embedded beneath the road, unharmed.The probe suspects that the Maoists had their own informers tracking the private vehicle’s journey right from the time it left a police station to reach the Kurkheda police station, under whose jurisdiction suspected Maoists had torched 27 vehicles. “The vehicle of a SDPO had passed the spot where the bomb was planted. It indicates the culprits knew their target’s movement and were waiting for it,” said a police source. “The QRT men were going to the police station to prevent it from getting captured, which is part of standard Maoist tactics,” he said. The police are also verifying if the bomb was placed days or weeks before the explosion to evade detection.“We are also looking at the possibility that the bomb could have been placed days or weeks before the attack, at a time of their choice. It has been seen in a few blasts in, Odisha andby Maoists wherein they managed to plant the explosives months before the attack at a time the road was under repairs or being constructed,” the source said. “Over the past few months, it has been seen that the Maoists are increasingly using IED, instead of guns, which is their new strategy,” the source informed.The Maoists are yet to claim ownership of the attack. The police said they found Maoist banners, warning against construction projects, put up near the blast site.
