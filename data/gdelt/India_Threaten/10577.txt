Looking for a second green revolution

When I was born in 1932, the world had 2 billion people. Today, the population is

7.7 billion and is likely to hit

11.2 billion by the end of the century, the United Nations reports.

How can the planet feed the surging swarm? Here are some thoughts:

I grew up in a meager farming region of West Virginia. We had no electricity. Small-town families had gaslights, and everyone else used kerosene lamps.

Our valley was mostly a string of dirt farms, horse-operated as in medieval times. My boyhood was during World War II, when most men had gone to combat. My aging uncle ran his farm with two mismatched horses and a crew of granddaughters, plus a scrawny pubescent nephew: me.

We milked cows by hand, plowed and mowed by team, found Indian arrowheads in corn rows, cut creek bank weeds to feed pigs, killed copperhead snakes, straightened bent nails to save money – long days of manual work. It seemed like slavery. Other family farms along the valley were little different.
