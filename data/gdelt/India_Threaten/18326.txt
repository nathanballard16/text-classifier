Selectors to assess Hardik Pandya during India A’s tour to New Zealand

New Delhi: Star all-rounder Hardik Pandya, who has been recovering from a lower back injury, was Monday included in the India A squad for three ODIs and tour matches in New Zealand. The player, who underwent a surgery in October, has been out of action since September.

The dashing all-rounder’s back problems have persisted since the Asia Cup in 2018, the first time he complained of a stiff back. Since then the team management along with the selectors have monitored and managed his workload.

Provided Pandya clears the India A test, he will be included in the senior team that will tour New Zealand for five T20 Internationals, three ODIs and two Tests in the last week of January.

Pandya had earlier said he was targeting an international return during the tour of New Zealand. India’s New Zealand assignments will start with the T20 International at Eden Park, January 24.

“As for) Hardik, we will have a look at him in the third week of January,” chief selector MSK Prasad told reporters here. “Then we will decide on the next course of action,” he added.

Hanuma Vihari will captain the India A team in the first-class games in New Zealand and Shubman Gill in the 50-over format.

The first tour match will be played January 17 and the three ODIs January 22, 24 and 26.
