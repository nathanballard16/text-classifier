Manipur-based auto-lifting gang busted, 1 held

A member of a auto-lifting gang operating in Manipur has been arrested for selling luxury vehicles using forged documents with the help of his associates in the Delhi-NCR, police said on Monday.

Mohammad Ajish Khan (27), belonging to Manipur's Thoubal district, was arrested on October 12 when he was driving a stolen car at NH-24, they said.

Khan, along with his associates, would come here to take luxury cars from auto lifters operating in the Delhi-NCR and later deliver the vehicles to the kingpin, Juma Khan, in Manipur, the police said.

"Members of insurgent groups of Manipur and other north-eastern states were among the buyers of these cars," Deputy Commissioner of Police (East) Jasmeet Singh said.

The gang used to lift around 15 cars every month and has transported more than 100 cars to Manipur so far.

With his arrest, 11 stolen high end luxurious cars worth Rs 2 crores have been recovered in Imphal and Delhi, the DCP said.

The accused disclosed that Juma Khan tampered the chassis number and got the vehicle registered with transport authorities in Manipur and Nagaland on the basis of forged documents.

Role of officers of transport authorities cannot be ruled out, the police said, adding that investigation was on in the matter.

Raids were conducted at various places in Manipur but the operation was initially interrupted due to activities of under ground groups, the police said.
