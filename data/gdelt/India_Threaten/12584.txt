Era of Swiss bank secrecy over, India to get details of bank account holders from September

New Delhi: India will start getting details of bank accounts held by its citizens in Switzerland from September, ending the era of Swiss bank secrecy. The development is a major success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led NDA government`s fight against black money ever since it first came to power in 2014.

"India will receive information of the calendar year 2018 in respect of all financial accounts held by Indian residents in Switzerland. This will be a significant step in the government`s fight against black money as the era of Swiss bank secrecy will finally be over," the Income Tax department said in a tweet.
