Aurangabad: The top-brass of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) on Wednesday strongly advocated the proposed kilo volt amperes per hour (KVAH) billing system for industrial consumers, asserting that the new system will be beneficial for all the stakeholders.The MSEDCL held a special awareness programme for industrial consumers from Aurangabad, during which different aspects of the proposed KVAH billing were introduced. “The proposed administrative structure aims to offer specialized and specific tasks to the workforce as against the existing work method.
