Keep away from elephants, say Sirumugai forest rangers

COIMBATORE: Forest rangers in Sirumugai beat have appealed to the public to be wary and co-operative as elephant movement has increased in Pethikuttai area of the beat.People and farmers, who own land in the area, should avoid moving around after dark and should not electrify fences using domestic power line, the officials suggested.Just days ago, the rangers had faced trouble after some villagers insisted on entering the forest to conduct rituals at a temple deep inside and did so, ignoring their warnings. The incident prompted the department to issue a warning through media and posters in the nearby villages.“Due to the summer, there has been an increase in the movement of elephants looking for food and water in Pethikuttai area and the forests around Bhavanisagar Dam . For this reason, we appeal to people and farmers not to enter the forest, pass through the forest and walk along forest paths either for farming or other purposes, endangering your lives. Elephants come close to forest fringes after dark. So, we request people to be careful and alert of their presence and if possible, avoid moving around after dark,” said the statement.People living along forest fringes have been requested to set up lights in front of their houses and ensure they are switched on after dark. “If an elephant does enter patta land, we request landowners to keep calm and contact the forest department immediately through phone. Neighbours and passersby can also contact and inform us,” said the notice. “When foresters come to the spot and work on chasing the animal back into the forest, we request people not to aggravate the animal by throwing stones at it or distracting it.”Landowners using electric fences have been asked to ensure that the fences are energized using batteries. “If the batteries are not working, farmers should not electrify the fences by connecting them to domestic power supply, power given to their farmlands or directly from transformers,” added the notice.
