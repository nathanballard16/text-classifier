As many as 1.04 lakh children were vaccinated during the three days national immunisation pulse polio campaign in the Union Territory of Chandigarh.

He said that 1,04,960 children were vaccinated against the target of 96,182 in Chandigarh.

The volunteers did a commendable job going house to house and vaccinating the children who were not brought to the booths on the first day. Their efforts and good coverage has been documented by the World Health Organisation (WHO) monitors who have visited the field especially the high risk/ vulnerable areas for the monitoring purposes, the spokesman said.

World Health Organisation (WHO) monitors appreciated the efforts of health workers as no child was found unvaccinated, he said.

Govt. of India is stressing upon 100 percent coverage of immunisation for which UT Chandigarh has already achieved it for routine immunization, and is also ensuring 100% polio immunization as well to maintain polio free status, he added.
