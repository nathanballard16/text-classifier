Karnataka crisis: Why should I go? H D Kumaraswamy asks

BENGALURU: Chief minister HD Kumaraswamy categorically rejected opposition demands to resign from the post on moral grounds, since his government no longer enjoys a majority in the legislative assembly.“Why should I resign? What is the necessity for me to resign now?” the CM said on Thursday, barely 24 hours after members of the state unit of the BJP, led by its president BS Yeddyurappa, staged a protest at the Vidhana Soudha demanding that Kumaraswamy quit.Defending his decision not to quit, Kumaraswamy pointed out that Yeddyurappa did not resign when he, the CM at that time, was confronted with a similar situation in 2009-10 after 18 MLAs, including some ministers, resigned opposing his style of functioning.Kumaraswamy’s decision was backed by water resources minister DK Shivakumar , who also recalled some events that transpired when MLAs revolted against chief minister Yeddyurappa in 2008-10. Shivakumar was also confident the present crisis would blow over and Kumaraswamy would continue in office for another four years.“We have confidence that the rebel MLAs will return and withdraw their resignations,” Shivakumar said. “We will fight till the last breath to save this government.”Earlier in the day, speculation was rife that Kumaraswamy, who held lengthy discussions with JD(S) supremo HD Deve Gowda and Shivakumar in the morning, could resign after two more MLAs quit on Wednesday, reducing numbers of the ruling alliance in the assembly to 100 in the 224-member House.
