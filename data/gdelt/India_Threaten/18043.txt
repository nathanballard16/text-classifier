SURAT: A 46-year-old textile businessman who consumed pesticides on Saturday night died at SMIMER Hospital on Monday.

The family members and friends of Dinesh Solanki said that Solanki was going through a financial crisis after incurring a heavy loss in business which might have prompted him to take the drastic step.

Solanki was found unconscious at his home in Shubh Residency at Puna Patiya after he consumed tablets that are used to preserve food grains.

Solanki was a native of Borsad in Anand and ran a shop of textile products in Bombay Market. He had shifted to the current residential address, where each apartment costs over Rs 1.50 crore, couple of months ago.

“The exact reason behind the extreme step is not yet known. However, his family members and friends claim that he was going through a financial crisis. We are yet to probe whether he was receiving threats from loan sharks for the recovery of money,” said an official from Puna police station.
