Will PM Modi have courage to fight from Kerala or Tamil Nadu, asks Shashi Tharoor

Rahul Gandhi’s decision to contest from Kerala’s Wayanad constituency shows he has the confidence to win from both north and south India, senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor said on Sunday and asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi would have the courage to fight from a seat in Kerala or Tamil Nadu. With Mr. Gandhi filing his nomination from Wayanad, Mr. Tharoor added that there was palpable excitement across the southern States that the next Prime Minister could be elected from the the region. He slammed Mr. Modi and the BJP for suggesting that Mr. Gandhi chose Wayanad to “run away” from majority dominated areas, saying the ruling party had repeatedly resorted to peddling bigotry. It was dismaying that this was coming from the Prime Minister, he added.
