(Web Desk) The Prime minister of Pakistan Imran Khan on Tuesday strongly responded to Indian allegations against Pakistan following Pulwama attack in Indian-Occupied Kashmir (IOK).



The Prime Minister said he wanted to respond to the Indian propaganda against Pakistan soon after the Pulwama incident but he could not do so due to his pre-occupation vis-a-vis all important visit of the Saudi Crown Prince MBS and the Business Conference.



Imran Khan regretted that the Indian government started Pakistan bashing soon after the Pulwama incident without any investigation. He said as to how Pakistan can even think of engaging itself in any such unwarranted situation, when it was hosting Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia Muhammad Bin Salman in Islamabad.

The Prime Minister said we will do it not under any pressure but with a conviction that we will neither allow anyone to use our land for terrorism nor allow anyone to commit terrorism against us. He said Pakistan has sacrificed over seventy thousand lives and borne the brunt of one hundred billion dollars of losses in the war against terrorism.



Imran Khan said India always places precondition of holding talks with Pakistan with terrorism one of the subjects. He said we are ready to hold talks on this issue as Pakistan desires elimination of this menace from the region.



Prime Minister Imran Khan however said that in the meantime there should also be a new thinking and introspection in India about the Kashmir issue. The Indian leadership must understand as to why the Kashmiri youth have gone to the last resort of sacrificing their lives for the sake of their right to self-determination. He said there is no military solution to this issue likes that of Afghanistan. He said how India can think of resolving the Kashmir dispute through a one dimensional military approach which has always met failures.



He said Afghanistan is facing internal strife over the last seventeen years and the international coalition led by the US has not been able to resolve this conflict militarily.



The Prime Minister said the entire world is now acknowledging Pakistan’s viewpoint on Afghanistan that the solution to this festering conflict lies only in political settlement through negotiations.
