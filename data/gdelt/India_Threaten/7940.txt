Trio paid American Express to extend credit card limit, say police

NOIDA: Police probing the Rs 3-crore American Express credit card fraud have found that the accused would pay small amounts to the financial service provider to get their transaction limit extended every month.The investigation team has also sought from Amex the documents that the main accused, Sunil Beniwal, had submitted in Australia to get the credit cards issued. Once the documents are verified, the police would write to the external affairs ministry to ensure that his visa is cancelled.Sunil, a graphic designer in Australia on a five-year student visa, would get the cards issued in that country and send them to his brother Sandeep Beniwal and his friend Sandeep Kumar in India. Sandeep and his namesake would then use the cards the shop in jewellery showrooms in Delhi-NCR.Sunil and Sandeep Beniwal are the sons of a Haryana Police sub-inspector.SP (city) Sudha Singh told TOI that the accused would pay Amex every month to get their credit card limit extended. “American Express had initiated an internal inquiry into the matter after showroom owners complained that they were not getting paid. The bank then transferred the probe to its financial fraud cell and came to know about the fraud. We are talking to the bank to find out what documents had been sought to extend the transaction limit,” he added.Circle officer Kaustabh said: “It seems they paid small amounts to get the limit extended. We will ask American Express to furnish details that can help us in the probe.”Once police get the details, they will persuade the Centre to get Sunil’s visa cancelled. “After the documents are received and proceedings under CrPC Section 91 are completed, the concerned ministry will be approached to start the process of visa cancellation,” the circle officer said.Police are also probing the role of more persons. Amex officials in India said they could comment only on Tuesday after talking to their counterparts in Australia.
