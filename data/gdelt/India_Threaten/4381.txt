Amaravati: YSRCP chief Jagan Mohan Reddy's uncle and former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy was found dead on Friday morning inside his home. Initially, it was reported that he suffered from a heart attack around dawn, however, to the contrary, his family members have raised suspicion over the death saying there was blood and bruises all over the body. Taking the matter further, Vivekananda Reddy's personal assistant Krishna Reddy filed a complaint over the death saying that it didn't seem natural.

Vivekananda Reddy's nephew and former MP YS Avinash Reddy also raised questions and said that there could be a "conspiracy angle" which needs to be probed. "There were two injuries on his head, one each on the front and the back. So, a thorough probe is required to establish the cause of death. There could possibly be a conspiracy angle as well that needs to be probed," Avinash Reddy told PTI.

"There was no response when I went to his house this morning. I called his wife in Hyderabad over the phone and she asked me not to disturb him. Later, the cook and other household staff reached the house but they too did not get any response. I then went in through a side door and found Vivekananda's body in the bathroom, with blood clots in the bedroom and the bathroom," personal assistant Krishna Reddy was quoted by PTI as saying.

The 68-year-old leader is now survived by his wife and a daughter. Reddy was born on August 8, 1950 and entered politics under his elder brother and former chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, popularly known as YSR. He represented Pulivendula assembly seat twice, first in 1989 and then again in 1994. After the passing away of YSR, he was elected as MLC. However, his relationship with YSR's son Jagan Mohan Reddy soured after the latter's decision to break away from the Congress and flout YSRCP.
