Day after Amethi visit, Rahul Gandhi raises Wayanad farmers' suicide in Parliament

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi today raised the issue of farm distress in the country and sought prompt attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to address the serious crisis in the sector. Rahul Gandhi said farmers in his parliamentary constituency, Wayanad are committing suicide in the absence proactive government help.

Rahul Gandhi won the Lok Sabha election from Wayanad parliamentary seat in Kerala. Rahul Gandhi said at least 18 farmers have ended their lives in Wayanad failing to repay loans taken from the banks.

He said farmers are under immense financial duress and still 8,000 of them have been given notices from the banks for not repaying loans.

The Congress leader alleged that the Narendra Modi government, in the past five years, paid more to the industrialists compared to the farmers. Rahul Gandhi said the Union Budget 2019-20 has not made inadequate provision to address farm crisis.

This comes a day after Rahul Gandhi's visit to Amethi, the Lok Sabha seat that he represented in the Lok Sabha for three consecutive terms between 2004 and 2019. He was defeated by Union minister Smriti Irani in 2019 Lok Sabha polls in Amethi.

Calling Amethi his "home and family" during his visit on Wednesday, Rahul Gandhi said, "Development of Amethi will not be hampered. I am the MP from Wayanad but my ties with Amethi are three decades old. I will fight for Amethi in Delhi."

This was Rahul Gandhi's first visit to Amethi after losing the Lok Sabha election from this seat. Rahul Gandhi resigned as the Congress president following the party's drubbing in the Lok Sabha election. The party has not yet decided on the next Congress chief.
