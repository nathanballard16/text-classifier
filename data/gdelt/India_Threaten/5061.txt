Unrest grips Suri village in poll run-up

Suri: Crude bombs explod-ed in the dead of night at a Suri village on Thursday, sending out signals that the countdown had begun on Trinamool Birbhum president Anubrata Mandal’s turf. It happened after Election Commission caution-ed Mandal over his public speech and loaded gestures.Ground zero was Chandra village, 8km from Suri town, on a day central forces were staying put in Suri Police Lines. A police contingent reached the trouble-hit village to bring the situation under control.The violence kicked off a blame game. BJP’s Bolpur candidate Dudh Kumar Mondal said: “It is the usual tactic of Anubrata Mandal to intimidate the opposition ahead of polls.” Trinamool Birbhum leader Abhijit Sinha, however, saw no politics in the violence.
