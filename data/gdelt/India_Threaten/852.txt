Only 25% women’s hostels registered

As per the Tamil Nadu Hostels & Homes for Women & Children (Regulation) Rules, 2015, all women’s and children’s hostels must be registered with the respective district collectorate. CHENNAI: With just three days to go before the deadline set by the government for women’s hostels to get registered with the district collectorate, only 564 of the 2,000-odd hostels in Chennai had done so till January 8. If unregistered hostels are closed, they need to spend more looking for another accommodation near their workplaces,” she said. Chennai district collector A Shanmuga Sundram issued an ultimatum to register women’s hostels by December 31, 2018, but later extended the deadline to January 21.The extension has not borne much results. Noting that she was staying at a registered hostel, the women employed in ITES sector said, “Inmates of unregistered hostels would also incur monetary losses as their payment towards advance would go for a toss.”
