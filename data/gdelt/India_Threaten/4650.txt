Gangotri gets a poll booth as villages wait for roads

Upset over delay in the construction of pukka roads to their villages, voters across Uttarakhand have threatened to boycott the upcoming Lok Sabha polls.For the residents of Sayuni Malli village in Chamoli district, it has been an almost 20-year long wait for a road link. In fact, so incensed are the villagers that they have even posted signs at the village’s entrance asking politicians not to enter. Though CM Trivendra Singh Rawat laid the foundation stone for a Rs 3.8 crore road project in November 2017, little progress has been made. Chamoli district magistrate Swati Bhadauria said tenders have been issued but villagers should be patients as “it’s not possible to complete the project overnight.”Residents of nine villages in Tehri district gathered outside Mussoorie to protest on Wednesday, threatening a poll boycott. Villagers prepared a memorandum for the CM and district magistrate. A few days ago, residents of 12 villages in three other districs had also submitted memoranda to their DMs.In Khatola village of Udham Singh Nagar district in Kumaon, over 2,000 voters have decided against voting. Villagers have been demanding construction of a 1.5km stretch of dilapidated road.Saroj Sarkar, who is leading protests, said the sitting BJP MLA Rajkumar Thukral had promised a connecting road in the 2012 and 2017 assembly polls but the promise has not been kept.Meanwhile, the Char Dham shrine town of Gangotri is set to get its first polling booth, where 141 seers will cast their votes. Until now, the closest booths were 29km away. At an altitude of 3,415 metres above sea level, it’ll be the highest booth in Tehri constituency.
