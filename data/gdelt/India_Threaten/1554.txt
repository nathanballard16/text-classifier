The survivor's statement which was recorded through video conferencing was crucial in proving the school teacher guilty. A sessions court in Nagod sentenced Gond to capital punishment on September 19 last year. Considering the crime to be “rarest of rare", a division bench of Madhya Pradesh High Court confirmed the death penalty on January 25. The HC noted that the capital punishment was important as the crime was committed by a teacher.

Superintendent of Jabalpur Central Jail, Gopal Tamrakr, while speaking to The Times of India, said that they received an email from Satna court which said that Gond would be executed at 5 am on March 2. However, he added that the hanging can still be stopped by the Supreme Court or the President.
