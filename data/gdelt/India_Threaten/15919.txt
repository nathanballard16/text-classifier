CPI general secretary D Raja Monday accused the BJP-led government at the Centre of creating mistrust among the people of the northeast, particularly in Manipur, by concealing the terms of negotiation with Naga groups.

Noting that there has been no discussion on Naga peace talks on the floor of Parliament, Raja said, “What are you negotiating behind people’s backs?” He alleged that central leaders including the Prime Minister and Home Minister have not spoken the truth on the issue till date.

Speaking at a party rally in Imphal, Raja said, “Centre cannot take the people of Manipur or northeast for granted. It should treat people from the northeast with dignity. Their opinions must be sought and taken into consideration before the final settlement of the Naga peace talks.”

The CPI general secretary claimed that small states like Manipur might be reduced to a union territory if the Naga peace talks lead to bifurcation. He added that his party will lead the fight if Manipur’s territorial and administrative integrity is compromised.

“We warn Mr Modi and Amit Shah, our party will keep fighting for safeguarding the interest of the Manipuri people,” he said.

Meanwhile, a six-member delegation of Naga Mothers Association (NMA) arrived in Manipur today. It is learnt that the delegates will call on meira paibis (Women folks), Kuki bodies in Manipur. However, it cannot be confirmed when the meeting will take place.
