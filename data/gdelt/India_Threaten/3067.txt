NEW DELHI: The Indian government on Monday sent notices to 13 news channels for airing Director General of the Pakistan Army's media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor’s recent press conference in the aftermath of the February 14 Pulwama attack.

Following the attack in occupied Kashmir in which at least 40 Indian soldiers were killed, the Indian information ministry had asked television channels to not air "any content that might incite violence, affect law and order, promote anti-national attitude and affect the integrity of the nation."

According to The Quint, the notice sent by the Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting read, "The Pakistan Army spokesperson’s media briefing was aired for 20 minutes and 45 seconds with ‘no intervention’ by the channel on the ‘correctness or otherwise of the claims’ made in the briefing."

The show cause notice added, the channels, by doing so, have violated the national law.

The channels in question have been asked to submit their response within seven days with a valid reason as to why the government should not initiate action against them.

DG ISPR in his press conference on February 22 had warned India to not mess with Pakistan.

Refuting reports regarding Pakistan preparing for war, DG ISPR had said, "Pakistan is not preparing for war. Threats and reports of a war are coming from your side. We are only using our right to self defence."
