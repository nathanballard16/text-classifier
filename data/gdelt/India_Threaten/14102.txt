South China Sea: Vietnam justified in defending its rights in Vanguard Bank in South China Sea

NEW DELHI: Vietnam has rightfully protested Chinese aggression in Vanguard Bank in the South China Sea region and Hanoi has alleged that Chinese ships have violated sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction of Vietnam under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).Vanguard Bank, the westernmost reef in the resource-rich Spratlys, sits within Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone and continental shelf, but Beijing says it falls within the “nine-dash line” it uses to claim sovereignty over more than 80 per cent of the South China Sea (SCS).On July 3 China’s Geological Survey Ship Haiyang Dizhi -8 (HD-8) along with escort ships entered into Vietnam’s EEZ including Vanguard Bank. Over 20 Chinese ships were deployed on July 12 while Vietnam tried to protect Hakuyru-5, Japanese supplied research platform currently used by Hanoi and Russia for joint prospecting in the region. Chinese coast guard ships also tracked activities of Hakuyru-5.Beijing should not conduct any activities that would complicate the situation in the sea and violate Vietnam’s sovereign rights in the Vanguard Bank area in SCS, according to maritime affairs experts. The actions so far have violated Vietnam’s sovereignty under the International Law The Vanguard Bank standoff represents the latest episode in the ongoing South China Sea (SCS) disputes, and signals Beijing’s unwillingness to adhere to the UNCLOS while continuing to base its claim to sovereign rights in the South China Sea on the so-called “nine-dash line. Since 2017, China has been strongly against Vietnam’s oil exploration activities in Vanguard Bank in blatant violation of Vietnam’s sovereignty.Beijing has been increasing its resource exploration efforts since 2016 in the South China Sea region in a bid to reduce its dependence on foreign suppliers for its crude oil. Beijing claims more than 80 per cent of the South China Sea, which holds an estimated 190 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and 11 billion barrels of oil in proved and probable reserves.As China shows no sign of giving up on its claim of sovereignty over the South China Sea by boosting its military presence in the region, and at least 27 artificial military outposts scattering from the Paracels to the Spatlys, above quoted experts fear that Chinese military could yet again increase pressure and presence in the Vanguard Bank zone from October. Since July China has been testing waters by sending its ships and then withdrawing to observe reactions including from the Global powers. There is a pattern in Chinese behavior and therefore Beijing increasing presence in the Vanguard Bank area from October cannot be ruled out.While India, USA, European Union, Australia and some regional powers have expressed concern over the situation in South China Sea and unilateral actions in the Vanguard Bank area, global powers including India which has huge stakes in ASEAN region must speak up and utilize upcoming platforms including EAS to voice concern over unilateral actions by China. Any concession to China at this stage would only embolden ambitions of Beijing in SCS and SE Asia and therefore balancing Chinese action is imperative, according to above quoted experts.The resource-rich South China Sea is one of the region’s most dangerous flashpoints and Beijing – wary of freedom of navigation operations in the waterway by the US and its allies – has insisted that territorial disputes should be resolved between claimants.While the United States is not a claimant, it regards the area as part of its Indo-Pacific strategy to contain China’s military expansion in the Pacific and Indian oceans.In an apparent show of strength and unity, the US and Britain conducted a joint naval drill in the South China Sea in February, while France sailed its naval assault ship Dixmude and a frigate close to the disputed Spratly Islands last year.The issue of Chinese aggression was raised during recent July-August ASEAN Regional Forum meetings. Addressing ASEAN counterparts Vietnamese Foreign Minister and Deputy PM Pham Binh Minh alleged at a meeting in Bangkok on July 31 that SCS situation has been complicated due to violation of Vietnam’s EEZ and continental shelf by HD-8.The Joint Communique issued by ASEAN Foreign Minister also expressed concern over ‘serious incidents in the area’. The issue was further highlighted at other meetings including East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers Meetings. The international community has also viewed Chinese action as ‘escalation’ and US Department of Defence on August 26 expressed deep concern over Beijing’s ‘coercive interference’ in Vietnam’s oil & gas prospecting activities. Australian and Vietnamese leaders in a joint statement (August 23) referred to ‘disruptive activities’ against oil & gas projects.“First, although Vanguard Bank represents the worst Vietnam-China tensions in the SCS since the Haiyang Shiyou 981 oil rig standoff in May 2014, the intervening five years were hardly without incident or tension either. For the last two years in a row, China has put enormous pressure on Vietnam to prevent hydrocarbon drilling in the areas Vietnam considered its continental shelves under UNCLOS, but China regarded as disputed regions. In the 2018 instance, Beijing forced Hanoi to cancel a $200 million contract with the Spanish energy firm Repsol on exploring the seabed off the southern coast of Vietnam. Furthermore, presumed Chinese fishing militia ships have routinely rammed Vietnamese fishing vessels even as Hanoi has mostly tried to keep such activities out of the headlines to maintain calm in bilateral ties,” wrote Derek Grossman Senior Defense Analyst with the US-based RAND Corporation in his blog “Why Vanguard Bank and Why Now? Explaining Chinese Behavior in the South China Sea” in August“…PLA likely seeks opportunities to test its growing capabilities to conduct joint operations, and unfortunately for Hanoi, Vanguard Bank may be just such an opportunity… Washington as part of its Indo-Pacific Strategy would have to demonstrate that it does not plan to allow a Scarborough Shoal 2.0, which could be a tall order. Enhancing cooperation with Vietnam's other defense partners—namely Australia, Japan, and India—could help to deter Beijing as well,” added Grossman.
