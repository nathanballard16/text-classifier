BJP questions Kejriwal for not implementing poll promise

Party says AAP didn’t keep its word on providing free rides to ‘ vulnerable categories’

The BJP Opposition on Thursday questioned Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on why he was “dithering” over the implementation of his 2015 election promise to provide free DTC bus passes to senior citizens, students and differently abled.

Leader of Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta announced that if voted to power, the BJP will provide free rides to these “vulnerable categories” in 2020.

“Why is Kejriwal after so many years saying that every step cannot be completed at once. After all, in the 2015 election manifesto, AAP had promised to provide concessional passes in metro trains and DTC buses to these vulnerable categories,” he said.

“This promise is recorded at serial number 53 of the AAP’s 70-point action plan. He has completely forgotten the most vulnerable category of differently abled while agreeing to consider senior citizens and students,” the LOP argued.

Criticising Mr. Kejriwal for holding back on his promise for more than four years and eight months, the Rohini legislator alleged that the AAP government had deprived these citizens of what could have been their right during the last four-and-a-half years.

The BJP, he said further, would come out on the streets in protest if senior citizens, students and the differently abled were deprived of their rights in this regard any longer.

Meanwhile, Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari accused the Delhi government of failing to rein-in pollution in the Capital.

“There is an emergency-like situation in Delhi. The number of patients suffering due to pollution is increasing in Delhi for which Chief Minister is responsible. Why don’t the AAP government prepare an action-plan for it and call a meeting of the Opposition parties. The graded action plan of Delhi government has failed,” he alleged.
