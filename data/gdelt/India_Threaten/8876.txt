BJP lashes out at Congress on the issue of national song, calls it anti-national

The BJP has lashed out at the Congress alleging that it has stopped the tradition of singing the national anthem and national song in the Jaipur Municipal Corporation (JMC).

The practice of singing the national song and national anthem in the local civic body was started during the BJP reign when the Mayor's post was held by BJP's Ashok Lahoty.

"The real face of the Congress has come to the fore on losing the Lok Sabha election. We used to say from the beginning that the Congress has got nothing to do with nationalism.

Congress has got nothing to do with India's national anthem and national song.

"The Jaipur Municipal Corporation had taken the unique initiative seeing which municipal corporations in the entire country had appreciated. They used to go home singing national song", Ashok Lahoty, Former Jaipur Mayor and BJP MLA, mentioned.

The BJP had lost the mayor election in the civic body held recently as Vishnu Lata, a BJP councillor turned rebel, contested the election as an independent backed by the Congress and won by one vote.

"The Congress has stopped this kind of culture on coming. It has again proved that they are anti-nationals and this time, the Lok Sabha election in the country was fought between the nationalists and anti-nationals. I want to warn the Congress party that they either rectify their mistake or do not repeat this kind of mistake", Lahoty said.

The JMC, on the other hand, has claimed that the practice was stopped due to some technical reason and will be started again.

"No, there is nothing like that. Some technical mistake has happened. Because of that it has been closed and we will get it started", Vishnu Lata, Jaipur Mayor told India Today.
