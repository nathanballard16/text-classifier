Minister’s caution

Certainly, Jaitley is right in criticising the CBI for naming several bankers without any evidence of complicity. Certainly, Jaitley is right in criticising the CBI for naming several bankers without any evidence of complicity.

Union minister Arun Jaitley makes a valid point in his recent blog post on India’s premier investigative agency, the CBI, when he suggests that the agency may be casting its net too wide. There is a fundamental difference, the minister said, between “investigative adventurism” and professional investigation. This strong indictment of the CBI — by a serving Cabinet minister, no less — appears to have been triggered by its decision, while filing a case last week against the former CEO of ICICI Bank, Chanda Kochhar, and her husband, Deepak Kochhar and Videocon group MD, Venugopal Dhoot, to name some high-profile former members of the bank’s credit committee, the current CEO of the Bank and individuals who now head other institutions in the financial sector. The agency said that it was probing the role of these bankers, too, in approving a loan to the Videocon group, whose MD alongwith the former MD of ICICI Bank and her husband has been charged with criminal conspiracy, cheating and abuse of office. If the agency includes the who’s who of the banking industry, without adequate evidence, it is bound to hurt an industry which has been showing signs of an upswing, while not serving any purpose, Jaitley cautioned.
