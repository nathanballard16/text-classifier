Indian Army Chief Cautions Soldiers About Honey-Traps on Social Media

The Indian Army chief raised this concern on the occasion of the Army Day celebrations in New Delhi on Tuesday.

"We have to be careful while using social media. Even our families should also use social media cautiously," Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat said.

It was not the first time the Army Chief had cautioned the troops about social media spying; he had done so a week earlier as well.

"Don't befriend women with names of film stars on social media, these could be honey traps," Gen. Bipin Rawat said earlier. "What makes you think they want to be friends with you? They would not want to be friends with any Tom, Dick and Harry," he expounded.

India's Army Chief said that it's not possible to put a ban on the use of social media in the military but it must be used in a constructive manner. "It should not compromise our security, as it can be used by our adversaries to trap us," the general said in his address to the troops.
