Opposition doesn’t like Masood Azhar’s global terrorist tag: Yogi

Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday alleged that the Opposition parties did not like it when the United Nations declared Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar a global terrorist.

Adityanath asked why the Congress, the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) did not make a statement about this success of India’s on the Masood Azhar issue at the global level.

The chief minister was speaking at an election rally, which prime minister Narendra Modi also addressed.

Adityanath further asked, “Main Congress netritva aur SP-BSP gathbandhan se poochna chahtan hoon ki in atankwadiyon ke prati unki sahanubhuti kya sabit karti hai (I want to ask the Congress leadership and the SP-BSP alliance what their sympathy for terrorists proves?)”

Demanding that the Opposition answer the question, the chief minister said India would lead the global fight against terrorism in the coming days.

Like Osama Bin Laden, the countdown for Masood Azahar would begin soon, he added.

He also said the Opposition’s ‘negative forces’ will dissipate on May 23, when the Lok Sabha election results are declared.

Asserting that a lot of development work had been done across the country under Modi’s leadership, Adityanath said people were getting the benefits of these schemes without any discrimination.
