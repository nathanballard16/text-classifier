AIADMK demands recall of Lt. Governor

Condemns her remarks on Twitter

The Puducherry unit of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) has demanded the recall of Lieutenant Governor Kiran Bedi for interfering in the internal affairs of a neighbouring State and for making “disrespectful comments” about politicians, bureaucrats and people in Tamil Nadu.

Addressing a press conference on Wednesday, leader of AIADMK in the Legislative Assembly A. Anbazhagan said the Lt. Governor should confine herself to the administrative affairs of the Union Territory. “The Lt. Governor has no right to comment on issues pertaining to Tamil Nadu,” he said.

“Her comments on Twitter about politicians, bureaucrats and people of Tamil Nadu were highly condemnable. The Union Government should immediately recommend to the President to recall Ms. Bedi from the Union Territory,” the AIADMK leader said.

Letter to PM

The party will write to the Prime Minister and President demanding action against Ms. Bedi for functioning in an “undemocratic and unconstitutional,” manner, Mr. Anbazhagan said.

He said the party would lay siege to Raj Nivas on Thursday to protest against her remarks on the social media platform in the context of the water crisis in Chennai.

Mr. Anbazhagan said the Lt. Governor’s power struggle with the ruling Congress “had brought administration to a standstill,” stalling development work and welfare measures.
