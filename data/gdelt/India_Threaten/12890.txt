Avoid freebies, they may cause in losses to Metro: SC

New Delhi, September 6The Delhi Government’s ambitious proposal to make metro travel free for women came under sharp criticism of the Supreme Court on Friday which questioned it for giving “freebies” and “sops” saying it might lead the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to losses. The Delhi Government should refrain from giving freebies from “public money”, the apex court said and warned that it would stop them from doing so as courts are not “powerless”. “If you will allow people to travel for free, then the Metro may go into loss. “Why you want to destroy the Delhi Metro,” the bench said, adding, “Can you give sops and say that Union of India should bear the cost”. “What you handle is public money and public trust,” the bench said, adding, “Do not think that courts are powerless”.
