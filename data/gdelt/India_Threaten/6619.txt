According to the report, a senior police officer said it was almost certain in light of the facts that the call was a hoax. “However, we could not take any chances and, hence, had to share the information with other states as a precaution,” the officer was quoted in the report as saying.

In the letter, Raju said: “One person...claiming to be a lorry driver by name Swamy Sundar Murthy who is claiming to be on his way to Hosur (Tamil Nadu) called up control room, Bengaluru city police at 17.35 hours today... He claims to have information to the effect that major cities in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Pondicherry, Goa and Maharashtra will be hit by terror attacks,” as reported by Hindustan Times.
