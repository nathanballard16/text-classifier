We're not gunrunners, grenade-throwers, stone-throwers, we believe in peaceful resolution of things.”“They want to murder us, we are ready, my chest is ready, fire here, not into my back,” 81-year-old Abdullah said in an emotional outburst.He also contested home minister's assertion in Parliament that he was neither under detention nor arrest and was at his home out of his own will. The former J&K CM said there was abig padlock on his door and he had to “force himself” to come out and speak to the media.
