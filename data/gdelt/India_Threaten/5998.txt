Bengaluru: Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy On Tuesday, April 16 warned Sandalwood actor, Rocking Star Yash by stating ” These actors wouldn’t survive if not for producers like us.”

This comment of Kumaraswamy came after Yash started involving himself in the rallies held in Mandya in the support of the Independent candidate Sumalatha Ambareesh.

Warning Yash to stay away from politics Kumaraswamy said “Some actor called Yash has been accusing my party members. My supporters have refrained from commenting only because of me. I can’t believe I agree to make films with such actors. They are only surviving because of producers like us.”

He further added that “Do not believe all that you see onscreen. What you witness on a daily basis is the truth. Where had these actors been when the farmers committed suicide?” said the Chief Minister.
