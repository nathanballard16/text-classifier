Self-proclaimed godman Swami Om to contest elections from New Delhi

The former Big Boss contestant has been in several controversies for making leud remarks against Big Boss host Salman Khan and his family. He was also thrashed live on a news channel by another guest for his offensive remarks.

A former Bigg Boss contestant, Swami Om, in a statement said he will fight against the "anti-Hindu" stance of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had put out a tweet depicting his party symbol, a broom, chasing a "Hindu swastika". The statement said several Hindu organisations held a meeting on Saturday and finalised his name.
