Bullet tankers coming from Kerala towards Udupi should traverse via KPT-Kavoor-Bajpe-Kana-Surathkal to reach MRPL. Lorries, buses and tankers should traverse via the adjacent one-way two-lane bridge in a two-way manner.Light motor vehicles including cars, jeeps, tempos, auto-rickshaws and two-wheelers will use the one-way two-lane arch bridge to commute. The deputy commissioner told the project director, NHAI to set up necessary cautionary and direction signs for the benefit of motorists.Union minister of road transport and highways Nitin Gadkari on March 5 had laid the foundation stone for the construction of a new six-lane major bridge across the Phalguni at an estimated cost of Rs 65 crore. The new bridge will be of 174-metre length with four spans of 32.50m and two spans of 22 metres and have the main carriageway of 3 lanes each and a service road bridge of 2 lanes after dismantling the existing arch bridge.
