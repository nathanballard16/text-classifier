FEMALE MEMBER FINALLY ADDED TO PROBE PANEL

MSU FACING A DEEP-ROOTED CONSPIRACY: REGISTRAR

VADODARA: M S University on Sunday decided to withhold results of all the students associated with the infamous Pathan group who have been arrested by police in connection with acid attack threats.The university has also decided that the students will not be able to take readmission in any faculty of the university till the time a probe committee appointed by it submits its final report.“We have issued necessary directives so that results of those who are our students are withheld and they are not able to take admission in any other faculty,” said MSU’s in-charge registrar N K Ojha.On Saturday, the cops had arrested six from the group for issuing threats of acid attack to MSU Students Union vice-president Saloni Mishra and former general secretary of arts faculty Shreya Negandhi.The six arrested included Zuber Khan Pathan, Fazal Khan Pathan, Akib Pathan, Mohsin Khan Pathan, Sajid Khan Pathan and Kalim Khan Pathan while two others Rustam Pathan and Atiyal Pathan were booked by Sayajigunj police for rioting and criminal intimidation on the basis of complaint given by Mishra.While Zuber has already passed out from the university, Fazal is a second year master’s of arts student at Faculty of Arts. Akib is a third year economics student while Atiyal is a second year economics student at Faculty of Arts. Similarly, Rustam is a second year economics student while Kalim is a third year arts student.Sajid is a ATKT student while Mohsin is a student of postgraduate diploma at Faculty of Commerce.Mishra in her complaint had stated that the group led by Zuber had gathered at the head office when she along with others had gone to submit a memorandum to MSU vice-chancellor.She has alleged that Zuber instigated his group by saying that when these girls go out, they will have to throw acid on them while the group even hurled abuses at her.Mishra had submitted her complaint before MSU vice-chancellor and senior police officials at police bhavan before lodging a complaint at Sayajigunj police station.Vadodara: M S University on Sunday finally appointed a female member to the probe panel, which it has formed to investigate the incidents of Friday at university head office during which members of Pathan group allegedly issued threats to female student leaders on the campus.Although the university had formed a mammoth-sized committee under chairmanship of proctor to probe the incidents, female members had pointed out that the committee, which is supposed to probe threats issued to girl students, ironically did not have a single female member.On Sunday, MSU vice-chancellor (VC) professor Parimal Vyas appointed chairman of women’s grievance redressal committee professor Adhya Saxena, government nominated syndicate member Rajendra Patel and deputy chief warden Dr Jaita Sharma as additional members of the committee. The first meeting of the committee will be held on Monday.Vadodara: If M S University officials are to be believed, the university is facing a deep-rooted conspiracy since the last couple of years every time before the new academic session begins.“These incidents happen every year during the months of April and May when the admission process is about to begin. The same group, which was involved in ruckus at the Halls of Residence last year, is this year allegedly involved in issuing threats to girl students,” said MSU’s in-charge registrar N K Ojha.“The fact remains that even last year, a non-issue had flared up and even this time, a non-issue has led to an unpleasant episode. Such episodes leave image of the university damaged as parents will think twice before admitting their wards here,” he said.Ojha said in rest of the time in the year, university has conducted students union elections, examination process and other events peacefully.
