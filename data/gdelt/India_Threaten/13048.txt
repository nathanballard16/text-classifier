Visitors bear brunt of strike by DC office staff

Though many employees were available in the offices, they refused to carry out any office work. However, members of the Punjab State District DC Office Employees’ Union will take a final decision tomorrow whether they will end or extend their strike. When I visited the district administration office today, the employees were present but they refused to hear me. We will resume work only when the union will announce to end the strike,” said an employee. President of the DC Office Employees’ Union, Ludhiana, Vikas Kumar Juneja said, “We will continue our strike on Wednesday.
