We can surge ahead with positivity. We can rise up to expectations of 130 crore people,” Modi said in Guruvayur in an address to BJP workers.

“Those who made us win are ours, those who did not make us win are also ours. You may ask BJP drew blank in Kerala then why Modi selected Kerala for his first political speech…..Kerala is as much mine as Varanasi,” Modi said.

He was addressing BJP workers after a visit to the Sri Krishna temple in Guruvayur to offer prayers.

The PM said although elections have their own place, the government’s responsibility is towards the country’s entire population.

He thanked voters for “the festive spirit of democracy”.

“I salute the people. People are my gods,” he said.

Modi underlined that his government would work for all without any discrimination.

“I am the servant of all. I am here to lift my county to its glory. I am for all. Whether we win or lose we are committed to all,” he said,

He also described BJP workers as ‘jan sevak’ who are committed to serving the people lifelong.

“Jan Sevaks are forever, not for mere five years,” he said.

Modi said there was nothing to worry or panic about Nipah virus which resurfaced for the second time in Kerala.

“The Government is with people. The State and Central government will work together to fight it. The Centre is closely monitoring the situation,” Modi said.
