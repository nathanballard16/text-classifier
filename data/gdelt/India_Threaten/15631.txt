Indian Politician Lampooned for Saying Cow's Milk Contains Gold, Asking Beef Eaters to Have Dog Meat

A controversial Bharatiya Janata Party chief from West Bengal suggested that “intellectuals” refrain from eating beef in public places, and start eating dog meat as well. He went on to attack beef eaters, saying some "take pride in cleaning the excrements of their foreign pet dogs".

Ghosh also warned beef eaters of the dire consequences for killing and consuming cows, which is a crime.

"The cow is our mother; we stay alive by consuming cow milk. If anyone misbehaves with my mother, I will treat them the way they should be treated. On the holy soil of India killing cows and consuming beef is a crime,” ANI quoted Ghosh as saying on the occasion of Gopashtam, a Hindu festival.

Comparing foreign breeds and Indian breeds of cows, he went on to say 'desi' cow milk contains gold and that is why Indian cows have gold-coloured milk. He further made a bizarre remark, saying cows of foreign breeds are “aunties” and not “gaumata” (the term describing the status of cows being equal to the status of 'mothers' in Hinduism).
