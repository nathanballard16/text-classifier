The alleged errors led to protests by students, their parents, students organisations and opposition parties.

Some students and their parents claimed they got poor marks though they are meritorious and scored good marks in the first year examination.

Errors, including in bubbling of OMR sheets by examiners and not displaying practical marks in the memos of some geography students, came to the fore.

Meanwhile, the Opposition congress said it would stage a protest here with other parties Saturday on the issue.
