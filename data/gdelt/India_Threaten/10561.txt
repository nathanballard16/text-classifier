India warns Pakistan not to set out for impossible ventures

NEW DELHI: On the occasion of Kargil Vijay Diwas, Indian Army Chief Bipin Rawat has issued a warning against Pakistan. Bipin Rawat asked the neighbouring country to avoid any further attempts to secure Kashmir.

According to the Army Chief, Pakistan has been attempting to achieve the impossible for a very long time. He warned that Pakistan will have to face heavy consequences if it attempts for more such impossible ventures as their Army’s strength is nowhere near that of the Indian army.

The Army Chief was speaking after paying his tributes to the Indian soldiers who lost their lives during the Kargil war.
