Just four states yet to achieve 100% toilet coverage in rural areas

NEW DELHI: Odisha, Goa, Telangana and West Bengal are the only states yet to achieve 100% household toilet coverage in rural areas. Odisha lagging behind has been made a poll issue by BJP in this election where it is challenging the ruling Biju Janata Dal (BJD) government.According to official data, toilet coverage in Odisha till Sunday was a little above 84% and in Goa it was almost 61%. In Telangana, around 96% of rural houses have toilets while in West Bengal, only 0.4% households lack individual toilets.Though the Centre had set October 2019 as the deadline to achieve full toilet coverage, which is one of the major goals under the Swachh Bharat Mission, it was hopeful of meeting the target before the polls. That would have come as a boost to the government as on Sunday, the total toilet coverage in rural India stood at 99.1%.Government sources said the slow progress in toilet construction in Odisha and Goa was a cause of worry. Recently, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan , who is leading the BJP campaign against Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik , had slammed BJD for this while talking to local media. He had cited how West Bengal, ruled by a non-BJP party, had done better than Odisha.Official data showed that the toilet coverage in Odisha was around 11.7% in October 2014 when the Swachh Bharat Mission was launched by PM Narendra Modi . In states such as J&K, Bihar, Rajasthan and Jharkhand, where less than 30% village households had access to toilet, coverage became 100% in less than four and a half years. “We are confident of achieving the target. State governments have responded well to the drive,” said a government official.
