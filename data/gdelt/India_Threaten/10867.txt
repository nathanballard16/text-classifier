Telangana Congress demands Muslim leaders must leave TRS

Hyderabad: Hyderabad City Congress Committee minorities cell chairman Sameer Waliullah on Wednesday accused TRS of betraying Muslims on the triple talaq bill issue. Hence, he said that Muslim leaders must immediately resign from their posts in the pink party.



Times of India quoted Waliullah as saying, “Muslims of Telangana had trusted CM K Chandrasekhar Rao and voted for his party in last two elections. They believed his claims that TRS was a secular and anti-BJP party. Despite being warned by Congress that TRS was BJP’s ‘B-Team’, they voted in favour of TRS in the general elections. However, TRS has betrayed Muslims by supporting BJP in passing triple talaq Bill in Rajya Sabha by abstaining from voting.”

Sameer further accused KCR for cheating Muslims by promising 12% reservation in jobs and education, but not granting them quota. Alleging that KCR and other TRS leaders have been wearing a mask of secularism for the last six years to conceal their anti-Muslim face Waliullah claimed that it was proved beyond doubt that TRS and BJP are in a ‘living relationship’ with both supporting each other.



He urged all Muslim leaders to distance themselves from TRS. Naming a few he said, Home minister Mahmood Ali, Bodhan MLA Aamer Shakeel, MLCs Farooq Hussain and Mohd Fareeduddin, chairmen of various corporations, including Wakf Board chief Mohammed Saleem, Urdu Academy chairman Raheemuddin Ansari and others should resign to show protest.
