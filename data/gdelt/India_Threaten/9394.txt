Pune: Case against hospital directors after foetus found dumped in garbage truck

After the medical waste vehicle did not turn up, an employee of Jivanrekha Multispeciality Hospital disposed of the lifeless baby with civic waste.



Dehu Road police have filed a case against the board of directors of Jivanrekha Multispeciality Hospital for allegedly dumping a 16-week-old dead foetus in the garbage instead of clinical disposal.



The incident came to light when a sanitation worker noticed a plastic bag containing the dead foetus in the garbage truck that was leaving the hospital. A complaint was filed by Dr Yamini Adbe, who works at the Dehu Road Cantonment Hospital after she received a call.



When doctors from the hospital were questioned, they revealed that a 20-year-old woman had come to the hospital on June 26 complaining of stomach ache. However, when Dr Jimesh Mevani checked the woman he found that she had a miscarriage. He extracted the dead foetus and told the woman and her husband that it will be stored in the hospital and disposed of with other clinical wastes.



However, the medical waste collection vehicle did not visit the hospital on June 26 and an employee of Jivanrekha Hospital instead dumped the dead body in the civic garbage truck.



Sanitation workers who found the foetus then approached the complainant, who reached the spot to verify the case. Talking to Mirror, Adbe said, “I reached the hospital and checked the garbage truck to find the dead foetus dumped in a plastic bag. The doctors from the hospital were going to store the foetus for medical study. But a negligent staff chucked the dead body in the civic garbage truck with injections and other medical waste. This grossly violates the medical disposal norms and could prove fatal to other human beings.”



Police have booked the hospital’s board of directors for negligence and endangering the lives of citizens.
