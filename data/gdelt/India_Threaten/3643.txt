Indian politician questions Modi over international media's refutal of Balakot 'casualties'

Indian Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Monday criticised Narendra Modi over false claims of casualties in the Balakot airstrike and questioned if he was "politicising terror".



Questioning Indian claims of 300 alleged terrorists being killed in the so-called airstrikes in Balakot on February 26, Sibal stated that the international media reported there were no casualties.

Listing a number of international media organisations such as New York Times, London-based Jane's Information Group, Washington Post, Daily Telegraph, The Guardian and Reuters, Sibal asked Modi if they are all "pro-Pakistan" as they are "reporting no proof of militant losses".

"You [Modi] are guilty of politicising terror?" he added.

"When international media speaks against Pakistan,you feel elated. When they ask questions, it's asking because it supports Pakistan?" Sibal continued.

Indian Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa also exposed the false claims of Indian media and government officials regarding the number of deaths in the February 26 Balakot airstrike.

During a press conference, when the Indian air chief marshal was asked to give a figure regarding the number of alleged terrorists killed in the February 26 airstrike, he said, the Indian Air Force (IAF) "can't count how many people died".

"We can't count how many people have died. It depends on how many people were there," Dhanoa said while addressing a press conference.

"[Indian] Air Force is not in a position to clarify how many people were inside. We don't count human casualties. We count what targets we have hit or not hit."

New Delhi’s claim of 300 casualties in the so-called air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan has been questioned worldwide.
