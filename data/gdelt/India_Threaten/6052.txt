Debris of Satellite Destroyed by India May Threaten ISS - Russian MoD

In turn, the Russian Foreign Ministry called anti-satellite (ASAT) tests conducted by India a result of the deterioration of the situation in the arms control sphere, caused by US actions.

Earlier, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that New Delhi had successfully tested its first anti-satellite missile by hitting a defunct Indian satellite at an altitude of 300 kilometres (186 miles).

Modi added that India had become the fourth country in the world to possess such a weapon after China, Russia and the United States.

India has been developing its space program since it gained independence from the British Empire in 1947.
