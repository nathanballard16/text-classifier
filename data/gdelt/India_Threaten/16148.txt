‘Tipsy’ woman creates ruckus at police station

Assaults woman SI after being detained for roaming about semi-naked

The Banjara Hills police station witnessed some commotion in the early hours of Sunday after an allegedly drunk woman was detained for creating nuisance in the area.

The woman identified as Lisa (24), a native of Nagaland, also attacked a female sub-inspector (SI) and hurled abuses at the staff when she was not allowed to leave the premises after gaining consciousness. She was later taken to the Women Safe Home in Begumpet.

Inspector N. Kalinga Rao said Ms. Lisa was detained based on a complaint received on Dial 100 about her being inebriated and moving around in a semi-clad condition in Zehra Nagar of Banjara Hills. “Locals complained that she was moving around semi-naked, screaming and shouting abuses. Soon, a team of women officers was sent to the spot and they brought her to the station,” he said.

When a woman SI tried to stop Ms. Lisa from running out of the station, she overpowered the officer and bit her on the hand, Mr. Rao said. In a video clip of the incident, which has gone viral on social media, Ms. Lisa is seen threatening to kill the police officers if they don’t let her leave. “She was drunk and we suspect that she was under the influence of drugs too,” the officer said, adding that her blood samples were sent for some tests.

Ms. Lisa is a resident of Begumpet and works with a private firm in Madhapur. On Saturday night, she attended a party at her friend’s place in Zehra Nagar, said police. Based on the complaint lodged by the woman SI who was assaulted, a case under Section 294 (obscene acts) and 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC and Section 71 of Hyderabad City Police Act was registered.
