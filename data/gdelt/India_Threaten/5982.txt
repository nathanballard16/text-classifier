Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Tuesday during a rally warned the Rocking Star Yash that producers are investing in him only because of their power. This comment has come after KGF star Yash started involving himself in the rallies held in Mandya in the support of the wife of late Congress MP and actor Ambareesh, Sumalatha. During K.R Pete rally, Karnataka CM Kumaraswamy said, "These actors wouldn't survive if not for producers like us." Karnataka CM has warned Yash to stay away from politics.

He further added, "Some actor called Yash has been accusing my party members. My supporters have refrained from commenting only because of me. I can't believe I agree to make films with such actors. They are only surviving because of producers like us."

"Do not believe all that you see onscreen. What you witness on a daily basis is the truth. Where had these actors been when the farmers committed suicide?" said the Chief Minister
