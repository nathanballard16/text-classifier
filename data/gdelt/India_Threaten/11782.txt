APHC asks UN to send peacekeepers to Kashmir

The All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) has demanded of the United Nations to send peacekeeping forces in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) to prevent the genocide of the people at the hands of occupation forces.The Hurriyat leaders were addressing a protest gathering outside Indian High Commission in Islamabad on Thursday to mark Indian Independence Day as a Black Day. People from different walks of life participated in the demonstration.The protesters carried black flags, banners and placards inscribed with anti-India and pro-Kashmiri slogans. The protesters chanted: “Kashmir Banega Pakistan” (Kashmir will merge with Pakistan) and “Go India Go”.The UN mission would also help in ending the lockdown in the occupied region and restore means of communication, which remain suspended for the past several days, they added.The APHC representatives said the Kashmir dispute was not a bilateral matter between Pakistan and India. They said it was an international dispute acknowledged by the UN through its resolutions and accepted by the two countries. It pertains to the life of 15 million Kashmiris.They termed the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution by India as a deep conspiracy and vowed that the Kashmiris would resist the ploy.They demanded of the UN to address the dire situation in occupied Kashmir and send its peacekeeping mission in the region.Talking to The Express Tribune, APHC leader Tahir Masood said India has committed a major blunder by revoking the special status of Kashmir. “The [redux] measure is taken to change IOK status, which is a Muslim-majority region,” he added.However, he said Kashmiris would foil all such malicious attempts of India.Another APHC leader Syed Yousuf Naseem said, Kashmiris have never given their allegiance to the Indian Constitution. He said Indian moves would not affect the freedom movement.The Modi government’s step would only highlight the issue on a global level, he said, adding the government of Pakistan had effectively showcased Kashmir dispute because of which the UNSC has convened its special session on Friday (today) for extensive discussion of the crisis.“It is high time that Kashmir should be given its due freedom,” APHC leader Abdul Hameed said.India could no longer maintain its writ in Kashmir and subject its citizens to further oppression, he said and expressed hope the freedom movement would gain more power than ever.He also appealed the UN to send its peacekeeping forces in Kashmir to put a check on widespread massacre of Kashmiris.
