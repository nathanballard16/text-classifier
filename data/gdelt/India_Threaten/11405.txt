India cut Kashmir’s autonomy. Here’s how that will affect South Asia -- and the world.

India’s decision will affect whether this settlement can be sustained. Pakistan is likely to remind the United States that it’s been significant in the Afghan peace process — and of its leverage over the Taliban — in the hope that the United States will chastise India. If it ramps up support to Kashmiri rebels, Pakistan will hope that the United States will look the other way. If the United States doesn’t meet Pakistan’s expectations, Pakistan may retaliate by gradually pulling its support from a future settlement in Afghanistan.
