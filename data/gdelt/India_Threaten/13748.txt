Power generation may fall coal workers go on strike

KOLKATA: The planned strike aton Tuesday is likely to hit power supply as plants with thousands of megawatts of generation capacity have fuel stocks only for a day or less.Worker at the coal behemoth are going on a tool-down strike on September 24 to protest against the government’s decision last month to allow 100% foreign direct investment in coal mining under the automatic route.According to a Coal India executive, while five unions have said it will be a one-day strike, one union has called for a five-day strike from September 23, which prompted its affiliated members to start disrupting production and dispatches at Talcher coalfields, which produce more than 100,000 tonnes a day.On Monday, attendance at Mahanadi Coalfields was almost half, while production at Eastern Coalfields’ Rajmahal was affected, the executive said.Eight power plants with a generation capacity of 13,280 MW are left with stocks that won’t last a day, while another 14 plants, with a total generation capacity of 18,850 MW, are left with a day’s stock, according to data provided by the Central Electricity Authority. These include plants that have payment issues or have already received more than the committed quota or are not lifting coal.An executive of NTPC, the country’s largest power producer, said the plants at Talcher (3,000 MW), Sipat (2,980 MW), Korba (2,600 MW) and Kahalgaon (2,340 MW) are likely to be affected by the strike as their coal stocks are low.Coal fuels the bulk of India’s power generation, and it is estimated that disruption of a day’s production may lead to losses between Rs 110 crore and Rs 130 crore for Coal India.The unions have adopted a hard line. They did not attend a meeting with the Union coal minister last week because the government notified liberal foreign investment norms last month, said DD Ramanandan, general secretary, All India Coal Workers Federation, which is affiliated to CITU.SQ Zama, secretary-general at Indian National Mine Workers' Federation, which is under INTUC, said workers would follow up the strike with more protests, which may include an indefinite strike if the government does not revoke its decision.
