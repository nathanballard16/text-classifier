Indian State Police Warns Public Against Investing In Cryptocurrencies

The police of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir issued a warning to the general public against investing in cryptocurrencies, according to a report in the daily The Business Standard.

An advisory issued by the Inspector General (IG) of crime branch, warned public against making investments in cryptocurrencies or virtual currencies such as Bitcoin due to the "heightened risk" associated with them.

The IG reminded the public that these forms of digital assets are not backed as legal tender by the government and central financial institutions.

"This can result in a sudden and prolonged crash, exposing investors; especially retail consumers who stand to lose their hard-earned money," the advisory said.

It also said the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has not given any license and authorization to any entity and company to operate in such schemes or deal with Bitcoin or any virtual currency. Nobody has been given any regulatory permission to deal with such currencies.

The IG added that the lack of regulatory oversight on cryptocurrencies leads to high risk of the platforms being used for carrying out subversive activities, smuggling, drug trafficking, human trafficking, terror funding and money laundering.

The RBI had banned the country's commercial banks from providing banking services to businesses or individuals dealing in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin that came into effect on July 6.

Blockchain developers, services providers, and companies dealing in cryptocurrency trading in India are reportedly migrating to crypto-friendly destinations or are seriously considering options in the wake of increasingly hostile ecosystem in the country.
