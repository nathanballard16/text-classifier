Bigg Boss 13: Shehnaaz Gill will remind you of Alia Bhatt as she fails to answer the Capital of India; WATCH

We still vividly remember the episode of Koffee with Karan which had Student of the year cast- Varun Dhawan, Alia Bhatt and Sidharth Malhotra grace the show and during the show, one memory that still remains afresh in our memory is when Alia Bhatt said that the President of India is Prithviraj Chauhan. Since that episode, Alia Bhatt has been mocked for her GK. Now, looks like, Bigg Boss 13 contestant Shehnaaz Gill is here to give neck-to-neck competition to Alia Bhatt because in one of the unseen videos of the show, we can see Sidharth Shukla, Vishal Aditya Singh and Shehnaaz playing a game of GK wherein they test her GK. When Vishal asks Shehnaaz to name India's capital, Shehnaaz says 'Mumbai'.

Furthermore, they ask her to name the capital of Haryana and she says Chandigarh. Also, she was asked to name 7 continents but she failed miserably here as well. She mentioned that Maharashtra, Orissa and Jharkhand are continents. In today’s episode, we will see Shehnaaz Gill pushing Asim while he is fighting with Sidharth Shukla and on seeing this, Shefali will get agitated and will call her psycho.

Also, in today’s episode, we will see Rashami Desai, Vishal, Shehnaaz and Hindustani Bhai fighting for captaincy and it will be interesting to see as to who eventually becomes the next captain of the house. Stay tuned to Pinkvilla for all the updates!
