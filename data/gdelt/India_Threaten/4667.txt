The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday released its first list of candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections with Prime Minister Narendra Modi again contesting from Varanasi seat. In total, BJP has released 184 names on Thursday. Amit Shah will be fighting from LK Adavani's Gandhinagar seat.

20 states covered in BJP's first list. All 17 seats in Bihar have been cleared by CEC and the list of names have been sent to the state election panel. The list will be released by NDA soon, says JP Nadda. In total around 25 sitting MPs have been dropped from the list. The big surprise is LK Advani being dropped and also the likes of BC Khanduri not making the cut. Contrary to expectations, BJP's main man in North East Himanta Biswa Sarma hasn't been given ticket.

While Home Minister Rajnath Singh has been again fielded from Lucknow, Union Minister Smriti Irani has been pitted against Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

Most of the ministers in the Union Cabinet, who are sitting Lok Sabha MPs, have been fielded from the same seats.
