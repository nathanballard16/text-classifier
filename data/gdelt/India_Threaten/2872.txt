KT Rama Rao’s poll cry: Let’s dictate the Centre

Hyderabad: TRS working president K.T. Rama Rao on Saturday said the party will go to the elections with the slogan “Telangana people dictate to the Centre”.

After the Lok Sabha elections, regional parties will play a key role in the formation of the government at the Centre, as the Congress was not in a position to win 100 MPs, and the BJP’s strength will dip, he told journalists.

He said if the BJP tried to take advantage of the Pulwama terror attack as an election issue, it would definitely lose as it could expose the intelligence lapses at the Centre.

Replying to a query on pre-poll surveys indicating a BJP win under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said Mr Modi was the PM and that was why all surveys focussed on him. “We did not ally with any party as we are confident of winning. Why is Mr Modi allying with others if he is confident of winning,” Mr Rama Rao asked.

Reminding that Chief Minister K. Chandrase-khar Rao had achieved Telangana statehood with just two MPs, he said, “We have to win 16 seats to be able to dictate to Delhi. So, we have to go to the polls with that slogan. Sixteen seats are requ-ired to ask Delhi for the Bayyaram steel factory.”
