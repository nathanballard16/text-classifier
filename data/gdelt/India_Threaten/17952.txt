Indore: Chief Minister Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government continues to use the stringent National Security Act (NSA) in creative ways. The act which pertains to preventive detention of a person who is a potential threat to “national security” has now been invoked against 40 people in cases pertaining to adulteration of milk and milk products in the last four months.

Treating the issue of milk adulteration at par with national security, Madhya Pradesh Minister Tulsi Silawat told news agency ANI, "In the last 4 months, NSA is slapped on 40 persons while 106 FIRs have been registered against those who adulterate milk and its products. The mission is to make the adulterators leave Madhya Pradesh."

Kamal Nath government declared a war on milk adulteration with its 'Shuddh ke liye Yuddh' campaign to fight those who indulge in the crime. Silawat vows that the MP government would not spare those involved in the crime.

"The 'Suddh ke liye Yuddh' campaign under the aegis of Chief Minister Kamal Nath is against those who adulterate milk and milk products in the state. The fight against the adulterated products is on a large scale and those who are involved in such crimes would not be spared," Silawat added.

Under the NSA which was promulgated during the then PM Indira Gandhi’s tenure on September 23, 1980, an individual can be detained without a charge for up to 12 months – and therefore is rarely used.

A person detained under the NSA can be held for 10 days without informing them of the charges and they can appeal before a high court advisory committee but are not allowed to be represented by a lawyer during the trial.
