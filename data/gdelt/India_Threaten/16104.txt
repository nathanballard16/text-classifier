Entally police in Kolkata arrested three suspected illegal Bangladeshi immigrants on Wednesday for allegedly threatening, kidnapping and extorting money from a fellow Bangladeshi trader last week.

Key accused Salim alias Salim Reza alias Mizanur, who stays at Kalidanga in Basanti, was arrested from Patuli police station area of Kolkata and subsequently on the basis of his statement, Chalauddin Mondal (49) and Nasima Bibi (35) were nabbed from Habra in North 24 Parganas. According to police sources, Bashir Miya, who runs a garments trade in Faridpur of Bangladesh, had come Kolkata on a business tour.

As per a complaint lodged at Entally police station, he alleged that he was kidnapped at gunpoint last Friday and released after two days when his father-in-law paid nearly Rs 6 lakh as ransom to the accused.

Bashir reportedly told police that on November 11, he had gone to Dharmatala area to buy some gold and clothes. There he came across an acquaintance, Salim, who allegedly requested him to come to a friends wedding, Bashir said.

“I agreed and we went to Guma railway station in Habra. There, I was intercepted by Chalauddin and Nasima who pretended to be officers of Central Bureau of Investigation and threatened me that I will be jailed for smuggling gold. They took nearly Rs 45,000 in Bangladeshi and European currency from me,” Bashir said in his complaint.

“Bashir further said he was abducted at gunpoint and kept in a room in Habra till they got the ransom money,” said a senior police officer.

Initially, a case was lodged under sections 120B, 419, 364A, 389, 324 and 379 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under various section of Arms Act on November 11. Later, more sections were added.

Following this, police conducted multiple raids in and around the city and nabbed key accused Salim and subsequently another raid was conducted in Habra, from where Chalauddin and Nasima were nabbed.As per police, the prime accused was chased from canning area and was finally arrested from Patuli with the help of local police.

“Primary investigation reveals that they are illegal Bangladeshi immigrants and involved with a gang of international human trafficking,” said the senior police officer.

“ Chalauddin and Nasima helped Salim keep the trader in captivity in Habra,” the officer added.

Police sources said a motorcycle was also seized.

“This bike was allegedly used by the accused persons for kidnapping the victim,” said the officer.

As per sources, the gang had planned to send him back to Bangladesh illegally, but he went straight to Sealdah railway station after being released on ransom. It is suspected that the gang would mostly accept money in Bangladeshi currency from victims.

Deputy Commissioner Debasmita Das of Eastern Suburban Division, Kolkata Police, however, said Bashir had all legal documents and that he often came to Kolkata on business purpose.

Further raids will be carried out to nab the other gang members, added police.
