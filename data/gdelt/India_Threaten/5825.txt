The police have promised action against the culprits.

"I have got this information. This is really inhuman as a woman was tortured and humiliated. That's why I told senior police officials to go there with additional force and have instructed them that whosoever was present there at the time of the incident should be called to the police station and, an FIR should be registered immediately after proper inquiry," police chief Vineet Jain said.

The woman had eloped with her lover few days back to Gujarat, police said, adding her in-laws and husband found her two days back.
