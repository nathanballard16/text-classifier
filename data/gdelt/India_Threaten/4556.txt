Dalai Lama says his incarnation may be found in India; warns against any successor named by China

The statement comes a day after the town of Dharamshala marked the anniversary of Dalai Lama’s escape from Tibetan capital disguised as a soldier.

: The spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists Dalai Lama who has been living in India since the last 60 years said on Monday that it was possible that if he dies his incarnation could be found in India and at the same time warned against any other successor named by China. “China considers Dalai Lama’s reincarnation as something very important. They have more concern about the next Dalai Lama than me, “the 14Dalai Lama was quoted as saying by Reuters. He said that if in future, in case people see two Dalai Lamas come, one from India, in free country, one chosen by Chinese, then nobody will trust, nobody will respect (the one chosen by China). So that’s an additional problem for the Chinese, he added.
