“Government ignored warning on Pulwama”

Congress leader Digvijay Singh took to Twitter to accuse the Narendra Modi government in India of deliberately ignoring an urgent warning about the February 14 Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF personnel.

Posting a signal intelligence letter on Twitter, Singh wrote: “PULWAMA WARNING: Would Home Minister deny this Signal sent on 8th February 2019 by SSP on behalf of IGP? J&K Governor admitted Intelligence failure in Pulwama attack. IG, Kashmir Police warned of IED attack, via Signal sent on 8 Feb, 2018. It was ignored. The result was Pulwama attack, where 44 of our Jawans sacrificed their lives in IED blast (sic).”

The former CM of Madhya Pradesh, who lost the Bhopal Lok Sabha election to BJP’s Pragya Thakur, said the government had earlier denied airlifting of CRPF jawans, forcing them to take the dangerous land route without sanitising the route leading to jawans’ death.“GOI doesn’t even ask anyone who is responsible for this Intelligence Failure? Not even the Governor who admitted Intelligence Failure!! Now this week, Pakistan shared the intelligence of possible IED attack in Kashmir. Again there is an IED explosion in Pulwama and yet again India pays for gross Intelligence Failure. Is there anyone responsible Mr Modi? Shouldn’t NSA be answerable for this Intelligence Failure?” Singh asked on Twitter. He then said, “No but NSA will not resign. NSA has been promoted to the Cabinet Rank from MOS rank!! Congratulations Mr NSA.”
