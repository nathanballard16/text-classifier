YSRCP MP Goddeti Madhavi Vows To Fight For Tribal Rights

Vishakhapatnam: YSRCP MP from Araku Lok Sabha (ST) Constituency Goddeti Madhavi on Monday vowed to fight for the implementation of tribal welfare and rights law. Madhavi met Head of the Department of Telugu at Andhra University J Apparao and said that she will strive for the welfare of the tribals.

Expressing concern over the lack of basic facilities, the YSRCP MP said that she will raise tribal issues in Parliament and also speak to Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the same. Madhavi pointed out that tribals were displaced and not given proper rehabilitation.

Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, in his first cabinet meeting on Monday, approved the decision to increase the salaries of Tribal Area Community Health workers from Rs 400 to Rs 4,000 per month. The move will benefit 700 community health workers in the state.

The salaries of ASHA health workers have also been increased fom Rs 3,000 to Rs 10,000. The giant leap in terms of monthly honorarium places the ASHA of Andhra Pradesh well above their peer group in Telangana who draw Rs 6,000 a month and by those in Kerala who earn a monthly honorarium of Rs 7,500. The decision will impact about 3,500 ASHA workers in the state.
