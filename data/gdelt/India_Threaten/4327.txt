UNSC members warn of ‘other actions’ as China blocks move on JeM chief Masood Azhar

The members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) warned that they may be forced to pursue other actions at the Security Council if Beijing continued with this policy.

China “should not protect terrorists from Pakistan or any other country,” said Diplomat.

It came hours after China for the fourth time, put a technical hold to tag Jaish-e Mohammad chief Masood Azhar as a “global terrorist”

The proposal to designate Masood Azhar was moved by the UK, France and the US on February 27, days after Pulwama terror attack which killed at least 40 CRPF soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir.

Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) had claimed the responsibility of the attack.

India has expressed disappointment over China’s decision saying it will continue to pursue all available avenues to ensure that terrorist leaders who are involved in heinous attacks on Indians are brought to justice.

India thanked all countries who supported the bid to designate Azhar as a global terrorist.

“We are grateful for the efforts of the Member States who moved the designation proposal and the unprecedented number of all other Security Council members as well as non-members who joined as co-sponsors, the statement said.

China, a veto-wielding permanent member of the UN Security Council had blocked the move by India and other member nations three times earlier.
