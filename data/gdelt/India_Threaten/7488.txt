India warns students not to study in Pakistani Kashmir

INDIA India warns students not to study in Pakistani Kashmir Tweet



According to the advisory issued by UGC Secretary Rajnish Jain, though PAK is an integral part of the Union of India, the educational institutions including universities, medical colleges and technical institutions situated there have neither been established by the government of India nor are recognised by the statutory authorities such as the UGC, the All India Council for Technical Education and the Medical Council of India.



“Therefore students are cautioned and advised against taking admission in any college, university or technical institution in any territory under the illegal occupation of Pakistan, including the so-called AJK [Azad Jammu and Kashmir] and Gilgit-Baltistan, which are not currently recognised in India,” read the contents of the UGC advisory.



Continuing the pressure on Kashmiri students to avoid such admissions, another statutory body and India’s national-level council for technical education, the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), has asked the provincial government of IAK to take steps in this regard.



AICTE sent an official communication to the secretary of the Higher Education Department and General Administration Department of IAK to caution students against pursuing courses in PAK “because the government of India doesn’t recognise these courses”.



Without recognition, the students with an education from PAK cannot work in India as the degrees won’t be honoured here.



The issue was flagged after 25 Kashmiri students pursuing various professional courses in PAK approached the Indian High Commission in Islamabad in Pakistan for attestation.



The Indian High Commission alerted India’s Ministry of External Affairs, which in turn discussed the issue with AICTE and decided to issue an advisory in this regard.



“The Ministry of External Affairs and AICTE have discussed the cases of 25 students. It is requested to advise students studying in AICTE-approved institutions, state government technical colleges and polytechnic colleges not to take admissions in PAK institutions of education,” the official communication reads.



Although there are no concrete figures on how many Indian Kashmiri students are pursuing an education in PAK, the government felt there was an upward trend in such admissions. The PAK government has reserved 6% of medical seats in its medical colleges for IAK students, spooking the Indian government.



After the 14 February car bombing in which more than 40 Indian forces personnel were killed in Kashmir and which India blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, there has been a steady decline in relations between the two countries. The current advisory comes three weeks after India suspended the intra-Kashmir trade between the two sides of Kashmir.



Widespread condemnation



The advisory to Kashmiri students has stoked widespread condemnation both in political and academic circles.



The Private Schools Association of Jammu and Kashmir (PSAJK), the largest group of private education institutions in IAK and whose many pass outs have taken admission in PAK institutions, said the move would have serious repercussions in the long run, besides impacting the education of hundreds of students.



“The SAARC [South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation] group and all associated agreements have been honoured through many decades even in hostile conditions, including war. The sudden barring of educational institutions in PAK is beyond comprehension,” GN Var, chairman of PSAJK, told reporters.



"It negates the basic principle of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, where India and Pakistan are both signatories.”



Separatist leader and chief cleric of IAK, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, criticised the advisory, calling it an “unreasonable diktat”. He said it was an unfortunate politicisation of education, which violates the fundamental right of students to seek education anywhere on the globe.



In addition, it had put the careers of those studying there in “jeopardy and uncertainty”, he said in a statement.
