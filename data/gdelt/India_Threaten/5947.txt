Korba, April 16

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday slammed Rahul Gandhi for calling “all Modis” thieves, adding such a language did not behove the Congress chief.

Such type of language did not behove the Congress leader, Modi said, addressing a poll rally here in Chhattisgarh.

“I have a question. Why all the thieves have Modi in their names, whether it be Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Narendra Modi? We don’t know how many more such Modis will come out,” Gandhi had said, targeting the PM over alleged corruption.

“Is this the language to be used?” Modi said, targeting Gandhi.

Modi also accused the Congress of being “hand in glove with not only Naxals but also with those who want to break India”.

The Congress poll manifesto would give an open licence to those who misguided peaceful tribals in forests, Modi said referring to Naxals.

The Congress’ panja (palm) wanted our armed forces to be stripped of their special powers and weaken them, Modi said.

“Will you allow the Congress to compromise on national security?” Modi asked.

The Congress’s poll promise to strip the army of special powers had led to celebration among those forces who are engaged in spreading violence, Modi said.

“Does the Congress ‘hand’ favour development or destruction?” he asked.

The PM exuded the confidence that there would be ‘Modi sarkar’ once again after the poll results. PTI
