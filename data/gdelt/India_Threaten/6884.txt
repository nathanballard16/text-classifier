NLS anti-ragging squad suspends student for ‘major misconduct’ against junior two years ago

NLS anti-ragging squad suspends senior student for a trimester (though question of appeals process remains)

The NLSIU Bangalore Anti Ragging Squad Committee has upheld a complaint made about ‘major misconduct’ of ragging in 2017-18 by a senior student against a junior student of the law school.

The registrar accepted the committee’s finding and procedure as “in accordance with the rules” and affirmed a one-trimester suspension from classes and academic privileges, and a one-trimester expulsion from hostels.

Repeated misconduct “may end up in removal” from NLS, the order warned the senior student.

One issue with the registrar’s order, however, is that in the post-script it states that the “vice-chancellor is the appellate authority”, which prima facie seems to go against the mandatory UGC regulations that require the chancellor as the appellate authority, stipulating:

“9. Administrative action in the event of ragging: 9.1. c) An appeal against the order of punishment by the Anti-Ragging Committee shall lie, i. in case of an order of an institution, affiliated to or constituent part, of a University, to the Vice-Chancellor of the University; ii. in case of an order of a University, to its Chancellor.”

We have reached out to vice-chancellor Prof Venkata Rao for comment.

We understand that the university is currently considering the applicable legal provisions.

In 2018, an anonymous blog raised the point that ragging still persisted at institutions such as NLS under the guise of “positive interaction”.

The continuing existence of ragging is, of course, not just a phenomenon at NLS or national law schools (though a residential campus can no doubt exacerbate ragging issues).

In 2017, NLIU had banned 6 ragging suspects from hostels and NLU Jodhpur had suspended three students for one year for ragging.
