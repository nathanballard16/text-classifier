SC directs Bengal to ensure unimpeded screening of film

The Supreme Court on Friday directed the West Bengal government to ensure that no obstruction or restraint of any kind was imposed on the public viewing of the film ‘Bhobishyoter Bhoot’ in local theatres.

A Bench of Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice Hemant Gupta also directed the State’s Chief Secretary, Principal Secretary Department of Home and West Bengal’s Director General of Police to ensure that adequate security arrangements were made to facilitate the screening of the film.

The State government must also ensure that the audience was not endangered and that there was no danger to the property of the theatres where the film was being or would be screened, the court ruled.

The order came after the producers of the political satire moved the apex court contending that the State government was “obstructing the film from being exhibited in the cinema halls of Kolkata in a highly back-handed and arbitrary manner”.
