The Mormugao Port Trust on Friday informed the High Court of Bombay at Goa that there is an imminent danger as regards breaking of the bottom of tanker ship ‘MV Nu-Shi Nalini’ grounded off the Marivel Beach at Dona Paula.

The MPT also informed the HC that it is in talks with various salvors and will appoint someone very soon to undertake salvage operation of the vessel carrying huge quantity of naphtha.

At the hearing in the matter, the MPT counsel also informed the court that there is an imminent danger of this ship’s bottom breaking as also over 2,000 tonne of naphtha onboard together with diesel and heavy oil leaking into the sea and endangering marine life.

The commercial admiralty suit has been listed for direction on December 12, 2019.

The company representative told the court that they have filed a bond with the MPT indemnifying the port against any claim or damages arising out of any accident involving or connected to the grounded ship, and also to reimburse all expenses and remuneration for salvage.

The High Court is hearing the suit challenging the refusal of customs to allow removal of the cargo – naphtha and slush oil – from the ship, when she was anchored at the MPT breakwater berth, on the grounds that the ship was under arrest.

The contention of the company is that though the ship was under arrest, the cargo inside is not and therefore, could have been removed.

Last month, the unmanned naphtha-laden chemical tanker anchored off the Mormugao port came adrift due to strong cyclonic winds and ran aground on sand and rock, a few hundred metres from the Dona Paula coast.

A first information report was filed by the harbour coastal police in Vasco against the vessel owners for negligence and endangering public safety, under provisions of the IPC, with police investigation already under way,

‘Nu-Shi Nalini’ contains around 2,400 tonne of naphtha, 50 tonne of oil and 19 tonne of diesel.
