NEW DELHI: The bullishness on Dalal Street is hard to miss, with the Sensex hitting all-time highs on a daily basis and market commentaries turning in favour of the broader market. Be it economic reforms or thaw in US-China trade war, the market is cheering every positive development.And now with the earnings coming out better than expected, Dalal Street has one lesser thing to worry about. Even Moody's India outlook downgrade was met with a lukewarm reaction, with most Dalal Street veterans saying it was too late to raise the red flag.Sandip Sabharwal of asksandipsabharwal.com went as far as to term the Moody's downgrade a ‘ridiculous’.In a tweet, Basant Maheshwari, a PMS fund manager, hinted that economic revival is on the cards and the first one to sound the bugle is always the stock market. This, he says, is already visible in the euphoria being seen in the markets.Sabharwal says with the breakout in global markets, a big bounce in Indian stocks is likely soon.And that's not it, Sabharwal also laid to rest the doubts that lingered over the sustainability of this market rally.He also told fellow investors to remember to buy 'despair' and sell 'euphoria'.Value investor Ashish Chugh cautioned investors against leveraged stocks.Meanwhile, Abhishek Basumallick's stock advice was not to get fixated on P/E.Sabharwal believes the Finance Minister's Rs 25,000 crore realty booster will not only boost the infrastructure sector, but also generate jobs.
