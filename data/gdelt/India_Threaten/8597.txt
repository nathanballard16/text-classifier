odisha contractors association: Bhubaneswar: Contractors warn of stir over neglect

BHUBANESWAR: The All Odisha Contractors Association on Wednesday alleged that the state government prefers outside construction firms over Odisha contractors. They also warned the government of hitting the street over their eight-point charter of demands.The association president Pravat Dash said their contractor friends do not get work contracts from the government and face financial crisis. “The state government gave the contracts of 98 hospital buildings to an outside company instead of allotting it to 98 contractors separately. It would have created employment for several people,” said Dash.He said the government has set a cut off rate of 14.99 per cent of the total estimation of a project for bidding. That means a contractor cannot bid less than 85.01 per cent estimated cost of the project. “But we have seen several people bid for the project with 14.99 per cent cut off rate and government applies lottery system to choose a contractor. Better this cut off rate set by the government in 2014 should be withdrawn for the interest of Odisha contractors,” said Dash.Anil Kumar Mahalik, vice president of the association, said the lowest bidding impact the standard of the work done by the contractors. “So this rate should be revised for the 50,000 contractors in the state. If the state government does not solve our issues, we will hit the street,” he added.Works minister Prafulla Kumar Mallik said he has forwarded the memorandum of the association to the department secretary for review on their demands. “Not all contractors belong to this association. But I will look into the matter,” he added.
