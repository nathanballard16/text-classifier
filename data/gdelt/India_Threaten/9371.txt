CHENNAI: The Arignar Anna Zoological Park in Vandalur, Chennai is a popular tourist and sight-seeing destination in Tamil Nadu. The park is supposed to be the biggest in India and South East Asia in terms of total land area and also the number of endangered animals that the park shelters within its premises.

The Central Zoo Authority of India has recognized the park as a Centre of excellence, with 171 species of animals, 2,644 animals, and an area spanning 602 hectares, receiving over 20 lakh footfalls every year.

In an attempt to house a pair of King Cobras commonly found in the Western ghats, the park authorities took efforts and with the consent and support of the Central Zoo Authority of India, brought a pair of King Cobras from Pilikula Zoological Park in Karnataka in exchange for two wild gaurs.

The reptiles are housed in their enclosure and arrangements have been made for visitors to watch them. The enclosure is set to replicate the reptiles’ natural habitat with bamboo sprouts, sand and two large pots.

A small stream also forms part of the enclosure. Other shrubs are also planted in the enclosure. Visitors can now watch the reptiles in close range standing behind a glass barricade without disturbing the reptiles.
