Punjab CM Capt Amarinder Singh snubs Pak minister over provocative tweet

Reacting strongly to the highly provocative tweet by Pakistan minister Fawad Chaudhary, inciting mutiny among Punjabis in the Indian army, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday asked Pakistan to mind their own business & keep out of India’s internal matters.

Kashmir is and will remain an integral part of India, he said
