I was made to shift from Unnao jail to Rae Bareli jail despite writing a detailed letter of his family members under life threat from MLA to the senior jail authorities,” he said.He has also categorically stated in his FIR to the police that discussion between him and his wife during latter’s last visit to the jail was overheard by security personnel and later passed on to aides of Sengar. Hence, they planned the attack and as a result the private security personnel also did not accompany my family members.“I am sure that aides of Sengar have a direct connection with the owner and driver of the truck and were directed by former to attack my family members,” he said.Unnao SP Sunil Kumar Singh told TOI that all the allegations raised by the survivor’s uncle in the FIR will be probed.
