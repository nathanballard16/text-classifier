Better supply to tame onion prices soon, say ministers

NEW DELHI: Amid skyrocketing onion prices , agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Tuesday assured that improved supply chain through NAFED would calm down prices in a few days while consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan warned against hoarding and said the government would keep open the option of imposing stock limits in such a situation.Paswan said the government will "wait and watch" for the next four to five days before taking any decision on imposing stock limit for onion. "We have a buffer stock of 50,000 tonnes. There is no dearth of onion. We will also consider imposing stock limit if prices do not moderate on account of speculative behaviour of traders," he said.The two ministers admitted that the government needed to do the balancing act. Meanwhile, the average wholesale price of onions at the Lasalgaon APMC- the country's largest wholesale onion market - dropped on Monday and Tuesday.
