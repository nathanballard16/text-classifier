TRS will campaign against Chandrababu Rule: Talasani

Hyderabad: TRS MLA Talasani Srinivas Yadav today said his party will campaign against Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu for miserably failing to develop the State and misusing funds for publicity. The TRS party will launch campaign against the TDP supremo in the forthcoming elections.

Speaking at the Assembly Media point on the first day of the Assembly session here today, Talasani Srinivas Yadav accused Nara Chandrababu of failing miserably to develop residuary Andhra Pradesh State. The TRS with NTR fans and followers are ready to intensify a campaign against Naidu’s rule in Andhra Pradesh, he declared. He also alleged that Naidu was resorting to mud-slinging on the TRS leadership, especially against Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao.

“We are not against the development of the Andhra Pradesh but Naidu’s remarks in this regard are totally wrong”, he said. He pointed out that Naidu’s comments after a meeting of TRS working president KT Rama Rao and YSRCP Chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy on federal front are only to defame the two parties. The NTR fans and followers and the TRS will go to AP people to join hands against Chandrababu rule, he added.

The TRS leader also said though the AP State was facing revenue deficit, Chandrababu was squandering public money in the name of Nava Nirmana Deeksha and people will teach him a lesson in future elections. “We will go to the AP people courageously and seek their support for campaigning against the TD rule, he added. Yadav also made it clear that the TRS leaders are not afraid of Chandrababu’s threats.
