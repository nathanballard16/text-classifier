Ravi Shankar Prasad warns Pakistan over terror

“Article 370 was used as a platform for terrorists and the government has rightly removed it,” the Union minister said.

Nagpur: Union minister for law and judiciary, Ravi Shankar Prasad on Saturday asserted that India will respond immediately and give a befitting reply to Pakistan if it does any misadventure in the aftermath of the scrapping of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, which granted the region autonomy.

India is well prepared to protect its territory and if Pakistan carries out any terror strike, it will be given prompt and appropriate response, Mr Prasad told reporters in Nagpur.

Reiterating that abrogation of Article 370 was taken in the best interest of the country and will be beneficial for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, the Union minister said it was unfortunate that important laws like Prevention of Child Marriage Act were not applicable there.

“Article 370 was used as a platform for terrorists and the government has rightly removed it,” the Union minister said.

On reviewing India’s no-first-use nuclear policy, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said the country was in state of readiness to thwart any attack from the enemy. He however refused to comment on Pakistan prime minister Imran Khan’s veiled threat of a war with India. “The efforts to revive militancy by our neighbour would be strictly dealt with. India is well prepared to meet any exigency,” Mr Prasad, also a Patna MP, said.
