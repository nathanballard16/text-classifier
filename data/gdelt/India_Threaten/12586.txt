PUSU, SOI, ISA, HIMSU form alliance

Tribune News ServiceChandigarh, August 31With only five more days to Panjab University Campus Student Council (PUCSC) elections, many alliances have sprung up. Today, Student Organisation of India (SOI) pledged alliance with three other parties, including PUSU (Panjab University Student Union), ISA (Indian Students’ Association) and Himsu (Himachal Pradesh Students’ Union). The new alliance will now fight the elections from all four posts, including president, secretary, joint secretary and vice-president. “We won’t like to align with any party simply because there has not been any decision of that sort from the top authorities so far. We will welcome any party that would like to support us, since we are fighting from all four posts, but there’s not much possibility of an alliance,” said Nikhil.
