Pakistan terms Pulwama terror attack ‘incident’, shares information with India

A month after a deadly terror attack on security personnel in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, Pakistan on Wednesday refused to call Pulwama attack ‘a terror attack.’ Pakistan has shared preliminary findings on the Pulwama terror attack with India. In a press release, Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry said it has shared the findings with India of the February 14 attack, "after examining the Indian report on Pulwama incident".



Notably, Pakistan’s press statement calls the Pulwama terror attack "an incident" and not a terror attack. At least 40 Paramilitary soldiers were killed in the Pulwama terror attack on February 14. This was the deadliest terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir in the past 30 years.

Pakistan's statement today read: "The Government of Pakistan has shared preliminary findings with the Government of India after examining the Indian report on Pulwama incident."

"The Indian High Commissioner in Islamabad was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs by the Foreign Secretary and the findings on the Pulwama incident were shared with him."

In the statement, Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had "offered cooperation in the investigation if credible evidence was provided by India".

The Pakistan Foreign Ministry statement said that in response to Imran Khan's offer, India handed over a paper to Pakistan on February 27, 2019.

"Pakistan has acted with a high sense of responsibility and extended full cooperation. We do so in the interest of regional peace and security. We have sought further information/evidence from India to take the process forward," it said.
