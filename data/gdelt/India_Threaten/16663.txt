?

Are these polls a fight between Congress and BJP or between Congress and the disqualified MLAs?

BENGALURU: With its prestige at stake, the Congress is not only under intense pressure to win maximum seats, but also ensure the defeat the 13 “betrayers”, who toppled the JD(S)-Congress coalition government and are now contesting on BJP tickets. In an interview with TOI, KPCC president Dinesh Gundurao said the byelections are more a personal fight between the Congress and the disqualified legislators. Excerpts.The Congress is certain to win at least 12 seats. The country is witnessing an anti-BJP wave and people are fed-up with the BJP’s horse-trading and the way they engineer defections.The Maharashtra drama has exposed BJP’s dark side. It will definitely have an impact.The defeat of the 13 turncoats will send out a message that the BJP’s unethical attempts to buy MLAs and topple governments will not be accepted. It will also send a message that those who betray their parties will not be accepted by the people.While on paper the fight will definitely be one between the Congress and the BJP, in reality it is a personal fight between the party and the betrayers. The manner in which the disqualified legislators backstabbed the Congress and its leaders, having been so close to the hierarchy and considered part of the inner circle, will make the fight personal. It is surely going to be the same at the ground-level where leaders betrayed our workers.
