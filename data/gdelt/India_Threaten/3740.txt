RRR: After Ram Charan, Jr NTR’s role from SS Rajamouli's upcoming film REVEALED?

Baahubali director SS Rajamouli has geared up for the shooting of his next big-budget film, RRR starring Ram Charan and Jr NTR. It is one of the films that moviegoers definitely can't wait for. The makers of RRR wrapped up the first schedule of the film in December and have geared up for the second which has high octane action sequences by Ram Charan. The actor will be seen fighting with 1,000 men. On the other hand, there is a lot of curiosity to know about Jr NTR's role.

According to a report in Times of India, Jr NTR will be seen playing a forest brigand in RRR. In order to get into the skin of his character, the actor is sweating it out in the gym to get the desired look. The Baahubali director SS Rajamouli recently attended Harvard India Conference 2019 where he spoke about his upcoming film. He revealed, "RRR is a pan-Indian film because the nature of the story is like that." The director didn't reveal much about the film but assured it is going to be a huge surprise for the audiences.

RRR is set in the pre-independence era with Jr NTR in the role of a bandit and Ram Charan as a cop. The makers of the film are yet to confirm the lead actresses, but recently, Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt were rumoured to play the female roles in the film. The crew that has worked for Baahubali is going to work for this film as well. If everything goes as planned, RRR is expected to etch new dynamics in the Indian cinema.
