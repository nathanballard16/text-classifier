Bains mastermind of CLU scam conspiracy, everyone knows about his love story with Sidhu: Karwal

LUDHIANA: Congress leader Kamaljit Singh Karwal, who has been named in the Ludhiana CLU scam along with cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu and accused of helping a builder obtain CLU illegally, has now claimed that local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on whose orders enquiry was conducted into this case has fallen into trap of Lok Insaaf Party MLA Simarjit Singh Bains as Sidhu is acting on his instructions. Karwal also warned Sidhu that his career will be destroyed if he continues falling for the dirty tricks of Bains.Speaking to TOI over the issue, Karwal said, "There is no doubt that it is a well thought conspiracy and the mastermind of this entire evil plan is MLA Simarjit Singh Bains at whose behest this entire script has been written. It is unfortunate that cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu is doing everything as Bains says. He thinks that in entire Punjab, he himself is the most honest person and second most honest is Simarjit Singh Bains, rest all are “Chor” (thieves). Sidhu should not forget that the “chor” Bains to whom Sidhu gives certificate of honesty, is the one who has become owner of Rs 1000 crores in last 10 years."Karwal also added, "Everyone knows about the love story between Sidhu and Bains. This entire CLU scam story has been cooked by Bains. Sidhu is helping Bains to achieve his political motives by being part of this. Moreover, if Sidhu claims that no one is as honest as him, I challenge him to face any kind of test of honesty against me, he will definetly lose it. I urge Sidhu to stop playing politics on this issue."
