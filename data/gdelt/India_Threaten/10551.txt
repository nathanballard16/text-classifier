General Bipin Rawat cautioned Pakistan as India staged nationwide ceremonies for the anniversary of the end of the three-month Kargil conflict

India's army chief warned Pakistan on Friday that it would get a "bloodied nose" if there was a repeat of a bloody battle which took place 20 years ago.

Amidst renewed tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, General Bipin Rawat cautioned Pakistan as India staged nationwide ceremonies for the anniversary of the end of the three-month Kargil conflict.

Today on 'Kargil Vijay Divas' 20th anniversary the Grateful Nation salutes our Brave Armed forces & pays homage to the Martyred Brave sons of Mother India.

About 1,000 Indian and Pakistani soldiers died in the battle which has gone down in history as the world's highest.

In May 1999, Pakistani troops and rebels crossed the disputed Kashmir border and seized Indian military posts in the Kargil mountains vacated during winter months because of the intense cold at 18,000 feet.

Indian troops eventually pushed the Pakistan military back. The Indian military has held ceremonies every July 26 since.

"This [Kargil] was a misadventure. Misadventures should not be repeated. You will get a bloodied nose next time," Rawat said referring to Pakistan at a media briefing in Indian Kashmir.
