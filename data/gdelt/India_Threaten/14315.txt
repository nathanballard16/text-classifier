TSRTC strike latest news (Hyderabad): The Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) employees will go on indefinite strike from October 5 (Saturday) to press for their demands.

As per the Joint Action Committee (JAC) of several employee unions, the decision to go on strike was taken due to the "unhelpful attitude" of the Telangana government in resolving the unsettled matter even after being given the strike notice.

The unions allege representing around one lakh employees, half of them working on a contract basis.

Notably, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) officials are trying to hire private bus owners and drivers, so that the common man does not face any difficulties in travelling. The Telangana government has, meanwhile, threatened to invoke the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) against the RTC staff, if they go ahead with the strike tomorrow.

JAC leader Ashwathama Reddy has asked the employees not to be scared by the government's threats to invoke ESMA. "ESMA and PD Act (Preventive Detention Act) are not new for RTC employees," he said.
