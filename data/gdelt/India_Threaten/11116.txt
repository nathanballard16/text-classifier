DGP claims Valley is peaceful; communication lines still down

Srinagar, August 6

Even as J&K DGP Dilbagh Singh on Tuesday asserted that not even a single incident of violence had been reported from Kashmir, the communication blackout in the Valley entered its second day after the government snapped television, telephone and internet links to deter protests over its scrapping of special constitutional status for the state.

The state police chief was quoted by IANS as saying that the situation was totally peaceful.

The Centre on Monday had revoked Article 370 that gave the special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Earlier, the authorities in Kashmir clamped an unprecedented communications blackout on the region, and arrested its leaders, including two former state chief ministers.

Shah Faesal, the leader of the Jammu and Kashmir People's Movement, claimed that a backlash against New Delhi's decision was imminent as many in the region saw the move as a breach of trust. "We might see an eruption when the guard is down," he told Reuters.

"People are taking it as an act of humiliation."

Despite assertion by the DGP, Reuters, quoting an unidentified police officer, reported that security forces fired teargas and pellets in response to sporadic protests in Srinagar on Monday. "There was stone-pelting in some parts of the city," he added.

Tension had risen in Kashmir since Friday, when officials warned of possible militant attacks by Pakistan-based groups.

In Srinagar, armed police were stationed every few hundred metres as a ban on gathering of more than four people in public places continued on Tuesday. Educational institutes and most shops in residential neighbourhoods were shut.

Some shopkeepers said they were running out of stock after days of panic buying.

"No provisions are left in my shop, and no fresh supplies are coming," said grocery store owner Jehangir Ahmad.
