Death of 3 GNDEC students leaves parents shattered

The deceased were identified as Anshuman, Vipul Pandey and Shankar Yadav, all students of Guru Nanak Engineering College (GNDEC), Ludhiana. None of the deceased was wearing helmet at the time of the accident. Sanjiv Sharma, an alumnus of the Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDEC), regretted that the authorities of various professional colleges and law enforcing agencies had been shying away from responsibility of cautioning youths and students in particular against unsafe driving. “Unfortunately we have failed to make our wards understand the significance of following practices to protect vital parts of our body,” said Sharma while appreciating that many students had started wearing helmets while riding two-wheelers. Acknowledging the tendency Manpreet Singh, warden at the GNDEC, said the victims could have survived had they worn helmets.
