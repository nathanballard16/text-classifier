DNA Edit: Corrupt vs Clean - The Robert Vadra baggage can sink the Congress

With Priyanka Gandhi Vadra entering the fray of electoral politics can husband Robert Vadra be far behind? In the high-stakes game for power, he will face intense heat.

The BJP has already accused him of routing kickbacks in petroleum and defence deals during the previous UPA government. Vadra, it is alleged, has bought a number of properties — including assets in London believed to be worth 12 million pounds and were bought between 2005 and 2010 — using kickbacks from defence deals.

Priyanka, like the devoted wife, has promised to stand by her husband as the Enforcement Directorate subjected him to long hours of questioning for the second consecutive day. In the 2019 elections, the narrative might revolve around “corrupt” and “honest” governments with the Congress being the obvious target.

Clearly, the Congress will leave no stone unturned to bolster Vadra’s defence because the grand old party cannot survive without the Gandhi family’s blessings. Vadra’s dubious deals have been under the scanner for some years now but it is only with Priyanka’s appointment as Congress general secretary for eastern Uttar Pradesh that corruption cases against him have got a new lease of life.

Varanasi in eastern UP is Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Lok Sabha constitutency. UP’s importance in India’s electoral politics cannot be overstated: It sends 80 MPs to Parliament in a general election. Vadra’s presence endangers Congress’s prospects.

Rahul Gandhi might feel confident after a string of Assembly wins, but his party is pitted against a tough adversary, Narendra Modi’s BJP. All said, PM Modi’s public stature and clean image is a huge draw for voters. In terms of popularity, he is way ahead of others. At such a critical time, the baggage of Vadra can sink the Congress party. Those who thought that getting Priyanka back into active politics was a masterstroke couldn’t have been more wrong.
