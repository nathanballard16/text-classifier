Indians in Berlin carried out their protest in front of the Brandenburg Gate from 11 am to 1 pm local time in Germany. They held a peaceful protest holding up banners written ‘Stop Police Brutality’, ‘Religion as the basis of citizenship: Where have you seen this before?’ and ‘Indian students of Berlin: We stand by all students of India’ etc.

The statement by the protesters expressed solidarity with the ‘brave students across India’ protesting against the CAA. It condemned ‘the violent suppression’ of the protests, ‘particularly by the Delhi Police in the Jamia Millia Islamiya and by the UP Police in the Aligarh Muslim University’. “Along with these brave students, we reject the unconstitutional and discriminatory use of religion as a basis for citizenship in the Citizenship Amendment Act and call upon the government to withdraw this illegitimate law, and initiate action against the police brutality,” the statement said.

The Indian community in the city is planning to hold another protest on Saturday (December 21, 2019) at the same place.
