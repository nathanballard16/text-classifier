Follow us on PM Narendra Modi

Before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, opposition parties have come together to defeat the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Efforts are being made to form a grand alliance, but will these bore any fruit? To know the answer to this question, India TV analysed the result of 2014 general polls.

According to the Election Commission of India (ECI) date, in 2014 LS polls, there were 137 seats where the BJP candidates bagged more than five lakh votes.

Most of these seats were in Gujarat (23), Maharashtra (21), Uttar Pradesh (21), Rajasthan (19), Madhya Pradesh (17) Karnataka (14) Chhattisgarh (7), Haryana (4), Delhi (4), Assam-Andhra (2-2) and in J&K, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand (1-1-1).

In case this happens again in 2019, the grand alliance will be able to give a tough fight to the BJP, but it will not be easy for the alliance to defeat the BJP candidates.
