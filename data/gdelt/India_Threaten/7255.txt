With Narendra Modi’s high re-election prospects, is India’s very identity at stake?

-

Around 900 million voters across India have availed an opportunity to decide the future of their Country, which has already been marred by hardcore Hinduism, jingoism, corruption, and barbarism in the disputed Kashmir territory.

Labeled as the World’s biggest democracy, India has been going through an electoral process since April 11, which will culminate on May 19 following the accomplishment of seven polling phases.

The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi – a Candidate of Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) – is eyeing another five-year term in the Office.

Battling with a comparatively week and disarrayed opposition, Modi’s prospects as a consecutive second-time victorious are not dimmed.

However, as the May 20th Edition of Time Magazine (Asia Edition), an iconic US-based weekly news magazine, has also cautioned about which shape India will be in if Narendra Modi steals the show again?

Titling Modi as “India’s Divider In Chief”, Time Magazine featured an article with a question “Can the World’s Largest Democracy Endure Another Five Years of a Modi Government?” by a novelist and journalist Aatish Taseer.

The five-year term of Narendra Modi as India’s 14th Prime Minister (May 26, 2014 – upto date) has already badly contaminated India’s image worldwide as a secular, liberal, and a democratic Country.

Beginning from a series of rape incidents to corruption charges, religious extremism, lynching of Muslims & Christians, genocide of innocent Kashmiris, jingoism against neighboring Pakistan, and a constant skirmish at its western border, India under Modi has already been brought on the verge of an ethnic-nationalist divides.

It is worth noting that the election manifesto of BJP, the India’s ruling party, has also already stirred an uproar in terms of its promises of altering the Kashmir status, in addition to BJP leadership’s anti-Muslims rhetoric.
