9 Important Real Life Symbolisms Of The Nav Durga Avatar & Why We Must Emulate Them

"Ma Ashche, Dhak bajjche, Ghor shajjche!"

The scent of autumn lingering in air, people hustling to get ready for pujo with last minute shopping, and streets decorated with pandals and fairy lights. These five days of celebration are equally enjoyed by people all over the country, regardless of their faith.

The festivities actually start with Mahalaya, the day people believe Maa Durga descends on Earth. Mahalaya is scheduled on September 28 this year, and whether you're a Bengali or friends with a Bengali, Durga Puja is probably one of the most fascinating festivals.

The word Durga, from the root word 'durgam', itself means fearlessness. To be able to face each adversity, however big or small it may be, it makes us who we are. Durga Maa, with her eight hands, epitomizes the word 'multi-tasking’ and it celebrates each and every woman who is a Durga in her own right. Goddess Durga comes to us in nine different avatars (forms) on the nine days of Navratri, and each and every form is in all of us. It defines our everyday lives and celebrates our trials, tribulations and joys, as humans.

Each day is dedicated to Maa Durga's avatars - a sight that that will truly humble you with her grace and presence! Entire cities have people enjoying togetherness and paying obeisance to the goddess who embodies everything from a demon slayer to nourishing mother.

Navratri has something for each one of us and qualities and attributes from each Nav Durga avatar resonate in all our lives. The killings of Chanda-Munda, Shumbh-Nishumbh, Madhu-Kaitabh, Raktabeej or Mahishasur, by Maa Durga teach us that evil will, at times, cross our path, but it’s up to us to fight it and never give up.
