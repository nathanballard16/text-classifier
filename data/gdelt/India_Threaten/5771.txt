PMO calls urgent meeting on cash-strapped Jet Airways; all international flights cancelled till Monday

The private airline on Friday also announced a total suspension of its international flights till Monday. According to government norms, an airline must have a minimum of 20 planes for operating international operations.

The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) on Friday called for an urgent meeting to review the ongoing crisis in the private debt-laden Jet Airways. According to news agency PTI, the meeting has been called after Civil Aviation Minister Suresh Prabhu asked the secretary of the department to review issues concerning Jet Airways. The crisis-hit private air carrier is facing severe financial crunch and has grounded several of its flights and stopped all international operations lately. The reduction in operation was announced after the airline informed the exchanges that it was forced to ground 10 more planes due to non-payment of rentals to the lessors. Reports also suggest that Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) and the Civil Aviation Secretary called for an urgent meeting on Jet Airways with Nripendra Mishra who is the Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Earlier in the day, Prabhu took to Twitter and wrote: “Directed Secretary MoCA to review issues related to Jet Airways. Asked him to take necessary steps to minimise passenger inconvenience and ensure their safety.”
