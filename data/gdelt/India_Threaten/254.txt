Government to hold review meet Tuesday on A320 Neo aircraft

New Delhi: The Central government would hold a meeting with the stakeholders, including IndiGo, engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney (P&W) and aircraft maker Airbus, Tuesday, following safety-related incidents with Airbus A320 Neo aircraft, powered by P&W, an official source said.

The government has taken serious note of the incidents and would review the issues in the upcoming meeting, the source said Sunday.

On Thursday, budget airline IndiGo’s Kolkata-bound flight had to return to Chennai, and the airline said that it was the result of “technical caution” noted by the crew.

“The crew followed the normal operating procedures and asked for a priority landing. There was no engine shutdown and no emergency landing was declared,” the airline said in a statement Saturday.
