Government to probe anti-CAA violence in Mangaluru: BS Yediyurappa

MANGALURU: Chief minister BS Yediyurappa said here on Saturday the state government will order an investigation into the violence that erupted in Mangaluru on Thursday during Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests, which claimed two lives.While the nature of investigation will be decided in conjunction with home minister Basavaraj Bommai, Yediyurappa said he has directed deputy commissioner Sindhu Rupesh to provide compensation to families of victims.No one is happy with the way incidents occurred on Thursday, the CM told media after reviewing the law and order situation in the city with senior police and district administration officials. Yediyurappa also held talks with representatives of various religious communities and family members of victims.The chief minister said police were compelled to use force on Thursday to deter the surging crowds. “They tried to storm a police station,” he said. Asserting that protesters could have caused mayhem had they managed to gain access to the police station armoury, the CM said he met families of victims to gain a sense of the problems they face following the incident.After spending nearly 30 minutes with the families, Yediyurappa said there are official discussions to provide them with houses if the situation warranted it.Curfew will be relaxed for the entire day on Sunday. From Monday, curfew will be lifted fully, but prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC will continue, the CM said. The decision has been taken keeping in mind representations made by religious leaders, he said.To a question on detention of journalists from Kerala, and alleged police failure to anticipate and tackle the violence as well as perceived police excesses at a hospital, he said all these allegations will be probed.Yediyurappa brushed aside a tweet where former chief minister Siddaramaiah had said the violence was state sponsored. “A person of Siddaramaiah’s stature must weigh his words rather than make such remarks,” he said.
