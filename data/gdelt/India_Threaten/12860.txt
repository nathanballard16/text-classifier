If attacked, India will give a reply that aggressor won’t forget, says Vice President Venkaiah Naidu

Without taking name of any nation, Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu, on Friday, said, “In spite of grave provocations, you must be seeing in the recent past, we are not doing anything, but if somebody attacks, we will give a reply to them which they will not be able to forget for the rest of their lives.”

The statement comes as a veiled warning to Pakistan, in which he further added that this should be understood by everyone. While launching a compilation of 95 speeches delivered by President Mr. Ram Nath Kovind during his second year in office, Mr. Naidu advanced the statements.

India has been acting with great restraint, even amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan after the Centre abrogated Article 370 from Jammu and Kashmir that granted special status to the state.
