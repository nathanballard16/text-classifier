How long will India, Pakistan continue to fight: Mehbooba Mufti

Jammu: Advocating the opening of all the historical routes for the external world, former CM of J&K and PDP President, Ms. Mehbooba Mufti told that India and Pakistan should negotiate with each other. She asked the question, “How long will India and Pakistan continue to fight?”

When Muzaffarabad and other routes were opened, why can’t they open similar routes? ‘How long the bloodshed would continue’, she asked.

She further said that if there is an infiltration, there should be a talk on it.
