Urban schools will fail if disruptive students remain

My brother, a certified teacher in South Carolina, has taught at least 5,000 students. He found that at the low-performing schools, there are usually three ringleaders and up to five students behaving terribly who settle down if the ringleaders are taken to task; there are zero to one misbehaving students in the middle-of-the road schools, and in the high-performing schools, none.
