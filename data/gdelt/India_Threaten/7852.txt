5 gau rakshaks bash up 3 in MP over beef rumour, held

BHOPAL: Madhya Pradesh police have arrested five gau rakshaks (cow vigilantes) from Seoni district after a viral video showed them mercilessly beating three persons, including a woman, over suspicion of carrying beef.The video also showed the attackers forcing one of the victims to beat the woman with a sandal while saying ‘Jai Shri Ram’.The vigilantism took place on May 22, a day before counting of Lok Sabha votes, but videos of it went viral a couple of days later, triggering nationwide outrage.The arrested gau rakshaks have been identified as Shubham Singh, Yogesh Uikey, Deepesh Namdev, Rohit Yadav and Shyam Dehriya. Shubham calls himself a member of Shri Ram Sena and his social media page has a photograph of him standing next to Pragya Thakur, the recently elected Bhopal MP.The cow vigilantes could be seen caning the two men so brutally that the sticks broke. The victims kept wailing and begging for mercy, but the attackers stomped on their face and head, kicked them about and caned them relentlessly.Madhya Pradesh home minister Bala Bachchan has warned of strong action against people “taking law in their hands”. DGP VK Singh has termed the assault as “a disturbing one”.On May 22, Shubham and his group of vigilantes had hauled Taufik, Anjum Shama and Dilip Malviya to Seoni police station, alleging that the trio was carrying beef in an auto-rickshaw and a two-wheeler from Khairi village. The cops booked them under Anti-Cow Slaughter Act and they were remanded in jail custody.“The trio didn’t tell us that they were beaten up. We charged them under Anti-Cow Slaughter Act, based on their confessional statements,” said Seoni SP Lalit Shakyawar, adding that the meat has been sent to a laboratory for testing.“The five were arrested soon after a relative of the victim filed a police complaint after the video went viral,” the SP added. Shubham was externed from Seoni for such assaults earlier and was living in Nagpur.In February this year, the order of his externment was cancelled. He and the four other vigilantes have been charged for rioting with a deadly weapon, voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful restraint and under Arms Act
