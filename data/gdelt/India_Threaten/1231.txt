3fold increase in UPrsquos volunteer base Youth Cong

Over 50,000 people associated with us within 10 days of Congress winning elections in three states.”Yadav took charge of Youth Congress nine months ago and launched various activities to reach out to youth across India. LUCKNOW: Claiming a three-fold increase in its membership in Uttar Pradesh, Indian Youth Congress national president Keshav Chand Yadav said that the grand old party would give BJP its toughest fight in UP.Speaking to TOI, Yadav said, “The Youth Congress membership stood at around 3 lakh in 2014. “We thought of presenting him the jhola because time for him to leave has come,” said IYC general secretary Srinivas. We have drawn a detailed plan to present Congress as an alternative.”Congress will focus on unemployment and crime against women in its campaign scheduled to be launched in February. But now, we have crossed 10 lakh mark in UP.”Asserting that the number defies claims that the grand old party had no base in the politically crucial state of UP, he said.
