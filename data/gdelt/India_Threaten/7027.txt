Manmohan didn’t allow armed forces for Pak strike: BJP

JAIPUR: HRD minister Prakash Javadekar made a startling claim that former PM Manmohan Singh refused armed forces to carry out surgical strike in Pakistan post 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.In a presser held at BJP head office in Jaipur on Saturday, Javadekar said, “Our armed forces sought permission from then PM Manmohan Singh to carry out a strike in response to the terrorist strike in Mumbai. Singh refused permission of any operation inside Pakistan. On a stark contrast, when Indian forces asked PM Narendra Modi for the same after Pulwama attack, they were granted permission.”Javadekar’s comment came in reaction to the Singh’s claim that during his tenure six surgical strikes were conducted in Pakistan. “When surgical trike is getting a good response, the Congress thought to claim it. But, their claim was exposed by the former chief of armed forces VK Singh who denied knowledge of any such surgical strikes,” said Javadekar, who is BJP Rajasthan election in charge. Supporting his claim, Javadekar said that they VK Singh was then chief of armed forces and any such operation without his knowledge cannot be possible. Singh was the chief of army staff from March 2010 to May 2012 while Manmohan tenured lasted from 2004 to 2014.Reacting on the Congress president Rahul Gandhi press conference in Delhi alleging BJP of diluting and attacking democratic institutions, Javadekar said, “Congress is known for peddling with lies. They should look back and see how they abused and misused institutions for personal gains.”He exuded confidence that BJP will repeat the success by winning all 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan. “We will maintain the track record of winning all 25 seats. We are winning 300 plus seats in the country,” said Javadekar who made the claim on the basis of his experience that ask any 10 people, 8 of them will tell you that Modi will become the PM.
