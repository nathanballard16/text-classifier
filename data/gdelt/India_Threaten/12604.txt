Pakistan is effectively highlighting Kashmir issue at all appropriate international forums:

Dr. Ashraf Toor (Chairman, Pak-American Democratic Forum):

PM Imran Khan is doing his part at all fora to effectively highlighting Indian atrocities in Occupied Kashmir. It is the responsibility of Muslims in entire world to highlight Indian policies in Held Kashmir. We Pakistani Americans are doing our part in this regard. We will be having a get together in Washington D.C on 2nd October where we will be highlighting Indian human rights violations in Held Kashmir. Despite of worst use of force by India, Kashmiris will definitely get freedom sooner than later. If India threats for a war, Pakistan is always ready to respond any Indian aggression in a befitting manner.
