BWSSB had dug up roads forand left without repairingAround 20 Resident Welfare Associations from Begur plan to take to the streets on August 18 to protest againstand no Cauvery water connection. Residents say repeated communications with Bruhatand Mahanagara Palike () andWater Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) have shown no progress in the area. Roads in Doddakammanahalli, Noble Residency Layout and Begur Koppa are in poor condition since two years now. They were dug up and left without being repaired after the Cauvery water connection work was undertaken by BWSSB. During monsoons, the low lying areas have flooded due to poor construction. The dug up stretch has also developed plenty of potholes due to which two-wheelers, especially, are at risk.K Prakash, president, Beautiful Begur federation says, “The roads in Begur have been dug up by the BWSSB for the Cauvery water pipeline work and has been abandoned after that since the past two years. The entire stretch floods during rains and is uneven and dusty during summers. The dust pollution has been affecting the elderly and the children. We have not even received a glass of Cauvery water to drink even though the work has been done. We are being denied basic amenities like water and roads. We pay around Rs 1000 for a water tanker, which comes once in three days. The quality of water is poor, but we cannot do anything since that is our only option. The area has become a death trap of sorts and we want to question our elected representatives.”Residents plan to march for two kilometres as a mark of protest asking for basic amenities in the area.
