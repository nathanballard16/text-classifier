Forest dept likely to clone endangered & rare trees in new lab

For cloning and tissue culture of Sagon trees, branches of trees that are fittest have been procured from Dewas district’s Sita Samadhi beat. As an experiment, team at Indore is developing clones of good quality Sagon trees and also Kadam and Paadar varieties. Indore: After successfully developing bamboo plants through tissue culture, forest department’s research and extension nursery at Khandwa road is now experimenting on developing rare and endangered trees (RET) species through tissue culture at their newly opened tissue culture lab. However, we are hopeful that Sagon trees will be successfully cloned,” Argal said. If conducted successfully, department will also use tissue culture method for cloning other RET species of trees, whose seeds are difficult to obtain from wild or are rare, endangered and threatened.
