EC warns Maneka Gandhi over her ‘ABCD’ formula

New Delhi: Dividing the villages into categories like ABCD based on vote share by Union Minister Maneka Gandhi did not go unnoticed by the EC.

The commission on Monday slammed Maneka Gandhi for driving the ABCD formula of dividing the villages under which the BJP party shall carry out the development works based on the vote bank the party would get from these villages, Indian Express reports.

Maneka was addressing an election rally in Sultanpur’s Pilibhit were she categorized the villages based on vote bank they receive from these villages.

Describing the categories, she said villages that fall under ‘A’ category are those where BJP gets more than 80 per cent votes, B with over 60 per cent, C with over 50 per cent and D with less than 50 per cent.

Warning Maneka against repeating such statements, the EC in its letter to Gandhi said that “Based on the available evidence and material facts in the matter before EC, hereby, strongly condemns the impugned statements made by her (on 14 April in Sultanpur’s Sarkoda village) and warns her not to repeat such misconduct in future.”

Earlier the commission had barred her from campaigning for two days following a controversial communal speech.
