Sansani: Slain rifleman Aurangzeb's brothers vow to take revenge from terrorists

Thirteen months after the abduction and killing of rifleman Aurangzeb by terrorists in South Kashmir's Shopian district, his two brothers have joined the Army to serve the nation and "avenge his death".

Mohmmad Tariq and Mohmmad Shabir joined the 156 Infantry Battalion of Territorial Army at a passing out parade at headquarters of the counter insurgency force 'Romeo' in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district Monday, a defence spokesman said.
