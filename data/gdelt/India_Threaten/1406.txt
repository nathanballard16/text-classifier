Deoband ulemas warn saints over Ayodhya march, say dont test patience of Muslims

Muzaffarnagar: Ulemas in Deoband have warned saints not to test the patience of Muslims over calls for a ‘dharma sansad’ in Muzaffarnagar followed by a march to Ayodhya to construct the Ram temple.“ Don't test the patience of Muslims. Don’t they believe in the Supreme Court?. Why is there a hurry?” he said.“If governments at the Centre and state do not take action against those responsible, we would understand that both the governments were helping them,” he said. We are peace loving and would respect the verdict of the apex court, but strict action should be taken against those trying to take laws in their hands,” said Deoband based ulema, Mufti Asad Qasmi on Thursday.He added that Muslims wanted peace and warned the Centre and the Uttar Pradesh government to take action against those who want to disturb the law and order situation.Questioning the timing and motive behind the march, he said that the sadhus were trying to disturb the law and order situation.He added that just like Muslims, other communities should accept whatever decision the Supreme Court of India takes on the Babri-Masjid, Ram Mandir issue.“I want to ask the ones who announced the march to Ayodhya.
