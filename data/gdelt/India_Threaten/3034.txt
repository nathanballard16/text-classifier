Tinkering will lead to disaster on unprecedented scale: Ex-CMs

SRINAGAR: Two former chief ministers of Jammu and Kashmir –– Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti ––have warned the Centre of dangerous consequences if Article 35A was tinkered with as it will raise questions on the state’s relationship with the country.The PDP and NC leaders vowed to fight to safeguard the special status of the state stating that scrapping Article 35A would bring unimaginable disasters and consequences, unprecedented since 1947.“I am not trying to threaten or scare the country, I am telling the truth, because it is my duty to warn you that your thought (to tamper with Article 35A is not right,” said Abdullah, while addressing party workers here. He said the situation in J&K would be worser than Arunachal Pradesh. Abdullah said the Government of India and J&K Governor should put their priority on conducting elections in the state rather than on deliberating on Article 35A.“There is no militancy or stone-pelting in Arunachal Pradesh but the state has been set on fire by fiddling with the Permanent Residence Certificate (PRC) issue…the situation has become so bad that people there have set fire to the house of the deputy chief minister. If you fiddle with Article 35A the situation will become worse in Kashmir,” Abdullah warned.He said the people should elect a single party to power so that the conspiracies to tamper with the special status enjoyed by the state would be fought effectively.People’s Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti said she was in touch with Abdullah and would want other regional parties to join hands to safeguard Article 35A or decide a strategy if it was tinkered with.
