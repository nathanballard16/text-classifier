Ambalal Sakarlal Desai - First Gujarati to obtain MA, LLB

VADODARA: Ambalal Sakarlal Desai , who had his roots in Alina village of Kheda district , was the first Gujarati to obtain MA as well as LLB degrees because of which he is also known as ‘Father of Gujarati Graduates’.He, in fact, attained this rare distinction at an early age of 23 years. But Ambalal who later moved to Ahmedabad opted not for practicing law but teaching as his profession. “He wanted the next generation to turn self-sufficient and self-respecting and he wanted to contribute to this end through teaching,” the study done by Kamini Rao, a PhD scholar who has studied Ambalal’s contributions in social, educational and economic development of Gujarat states.“Due to the nationalist activities of Ambalal and his articles and speeches for making general public aware, the British government issued a warning to him. Caring more for self-respect Ambalal who belonged to the proud caste of Brahmakshatriya, chose to leave the service of the British in retaliation rather than submit to the warning,” the study states.He then was appointed by Gaekwad of Vadodara as a judge in his state. Beginning his new career as a civil judge, Ambalal gradually reached the post of chief justice of Vadodara state.Ambalal had joined Vadodara judicial service from January 4, 1876 and between October 22, 1890 and July 31, 1899 he had served as chief justice. As chief justice, he was also head of the justice department.Interestingly, when he retired from service of Vadodara state due to age limit, he was offered the post of ‘Diwan’ by Maharaja Sayajirao III. But he declined this offer as he wanted to serve Ahmedabad, his own city, even more.
