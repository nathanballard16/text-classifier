Vodafone Idea promoters may subscribe to shares worth Rs 20,000 cr in rights issue, Telecom News, ET Telecom

NEW DELHI: Vodafone Idea Limited. (VIL) has said that its promoter shareholders -- Vodafone group and Aditya Birla Group-- will participate for an amount of up to Rs 20,000 crore in the Rights Issue, instead of the previously announced amount of up to Rs 18,250 crore.The company said in a filing to stock exchanges the promoters and promoter group reserve the right to subscribe to additional rights issue shares to meet any under subscription in the Rights Issue up to the extent permitted by the SEBI in its letter dated February 15, 2019.However, it said, that any subscription of rights equity shares by the promoters and promoter group in excess of Rs.20,000 crore or the "Additional Shares" will be earmarked separately and any profits realised by the promoter or promoter group on the sale of such Additional Shares within one year from the date of allotment of such shares in the Rights Issue, net of taxes, will be paid as additional cost on Additional Shares to the Company by the promoter and/or promoter group.“The profit on the sale of such Additional Shares would be based on the excess of the Reference Price over the Rights Issue price,” the company said.“This was more done as a caution primarily to prepare for the Axiata situation - what if Axiata didn't participate - which actually turned out to be the case. Or what if others were not interested which didn't turn out to be the case,” Akshaya Moondra, Chief financial officer, told ET.Malaysia’s Axiata Group Berhad has renounced its shares entitlement in Vodafone Idea’s ongoing Rs 25,000 crore rights issue in favor of global investors, a move which will bring down its stake in India’s largest telecom operator to 2.6% from 8.1%.Moondra said that there was some change in SEBI regulation which required that the shut period starts from April 1 instead of 15 days before the declaration of results.“So, we had kind of engaged because there is a technicality that participation and rights issue is insider trading or not. Logically it is not, but you could interpret it. So, the conclusion that was reached was that let promoters announce upfront what is the extent of participation they will do,” he said. “…I don't see any risk of promotors leaving to subscriber anything more.”
