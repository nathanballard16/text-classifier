Jodhpur court to hear Salman Khan’s plea against conviction in blackbuck poaching case, today

Jodhpur: A Jodhpur court will Friday take up actor Salman Khan’s plea against his conviction in the blackbuck poaching case. The actor had filed a plea against his conviction by a lower court, which had sentenced him to five years in jail.

However, there are apprehensions that Salman Khan may not appear before the court in view of a death threat issued by a gangster, ‘Garry Shooter’, of the Lawrence Bishnoi gang on Facebook last week.

During a hearing July 4, Sessions Court Judge Chandra Kumar Songara had directed Salman Khan to appear before the court September 27, failing which his bail plea may be cancelled. The actor has not appeared before the court since May last year, when he was granted bail.

“Salman Khan has not arrived so far and there is no intimation of his arrival,” police said. “Adequate security measures have been made for the actor because of the threat issued against him,” the police added.

Airport sources said Friday that there is no charter flight scheduled to arrive for the day from Mumbai.

Salman Khan is accused of killing two blackbucks during the shooting of a film in Jodhpur in 1998.
