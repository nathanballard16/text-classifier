Salem: Municipal corporation commissioner R Sadheesh imposed a fine of Rs1 lakh on a private hospital for disposing of medical waste in bins placed in the city on Friday. The commissioner warned the hospital authorities that he would cancel the license if the they continue to do the same.

The hospital management simply dumped the waste without following the guidelines prescribed the state. The waste dumped included syringes, needles, glucose bottles and materials like napkins, blood stained cottons in the bin.

According to Sadheesh, SMC has nominated a private company to collect medical waste from all the hospitals including government and private.

The commissioner warned all private hospitals to follow the guidelines strictly while getting rid of the medical waste.
