Would rather die than help BJP, says Priyanka Gandhi

Making a U-turn from her remark of weak Congress candidates eating into the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) votes in Uttar Pradesh, Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Thursday said that her party has fielded strong candidates and would rather die than help the present government.

"Our candidates are putting up a strong fight everywhere and the allegations made by the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party are not correct. I would rather die than benefit the BJP in elections. I can never support the destructive ideology of such a political party ever. Congress will continue its fight against the BJP and the Narendra Modi government will not come to power again," said the UP East in-charge.

Priyanka, in an exclusive interview to India Today TV on Wednesday, had claimed to have fielded weak candidates to eat into the BJP's vote share in the state in the ongoing general elections.

"I have selected candidates in UP after consulting with top party leaders. Congress will with on the seats where our candidates are strong. Wherever our candidates are light weight they will cut BJP's vote share," she had said.
