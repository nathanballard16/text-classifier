With this, she has become the third women of menstrual age to offer prayers at the shrine despite stiff resistance from right-wing organisations.Visuals of the Sri Lankan woman named Sasikala, carrying the 'irumudikettu', went viral after she, along with her husband and son, visited the temple on Thursday night, shortly before the shrine was closed for the day.Sources say that Sasikala approached the police in Pampa on Thursday evening, seeking protection for her visit to the temple. It is understood that she had undergone a hysterectomy. She produced medical documents to prove this before the police. Following this, the police extended protection for her to offer prayers in the temple. She climbed the 18 holy steps to enter the sanctum sanctorum, sources further pointed out.Few news channels reported the development on Thursday night, but soon retracted when her husband denied Sasikala's entry into the shrine, who was apparently concerned about their safety.Supporters ofand its allies have unleashed violence acrossafter two women, Bindu and Kanakadurga, offered prayers at the shrine on Wednesday, thereby, breaking a tradition which kept women in the age group of 10 to 50 away from the temple, citing the celibate status of the deity. The ruling CPI (M) is equally violent while retaliating to the's attacks.
