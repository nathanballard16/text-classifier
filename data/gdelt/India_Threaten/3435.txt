By Iffath FathimaWhitefield residents begin marking trees to avoid similar incidentsResidents have registered a police complaint against “unidentified persons” for axing a 100-year-old banyanin Whitefield.Residents said they noticed the tree wason Friday and their efforts to find the culprits went in vain.“We have got different answers from different people. Some said it could have been intentionally cut while others said that it would have been cut with forest officials’ permission,” said a Whitefield Rising volunteer. When some residents suggested it could be the handiwork of a nearby shopkeeper, they contacted the CEO of the store, but he too he had no role in the incident.Residents were also sure that the tree cutting wouldn’t have happened overnight. “The tree was an old one and also really big. Cutting it over night was not possible for sure. People would have come and cut it down bit by bit for a week at least,” said another Whitefield rising volunteer. Finally, they registered an FIR at the Whitefield Police Station on Tuesday. “We have got the complaint and have started our investigation as well. We will find the culprits soon. Trees can’t be cut without permission,” said a police officer .Residents also started marking trees which they believe are under threat as a precautionary measure.So far 35 trees have been marked near Whitefield Main Road and Ramaghondanahalli. “Many trees face the axe when new buildings come up. So we have started noting down such trees and mark them. We do not want to see any more trees getting cut,” said a resident.Residents are now planning to carry out a tree census with the help of environmentalist Vijay Nishanth.
