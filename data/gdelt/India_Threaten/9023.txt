BJP ally Janata Dal-United to oppose Triple Talaq Bill in Rajya Sabha

By Express News Service

PATNA: Striking a discordant note, NDA ally Janata Dal (United) has cautioned the Modi government against any “hasty” move on Uniform Civil Code (UCC). JD(U) national general secretary K C Tyagi said that the legislative proposal against the practice of triple talaq was a part of the agenda on Uniform Civil Code (UCC).

“Ours is a nation based on a delicate balance in respect of laws and governing principles for different religions and ethnic groups. We must not impose any view without obtaining substantive consultations. We’re of the view that it (triple talaq issue) needs wider and in-depth consultations with various religious groups,” Tyagi said.

The JD(U) decided not to be part of the NDA government at the Centre, apparently miffed at the offer of a lone berth in the council of ministers.In what was seen as a tit-for-tat response, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar later inducted new members into his council of ministers, not one of whom were from the BJP.

Speaking to this newspaper, Tyagi said that his party saw triple talaq legislation in a larger ambit of being part of the BJP’s agenda on UCC.

“In absence of a wider consultative process, any attempt at premature or hasty tampering with long-standing religious practices that deal with complex issues of marriage, divorce, adoption, inheritance and the right to property and succession, would be clearly inadvisable,” Tyagi said.

The JD(U) leader said all the stakeholders must be taken into confidence to make the law more broad, comprehensive and acceptable.

The government’s bid to push the triple talaq met with failure, prompting it to come out with four Ordinances.
