Pawan will contest from the Gajuwaka Assembly seat of Visakhapatnam of Andhra Pradesh in the upcoming Assembly elections and not from Anantapuram as was announced earlier. Gajuwaka was once a stronghold of the Praja Rajyam Party and so party workers insisted that the popular face must fight the polls there. He is also said to be popular with the youth there.
