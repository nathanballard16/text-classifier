Audio clip of CPM area secretary threatening Kalamassery SP made public

Kochi: The audio clip of a CPM leader threatening a police sub Inspector over phone has surfaced.

The political activist threatened the police officer alleging the latter behaved rudely with a Students Federation of India (SFI) leader following the clash between students at Cochin University.

Mathrubhumi News received the audio clip of CPM Kalamassery area secretary Zakir Hussain threatening Sub Inspector Amruth Rangan.

Zakir Hussain told the SI that it would be better if the police officer intervenes in issues after understanding the political situation in Kalamassery.

The SI replied that he was straight forward and did not take actions according to the political situation. Further, the SI stated that he could not just stand and watch when students attacked each other and added that he was not worried about being transferred.

Despite the SI saying that he had only moved the SFI leader to a safer area, Zakir Hussain did not budge. Responding to the incident, Zakir Hussain said the SI had behaved very rudely with the students.
