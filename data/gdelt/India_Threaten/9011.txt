Manish Sisodia calls for strike on poverty

By "surgical strike", Manish Sisodia referred to the cross border operations by the Indian Army and the Air Force.

Deputy Chief Minister of Delhi Manish Sisodia on Thursday urged the educators of Delhi government to carry out "surgical strikes" to weed out ills like hunger, unemployment, illiteracy, violence and hatred in society.

"We all read newspapers and the distressing, disappointing headlines. The power to alter these headlines lies in our hands as educators. Only we are capable of changing these headlines. We should commit to ourselves that, in five years time, we will turn these headlines of despair and outrage that bother us, into headlines of hope and prosperity," said Sisodia in his address to the heads of schools, principals and vice-principals during the three-day administrative and capacity building training programme that began here at Vigyan Bhavan.

By "surgical strike", Sisodia referred to the cross border operations by the Indian Army and the Air Force.

"The Army cannot do a surgical strike on ills of unemployment, hunger, illiteracy, violence and hatred that we read about daily. You will have to do it. The teachers and education staff will conduct surgical strike on these ills," said Sisodia, who is also Delhi's Education Minister. He highlighted achievements of the AAP government in uplifting education sector.
