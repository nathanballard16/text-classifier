India wants to use water as a weapon against Pakistan. A 59-year-old treaty stands in the way.

On Thursday, India’s water resources minister wrote on Twitter that the government had decided to choke off any flow to Pakistan from the three rivers India controls. But this was less an announcement than a reiteration of existing policy. India already uses about 94 percent of these waters and is moving ahead with projects to utilize what remains rather than let those waters flow to Pakistan.
