New Delhi: Just a day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee asked her political adversaries to unite in order to fight the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the Congress on Thursday showed its reluctance to join hands with the Trinamool Congress (TMC). The party also blamed the TMC chief for failing to control the rising influence of the BJP in West Bengal.

When asked about Mamata Banerjee's calls to Congress to join the TMC's fight against the BJP, Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury directed a veiled dig at the TMC chief saying, "People say something and then go back on their words, it's in her nature."

He, however, went on to suggest that Congress joining hands with the TMC might not be a far-fetched idea after all. "If she is serious, she'll have to talk to our senior leadership. The way BJP is growing in Bengal, it is due to Mamata ji's failures," added Chowdhury.

Earlier on Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee urged the Left parties and the Congress to unite with the Trinamool Congress to fight the BJP in West Bengal. The Chief Minister also assured that all the complaints of the Left and the Congress regarding Panchayat poll manipulation and hostile takeover of party offices would be looked into.

“It is important for us to work together. This is for a greater interest,” Ms Banerjee said in the West Bengal Assembly. She said her Trinamool Congress would extend all help to both the Left and Congress in fighting the BJP.
