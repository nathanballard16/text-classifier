Digvijay singh warns government against abolition of Article 35A

Bhopal: Veteran Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Digvijay Singh has cautioned that decision on abolition of Article 35A in J&K should not be taken in haste.

“Article 35A is enshrined in Constitution. All political parties should be taken into confidence before taking any decision on it”, he said.

Talking to reporters on the sidelines of his visit to flood-affected people in Sehore, he observed that it was beyond anybody’s comprehension as to why the Centre suddenly ordered to stop Amarnath Yatra, causing great inconvenience to thousands of devotees and rush over 20,000 security personnel to Valley. Militancy in Kashmir has almost been a routine affair; he said.
