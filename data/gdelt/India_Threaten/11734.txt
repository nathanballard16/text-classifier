The Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reached out to Afghanistan in his Independence Day speech, calling the country a ‘good neighbor of India’.

Addressing the Indian nation on the occasion of 73rd Independence Day of India, Modi said “From the ramparts of the Red Fort, I give my greetings to the people of Afghanistan who are marking 100 years of freedom.”

He also launched a veiled attack on Pakistan a day after the Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan threatened war against India amid Kashmir tensions.

Accusing Pakistan for promoting terror in the region including in Afghanistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, Modi said “Those who give protection to terrorism and support it must be completely exposed.”

The Indian Prime Minister also added that “Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka are also affected by terrorism. All countries in the world need to come together to fight this menace.”

This comes as tensions remain high between India and Pakistan after New Delhi scrapped the Article 370 revoking the special status granted to Jammu and Kashmir.
