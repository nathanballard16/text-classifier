Mumbai: Maharashtra's struggle with drought seems to be never-ending as the grievances of locals are increasing day by day. The locals of Latur, Marathwada and Beed are finding it difficult to get portable water as water levels are rapidly falling below average.

The central government issued an advisory to six states across the country. The states were, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Tamil Nadu. The centre asked the states to use water judiciously. The advisory was issued after the water levels in these reservoirs fell below 20 per cent of the average of live water storage levels over the past 10 years.

Due to scanty rainfall, the locals in Maharashtra are struggling to grow crops. Their only means of income, agriculture also seems to be slipping from their hands owing to the ensuing water crisis in the state. It was reported that the locals have to buy drinking water to meet their needs as the administration has failed to provide help.

A district of Maharashtra which has been struggling in the clutches of water crisis is Beed. The Babi village is among one such district where the locals have to walk miles to get drinking water for themselves. The locals have to wake up at 4 am to go to the well and get water for themselves.

Since there is not enough water for the people in the village, they have to walk kilometres in the scorching heat. One of the villagers stated that the situation presently was worse than the 1972 drought. After experiencing rainfall below the average level, the Maharashtra government had declared a drought in 151 tehsils across 26 districts.
