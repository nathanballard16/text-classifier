Maharashtra water release floods Belagavi, Bagalkote

Hubballi: The ouflow from various reservoirs in Maharashtra has submerged several bridges in Belagavi and Bagalkote districts with villages facing the threat of flood due to the overflowing Krishna river. Officials have shift the villagers and their livestock to safer places.

The outflow from Koyna reservoir is on the rise with Karnataka receiving 1.80 lakh cusecs of water. Officials are releasing nearly two lakh cusecs of water from Almatti dam with a high alert sounded in Belagavi as there is a possibility of floods.

Three teams of NDRF have been brought to Chikkodi from Pune and have been deployed in villages situated on the bank of the river. Many villages remain cut off as Davaleshwar bridge is submerged in the swirling waters of the Ghataprabha river in Rabakavi-Banahatti taluk.

People have deserted Lakamapur village in Nargund taluk of Gadag district after the flood water of Malaprabha river turned the little hamlet into an island.

Many other villages including Konnur and Vasan in the district are also facing the threat of floods.

Allaying the fear of fresh floods, Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi maintained that the water level in the rivers has not reached the danger level.

He said that people living on the banks of rivers will face a flood threat only if the outflow from Maharashtra crosses 2.5 to 3 lakh cusecs.

“There is flow of 1.70 lakh cusecs water into Karnataka from the neighbouring state. We have already directed officials of Almatti reservoir to discharge 2 lakh cusecs of water. Therefore, people living on the banks of the river need not worry about the flood threat,” he added.
