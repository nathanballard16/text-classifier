Bomb making equipment found in Hindu nationalists office

INDIAN communists warned that violence ‘is in the genes’ of Hindu nationalist paramilitaries after a huge weapons cache was found in their offices in Kerala.

Police made the discovery on Wednesday during a raid on the offices of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) in Nedumangad while investigating a series of bomb blasts last week. Their haul included swords and hydrogen peroxide, which is often used as bomb-making material.

The Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) warned: “This is what the RSS is busy doing. Preaching and practising violence is in their genes. They have no respect for democracy and the constitution.”

RSS is a right-wing Hindu nationalist paramilitary organisation which many view as the parent organisation of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

CCTV footage appeared to show an RSS worker known as Praveen throwing a bomb at a police station in Nedumangad this month during violent clashes amid demonstrations after two women entered the Sabarimala temple for the first time in its history.

The BJP and RSS backed calls for the shutdown in protest at a Supreme Court decision in September which ruled that women should be allowed into the shrine, which attracts the world’s biggest pilgrimage.

Hindu groups have organised demonstrations in the town since the verdict which allowed access to those previously banned from entry, particularly women of menstruating age.

The CPI-M-led Left Democratic Front government has led attempts to implement the ruling in the face of opposition from the BJP and Congress.

Police confirmed that Praveen remains the main suspect for the attacks, however they said he had gone into hiding and had not been arrested.
