Bittu cancels stir against NHAI amid border tension

Ludhiana: Amid the ongoing tension along the border, Member of parliament Ravneet Singh Bittu has called off the protest scheduled on Thursday against National Highways Authority Of India (NHAI). The protest was to be launched to demand the shutting down of the Ladhowal toll plaza.

The new protest date will be decided in the coming days, Bittu said.

“Due to the prevailing security situation at the border, there is a lot of Army and paratrooper activity these days and this stretch of the highway is vital for their movement towards Jammu and Kashmir. So any kind of protest can disrupt traffic movement along the route. Therefore, we have decided to call off the protest and the fresh date will be decided once the tension eases out.”

Notably, a few days ago MP Bittu had warned the NHAI that if by February 27 the Ladhowal toll plaza is not shut down, he along with fellow Congress workers will start a protest against the highways authority.
