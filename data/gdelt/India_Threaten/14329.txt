Chakma students urge Shah to act on Mizo 'atrocities'

The All India Chakma Students' Union (AICSU) on Friday said that at least 34 Chakma students including nine girls ran away from the JNV at Serchhip in Mizoram on October 3 after Mizo students brutally tortured one Nolin Bikash Chakma at JNV located at Thenzawl in Serchhip district on September 26.

A Class 12 student, Nolin Bikash was attacked and tortured by Mizo students with iron rods at the hostel on September 26.

"All the 34 Chakma students, including 9 girls fled from the hostel of JNV Thenzawl in Serchhip district to their homes on October 3 due to the lack of security, intimidation and threats of torture from the Mizo students. Of them, 17 belonged to Lawngtlai District and 17 are from Mamit District," said Tejang Chakma, Vice President of the AICSU.

He said that the torture of Chakma students in the JNVs is a regular affair and in 1997, the JNV authorities had to shift 43 Chakma students to JNV at Mou Gate in Senapati district of Manipur after brutal incidents of torture and harassment at the JNV hostel at Hrangchalkawn in Lunglei District, Mizoram.

"There is an immediate need to end such torture in the educational institutions and create conducive atmosphere for return of all the 34 Chakma students studying at JNV Thenzawl. Unless the Home Minister of India ensures a safe and secure environment inside the school premises run by the Central government, it shall be a failure of the Government of India to secure the future of its children," Tejang said.
