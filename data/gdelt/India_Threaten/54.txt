Mumbai: Karnataka NRI Forum–UAE urges state admin to rehabilitate returning Kannadigas

Mumbai, 02 Jan: It’s the duty of Karnataka state government to help NRI Kannadigas who return from GCC countries either by losing jobs or for any other reason in order to find sustenance, said Karnataka NRI Forum - UAE general secretary Prabhakar Ambalatere.

Addressing media persons, at Dubai on December 31, Prabhakar said that despite coalition government is reigning in Karnataka; it has not appointed deputy chairperson for NRI Committee.

The other states of southern India are already committed to the welfare of returning NRIs. A private airline that was operating flights to UAE from Mangaluru has stopped all flights; while Air India Express that operates flights to Mangaluru is swindling the passengers taking advantage of the situation. Despite this, Dakshina Kannada district MP is not taking the issue with civil aviation minister to address the situation. If the Karnataka state administration continues its step-motherly treatment to NRIs; severe protests are being planned, cautioned Prabhakar.
