Fisherman dies as boat capsizes

KSDMA reiterates importance of following weather alert

The Kerala State Disaster Management Authority (KSDMA) has warned fishermen not to venture into parts of the Arabian Sea over the next few days as strong winds are expected from a southwesterly direction in the next few days.

The State Emergency Operations Centre (SEOC) request comes even as one more fisherman died in at sea, taking the toll this week to three.

Citing an IMD forecast, the KSDMA said strong winds reaching speeds of 45-55 kmph were likely to prevail over north, central, and southern parts of the sea till Friday. Strong winds were also likely on Thursday.

Boat capsized

Abdul Rahman, 45, died after his fishing boat capsized four nautical miles off Vizhinjam on Tuesday night. Rough seas capsized the boat as Mr. Rahman and his companions Abdul Manaf, Sadiq Ali, and Ahmed Shah were hauling in the net around 10 p.m.

The four began swimming towards the shore, but the strong currents overtook Mr. Rahman, the coastal police at Vizhinjam said. Early on Wednesday, fishermen who had set out from Colachel had sighted the three others and rescued them. Abdul Rahman’s body was recovered from the sea off Vallavila in Tamil Nadu around 7 a.m. on Wednesday. He lived at Harbour Road, Vizhinjam, and is survived by wife Subeida and two daughters.

Meanwhile, fishermen organisations blamed the mishap on the unscientific construction of the breakwater. They urged government agencies to be judicious in issuing weather alerts.

“Weather alerts are important. On the other hand, fishermen have lost almost 40 days of work during the past six months owing to alerts issued indiscriminately” T. Peter, general secretary, National Fishworkers’ Forum, said.
