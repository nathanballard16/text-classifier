'Hindutva' word doesn't exist in my dictionary: Digvijaya Singh

There is no such term called 'Hindutva' that exists in my dictionary, said Congress leader and former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh here on Saturday.

"Why are you using the word 'Hindutva'? No such word called 'Hindutva' exists in my dictionary," he said while addressing a press conference.

The Congress leader was asked if he thinks that there will be polarisation in elections on the issue of Hindutva.

His comments assume significance in the wake of BJP fielding Malegaon Blast accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal, the seat from where Digvijaya is contesting on a Congress ticket.

Digivijaya has often been accused by his political rivals of inventing the 'saffron terror' term.

Later, Singh tweeted saying that the Hindu religion was his faith. "Therefore, I did not propagate about Narmada Parikrama, traditions of Raghogarh temple...When did the BJP people come between me and God? When did they become agents to give certificates," he asked.

Tweeting further, he said: "The Hindutva of Sangh does not unite, but divides. I will never allow my religion to be hijacked politically. For us, the Hindu religion is a matter of faith. I have my personal relationship with God."

Bhopal will go to polls on May 12. Counting of votes will take place on May 23.
