Lok Sabha Election 2019, Dadra and Nagar Haveli profile: BJP holds on to Union Territory seat but Congress poses major challenge-Politics News , Firstpost

Spread over 491 square kilometres and landlocked between Gujarat in the north and Maharashtra in the south, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from the Portuguese in 1954.

Dadra and Nagar Haveli has a lone Lok Sabha constituency and the Bhartiya Janata Party’s (BJP) Patel Natubhai Gomanbhai is the sitting MP from here.

Spread over 491 square kilometres and landlocked between Gujarat in the north and Maharashtra in the south, Dadra and Nagar Haveli was liberated from the Portuguese in 1954. While the culture in the Union Territory is influenced by the Portuguese, the Census data of 2011 states that more than half of the population belongs to Scheduled Tribes, which is why the seat is reserved for ST. The major tribes inhabiting the area are Varlies, Kokana, Dhodia and Dublas.

While the BJP has held the seat twice consecutively, it faces threat from Congress leader Delkar Mohanbhai Sanjibhai. The tribal leader has been elected MP six times. He was also one of the founders of the Bharatiya Navshakti Party but has since joined both the BJP and Congress. While in the 1991 and 1996 elections, he won the MP seats on a Congress ticket, he quit Congress to join BJP in 1998. A year later, he contested General Elections as an independent candidate. In 2009, he joined the Congress again.

While there were rumours of him joining the BJP again ahead of the 2014 polls, the tribal leader is likely to stick to Congress. Vocal about the problems of the tribals working in factories of Silvassa, Delkar poses a great challenge to incumbent Patel.
