Weather News and Analysis

Skymet Weather Team

Active Southwest Monsoon has given moderate to heavy rains in the eastern parts of Rajasthan during the last 24 hours. Jaipur, Kota and other areas in East and Southeast Rajasthan were the ones to witness these showers.

Our meteorologists predict, these moderate rains with one or two heavy spells would continue for the next two to three days. Thereafter, rains may intensify over the southeastern parts, wherein places like Rajsamand, Jhalawar, Udaipur, Chittorgarh, etc may receive heavy rains. These activities are likely between July 27 and 29.

Meanwhile, on and off rainfall activities would continue over the eastern parts of Rajasthan. However, the western areas of the state will remain almost dry with isolated light rains and one or two moderate spells. The city of Jaisalmer may receive light rain with cloudy to partly cloudy sky conditions. The intensity will be certainly more over East Rajasthan as compared to West Rajasthan.

The axis of Monsoon Trough continues to pass through Rajasthan. It is originating from East of Bikaner and extending up to the northeastern states across North Madhya Pradesh and South Uttar Pradesh. Moreover, the humid winds are feeding moisture. All these systems are resulting in enhanced rainfall activities over Rajasthan.

These rains will definitely bring down the rain deficiency of East Rajasthan to some extent. However, the western parts of the state need to wait for one week or so to experience typical Monsoon rains.
