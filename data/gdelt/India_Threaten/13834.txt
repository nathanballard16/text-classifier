Karnataka still waiting for flood relief funds for past 1.5 months: Congress

Senior Congress leader VS Ugrappa on Wednesday slammed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Karnataka after Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa said that he is hopeful of getting flood relief funds from the Central government in another four-five days.

Speaking to India Today TV, VS Ugrappa said that the Congress party would fight for the rights of the people of Karnataka as a "responsible opposition party".

Ugrappa also said that the taxes that have been collected from the state, "it is a matter of the right of the people of Karnataka to take back at least some portion of that same money".

"With Rs 35,160.81 crore damage estimates sent to the Central government, the state is patiently waiting for funds for the past 1.5 months," the Congress leader said.

As many as 103 taluks in 22 districts were affected due to floods last month, in which over 80 people were killed. Around seven lakh people were shifted to safe areas and thousands of houses were damaged.

Earlier, BS Yediyurappa had said that the state has been facing both the drought and the flood situation.

"We are facing both drought and flood situation. I'm hopeful of getting funds from the Centre in another four to five days. We are giving special attention in providing relief to those affected by floods cancelling certain programmes of the state government," Yediyurappa had said.

While speaking to the media, CM BS Yediyurappa said that it has been a "trial by fire" for him whenever he has occupied the top post.

"Whenever I have become the chief minister, it has been a trial by fire. Record rains in 108-110 years have taken place leading to large scale flooding and destruction. We have to resolve issues and help in the construction of houses to those displaced," BS Yediyurappa had said.
