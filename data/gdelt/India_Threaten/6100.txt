Former IPL chief Lalit Modi has said he would sue Congress chief Rahul Gandhi for his "all thieves have Modi in their surnames" remark.

"The #papu @rahulgandhi says "All MODI's are CHOR's". Well he will be taken to court in the UK by Me. But reality is that the world knows 5 decades of daylight #looting of #India was and is done by none other than the #Gandhi #family @narendramodi," Lalit Modi tweeted on Friday.

The tweet has a video attached to it that recounts the alleged corruption scams under the regime of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.

Rahul Gandhi had said recently at a rally in Maharashtra, as he accused PM Modi of corruption: "I have a question. Why do all the thieves have Modi in their names whether be it Nirav Modi, Lalit Modi and Narendra Modi? We don't know how many more such Modis will come out."

Lalit Modi faces charges of money laundering and is wanted by Indian authorities. He left the country in 2010.

Earlier, Bihar Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi too had said he would file a defamation case against Rahul Gandhi for his comment.
