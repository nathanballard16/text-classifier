LUDHIANA: Officials of Ludhiana Improvement Trust (LIT) called off their strike on Wednesday afternoon after the police registered an FIR against the person who had allegedly manhandled a clerk in LIT office last week. The employees had been on strike while demanding action against the person.

The cops registered an FIR against the person and also visited the LIT office on Wednesday for seeing the place where the incident had taken place.

It was on March 1 that a clerk of LIT, Harpreet Singh, had alleged that an applicant who had applied for transfer of ownership of a flat in his name had manhandled him. Even the estate officer of LIT Harpreet Sandhu alleged that the person had argued with him as well. The officials claimed that since there was commercial activity going on at the ground floor of the flat in Sant Isher Singh Nagar for which he had applied, they had refused the same. They claimed that they had asked him to stop the violations but instead of doing the same he started arguing with them.

The estate officer said that, “The case has been registered against the person who had misbehaved with me and the staff, so the employees called off the strike and joined their duties in the afternoon.”

Meanwhile, superintending engineer of LIT Rakesh Garg said that after this incident they were going to deploy a security guard at the office entrance so that in future no such incidents should take place again. He said the officer concerned had been asked to fulfil the requirements.
