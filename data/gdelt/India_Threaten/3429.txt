Pakistan Navy issues Naval & Coastal Warnings for possible exercises

An IN submarine was detected on 04 March 2019, 65km away from the safety enclosure enforced by the Pakistan Navy. The enclosure was supposed to be enforced on 01, 04-08, 11-15, 18-22 and 25-29 March 2019 for conducting Naval Exercises. A screen grab of the IR feed of the PN P-3C Orion aircraft (which probably detected the submarine) can be seen below.Based on the information contained in the roughly 40 second long video of the IR camera feed, the location and course of the PN P-3C Orion and the IN submarine can be mapped, as shown below. It appears that the IN submarine was on a south-western course (240 degrees) when a PN P-3C approached from the north-west (160 degrees). The PN aircraft passed within 0.62NM (1.15km) of the IN submarine.
