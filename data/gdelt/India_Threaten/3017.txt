A move by the SAD to corner Navjot Singh Sidhu on the issue of promising government jobs to the kin of Amritsar rail tragedy victims backfired with Cabinet minister Sukhjinder Randhawa launching a scathing attack against Akali MLA Bikram Majithia, with Sidhu in tow.

On asking about the arrests made in the rail tragedy probe, SAD chief Sukhbir Badal found himself cornered when CM Capt Amarinder Singh took a potshot at him, saying that in the road accidents involving Orbit buses, no one was put behind bars. Randhawa asked the CM whether the former Deputy CM, owner of the Orbit Aviation, needed to be arrested for the accidents caused by his buses.

“In none of the incidents involving Orbit buses, including the one in Moga, the compensation to the victim families was paid by the state. The Akalis looted and abused the government,” he asserted.

Replying to Akalis’ demand for an FIR against Sidhu in the rail accident, Randhawa demanded a case against the Badals “since the owner of the buses service should also be held responsible, not only the drivers”.

Dragging the issue of alleged drug taint against Majithia, Randhawa requested the CMto book Majithia for his alleged complicity in drugs case. “CM Sahib, we should take up with the High Court for early hearing in the drug cases so that truth could come out,” said a senior Congress leader.

On jobs to the families of the rail accident victims, Sidhu said the process was on. “I am giving Rs 8,000 per month to the families, who had no bread earner,” he said.
