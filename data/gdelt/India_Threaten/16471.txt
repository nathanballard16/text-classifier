Hyderabad: Putting an effective end to 50-day long strike, Telangana State Road Transport Corporation-Joint Action Committee (TSRTC-JAC) on Monday called off the strike and asked the employees to join back the services with immediate effect. It should be noted that the TSRTC employees have been striking since October 5 demanding the merger of the TSRTC with the state government.

The development has come a day after TSRTC-JAC Convenor E Ashwathama Reddy had told media that the striking employees would intensify the agitation with a series of picketing programmes today at depots, bus stands and important junctions in the state.

Before stressing that the strike will intensify, Reddy had said, "We thank all those who took part in the strike for 51 days with determination. The strike will continue." The agitating employees had once again demanded Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao to invite them to hold talks.

Back on October 5, nearly 48,000 employees had started the indefinite strike after the JAC of the unions had demanded a pay revision of its employees, recruitment to various posts and merger of the TSRTC with the state government.

Reacting to the demands of the striking TSRTC employees, Chief Minister KCR had iterated that the road transport corporation of the state would not be merged with the state's transport department under no circumstances.

The Chief Minister had called the strike illegal due to the inconvenience it had caused to the daily commuters and rest of the public.
