John Pilger: We are in a WAR SITUATION with China! (E788)

In this season finale special episode of Going Underground, we speak to legendary journalist and filmmaker John Pilger on a round-up of all the latest issues. Pilger describes the current state of global affairs as a state of world war, saying that the ‘coming war on China’ he warned about… has now arrived, he also discusses the Hong Kong protests and why they have grown, along with US involvement in the unrest. He talks about the collapse of the global nuclear arms control framework, with the ending of the INF Treaty, and the beginning of a new arms race with Russia, amid a situation which he describes as Washington’s goal to break up the Russian Federation under Putin. He also warns of the increased risk of nuclear war as nuclear superpowers, such as Pakistan and India, experience major tensions between each other. Pilger also discusses his concern over John Bolton being at the ear of Donald Trump, how Brexit, as a weapon of mass distraction in the UK, has deflected attention away from the most pressing issues at home (such as austerity and the NHS) and abroad. He slams sanctions on Venezuela and Iran and also updates us on the condition of Wikileaks founder and publisher Julian Assange, after he visited him recently in Belmarsh Prison.
