Dalit groups plan another protest against government for demolition of Sant Ravidas temple

NEW DELHI: Dalit activists have planned to carry on their protest against the government for the demolition of the Sant Ravidas temple at Tughlakabad, following Supreme Court orders. They would be sitting on dharna for an indefinite period at the Jantar Mantar in Delhi from Friday, August 30. The next leg of the protest is likely to be formally announced on Tuesday."Akhil Bharatiya Sant Shiromani Guru Ravidas Mandir Sanyukta Sanrakshan Samity," an umbrella body of dalit groups from across the country formed recently to take this temple movement ahead, have decided to start a non-stop dharna. They are demanding that the government should help rebuild the temple at the very spot that it stood, since it has a historical importance and dates back to 1509, when Guru Ravidas was there during the reign of Emperor Sikandar Lodi The dharna has been planned as a follow up to last week’s mobilization of dalit groups who marched in protest, to show that the community has not relented from its demand and would continue with it, till the time the government responds to it."The dalit body will also demand the release of 96 protestors, who have been arrested on August 21. Most of them are from Haryana, while there are many from Uttar Pradesh and some from Delhi,” said dalit activist Ashok Bharti.This is the first dalit movement that seems to be growing since the temple was demolished, in which the “sant samaj” or spiritual heads of the Ravidasi community have got involved. There are about 150 Ravidas temples in just Delhi, according to Bharti, and hence the dharna at Jantar Mantar is likely to see a good congregation of people from all over Delhi, while those from outside will keep coming in from time to time.The Delhi protests are a follow-up of protests held in Punjab last week, soon after the demolition of the temple earlier this month.
