It has already recruited twice and is doing it the third time,” they added.They stated that more than 25,000 teachers had gone on a hunger strike at Freedom Park in Bengaluru on February 5, 2018 to press for their demands.“Despite our repeated appeals to the authorities and the education minister, the government has not considered them,” they rued.They warned that if the government fails to consider them as graduate teachers, they would boycott taking classes to class to 8.
