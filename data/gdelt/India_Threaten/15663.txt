PNB posts Rs 507 crore profit as provision eases; net NPAs fall

PNB managing director S S Mallikarjuna Rao said that bank will focus on recovery to bring down the net NPA to the comfort level of the RBI by the end of the current fiscal.

State-owned Punjab National Bank (PNB) on Tuesday reported a profit of Rs 507.06 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, aided by reduction in provisioning for bad loans. PNB had posted a loss of Rs 4,532.35 crore in the corresponding July-September quarter last year.

While the lender’s non-performing assets (NPAs) and provisioning against bad loans fell during the quarter when compared with same quarter last year, but sequentially (i.e. when compared with first quarter) there was deterioration in NPA numbers.

During the quarter, provisions for bad loans declined sharply to Rs 3,253.32 crore against Rs 7,733.27 crore in July-September 2018. But provisions shot up compared to January-March quarter level of Rs 2147 crore. Shares of PNB closed 5.28 per cent below at Rs 64.60 at the National Stock Exchange Tuesday — as NPA and provisioning numbers came in above estimates.

Gross NPAs amounted to 16.76 per cent of the gross advances at the end of September, lower than 17.16 per cent a year ago. Net NPAs or bad loans also came down to 7.65 per cent as against 8.90 per cent in the year-ago period.

PNB managing director S S Mallikarjuna Rao said that bank will focus on recovery to bring down the net NPA to the comfort level of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) by the end of the current fiscal. “If you look at the guidance, we are very confident that we can bring down the net NPA by March 2020 below 6 per cent,” he told reporters while announcing quarterly results. Rao, who was appointed the head of the country’s second largest lender last month, has set a recovery target of Rs 24,000 crore for the entire fiscal.

Of this, the bank has done recovery of Rs 7,000 crore during the first half of the current fiscal and the remaining Rs 17,000 crore would be done in the remaining half through cash recovery and reduction, he said.

“In NCLT (National Company Law Tribunal) there are 14 cases which are in final stages. From NCLT we are expecting Rs 11,000 crore reduction from NPAs … the real amount received will be around Rs 6,500 crore, against which the write-back will be about Rs 3,800 crore,” he said.

Total income during July-September quarter rose to Rs 15,556.61 crore from Rs 14,035.88 crore in the same quarter last year, PNB said in a regulatory filing. The bank earned operating profit of Rs 3,561 crore during the quarter as against Rs 2,839.50 crore in the same period a year ago. During the quarter, the total interest income of the bank rose to Rs 13,292 crore from Rs 12,326 crore in the same quarter in the previous fiscal.

During the quarter, gross NPAs, in absolute terms, stood at Rs 78,472.70 crore at the end of September, lower than Rs 86,620.05 crore reported in the second quarter of 2018-19. Net NPAs were valued at Rs 32,658.69 crore as against Rs 38,278.84 crore.

The bank expects slippages of around Rs 19,000 crore this year and its Net Interest Margin around 2.40 per cent.

The bank received capital of Rs 16,061 crore from the government during the quarter to help it effectively amalgamate two state owned banks Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India. Following the infusion, the capital adequacy ratio of the bank increased to 14.07 per cent from 10.08 per cent in the same period a year ago.
