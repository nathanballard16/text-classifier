The Delhi resident wanted to ‘teach parents a lesson’.A 22-year-old-man was arrested by the Mumbai Crime Branch for allegedly making a hoax threat call to theheadquarters in Delhi warning of a bomb attack in Mumbai.The accused, Shubham Kumar Ajay Pal, a resident of Mehrauli, Delhi, was arrested from Goregaon on Friday by a team of the Mumbai Police’s Crime Branch Unit XII.Pal had reportedly reached the city late on Thursday following a tiff with his father. In an apparent bid to teach his parents a lesson, he called up the NIA office and said: “On August 30, there will be an attack on Mumbai. Save the city, if you can.”With an alert already in place owing to intelligence inputs of possible infiltration attempts via sea, the call put the national security machinery in a tizzy. As he had used his personal phone to make the threat call, tracing him was easy.“We traced the mobile number toin Goregaon,” said a crime branch officer.According to the police, Pal is a Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) dropout. He would often help his father at his mountaineering equipment shop in Delhi. He had been reportedly stealing cash from the shop, and after his father found out about it recently, got a big dressing down.“After the scolding, Pal took a train to Mumbai from Hazrat Nizamuddin railway station and went straight to Goregaon from where he called up the NIA headquarters,” said a police official.It isn’t clear why the accused chose to come to Mumbai, or why he was in Goregaon. He has no family or friends in the city, the police said.He was found wandering near NESCO and was arrested. He has since been handed over to the Vanrai police and has been booked under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.Pal has been remanded in police custody till September 9.
