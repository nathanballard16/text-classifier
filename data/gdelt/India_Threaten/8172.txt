Online petitions: Fad, chad or launchpad?

Bengaluru: On May 17, Elliot Alderson, a French security researcher, warned journalists against writing stories based on petitions on a particular online forum, claiming these petitions “represent zero value, as they don’t verify email ownership.”Alderson’s warning — he has exposed several security flaws in major systems, including many in India in the past — comes at a time when online petitions have become immensely popular, especially among the youngsters.From petitions about saving a wild animal in Africa or helping a community in India, all garner equal response, raising questions of whether people signing such petitions really understand issues they are lending name to and are they real signatories or not, among many others.There have been several examples where online petitions have led to on-ground results too, and given their growing popularity, TOI caught up with a host of youngsters in Bengaluru for their opinion on whether such petitions are a virtual fad, a waste of time or a launchpad for on-ground movements?Haritha Hariharan, 19, a student, believes that a petition with numerous signatures can hold ground in a court or in a legislative assembly, and cited the example of a signature campaign in the UK, which eventually saw then Prime Minister David Cameron resettling 20,000 Syrian refugees in 2015.Popular among youngstersShe felt other than actual action, petitions also lead to increased awareness of social and environmental issues among youngsters, working adults and students who are seen to be taking to social media platforms to share various issues.But her view is not shared by Sanobar Ahmed, 19, another student. Arguing they are ineffective, Sanobar said those who sign it don’t get any follow-up about the results of the petition.“A majority of those who sign petitions cannot remember those they have previously signed. Once it is signed, it is forgotten. Personally, I’ve never really seen any of them pan out. For a short period, it becomes a topic of discussion and then dies out which is why I think they’re ineffective,” says 20-year-old Yashi Malik.But it isn’t that petitions are worthless. Environmental activist Sriranjini Raman believes online petitions are an integral part of the process to bring out changes. “Thanks to the internet, e-petitions allow us to spread information quickly, engage with the masses and draw public attention to issues.”Arguing that petitions initiate the build-up of a social movement, she said: “For instance, a petition to exempt sanitary napkins from GST tax became quite popular and caught the attention of Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and was thus successful.”She said e-petitions could be an effective stepping stone with regards to issues like animal cruelty and social justice, but it is not enough to create positive change. As Dave Karpf said in his book, The MoveOn Effect, “petitions alone were not going to achieve change, but they were a useful first step”.Slacktivism a concernPetitions are known to create “interested bystanders” who want to create change, but end up not doing much in favour of it. It has brought on a phenomenon of ‘slacktivism’, which has become quite common in India.Business analyst Nithin Jacob, 24, says, “A signature from a random person from across the globe cannot empathise with a cause that barely affects them. But it is filled up purely out of pity and that false sense of accomplishment.”Slacktivists tend to offer little effort and commitment to the cause while believing they’ve done enough. This phenomenon has slowed down the process of creating change. “Petitions often cannot create actual change. Thousands of people signed a petition to construct a bridge on a river in Assam to help children reach their school, but nothing happened,” says Keerthi Gaddam, 19.In reality, petitions are much more effective when used as a starting point by raising awareness on issues and catching the attention of the media and subsequently those who are responsible for making changes.— Meghna Nair
