US says it is 'affront' that planners of Mumbai terror attacks have not been convicted, while glossing over Pakistan's role

WASHINGTON: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared it an “affront to the victims and their families” that those who planned the 66/11 Mumbai attack still have not been convicted, even as another Indian-American died in a terrorist attack on a UN vehicle in Kabul on Sunday.Pompeo confirmed news about the death of Anil Raj - who was working as a coordinator for the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Afghanistan – while marking the 11th anniversary of the Mumbai terrorist attacks."Attacks targeting UN personnel working to help the Afghan people are unconscionable, and we condemn this act in the strongest possible terms,” Pompeo said in remarks at the State Department, without identifying the perpetrators of the attack. Most terrorist attacks in Afghanistan are attributed to Taliban , protégés of Pakistan ’s military-intelligence establishment.There were few details available about the circumstances of Anil Raj’s death, aside from the fact that five other UNDP staff, including civilians were injured in the attack.The California-born Raj was known to have deep working ties to Afghanistan and was a frequent visitor to - and sometime resident in - the country.In a LinkedIn profile, he listed his last assignment as ''Collaborating with key national institutions, embassy partners, the NATO mission and UN agencies to design and launch new projects under the UN's Law & Order Trust Fund for Afghanistan (LOTFA) to improve rule of law service delivery to Afghan citizens.''Describing himself as an “Institutional Development Specialist,” Raj appeared to have lived in Kabul between December 2015 and March 2018 while “Providing technical and management services to support reform and development of Afghanistan's national rule of law institutions.”A graduate of Saratoga High School, Raj earned a bachelor's degree in political science from University of California Riverside and a master's degree in international human rights from the University of Denver, before going into international development. His CV showed him having worked in three other crisis states – Myanmar, South Sudan, and Colombia.Raj’s death came two days ahead of the 11th anniversary of the 26/11 terrorist attack on Mumbai perpetrated by Pakistan and it's military-intelligence establishment which claimed 166 lives, including that of six Americans.Although Pompeo regretted that planners of the Mumbai attacks have not been convicted, he made no mention of Pakistan (which has protected the perpetrators for 11 years) and instead pivoted quickly to Iran , saying “Moving on to the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism , the Islamic Republic of Iran…President Trump and I have been following closely the protests that have recently broken out across that country.”The digression was typical of Washington, which has refused to identify Pakistan as a perpetrator of terrorism despite a myriad terrorists (including Osama bin Laden and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed) being caught there, and despite the many terrorist attacks Pakistan-backed Taliban have launched in Afghanistan against American forces and its interests. Instead, the US typically chases terrorist shadows in places such as Iran, Cuba, Venezuela and -- till it became a Trump favorite – North Korea, while leaving Pakistan unpunished.On Tuesday, President Trump carried what many analysts see as a travesty in the war on terrorism in a new direction, warning that he would designate some Mexican drug cartels as Foreign Terrorist Organisations (FTO).Asked by the former Fox News host Bill O’Reilly in a radio interview if he would consider designating the cartels as FTO, Trump said he had been working on it for the last 90 days, and although the “designation is not that easy, you have to go through a process, and we are well into that process.”“They will be designated … I have offered him (the Mexican president) to let us go in and clean it out,” Trump said. “He, so far, has rejected the offer. But at some point, something has to be done.”The US President’s remarks agitated Mexico, which said the designations unnecessary and inconvenient, and that the US and Mexico have a healthy working relationship in fighting cartels.
