SpiceJet to induct 16 aircraft previously operated by Jet

SpiceJet is planning to induct 16 Boeing 737-800 next-generation aircraft on a long-term dry lease.

The aircraft, previously flown by Jet Airways, are expected to start joining the SpiceJet fleet in 10 days.

The company said in a statement it has applied to the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for a no-objection certificate to import the aircraft.

A dry lease involves taking an aircraft without the operating crew. The lease could extend from two or three years up to six years, and can be extended further if required.

Low-cost airline SpiceJet will have to reconfigure these aircraft as Jet Airways is a full-service carrier which offers seating in business and economy classes. SpiceJet, on the other hand, offers only economy class seating although some ‘special’ seats that offer additional leg room and other comforts are priced higher.

The deployment of the 16 aircraft is expected to ease the shortage of aircraft which Indian carriers are currently facing on account of the global grounding of Boeing MAX aircraft, a drastic decline in Jet Airways’ fleet on account of leasing companies taking back their aircraft, trouble with the Airbus New Engine Option aircraft, and pilot shortages.

Grounding of aircraft

SpiceJet had a fleet of 13 Boeing MAX, of which 12 were operating when the global grounding of the aircraft was announced on March 13. It is not yet clear for how long they will remain grounded.
