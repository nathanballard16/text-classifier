PM Khan will have to go home, proclaims Zardari

ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday said that Prime Minister Imran Khan would have to go home, clearly indicating his party's intent to oust the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government from the centre.



The former premier made the assertion while speaking to the press after a meeting with Jamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, another staunch opponent of Khan.

Speaking of the meeting, Zardari said he has always had Fazl's blessings, adding, "However, I am not sure whether he is an elder to me or I am to him".

Regarding the current situation of the country, he maintained that if the government was not pushed back then it would result in irreparable loss.

"If we did not do this, then the coming generations would not forgive us," the PPP co-chairman said. "And if we did not do this, then some other force might do so.

"Kaptaan will have to go home," he pronounced.

When asked as to how much time they would give to the government, Zardari said there is a season for everything, adding that it would be only after Ramazan and Muharram.

Speaking to newsmen, Fazl said the meeting with Zardari was a routine one.

"We are not in a position to give any surprise. Today, it was just a dinner invite," he said.

"I had also met Mian sahib and discussions were held therein too. Several issues pertaining to the country were discussed, regarding which there is harmony among us."

The JUI-F chief said they were united to rid the nation of fake leaders, adding that meetings would be held in the future as well and the political agenda would be taken forth.

"Whoever is a friend of Modi is a traitor," he replied, when asked about PM's comment regarding Narendra Modi's victory in general election in India.
