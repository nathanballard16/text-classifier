Opinion | Abolition Of Article 370 In Jammu & Kashmir Reeks Of RSS's Hindutva Doctrine. Why This Brutal Step?

Prime Minister Modi is a man in a hurry. He is in a hurry to demolish the Indian state that 15 governments before his had built with painstaking care. Among nation-­states, it was unique for its tolerance and easy accommodation of div­e­rsity and the freedom it gave its diverse people to seek their futures within its boundaries.

The keystone of this arch of tolerance was Article 370 of the Constitution, which gave a special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Article 370 gave legal recognition to the Instrument of Accession. This ceded sovereignty to the Ind­ian state over Kashmir only in the four subjects mentioned—defence, foreign affairs, communication and currency. Further integration with the Ind­ian state could be proposed by New Delhi, but had to be accepted by the state legislature, which had the right to declare itself a constituent asse­mbly whenever the need arose.
