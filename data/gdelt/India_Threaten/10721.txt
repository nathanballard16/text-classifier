Kejriwal warns pvt hospitals of against refusing treatment to accident victims

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday warned private hospitals that their licences would be cancelled if they refuse treatment to the accident, acid attack and burn victims in the city.

Kejriwal rued some hospitals were refusing treatment to victims despite the AAP dispensation having launched a scheme in February 2018, making the Delhi government bear all expenses of treatment of such patients.

Addressing a press conference here, Kejriwal said the Delhi government had initiated the scheme, keeping in mind the fact that if such victims are provided treatment within the golden hour, their lives could be saved.

The chief minister's warning came during a meeting with the private hospital representatives who assured him of full cooperation in implementing the scheme strictly.

He pointed out that even as per various orders of the Supreme Court and the Delhi High Court, no hospital can refuse treatment to accident victims.

"After accident, there is a golden hour to save the life of an accident victim. If they (private hospitals) refuse treatment to accident victims, we will take strict actions, including cancellation of their license," Kejriwal told reporters.

He said since the launch of the Delhi government's scheme in February 2018, 2,501 people have been treated till April this year.

"The Delhi government is bearing the entire treatment expenditure of the accident and burn cases victims under its scheme and there should be no complaint in this regard.

"I am happy that the attitude of all the hospitals was positive and they assured us that there will be no refusal," said Kejriwal.
