An Indian nuclear power plant suffered a cyberattack. Here’s what you need to know.

Air-gapped nuclear facilities can be attacked. Air gaps can be effective against unsophisticated and untargeted cyberthreats — but not against targeted attacks. As the Nuclear Threat Initiative states in its 2016 report on cyberthreats to nuclear facilities, targeted attacks go beyond network connections and generally leverage “witting or unwitting humans, or a long and difficult-to-defend supply chain, to deliver the attack.” Another report by the Fissile Materials Working Group (a coalition of global civil society organizations) highlights that in practice, “organizations must transfer data into and out of their operational networks for a variety of reasons.” For instance, new data has to enter an air-gapped operational network to update the software and hardware in the network. That exposes the critical internal network in a nuclear power plant to a host of vulnerabilities. Most famously, the Stuxnet attack penetrated Iran’s air-gapped Natanz uranium enrichment facility.
