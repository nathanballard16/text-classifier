New Delhi ‘changed plan of a missile attack’ after warning

India had planned a missile attack on six to seven places inside Pakistan from an airbase in Rajasthan but Pakistan foiled this plan on the basis of intelligence, government sources said on Monday.Pakistan learned about this plan on time and its agencies warned Indian agencies that Pakistan was ready to retaliate against any such attacks. They were told that the intensity of the Pakistani attack would be threefold of the Indian assault, the sources added.They said India planned now to mount terrorist attacks in large cities of Pakistan particularly Karachi and Bahawalpur and information about the potential Indian attacks had been shared with friendly countries.Pakistan has told the international powers that it wants peace with India and that by releasing the Indian pilot, Pakistan has demonstrated its will in this regard.Important personalities of the world are in contact with Pakistan and India. However, there is no direct contact between the two rivals but security agencies of the two countries are in touch.According to sources, the tension between Pakistan and India is not as high as it was a few days back. However, the government, the armed forces, and the agencies are on alert. The release of the Indian pilot has changed the situation and Pakistan is getting diplomatic cooperation from across the world.Earlier Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the USA played an important role in de-escalating the situation. In the last couple of days, the British premier has also attempted to reduce tensions between the rival states.According to sources, the dossier from India about the Feb 14 Pulwama attack does not provide any practical evidence which could justify action against the Jaish-e-Mohammad of Masood Azhar.The government had decided back in 2018 that the organisations that have been banned but have a large following would be brought into the national mainstream. The government will take the seminaries of these organisations into its own custody and the education of the pupils studying there would continue.
