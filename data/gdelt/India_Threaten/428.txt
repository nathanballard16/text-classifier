Prasad on quota bill: This is first sixer, expect more

NEW DELHI: Countering the attack of the opposition that the government hastily brought the constitutional amendment bill for 10% quota for the economically weaker upper castes, law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said there was no scope for doubt as the Constitution empowers Parliament to make these amendments.“Why is this doubt about the powers of this House?” he said citing Article 368 of the Constitution to reaffirm the powers conferred on Parliament to bring amendments. Intervening in the debate in Rajya Sabha , Prasad said the 10% quota will be applicable to jobs in both central and state governments. He said the legislation gives powers to the states to decide on the economic criteria for defining the beneficiaries.Taking on the Congress leaders who questioned the timing of the bill calling it a pre-poll gimmick, Prasad said: “We are being asked why now? My answer if you (Congress) did not get it in time and we are getting it late but at least we have the courage to do it.” He questioned why Congress did not move on the quota issue in 2010, a year after the UPA returned to power for the second time.Prasad warned the opposition that “this was the first sixer and more sixers were yet to come. When the polls happen people will for sure come out in support of NDA, BJP and Narendra Modi”.
