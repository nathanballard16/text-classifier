Indian army chief hurls hollow threats at Pakistan to attack Azad Kashmir

NEW DELHI (Dunya News) – Forgetting the humiliation that India faced on February 27 at the hands of Pakistan, Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat hurled hollow threats at Pakistan to attack Azad Kashmir, Dunya News reported on Friday.

Bipin Rawat’s statement came after Union Minister Jitendra Singh drivelled on about occupying Azad Kashmir as a part of India’s next agenda. Indian army chief said forces are ready to launch operation if government wants so.

“All actions are decided upon by the central government. Agencies working under the government have to act in accordance with its directions... the Army remains always prepared for any kind of action,” warmonger Rawat told the media.

India Humiliated



Tensions between Pakistan and India heightened after Pulwama attack when New Delhi leveled false allegation over Islamabad for planning the assault. India violated Pakistan’s airspace and Pakistan Air Force shot down two of its fighter jets on February 27 in Balakot and captured a pilot – Abhinandan Varthaman – alive.

India shamelessly lied to its people afterwards claiming that it killed militants in Balakot and downed Pakistan’s F-16 in a foolish attempt at face-saving as the allegations were proven wrong not only by Pakistan but at international level as well.

The risk of a full-blown war between the two nuclear-armed neighbours surged once again after India illegally scrapped occupied Kashmir’s autonomy in an unconstitutional and unilateral move on August 5 and imposed curfew in the valley.

On the other hand, battle-hardened Pakistan Army is fully prepared for any kind of misadventure by India and has vowed to fight for Kashmir – Pakistan’s jugular vein – until the last bullet, soldier and breath.
