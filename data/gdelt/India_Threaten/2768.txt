Durrani has been found guilty of violating the military code of conduct. He is no more entitled to pension and facilities and his name has been placed on the Exit Control List (ECL)."Lt-Gen (retd) Durrani has co-authored a book, The Spy Chronicles, with Amarjit Singh Dulat, a former chief of Indian spy agency Research and Analysis Wing (RAW).The press conference was called amid crescendoing war hysteria and relentless threats of military action from India in the aftermath of February 14 Pulwama suicide attack in occupied Kashmir.The ISPR head issued an unambiguous warning to New Delhi, saying: “Don’t mess with Pakistan.”“We do not wish to go to war. But please be assured, should you initiate any aggression, you shall never be able to surprise us. We shall, for sure, surprise you,” the chief military spokesperson remarked.
