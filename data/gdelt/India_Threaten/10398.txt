Karnataka floor test Highlights: Kumaraswamy govt falls, BJP likely to stake claim tomorrow

Karnataka Floor Test Result Highlights: After the fall of the Congress-JD(S) government on Monday, BJP sources said the party’s state chief B S Yeddyurappa is likely to stake claim on Wednesday. The swearing-in ceremony is likely to be held on Thursday.

The HD Kumaraswamy-led Congress-JD(S) government failed to survive trust vote in the Karnataka Assembly on Tuesday. “HD Kumaraswamy has failed the confidence vote, with 99 voting for the government while 105 members have voted against the government,” Speaker KR Ramesh said. The trust vote was necessitated after 15 MLAs resigned, plunging the government to a minority.

Ahead of the trust vote, Section 144 was imposed in Bengaluru for the next 48 hours following clashes between Congress and BJP workers. The workers from the parties indulged into a brawl after some from the ruling coalition allegedly tried to take away the two independents to make them participate in the trust vote the deadline of which was fixed at 6 pm.

Earlier in the day, Supreme Court had adjourned till Wednesday the hearing on a plea filed by two Independent Karnataka MLAs, seeking holding of the floor test “forthwith” in the state Assembly. The court’s decision was taken after the counsel for Karnataka Speaker told the court that the trust vote may “most likely happen today or tomorrow.” The MLAs who withdrew support to the ruling coalition had sought direction to the ruling JD(S)-Congress coalition government to conduct the floor test on or before 5 pm on Monday.
