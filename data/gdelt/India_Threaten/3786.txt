The Indian Government is reportedly expected to sign a $3bn deal with Russia later this week to lease another Akula-class submarine for use by the Indian Navy.

Known as Chakra III, the new submarine will undergo an extensive building programme on mothballed hulls at a Russian shipyard, reported The Economic Times.

Citing sources, the publication stated that the vessel will be customised to meet Indian needs and incorporated with domestic communications systems and sensors before its targeted delivery in 2025.

The proposed deal comes after years of negotiations between the two sides. India previously procured two similar vessels from Russia.
