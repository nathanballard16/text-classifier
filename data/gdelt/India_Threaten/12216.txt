Sonia Gandhi approves Congress-Left pact for Bengal bypolls

NEW DELHI: Sonia Gandhi has approved Congress-Left Front alliance in West Bengal for the upcoming three assembly bypolls in the state.The move is seen more as an effort to combat BJP , which is pushing both the parties out of the opposition space in West Bengal, and positioning itself as the sole challenger to the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress.The 2019 Lok Sabha polls saw a saffron surge in West Bengal. While BJP won 18 Lok Sabha seats against Trinamool’s 22, Congress could win just two and the Left ended up with a zero. Gandhi was apprised of the mutual need of Congress and Left Front by state Congress chief Somen Mitra last Friday. He informed the Congress interim president of both sides wanting to fight the bypolls together. While the Congress-CPM alliance failed to click in the last West Bengal assembly elections, bid for the same alliance in the last Lok Sabha polls fell through due to seat-sharing differences.“I had held discussions with West Bengal CPM leaders Biman Bose and Surya Kanta Mishra and we agree to have a Congress-Left Front alliance in the upcoming assembly by-elections. Accordingly, the Congress will fight two seats ( Kaliaganj and Kharagpur ) and the Left Front one seat (Karimpur)”, Mitra told ET from Kolkata.Asked why Congress overlooked Banerjee’s recent call for a united front against BJP, Mitra said, “This alliance is for local politics. Sonia Gandhi-led AICC and PCC will decide what to do when it comes to the next general elections.”
