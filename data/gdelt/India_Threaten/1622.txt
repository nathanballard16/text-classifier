Anna Hazareâ€™s health deteriorates, admitted to hospital

New Delhi:

Social activist Anna Hazare was admitted to a hospital in Maharashtra’s Ahmednagar after his health deteriorated on Wednesday. This is the second time within a week that Hazare had to be taken to the hospital. It comes after week-long hunger strike for demanding Lokpal Bill. News Nation has learnt that doctors at the Ahmednagar hospital say that the oxygen supply to his brain has been affected, which may result in brain haemorrhage.

Hazare had earlier warned that if the Modi government did not fulfil its promises, he would return his Padma Bhushan award. The hospitalisation of the Gandhian comes on the seventh day of his hunger strike. Hazare had refused to call off his protest saying the government is handling the issue of corruption in a casual manner. The talks between Union minister Subhash Bhamre, state minister Girish Mahajan and Hazare in the latter's Ralegan Siddhi village in Ahmed Nagar district, the venue of his fast since January 30, remained inconclusive Monday.

The 82-year-old had lost 4.25 kg in the last six days. However, repeating his demands, the anti-graft crusader said the ministers who called on him Monday had nothing concrete to offer.

"This insincere attitude of the government is very disappointing," Hazare had told Press Trust of India. "I will not call off my hunger strike till the government initiates concrete steps beyond hollow assurances," he said. "They (Centre) are misleading the people on Lokpal bill. Also, the draft of Lokayukta bill by the Maharashtra government is also misleading, hence I am not accepting it," he said. "I was also told that the Supreme Court has given a date to the Centre for submission of its plan for appointing a search committee for Lokpal. The Centre also said that it will abide by the search committee's report. I will wait for it," he said.
