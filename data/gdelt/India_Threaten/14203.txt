SC restores Dalit status quo, but ‘forwards’ too make gains

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court judgment recalling its March 2018 order which diluted the flagship Dalit atrocities Act completes the restoration of status quo forced by SCs/STs through their vigorous protests.The outrage that followed the judicial imposition of checks on implementation of Prevention of Atrocities (POA) Act and the unanimity among the political class that the court order should be annulled had pushed the Modi government into a corner.The latter sought review of the controversial order and pending adjudication, brought a legislation to restore the original law in December last year which sailed through Parliament. Interestingly, so did the legislation for a quota for economically disadvantaged ‘forwards’, intended to assuage upper castes.Tuesday’s apex court order lends finality to the corrective action. It’s a relief for the ruling BJP which was under attack from political rivals and civil society alike.Given the persistent demand among upper castes and OBCs that the stringent POA needed to be diluted, and the strong resonance the March 2018 judgment found among them, the political-judicial imprimatur on the inviolability of the contentious law somewhat repairs the political leverage that Dalits enjoyed over decades and which appeared on the wane.As the affirmative action for Dalits appeared under threat, high-profile anti-Dalit incidents, from suicide of Rohith Vemula to Koregaon-Bhima attacks, introduced a social and political dimension to the debate.The retaliatory protests — demonstrations that shook Maharashtra in January 2018 and the April 2 national bandh against dilution of POA Act — raised the spectre of permanent caste rupture.Given the sense of siege among the community, reinstituting of safeguards is likely to douse the tempers. But if it all seems back to square one, a major gainer have been the upper castes which used the situation to extract the impossible.During the climax of the debate on Dalit rights and the correctives taken by the BJP regime, the forwards organised themselves in a way that the saffron defeat in its forts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan in December 2018 appeared their doing.Rattled by assembly defeats and with Lok Sabha polls looming, the Modi government carved reservations for upper castes by introducing ‘economic criteria’ for quotas — angrily derided by rights activists as “perverse”.It has put the historically underprivileged and the privileged castes on the same footing on the issue of empowerment, hitherto an unthinkable proposition.
