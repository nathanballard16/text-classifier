Dahod cops asked to use water judiciously

VADODARA: The Dahod police has instructed its personnel staying in the police line to use water judiciously in wake of the lesser supply of water to the town from the Kadana reservoir . Those staying in the quarters have also been warned that if water is wasted, the matter will be reported to the district superintendent of police (SP).Dahod is known to face water woes in summer as it does not have any major source of water locally. Projects are underway to bring water to the district and ensure that the issue is resolved, but the situation this summer remains grim.The circular issued by the reserve police sub-inspector (PSI) apart from other steps has asked those staying in the police line to stop washing their vehicles daily. It also instructs that the residents should not quarrel with the person responsible for water supply if there were any problems.Dahod SP Hitesh Joysar said that the notice was issued much like other directives for cleanliness and other aspects in the police line. “The reserve PSI had brought the issue to my notice following which the circular has been issued. There is no immediate crisis of water, but the idea is to ensure that water is preserved,” he said.The police line has hundreds of vehicles including those of personnel as well as those of the department. Joysar said that if these are washed everyday and lot of water would be consumed.
