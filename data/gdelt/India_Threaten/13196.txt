Former Haryana Congress president Ashok Tanwar on Saturday struck a conciliatory note when he said here that he and his supporters would “actively work on the ground” to ensure the Congress Party’s win in the upcoming state election.

Visibly upset at being removed from state president’s post a few days back, Tanwar had given the formal taking over by new Haryana poll leaders in Chandigarh—Kumari Selja (state chief) and Bhupinder Singh Hooda (CLP leader) the miss.

Speaking after a meeting his aides here, Tanwar said, “Me and all state Congress workers who spent five years slogging in the field will put in our best in the state election and work for the party’s victory. These workers have an impact on the ground and we will use that impact to the party’s advantage.”

Tanwar added that he had flagged to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and ex party chief Rahul Gandhi the need to take care of the state workers in the forthcoming election.

Tanwar had earlier argued that leaders who contested the Lok Sabha poll should not contest the state election in Haryana and new candidates should be given the chance.

Asked if he would congratulate Selja and Hooda, Tanwar said, “I’ve already done that. I congratulate them both and wish they work hard and improve the party’s vote percentage by 10 points.”

Tanwar said he had been speaking to the leaders who had phoned him. There has been talk that Tanwar is upset and avoided phone calls by senior state leaders but he denied having ignored any call.

“I took every call I got,” said Tanwar in the first indication of some harmony in the state unit ranks mired by factionalism.
