Don't be complacent if alliance doesn't happen, be ready to fight: Uddhav tells Shiv Sena leaders

Saffron allies Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seem to be heading towards another standoff over seat-sharing ahead of the Maharashtra assembly elections.

Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray has made it clear to top party leaders to be prepared to contest for all 288 seats in Maharashtra, in case the alliance with BJP does not remain intact.

Uddhav Thackeray had called a meeting of top party leaders ahead of the assembly elections in Maharashtra.

Sources told India Today TV that the core issue discussed during the meeting revolved around seat sharing.

Several reports indicated that BJP is offering a lesser number of seats to its state ally, following which some Sena leaders said the deal should not be accepted.

Uddhav assured the leaders that the BJP top brass assured him of 50-50 seat sharing. While Uddhav was sure that the alliance would continue, he added that party leaders should be prepared to fight for all 288 assembly seats alone.

BJP and Shiv Sena entered an alliance days before the Lok Sabha elections 2019, following which it was agreed that both parties will be contesting on an equal number of seats in the upcoming state assembly elections, after giving other allies their shares.

Seat sharing seems to have become again become the bone of contention for both the parties.

While Uddhav Thackeray remains confident that BJP will agree to his party's terms, Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has remained non-committal and just said that discussions are on.
