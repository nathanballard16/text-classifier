Companies fail to detect cyber attacks even as overall number of attacks increased in 2018: F-Secure Research

-Even as cybersecurity data shows a significant increase in attack traffic in the second half of 2018, 14.5% Indian companies failed to detect any attacks during that time period, finds cybersecurity provider F-Secure . Attack traffic observed by F-Secure’s network of decoy honeypots in 2018 increased by 32% over the previous year and increased fourfold in the latter half of 2018 compared with the first half of the year. However, survey data showed that many companies may not have the visibility they need to catch attacks that make it past preventative measures like firewalls and endpoint protection . 22% of companies did not detect a single attack in a 12-month period, 20 % detected a single attack during that time frame, and 31% detected two-five attacks.In contrast, F-Secure’s detection and response solutions detected 15 threats in a single month at a company with 1300 endpoints and seven threats in a single month at a company with 325 endpoints. About one-third of F-Secure’s survey respondents indicated that they were using a detection and response solution or service.F-Secure Vice President of Cyber Security Products Research & Development Leszek Tasiemski said, “Today’s threats are completely different from 10 or even 5 years ago. Preventative measures and strategies won’t stop everything anymore, so I’ve no doubt that many of the companies surveyed don’t have a full picture of what’s going on with their security. Many organizations don’t really value security until an incident threatens to cost them a lot of money, so I’m not completely surprised that there are companies detecting zero attacks over the course of a year.”While the healthcare and manufacturing sectors detected the fewest number of attacks, finance and ICT saw the maximum number of attacks. The largest source and destination of observed attack traffic were US-based IP addresses.
