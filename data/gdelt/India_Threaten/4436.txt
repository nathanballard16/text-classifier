Congress stakes claim to form govt in Goa

PANAJI: The Congress party once again urged Goa governor Mridula Sinha to dismiss the Manohar Parrikar-led coalition government which had “lost the trust of the people” and instead invite the Congress, which remains the single largest party, to form the state government.The Congress said that the strength of the BJP in the 40-member state legislative assembly could “dwindle” further but cautioned Sinha from recommending President’s rule in the state.The letter, signed by opposition leader Chandrakant Kavlekar, was submitted to Sinha on Saturday. The Congress also sought an appointment with Sinha to justify their claim to form the government.“We are staking our claim to form the state government and demand that we be called to form the government forthwith by dismissing the incumbent BJP led government,” Kavlekar said.“Any action in violation of the constitutional mandate to invite the single largest party to form the government and any attempt made to bring the state under President’s rule will be undemocratic and illegal and will be challenged as deemed fit.”The Congress’s claim comes after the demise of former Mapusa BJP MLA Francis D’Souza.Meanwhile, the Goa unit of BJP has called a meeting of its MLAs in Panaji today, reported news agency ANI.
