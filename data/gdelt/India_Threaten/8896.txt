Niti’s new road map: Only electric vehicles to be sold after 2030, Auto News, ET Auto

The government's think tank NITI Aayog has proposed that only electric vehicles should be sold after 2030, expanding the scope of the clean fuel technology beyond two- and three-wheelers.Earlier, a panel headed by NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant had suggested that only electric-powered three-wheelers and two-wheelers with engine capacity of up to 150 cc should be sold from 2025.Now, it has moved a Cabinet note, seeking to fix responsibility for different ministries, with the road transport and highways ministry proposed to prepare a framework to phase out the sale of diesel and petrol vehicles by 2030.It has also suggested that the ministry pilots an e-highways programme - with an overhead electricity network - to enable plying of trucks and buses on select National Highways. The proposals are part of the plan to manufacture 50 Gigawatt hour (GWh) batteries by 2030.The plan comes amid intense lobbying by the automobile industry , which is opposed to the push for 100% electric vehicles, with the Japanese and Korean companies leading the charge with support from Indian veterans such as Rahul Bajaj and Venu Srinivasan.Transport minister Nitin Gadkari - who had once threatened to mandate EVs from 2030 - has now said that the roadmap will be decided after consulting the industry.The Cabinet proposal has suggested that Gadkari's ministry should be tasked with issuing norms for cab aggregators to replace all diesel and petrol-fuelled vehicles with EVs by 2030. Similarly, the heavy industries ministry would go for complete replacement of all diesel/ petrol vehicles with EVs of all central ministries, agencies and public sector by 2030.To meet the target of setting up of the Giga-scale battery manufacturing, the think tank has proposed extending financial incentives to the investors including cash subsidy on the basis of overall domestic value addition per kilowatt hour (KWh) basis.It has estimated that the annual subsidy outgo would be around Rs 8,000 crore. The subsidy will be given to the manufacturers after the actual sale.In its effort to ensure that there is no monopoly of the manufacturers and the batteries are manufactured domestically, the maximum cash subsidy would be for up to 20 GWh per firm and Rs 2,000 cash subsidy will be for one KWh only for 100% domestic value capture, which means the minimum percentage of manufacturing in India.It has also proposed that any manufacturer has to go for 60% domestic value capture and in those cases the cash subsidy would be Rs 1,200 per KWh.Sources said the companies bidding for the scheme would have to go for at least 5 GWh battery manufacturing and they would have to achieve the target in five years. In case of failure to meet the target, the cash subsidy per KWh battery would be slashed.Niti Aayog has estimated that the sale of EVs will help save about Rs 3 lakh crore on account of the import of crude oil to meet the growing demand. It has also projected that while 79% of the battery pack can be indigenised only 21% minerals will need to be imported.The think tank has also said that battery manufacturing in this large scale would generate about 10 lakh direct and indirect jobs. To attract investors, it has also proposed complete tax exemption on the capital expenditure during the first year and other concessions besides making land and other clearances available.While the Niti Aayog in its Cabinet proposal has suggested the highways ministry identify stretches for electric-highways, Union minister Nitin Gadkari has said India may could have such a stretch with help from Sweden. He has said that the upcoming Delhi-Mumbai expressway will be the ideal stretch.The electric highways are those where overhead electric cable is laid to allow trucks to operate as electric vehicles when on the electrified road and as regular hybrid vehicles at other times. After Sweden, recently Germany started a similar pilot on a stretch.
