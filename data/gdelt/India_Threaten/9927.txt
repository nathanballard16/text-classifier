Married woman elopes with domestic help, steals cash and jewellery

Ludhiana: A married woman has eloped with the domestic help of her house along with cash and jewellery, after giving sedatives to her family in Chaudhary Colony of Moti Nagar in the wee hours of Thursday. The domestic help was earlier working at the woman’s parental house, but after her marriage, she called him to work at her in-law’s house. The Moti Nagar police have registered a case against the woman, Indu Bala (30), and domestic help Ashish Kumar.

Complainant Gaurav Kumar (33), who works as a deputy manager in a bank stated that he got married to Indu on March 18 last year. Ashish was earlier working at Indu’s parental house, but two months after their marriage, Indu brought Ashish to their home against his will. When he asked Indu to send Ashish back, she started fighting with him. Gaurav added that later he came to know Indu had an affair with Ashish. When he questioned her, Indu filed a complaint against him at the women’s cell, but later withdrew it.

Gaurav alleged that on July 10, Indu cooked dinner for all. After having dinner, he and his parents lost consciousness. When he woke up on Thursday morning, he found his wife and Ashish missing, while their cash, jewellery, and valuables were stolen. On inquiry, he came to know from neighbours that Indu had escaped with Ashish in a car.

Investigating officer from Moti Nagar police station, sub-inspector Baldev Singh said an FIR under sections 328 (causing hurt by means of poison, etc., with intent to commit an offence), 457 (lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to commit offence punishable with imprisonment), and 380 (theft in dwelling house, etc) of the IPC was registered against the accused. The police have launched a manhunt for their arrest.
