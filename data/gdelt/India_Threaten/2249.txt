Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince MBS Visits Pakistan Amid Deepening Tensions With Neighbor India

Amid ties worsening between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan, Saudi Arabia's crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has decided not to call off his visit to Pakistan.

Earlier this week, India's security forces in Kashmir, a region claimed both by India and Pakistan, were the target of a massive attack which led to the death of 44 members of India's CRPF, a paramilitary unit. It is believed that a vehicle carrying nearly 350 kgs of explosives rammed into one of the buses in the convoy, killing everyone onboard.

India has vowed to isolate Pakistan internationally as it blames the attack on Islamabad. According to Reuters, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for the attack, which India says has the backing of the Pakistani government and military. Pakistan has denied this claim, but India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised that action will be taken to avenge the deaths of CRPF personnel.

India's efforts to isolate Pakistan are not having the desired immediate effect, with Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammed bin Salman not calling off his scheduled visit to Islamabad.

This is the first high-profile visit by an international leader under the rule of new Pakistani premier, Imran Khan, who has been at the helm of the country only for a few months. Khan remains optimistic about MBS' visit, with Pakistani officials claiming that the Saudi Arabian crown prince is expected to sign agreements amounting to $10 billion.
