Salman Khan is reuniting with 'Hum Apke Hain Kaun' director Sooraj Barjatya for another family drama

Sooraj Barjatya made his directorial debut with Salman Khan's Maine Pyaar Kiya (1989) and the duo hasn't stopped teaming up since.

After hits like Hum Aapke Hain Kon and Hum Saath Saath Hain, the duo is working on another family drama.

Salman Khan, who made his breakthrough with Maine Pyaar Kiya (his second film), hasn't commented on the matter as of yet but Bartajya confirmed the news to Mumbai Mirror.

"It's a family drama, but not about joint family. It's about [a] husband and wife and I've already discussed the idea with Salman."

The film, although planned, has not yet gone into production as the two are occupied, Salman Khan with his Rohit Shetty cop-drama and Sooraj with Hum Chaar.

"Right now the focus is on Hum Chaar. Then my younger son Avnish will debut as a writer-director with a film this year. It's a very big responsibility. After that I start writing my film with Salman," said the filmmaker.

This will be the fifth time the duo has teamed up for a film, the last one being Prem Ratan Dhan Payo. So far, the two have been successful in their ventures so we have a feeling the next project would do just as well.
