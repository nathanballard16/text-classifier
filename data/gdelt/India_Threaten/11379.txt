Opinion | Splitting Jammu & Kashmir A Masterstroke, India Has Derailed Pakistan's Leadership Role In Afghan Peace Process

August 5, 2019, will go down in history as one of the most momentous days in India’s history. It was the day when the state of Jammu and Kashmir was obliterated from the map of India. But in reality, a historic wrong was corrected. An unholy compromise done post-Partition—for whatever reason, knowingly or unknowingly—was annulled by Parliament. A resolution was passed by Lok Sabha approving abrogation of the special status to Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of the Constitution and a Bill was passed for splitting the state into Union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

There have been numerous committees, study groups and research teams, both official and sponsored by NGOs, and think-tanks trying to und­erstand the “Kashmir crisis” and finding solutions. Over a dozen reports by government-appointed interlocutors have been gathering dust. Even in recent times, a self-appointed expert committee of concerned citizens led by a former Union minister came out with “stunning findings” on the “alienation” and “disempowerment” among Kashmiri youth. If the wisdom of this team is to be believed, the highly-educated but unemployed, alienated youth of Kashmir have managed to quickly acquire guns and these gun-wielding youth may do something desperate, like attacking the Amarnath Yatra.
