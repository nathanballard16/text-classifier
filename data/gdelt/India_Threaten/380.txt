A 22-year-old man was arrested Monday for allegedly setting his father ablaze while the latter was asleep at their home in Kolkata’s Garfa area. Police said the accused — identified as Amit Kumar, a mobile showroom employee — and his mother would regularly fight with his father Kaleshwar Ram (50), over his excessive drinking. On Sunday night, the accused returned home to find his father in an intoxicated state. The two then had an argument. After his father fell asleep, Kumar allegedly poured kerosone on him and set him ablaze.
