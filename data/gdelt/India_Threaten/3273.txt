Amman, Feb. 27 (Petra) -- Pakistan shot down two Indian Air Force jets in the Indian airspace on Wednesday and captured a pilot, Pakistani military stated.



Pakistan's foreign ministry confirmed that it conducted airstrikes in Indian-controlled Kashmir, after India launched airstrikes in Pakistan territory Tuesday.

The Pakistani Foreign Affairs Minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, said that India must act more responsibly, warning New Delhi of challenging his country.



Amid the rising tensions, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has urged India and Pakistan to avoid "further military activity" following a dramatic escalation in tensions between the two South Asian neighbors.
