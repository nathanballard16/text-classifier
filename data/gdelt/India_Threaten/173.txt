Left parties stage protest

To condemn burning of CPI flags by VHP members

Members of the Communist Party of India and Communist Party of India (Marxist) staged a protest in Varadharajapuram Medu on Friday, condemning the burning and tearing down of CPI flags in Singanallur.

On Thursday afternoon, three persons went to the CPI branch office in Singanallur, damaged the flags and threatened to kill the party workers. Following the incident, the CPI workers lodged a complaint with the Singanallur police. The police arrested R. Sowminarayanan (28) of Uppilipalayam and V. Sarathkumar (22) of Sulur and are on the look for Bharath, who had accompanied the two. The polices said the three belonged to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad.

On Friday, CPI State Treasurer M. Arumugham, who led the protest, said what the Kerala Government tried to do in Sabarimala issue was just to implement the Supreme Court order allowing women of all age groups to enter the hill shrine.

Those people who were opposed to the order should either fight legally or protest against the Supreme Court and not against the Kerala Government. He also said that the issue concerned Kerala and there was no problem in Tamil Nadu. The Hindu organisations were only trying to trigger communal tension in Coimbatore. The police should take steps to maintain law and order.

CPI(M) district secretary V. Ramamoorthy, the party's State executive committee member C. Padmanabhan, CPI district secretary V.M. Sundaram and others participated.
