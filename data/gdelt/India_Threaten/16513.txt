OIC a platform uniting the Muslim world: Dr. Firdous

Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Information Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan has said that Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was a platform uniting the Muslim world.

Talking to media persons after her arrival at Jeddah, she said that Pakistan had always played its due role for Ummah's unity and resolution of its problems.

She said in the present world scenario, there was a dire need to forge unity among the Muslim world and Prime Minister Imran Khan had emerged as an active leader.

The SAPM said that there was need to promote the real message of Islam from the platform of the OIC.

She said that negative propaganda against Islam could be countered by projecting the real message of Islam.

She urged the OIC members to pay heed to the cries of the hapless Kashmiris and represent their sentiments and pressurize India to give the people of Kashmir their inherent right to self-determination.
