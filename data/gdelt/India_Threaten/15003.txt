Rajnath warns Pakistan to stop its anti-India activities or face befitting reply

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Monday warned Pakistan to stop its terror activities to destabilise India or face befitting reply.

"Our soldiers never launch offensive against Pakistan. The other side is doing activities to destablise India (by sponsoring terrorism and resorting to shelling, Singh said at a function in the inauguration of 1,400-ft bridge across the Shyok River near the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with China in Leh district of Ladakh.

"If this is not stopped or controlled, we will continue to give befitting reply," Singh said.

Singh said that India has good relations with China. China spoke nothing regarding Kashmir during meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and considers Kashmir as an internal issue of India, he added.

The Colonel Chewang Rinchen Bridge falls at the fag end of the recently-completed road connecting Leh with the Karakoram Pass and will allow ease of troop movement to the Daulat Beg Oldi sector.

Colonel Rinchen remains one of the six forces personnel to have won the Maha Vir Chakra, the second highest military honour presented for acts of gallantry in the presence of the enemy, on two occasions during his career.

He was first honoured with the Maha Vir Chakra in 1948 during the first Indo-Pak conflict over the Kashmir issue.

He was conferred the award for a second time for gallantry displayed during Operation Cactus Lily in December 1971 during which he freed nine enemy strong points, held by one to two platoons, in Partapur sector in Ladakh.

Singh was accompanied by Army chief General Bipin Rawat and Director General of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) Lt Gen Harpal Singh during the inauguration of the strategic bridge.
