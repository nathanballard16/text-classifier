CMRL, employees call a truce

Staff resume work after firm says it will consider taking back workers

The Chennai Metro Rail Limited (CMRL) has agreed in the labour conciliation meeting held with union members to look into the issue of reinstating the operation and maintenance staff who were removed from service. On the basis of this assurance, the employees had called off the strike and returned to work on Thursday.

The CMRL, in a press release, has said that the O&M staff who were removed could prefer an appeal, as per the procedures laid down. It thanked the service rendered by the staff and outsourcing personnel for helping to carry on with the metro services during the strike on Tuesday.

The release further indicated CMRL’s attitude to the sabotage activity in no uncertain terms: “CMRL is concerned about its staff welfare but will not tolerate any action which will cause inconvenience to our commuters. Service to our Metro commuters is supreme.”

‘Vindictive attitude’

The Centre of India Trade Unions (CITU), while welcoming the officials of CMRL to allow an appeal to higher authorities for revoking the suspension of seven employees (of eight employees in total) made at the meeting held at the Labour Commissioner’s office, point out the vindictive attitude of the organisation against the employees who participated in the strike.

In a press statement issued by A. Soundarajan, president of CITU, the employees who reported to duty on Thursday were not allowed to work at their respective workplace and were asked to sign in separate entry forms. This vindictive measure of not allowing the employees to work at their regular workplace was against the cordial management-labour relationship and wanted the employees to be allotted their regular work.
