Indian man arrested for eating sloth bear penises in bid to improve libido

A man in India was arrested Saturday for allegedly slaughtering numerous sloth bears and eating their penises in a bid to improve his libido, a report said.

The man, who uses several aliases, but is now known as Yarlen, has been on the lam since 2014 — a year after he was arrested for allegedly killing two of the animals in Kanha National Park, BBC reported.

In that case, Yarlen spent a year in jail before going on the run once he was let out on bail.

The nomadic tribe Yarlen is part of, the Pardhi-Behelia, believes sloth bear genitals are aphrodisiacs, the report said.

Indian authorities believe Yarlen is also a suspect in the poaching of endangered wild animals, including tigers, across the country.

“We created a special cell to track him down and arrest him,” Ritesh Sirothia of the Madhya Pradesh Forest Department told the outlet.

“It was our longest chase, it went on for six years.”

Sirothia said Yarlen was wanted for six crimes — including three related to tiger poaching — in the states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.
