Pakistan summons Indian envoy; rejects objections over Qureshi's phone call to Hurriyat leader

In a response to India’s protests against the telephonic conversation of Qureshi with the Hurriyat leader, Pakistan’s Foreign Office in a statement issued Wednesday midnight said that the country "categorically rejects the objections" by India.

New Delhi: In a retaliatory move, Pakistan Foreign secretary Tehmina Janjua summoned India's high commissioner on Thursday, after India summoned its envoy in New Delhi, following the country’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's telephonic conversation with separatist Kashmiri leader Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. On Wednesday, India had summoned Pakistan’s envoy Sohail Mahmood in New Delhi and had categorically told him that Qureshi’s conversation with Farooq was a “brazen attempt” to subvert India's unity and violate its sovereignty and territorial integrity. After India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale summoned Pakistani envoy Sohail Mahmood, the Ministry of External Affairs, said in a statement, that Pakistan High Commissioner was "cautioned" that persistence of such behaviour by Pakistan will have "implications". Following this, Pakistan Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua summoned Indian High Commissioner Ajay Bisaria to lodge a protest over the summoning of Pakistan's envoy, the country’s Foreign Office said. Janjua made it clear to Bisaria that Pakistan would continue to extend support to the people of Kashmir.
