US sanction call attack on India’s sovereignty: MP

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah moved the Citizenship Amendment Bill to protect the unity and security of the country and enable persecuted persons defined by the legislation, and the call for sanctions by a US panel was an attack on India’s sovereignty, BJP MP Nishikant Dubey said in Lok Sabha on Wednesday.Referring to reports that the US Commission for International Religious Freedom had called for sanctions against the home minister, the BJP MP said, “This is a matter of concern for the entire House.” He said it was a matter of shame for the entire country, adding that a senior Indian minister should be named on the basis of untruths.
