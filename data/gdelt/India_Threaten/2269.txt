Terrorising Kashmiris outside J&K will alienate them: Omar

SRINAGAR, Feb 17: Former chief minister Omar Abdullah today warned that attacking and terrorising people of Kashmiri origin outside the state will lead to their further alienation from India.

In a series of tweets, Omar also called for the safety of Kashmiris living or studying outside the state.

"Our enemies and those who back terrorism in J&K have been trying to drive this wedge so please please let’s not do their job for them. Kashmir isn’t just a piece of land it’s the people that inhabit it."

"Those hotheads that make up the mobs doing this damage need to ask themselves (if they have the mental bandwidth) whose purpose is served by ostracising Kashmiris."

"By attacking them, terrorising them and forcing them to find shelter they are being told there is no place for them outside the valley & no future in the mainland."

Mehbooba Mufti also condemned the reports of harassment of Kashmiri students across the country.

"Tragic that educated & civilised citizens are spearheading a vicious propaganda to paint all Kashmiris with the same brush. What is the difference between you and those who indoctrinate vulnerable men for Jehad? Isn't this also a type of religious indoctrination?" she wrote.
