On Monday, without naming AIMIM Chief Asaduddin Owaisi, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had warned against the rise of extremism among minorities who has a base in Hyderabad.

Reacting on Banerjee’s allegations, Owaisi on Tuesday said, “By making such allegations against me you are giving the message to Muslims of Bengal that Owaisi’s party has become a formidable force in the state. Mamata Banerjee is showcasing her fear and frustration by making such comments.”

It may be recalled that AIMIM had recently entered the Hindi belt by winning Bihar’s Kishanganj seat.
