Man Miraculously Survives After A 4ft-Long Iron Rod Pierces His Chest Just Below His Neck

In a horrific incident, a daily wage labourer who had come to Madurai for work on Monday, miraculously survived after a four-foot-long rod pierced into his chest. The doctors were successful in removing the rod from his chest.

The 28-year-old man, Gurusamy, had accidentally fallen into a roadside ditch that was under construction. He hailed from Andipatti Bungalow near Vadipatti and was returning home when the accident happened.

Dr K Vanitha dean of Government Rajaji Hospital, said that Gurusamy was riding a two-wheeler with his friend on late Tuesday night and lost the balance of the vehicle when they were reaching the Melavasal area.

The two men fell into a channel which had iron rods coming out of it. A pointed rod then pierced into Gurusamy’s chest just below the neck and came out from the other side. His friend was lucky enough just to have suffered some minor injuries, but alerted the passersby.

Gurusamy was immediately rushed to the hospital in the ambulance and was given first aid after which the doctors operated him for five hours. Doctors also said that the man was lucky that the iron rod did not damage any of his vital parts.

"The availability of experts and medicines at that early hour helped make the surgery a success," Vanitha told The Times Of India.

The man was in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for two days and would be discharged after few days. The doctors have advised him to take a lot of rest.
