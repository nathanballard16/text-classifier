‘Call to Pak-based terrorists to undertake terror attack in India’

NEW DELHI, Apr 7: India on Sunday rejected as “irresponsible and preposterous” Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s comments that India was planning to attack Pakistan again between April 16 and 20.

In a strongly worded statement, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the comments by the Pakistani Foreign Minister are aimed at whipping up war hysteria in the region.

“India rejects the irresponsible and preposterous statement by the Foreign Minister of Pakistan with a clear objective of whipping up war hysteria in the region. This public gimmick appears to be a call to Pakistan-based terrorists to undertake a terror attack in India,” Kumar said.

The MEA spokesperson’s statement came hours after Qureshi said in a press conference in Multan that Pakistan has “reliable intelligence” that India is planning to attack Pakistan again between April 16 and 20.
