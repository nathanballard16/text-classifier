Kidney racket: report to be ready in a week

Management of the hospital to be questioned by committee on Monday

A three-member committee formed by the Collector to look into an alleged case of illegal kidney transplant at a city-based private hospital was instructed to submit its report within a week.

District Medical & Health Officer (DMHO) Tirupathi Rao, who is a member of the committee, said that they have prepared a questionaire to look into the issue.

“The committee will check how many alleged illegal transplantations have been performed by the hospital. It would also find out how the doctors forged the relevant documents before conducting organ transplant and a few others. As per the instructions of the Collector, the committee will submit its report in a week,” Mr. Tirupathi Rao said.

Sources from the police department said that the management of the hospital would be questioned by the committee on Monday. “The police department has summoned the management, and if they ignore the summons, action would be initiated,” a police officer said.

It may be recalled that M.R. Peta police had arrested two doctors — M Manjunath (34), an Ayurvedic doctor from Bengaluru, and D. Prabhakar (35) — on Thursday, on the charges of illegally transplanting a kidney. The incident came to light after the complainant, who is also an organ donor, approached police, claiming that he was cheated in terms of payment.
