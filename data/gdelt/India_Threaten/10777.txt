UN hails India’s move towards increasing tiger population

The UN chief Antonio Guterres hailed India’s initiatives for achieving the target of highest target population which has shown an incredible rise in the number of big cats from 1,411 in 2006 to 2,967 in 2018. A spokesperson for the UN chief Antonio Guterres considered this as a “good sign” as India meets the UN’s sustainable development goal (SDG) that seeks preservation of all species especially those, endangered.

Commenting about the increase in tiger population in India, Secretary-General Guterres’ Deputy Spokesperson Farhan Haq said, “We have a Sustainable Development Goal which encourages the preservation of biodiversity and of all species including, in particularly, those that are endangered. So, it’s always a good sign if endangered species are, in fact, being protected.”

India has emerged as one of the biggest and safest place in the world habituating around 3,000 tigers.
