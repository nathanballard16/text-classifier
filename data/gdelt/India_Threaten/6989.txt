Colombo Easter suicide bombers travelled to Kerala, Kashmir: Sri Lankan Army chief

Two of them reportedly travelled to India in 2017.

Sri Lanka’s Army chief Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayke said that some of the terrorists involved in the Colombo Easter bombings travelled to India, possibly to participate in terrorism training.

He told BBC: “They had gone to India, travelling to Bangalore, Kashmir and Kerala state, (according to) information available with us. It would have been for some sort of a training or to establish links with other organisations outside the country”.

Two of them reportedly travelled to India in 2017.

A Union Home Ministry official however said that the Sri Lankan Army hadn’t shared any info officially.

Key suspect and mastermind Maulvi Zahran Bin Hashim – an Islamic preacher – is believed to be one of the individuals who visited India.
