On the first day of college after summer vacation, students have been observing this day and causing public nuisance, despite repeated warnings by Chennai Police. This time as well, the students did not shy away from climbing atop the bus and trying out stunts.

Even after strict warnings, students of Pachayappa'a College and Ambedkar Arts and Science College in Chennai were caught on camera celebrating Bus Day on Monday. Many were old students influencing freshers to celebrate Bus Day by creating a ruckus.

The students were hanging by the window bars on a moving bus, climbing up its roof and even blocking traffic to take group photographs in front of the bus.

Despite the Madras High Court coming down heavily on Bus Day celebrations, the nuisance still continues even this year.

The police identified and detained 24 students in connection to the Bus Day celebrations in the city.
