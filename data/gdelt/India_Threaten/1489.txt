‘Clarify stand on Ram Temple,’ Amit Shah dares Rahul Gandhi

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah intensified the Ram Temple pitch in Uttarakhand and West Bengal on Saturday by reiterating the party’s promise to build the temple in Ayodhya at the earliest even as he accused opposition parties of creating obstacles.

Addressing party workers in Dehradun, he said, “BJP ki niti spasht hai, usi jagah par bhavya Ram Mandir jaldi se jaldi banayein (BJP’s policy is clear to build Ram temple at the same place at the earliest).”

He accused the Congress of being the biggest hurdle in achieving the resolution on the temple and asked Congress president Rahul Gandhi to clarify his stand on the issue. “Rahul Baba, clear your stand. Whether or not you want the Ram Temple?”

Reacting to Shah’s allegations, Suryakant Dhasmana, vice president, Uttarakhand Congress, said, “India is a secular country and its government should work for development and not to make religious structures. Secondly, BJP has failed to make the temple which was listed in its manifesto. Why should Rahul Gandhi answer Shah’s question on Ram Temple?...”

Uttar Pradesh Congress president Raj Babbar countered Shah’s charges, stating : ... “Instead of talking about building a Ram temple in Ayodhya, the BJP leaders appear indulging in politics on the issue by talking about a dispute over land there,”

Addressing a gathering of BJP’s booth presidents in western UP’s Amroha, Shah also hit out at the recent tie-up between Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party in Uttar Pradesh. The coalition of “bua-bhatija” (Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati) reflected that they were all together against BJP, he said. “But, even if three or four such coalitions are made in these states, they won’t be able to win.”
