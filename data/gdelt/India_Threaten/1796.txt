The gloves are off

A degree of combativeness is only to be expected ahead of a crucial election. But if what the PM said, and what he didn’t say, in Lok Sabha on Thursday is an indication, the campaign for 2019 may be more about stoking fear than promising hope.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reply to the debate on the motion of thanks to the President’s speech in the Lok Sabha offered a sobering glimpse of the election campaign to come. A spectre, and spectral oppositions, underlay his speech. The PM warned against the coalition government. “Milavati sarkar” vs “poorna bahumat ki sarkar” (coalition government vs government with a majority) — the latter, he said, worked in national interest (“deshvasiyon ke liye samarpit”), the former did not. “Mahamilavat”, or grand alliance, was associated, he suggested, with instability, corruption, dynastic politics, it was bad for a nation’s health. He accused the Congress of dividing history into BC, Before Congress, and AD, After Dynasty, in order to project that nothing had happened before it came to power and to attribute all achievements to the Gandhis. At the same time, the PM himself repeatedly invoked a before-and-after scenario — 55 years of power play (“satta bhog”) vs 55 months of service (“seva bhav”). He countered the Opposition’s criticism against his government, that it shows disrespect to institutions, by questioning the Congress’s own record, pointing out that it was the party that imposed the Emergency and misused Article 356. When the Opposition criticises him or the BJP, it runs the risk of criticising the nation itself, suggested the PM.
