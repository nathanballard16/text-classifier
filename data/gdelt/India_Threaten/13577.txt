New York, September 20

India will soar high if Pakistan “stoops low” by raising the Kashmir issue at a high-level UN General Assembly session here next week, India’s top envoy to the United Nations has asserted, warning that Islamabad may mainstream “hate speech” after normalising terrorism in the past.

With an anticipated rant by Pakistan on Kashmir during the UNGA session, India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Syed Akbaruddin at a press conference here on Thursday said “poison pens” didn’t work for too long.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has vowed to raise the Kashmir issue at the UNGA session here on September 27. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also scheduled to speak on the same day.

Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said Khan would “forcefully” raise the issue before the international community during his address to the UNGA.

“We explained to you what our approach is and what our orientation is and how we are working very differently from our previous experiences. But there may be somebody who is wanting to bring an issue which they have raised before...Your question further is that what if they become more shrill, what if they raise it in a much more sharper manner,” Akbaruddin said.

He was responding to a question on whether he expected Kashmir to be raised during the UN General Assembly session and how India would tackle it.

“What you’re telling me is that it will be more of the same, much more of the same from the side of one country. If that is so, what is our response? So let me put it this way. That it is for every country to determine its trajectory of how it wants to approach global platforms. There may be some who stoop low. Our response to them is we soar high. They may stoop low, we soar high,” he said. PTI
