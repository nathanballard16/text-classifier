In a major move, the Andhra Pradesh government on Wednesday said that it was considering enforcing a ban on private practice of government doctors across the state.

The announcement came after an expert committee submitted a report to Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy on health reforms in the state. The committee was led by Dr Sujatha Rao, a former Union Secretary of Health under the Government of India and made 100 recommendations, according to the CMO.

During a review meeting at his camp office in Tadepalli in Amaravati on Wednesday, the Chief Minister had a lengthy discussion with the experts’ committee and officials on the contents of the report.

Besides the ban on private practice, the report also suggested that the salary of government doctors be increased. However, further details on the matter are yet to be revealed.

"The Chief Minister told officials to formulate guidelines for the same. He directed officials to release a notification for the recruitment of government doctors vacancies. The CM asked the expert committee to formulate policies to ensure that theoretical knowledge is applied to practical problems," a press note from the Chief Minister's Office (CMO) stated.
