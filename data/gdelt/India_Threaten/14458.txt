Pakistan Army's Terror Plan 'C': Trigger Communal Clashes, Stage 26/11-Like Attacks In India

New Delhi:

Pakistan is planning to trigger communal clashes and 26/11-like attacks as part of its new plan to target India. Pakistan Army and ISI is helping terrorist organisations like Lashkar-e-Taiba, Hizbul Mujaheeden and Jaish-e-Mohammed to carry out such attacks. According to sources, Pakistan Army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa is monitoring this new plan against India.

According to sources, Pakistan is attempting a three-pronged strategy attack against India ever since Modi government revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Plan 'A' was disturb the peace in Kashmir and other parts of India by using the terrorists and anti-India elements already present in India. Plan 'B' involved infiltrate terrorists into India to carry out attack. However, security forces have so far not allowed these plans to succeed. Pakistan, therefore, is now focusing on Plan 'C'.

This plan involves carrying out attacks on religious places during festive season in India to trigger communal tension and clashes. The Pakistan Army and ISI are also supporting these terrorist organistaion in planning and carrying out another big attack like the one in Mumbai in 2008. Apart from Pakistan-based terrorist organisations, modules of Indian Mujaheeden are also being called into action. IM is being tasked with these mission as they are said to have sleeper cells in India.
