She was hoping to get some answers out of Jihoon's friends since Jihoon was turning out to be someone different than she had believed him to be.Meanwhile, Jihoon was worried his friends would reveal "a bad thing" about him to Deavan because he had "f-cked up."Jihoon's friends were fascinated he was dating an American girl, and the group appeared to have fun and get drunk together. Jihoon's friends said he was like a child because he had no cares or worries in the world."Once he has money, he just can't keep it in his pocket. He has to spend it on something that day," one of Jihoon's friends told the cameras.Jihoon's friends told Jihoon to address Deavan's doubts, and then Jihoon revealed he had been selling used phones in China. The news disturbed Deavan because it meant her fiance had been involved in an international crime.Jihoon's friends had warned him the business was dangerous, but Jihoon admitted he was greedy and took advantage of an opportunity when it had presented itself."I now change jobs. I promise. Next time, I go to jail," Jihoon told Deavan. "I'm not doing illegal anymore, okay?"The guys told Deavan to trust Jihoon because he had changed, but she wasn't convinced.Two weeks into Deavan's stay in South Korea, nothing had panned out the way she had anticipated. Although the couple didn't even have an apartment of their own, Deavan planned to file marriage papers so she could reside in Jihoon's country permanently.Deavan was a little nervous to make their marriage official because of everything that had happened. Deavan had a lot to take in, but she said she loved Jihoon."I want to make sure everything is going to be okay and you're not going to buy anymore and we'll get the apartment," Deavan said."Enough," Jihoon replied. "Too much worry.""I feel you don't worry enough," Deavan pointed out, adding that she wanted confirmation Jihoon was paying off his debts because they'd soon become her own debt.Jihoon argued his debt was a personal problem, but she disagreed. Deavan therefore wanted to manage their money so she could figure out where it all goes, and Jihoon obliged, which made her feel better.Deavan decided to marry Jihoon because he was taking steps in the right direction and she loved him."We finally get married. I am excited. I'm happy. It just start," Jihoon gushed.Deavan wanted to have an actual wedding, but the pair knew that would take some time to plan.The second night of Laura and Aladin's traditional three-day Tunisian wedding was about to commence.Laura was disappointed her son Liam had chosen to sit out of the first night of events, and Aladin called him a child and said Liam's alleged sickness was just "an excuse" and he had been rude.Laura said her son had diarrhea and would also miss out on the second day of her wedding. She was upset and a bit angry, but she still defended Liam to the ground.Laura was adorned in gold jewels and a red and green dress and robe. As the bride, she sat on a fancy sofa, and guests threw money into a bucket as gifts for the groom and his mother.Laura said she put on a happy face and pretended it was the best day of her life, but she was feeling lonely deep down inside and just wanted to "disappear."Laura knew it was a long shot, but she hoped Liam would attend the third -- and final -- part of her wedding and maybe even bond with Aladin. Laura said if the two most important men in her life couldn't get along, she'd be "heartbroken."Because Aladin loved Laura, he said he would try to bond with Liam again, and so he brought Liam to a spa. Liam wanted Aladin to know what he was getting himself into, but he also wanted to know what his beloved mother was getting herself into.Aladin told Liam that he was upset about his absence, and Liam insisted he was really sick. However, Aladin pushed Laura's son to be honest with him and let him know if he had done something wrong."I was sick with a stomach ache because I ate something bad," Liam said. "[But] yes, I did have some complaints about you. And I did make some comparisons to men in the past."Liam didn't like Aladin but didn't want to come across rude or mean. He tried to be nice to Aladin and just wanted to leave it at that.Liam said he didn't want Aladin to try to be his stepfather, but Aladin said he'd never be his father given they're only eight years apart in age.Aladin let Liam know, however, he wanted to have children with Laura, but Laura had apparently informed Liam that she didn't want to have another child. Liam said it would be too dangerous for Laura to get pregnant again.Liam told Aladin that Laura still needed to take care of him, but then Aladin noted, "You can take care of yourself. You are not like a baby or something."Liam continued, "Once she has another child, she will stop paying attention to me... I can't trust you... She can't be having children. It's a bad idea. It's your responsibility to make sure she doesn't do it."Liam said if the couple decided to have a child, he'd be done with the both of them.Aladin cared about Liam because he's Laura's son, but he told the cameras that if Liam wanted to be cut throat with him, he wouldn't care about him. Aladin said he couldn't force Liam to attend his wedding, and if Liam didn't show up, the wedding wouldn't stop.Corey had been in Washington for three weeks after his father passed away. When he Skyped with Evelin, she was wearing her engagement ring, and Corey noted she had been much more "passionate" and "caring" towards him.Corey said Evelin had been very supportive and so he made the decision to return to Ecuador to be with the love of his life.Corey only had 30 days left on his visa, so he hoped to convince Evelin to marry him -- even though she had never envisioned herself becoming a wife.When Corey hugged his mother and said goodbye, he started to cry. His mother said everything would be okay and she'd be fine.Evelin told Corey to "hang in there" and enjoy life, because she wanted him to follow his heart and really discover whether Evelin is The One for him."My heart wants to go for Evelin, but everything else wants me to stay here," Corey told the cameras.Corey really hoped Evelin would want to tie the knot before his time in Ecuador ran out.When Corey returned to Ecuador, Evelin was actually waiting for him this time at the airport, and he was absolutely thrilled to see her. Corey was so relieved he wouldn't have to take a bus to Engabao again, which he admitted was a horrible experience.Evelin was so happy to see Corey because she felt like he had been gone for a year or two.But Evelin didn't want to get married and admitted to cameras it had never been one of her dreams. Evelin apologized for not being able to be by Corey's side when his dad passed away, and she made him a nice mean upon his return.Evelin also assured Corey that she had blocked her ex in every way. Evelin didn't want to have any more troubles with Corey, but it apparently took five years for Evelin to block her ex.Evelin said she had a great friendship with her ex but she understood Corey's concerns and wanted him to trust her and be happy. Corey said Evelin's effort showed she really cared about their relationship and wanted things to work.Corey had given everything up to move to Ecuador and commit to Evelin, and so he hoped she'd be open to the idea of marriage.Sumit admitted he had "lied a lot to everyone" and done "a lot of things wrong." Sumit told the cameras he had been married for two-and-a-half years."I was dating Jenny when my parents set up an arranged marriage, and I barely knew the girl before I married her," Sumit said.Sumit feared Jenny would leave him for good, but he at least felt relieved the truth had come out.Sumit told producers he had been held at his family's home for five days, leaving Jenny alone. He was apparently forbidden to have any contact with Jenny at that time.Sumit's family also declined participation in being filmed or conducting any on-camera interviews.After many days of being locked up, Sumit was allowed to visit with his friend Neeraj. Sumit said his family was made aware he loved and was living with Jenny. Neeraj lied to Jenny about Sumit being married because Sumit had allegedly asked him to.Neeraj had warned Sumit the situation was going to be a big mess, and he said Sumit couldn't even face his problems now.Sumit's family tried to convince him to stay with his wife, saying she's younger and more beautiful than Jenny. His family also pointed out Sumit could welcome children with his wife, but he wasn't happy."In other countries, it's about couples. They love each other, they get married. It's not the arranged marriage. If they're not happy and feel the marriage is not going good, they can get separated and divorced... I just want separation," Sumit said."No one should force me into a marriage... It's my decision. I want to be with Jenny. It's my right to be happy."Sumit was warned by his family that if he chose Jenny, the police would show up at his doorstep. While Neeraj pointed out having an affair is not a crime in India, Sumit's family could lie to authorities and say he beat his wife.Sumit said his family would lie in order to pressure him to stay with his wife. Sumit insisted he'd rather go to jail than stay in his marriage because he truly loved Jenny.Sumit determined he must sneak away so he could talk to Jenny. He finally stood up for himself and acknowledged now was not the time to take a step back.Want more news? Click here to visit our webpage!
