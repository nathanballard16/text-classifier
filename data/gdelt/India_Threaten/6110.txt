Bengaluru: Former Karnataka chief minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party leader BS Yeddyurappa on Friday mocked Janata Dal (Secular) supremo and former prime minister HD Deve Gowda over the latter’s statement supporting Rahul Gandhi’s aspirations of becoming the prime minister, and questioned how someone could keep an ambition of becoming the PM “when his party contests only on 7 seats?”.

“He is fighting on 7 seats and has ambitions of being Prime Minister or advisor to Prime Minister?” Yeddyurappa asked over Deve Gowda’s ‘If Rahul Gandhi becomes PM, I will sit by his side’.

Gowda had earlier in the day said that he would not want to retire like BJP veteran Lal Krishna Advani. “I want to save my party first and last the office building”, adding that if Rahul Gandhi becomes the PM, “I will sit by his side”.

He had announced three years ago that he would not contest polls, has now said that he would not retire from active politics like Advani. In the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections, Deve Gowda is contesting against GS Basvaraj of BJP Karnataka’s Tumkur parliamentary seat.
