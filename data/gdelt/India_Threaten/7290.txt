‘Stay indoors from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.’

More number of fever and dehydration cases being reported in hospitals: DMHO

With the severe heatwave conditions prevailing since the last couple of days in the State, health department officials of Visakhapatnam district cautioned citizens not to go outdoors during peak afternoon, unless it is absolutely necessary.

“People should avoid venturing out of houses between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., as the mercury rise could lead to sunstroke. If it is necessary to go out, it’s better to use umbrella, caps etc avoiding exposure to direct sunlight,” said District Medical & Health Officer Tirupathi Rao.

Humid conditions

Even though the temperature being registered in Visakhapatnam since the last couple of days is around 34 to 36° Celsius, with the humid conditions (Humidity over 70), citizens have been experiencing it as over 40° Celsius.

According to DMHO, number of fever cases are being reported at various hospitals, due to increase in temperatures. Health experts say that exhaustion can be caused due to water depletion or sodium depletion, which can lead to fever, fatigue, nausea, and other problems. They suggest people should take plenty of water even if they do not feel thirsty. They also say that those who sweat excessively should consume lime water with salt, coconut water etc. The doctors also caution pregnant women and elderly persons to be more cautious.

Mr. Tirupathi Rao said that they have made sure all the Primary Health Centres (PHCs), Community Health Centres (CHCs) have been stocked with Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) sachets, IV fluids etc.

“In all grama panchayats, we have arranged water kiosk centres, where fluids have been arranged. The ASHA workers have been informed to take necessary precautions in their areas,” Mr Tirpathi Rao added.
