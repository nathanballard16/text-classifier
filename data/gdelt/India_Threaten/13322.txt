No Shah, Sultan or Samrat can impose Hindi: Kamal Haasan

CHENNAI: Actor and Makkal Needhi Maiam leader Kamal Haasan on Monday reacted sharply to Union home minister Amit Shah’s push to make Hindi the national language , warning that the battle for language would be far bigger than the 2017 pro-Jallikattu protests in Tamil Nadu.He said any effort to impose Hindi on the state as against Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy (Tamil and English) would result in a massive protest. “Tamil Nadu and the country do not need or deserve such a battle,” the actor said in a statement.“Do not make an inclusive India into an exclusive one. All will suffer because of such short-sighted folly,” he said."Unity in diversity is a promise that we made when India became a Republic. Now, no Shah, Sultan or Samrat must relent (renege) on that promise. We respect all languages, but our mother language will always be Tamil,” he said.“Most of the nation happily sings the national anthem in Bengali with pride and will continue to do so. The reason is that the poet who wrote it gave due respect to all languages and culture within the anthem. And hence, it became our anthem,” he said in a video message.Shah on Saturday had pitched for Hindi as a common language for the country, reigniting the debate on the issue as parties in the South said they would oppose any attempt to "impose" the language. DMK chief M K Stalin had said Shah's views were "shocking". "This will certainly infringe national integrity and hence he should withdraw his views immediately," he told reporters.
