Change of IHK demography to be war crime, warns Masood

AJK President, Sardar Masood Khan has warned that Indian attempts to change demography of occupied Kashmir will be a violation of Geneva Convention, and a war crime under international law as well.

He was talking to PTI leader Col (ret) Raja Zamir Khan who called on him on Thursday, and discussed different aspects of Kashmir liberation movement, Indian brutalities in occupied Kashmir, and efforts being made on the international level to project liberation struggle.

The AJK president asserted that pressure on India was mounting on the international level , and the international community was now convinced that India’s claim over occupied Jammu and Kashmir is false and fraud.

This has bewildered India and now it has suddenly intensified state terrorism against defenseless and innocent Kashmiri people on the one hand, and increased violations of ceasefire line and unprovoked firing on the Line of Control on the other hand, he added

He said that after two reports by the UN Human Rights Commission and a number of reports of the UK parliament, India has deployed another 90,000 troops in occupied Kashmir, which reveals the future Indian designs.

He said that the Modi regime was poised to rehabilitate a large number of Indian Hindus in occupied Kashmir to turn the Muslim majority of the state into minority.

The AJK president said that the delicate situation of occupied Kashmir warrants all political forces of Azad Kashmir to demonstrate unity in their rank and file, and unanimously convey a message of solidarity to their brethren in the held territory.

“The way different political forces in occupied Kashmir had formed a joint resistance front and decided to carry forward their struggle, the people on the other side of the Line of Control desire to see this environment of unity and cohesion in Azad Kashmir also,” he added.
