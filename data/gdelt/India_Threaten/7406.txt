Ahmedabad: Dev Aurum complex yet to get all clear from fire department

The Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Service (AFES) department have still not given a No Objection Certificate to the A wing of the Dev Aurum complex located in Prahaladnagar area, after a fire broke out on April 7, which had endangered the lives of more than 100 people.

Two days after the incident, the Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra had sent a show-cause notice to chief fire officer MF Dastoor. Following that, the estate department of the AMC had sealed the entire complex after it was found lacking in fire safety systems. It has been more than a month, but the complex is still not operational as it has not received the NOC from the fire department.

Chief fire officer MF Dastoor said, "After the complex was sealed by the estate department, fire safety systems in the B and C wings of the building were checked and cleared by officials and now, both the wings are operative. But A wing of the building and basement is still sealed as the entire electrical wiring of the particular building was damaged during the fire and authorities of the building are working on it. Once the issue has been sorted out and the fire safety equipment is installed, we will check the building and then give an NOC. Until that time, the A wing of the building will not be operational."

Heavy administrative charges were imposed by the estate department of the AMC on the authorities of the complex during the process. From every unit of the complex, Rs 5,000 was taken as charge and a total of Rs 10.40 lakh was recovered.

Chaitanya Shah, estate officer of South West Zone, said, "Right now, the A-wing and basement of the complex is sealed. Once the fire department clears them, only then can we allow the complex to be operative. We had taken a total Rs 10.40 lakh worth of administrative charges from the units of the complex."
