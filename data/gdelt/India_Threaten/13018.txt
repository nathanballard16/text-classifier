PM Modi and Nepalese counterpart KP Oli jointly inaugurate South Asia's first cross border pipeline

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Nepalese counterpart KP Sharma Oli on Tuesday inaugurated first of its kind cross border commercial oil pipeline between India and Nepal in South Asia.

The pipeline from Motihari in Bihar to Amlekhganj in Nepal will transfer petroleum products such as diesel, LPG, aviation turbine fuel etc.

Speaking at the inauguration through video conference, PM said, "our bilateral cooperation has increased in the past few years..and India is ready to help Nepal according to country's priority."

Calling the pipeline "One of the best examples of trade and transit between India and Nepal", PM Oli said, "Implementation of various India aided projects in Nepal have gathered momentum in recent years following the understanding between me and PM Modi."

Nepal's KP Oli also said the project will enhance "interconnected and interdependence" between India and Nepal.

The idea of the pipeline was first proposed in 1996 and finalised in 2014 during PM Modi's Nepal visit. It was approved by Indian Oil at a total cost of Rs. 324 crore in September 2015 but the work was delayed following the earthquake of 2015.

The pipeline will replace road transportation and ensure uninterrupted supplies. The pipeline is 69 km long with a capacity of 2 million tonnes per annum. Around 32.7km of the pipeline is in Indian territory and 36.2 km in Nepal's territory.

Inda is engaged in a number of projects in Nepal. Last year Integrated Check Post in Birgunj (Nepal) built with New Delhi's assistance was inaugurated during PM Modi's visit. Both leaders also inaugurated three-storied library for Nepal Academy and Nepal-Bharat Maitri Pashupati Dharmashala in Kathmandu.
