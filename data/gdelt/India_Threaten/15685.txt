Lawyers vs Delhi cops: Bar council accuses policemen of making provocative statements

NEW DELHI: As lawyers demonstrated outside district courts in Delhi, Bar Council of India chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said on Wednesday any incident of violence involving lawyers, police and public will not be tolerated.Speaking to reporters in Supreme Court premises, Mishra said the BCI has taken serious note of all incidents of violence between lawyers and police and all requisite action will be taken against those guilty.He also accused policemen of making provocative statements against judges and lawyers during their protest outside the police headquarters on Tuesday.Police protests were triggered by two attacks on their colleagues, one on Monday outside Saket District Court and another on Saturday at the Tis Hazari Courts Complex after a parking dispute between an on-duty policeman and a lawyer which led to at least 20 security personnel and several advocates being injured.Two FIRs were registered against unidentified persons, who were seen in a video hitting a uniformed policeman on a motorcycle with his elbow and slapping him outside the Saket court.
