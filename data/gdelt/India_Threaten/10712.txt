Kejriwal warns pvt hospitals refusing to treat accident victims

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday warned private hospitals against refusing to treat accident victims in the city.

Kejriwal said despite a scheme launched by the AAP dispensation in February 2018, under which the Delhi government bears all expenses of treatment on such patients, some hospitals were refusing to treat them.

Addressing a press conference here, Kejriwal said that he on Tuesday held a meeting with representatives of privates hospitals, which assured him of full cooperation in implementing the scheme.

He said there is also a Supreme Court order according to which no hospital can refuse to treat accident victims.

"After accident, there is a golden hour to save the life of accident victim... If they (private hospitals) refuse to treat accident victims, we will take a strict action, including cancellation of their license," Kejriwal told reporters.

He said that since the Delhi government's scheme has been launched in February in 2018, 2501 people have been treated.
