India says Pakistan must take credible steps

New Delhi: After Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) rap to Pakistan on failing to act on terror financing, India has said that it expects the neighbours to comply with the FATF norms by September 2019.

On Friday, FATF issued a warning to Pakistan and said they have failed to complete its action plan on terror financing.

FATF has issued a stern warning to Islamabad to meet its commitment by October or face action, which could possibly lead to the country getting blacklisted.

The Paris-based global body is working to curb terrorism financing and money laundering and has asked Pakistan to reassess the operation of banned terrorist outfits in the country.

In response to a media query regarding the FATF report, Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said the FATF has decided to continue to keep Pakistan on its compliance document (ie. Grey List) for the International Cooperation Review Group (ICRG) monitoring for its failure to complete the action plan items due in January and May 2019.

He said, "We expect Pakistan to take all necessary steps to effectively implement the FATF Action Plan fully within the remaining time frame i.e. by September 2019 in accordance with its political commitment to the FATF and take credible, verifiable, irreversible and sustainable measures to address global concerns related to terrorism and terrorist financing emanating from any territory under its control."

India has welcomed the FATF's slamming Pakistan for financing terror organisations on its soil.
