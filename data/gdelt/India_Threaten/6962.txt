Election Commission cautions K Chandrashekar Rao, says stick to poll code

Hyderabad: The Election Commission of India on Friday issued a caution notice to Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao over his remarks at an election meeting held in Karimnagar on March 17.

The EC has cautioned him to be more careful in future and to strictly adhere to the provisions of the model code of conduct while making a public statement.

Mr Rao in his speech at Karimnagar had referred to the BJP and said, “Ee Hindu gaalu... bondu baalu... dikkumalina... daridrapu gaalu… desham lo aggi petale, gattarlevale.”

Following this, Mr M. Rama Raju, president of the TS unit of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad, filed a complaint with the Election Commission on April 9. The poll panel issued a showcause notice to Mr Rao.

The EC in a statement said that it had received a reply stating that the speech was widely reported in the electronic and print media but was misunderstood by the complainant.

The commission stated that Mr Rao as president of a recognised political party and as Chief Minister has an added responsibility to not only uphold the basic tenets, including secularism, of the Constitution of India but also to display the same in public.

According to the Election Commission, Mr Rao violated the provisions of sub-para(l) of para I of the model code of conduct which specifies that no political party or candidate shall indulge in any activity which may aggravate existing differences or create mutual hatred or cause tension between different castes and communities, religious or linguistic.

The EC said the comments also violated the provisions of sub-para(3) of para 1 which prohibits appeal to communal feelings for securing votes. The Election Commission issued Mr Rao a caution notice to be careful in future.
