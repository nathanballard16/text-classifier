Imran Khan says Pakistan unfairly accused over Kashmir bombing

Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday said India has unfairly accused his country of complicity in a deadly bombing last week in New Delhi's sector of disputed Kashmir.

India had "levelled allegations against Pakistan without any evidence", Mr Khan said, addressing the nation. He said he was ready to co-operate with New Delhi.

The Pakistani Prime Minister also said he will retaliate if India launches an attack after the conflict, stressing the Kashmir dispute can only be solved with dialogue.

It is the first time Mr Khan had addressed the unfolding crisis, sparked after a Pakistan-affiliated terror group killed 44 Indian policemen in a suicide bombing last week.

India accused Pakistan security forces of being complicit in the attack and ambassadors from each country have been recalled.

At least nine people were killed on Monday in a gun battle during a search for militants by Indian military personnel.
