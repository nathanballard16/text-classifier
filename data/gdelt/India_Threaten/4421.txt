SAD leaders seek action against Ashu, threaten protest

Ludhiana: Senior leaders of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) have threatened to hold a protest if the authorities failed to take action on their complaint against local MLA and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu for his alleged involvement in the alleged CLU (change of land use) scam.

Led by district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon, MLA Sharanjit Singh Dhillon and senior leader Harish Rai Dhanda met city police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill and deputy commissioner Pradeep Aggarwal on Friday, and demanded action against Ashu for allegedly threatening MC DSP Balwinder Singh Sekhon in the infamous CLU scam.

The Akali leaders, in their complaint, said that in the audio recording between the minister and Sekhon, it was clear Ashu had made objectionable remarks against Punjab and Haryana high court, and flouted all rules and regulations. “Besides giving a complaint against Ashu, we have also sought a probe into the role of cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu, as despite such a serious lapse in which his cabinet colleague is openly heard threatening a public servant and making a mockery of the law, Sidhu has done nothing about it. It proves he too is fully supportive of Ashu, who is known for misbehaving,” said Dhillon.

Dhillon also said if no action was taken on the complaint filed by SAD, then the party would hit the roads and sit on protest against both the cabinet ministers.
