Tik Tok star Mohit Mor killing: Teenager took assignment to â€˜prove his mettleâ€™, murder over money dispute

New Delhi:

Tik Tok star Mohit Mor was killed over a money dispute with Delhi notorious Nandu gang, the police said on Friday. Mohit Mor, a gym trainer who was quite popular on the video-sharing app Tik Tok had over 5 lakh followers over there. According to a report published in The Hindustan Times, he had allegedly taken Rs 30 lakh from Mangu, an alleged member of the Nandu gang, to invest in a property.

After Mangu's death in gang ware in 2017, members of the Nandu gang asked him to return the money he had taken from him. He, however, allegedly refused to give the money to Mangu’s friends in the gang and probably this was the reason he was brutally killed.

After receiving threats from the Nandu gang members, Mor reportedly took protection from Pradeep Solanki and Vikas Dalal, alleged members of the Manjeet Mahal gang, the report quoted Sanjeev Kumar Yadav, deputy commissioner of police (special cell).

However, Dalal was gunned down in a gang war in Delhi’s Dwarka on Sunday, following which Nandu gang again asked Mor to return the money. “Mor refused, leading to the enmity taking the shape of a murder plan,” Yadav said.

Sandeep Pehalwan, a key member of Nandu gang hired three people, including the teenager arrested by the police, to kill Mor. “The boy had joined the gang after making some enemies. He was desperate to prove his mettle and loyalty to the gang members,” the DCP said.

On Tuesday evening, Pehalwan was informed that Mor was sitting in a photocopy shop in Najafgarh. He then reportedly called the three assassins and gave them guns to execute their plan.

“Pehalwan called the trio and gave them a pistol each to kill Mor. The three of them entered a shop and pumped 13 bullets into Mor who was seated on a sofa,” said the officer.

The vehicle on which the three accused fled the scene was caught in the CCTV camera, which helped police to identify them. Acting on specific inputs, the police arrested one of them from Dwarka Sector 23.
