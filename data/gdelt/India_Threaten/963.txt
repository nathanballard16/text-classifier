Another threat call to Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal

An unidentified caller rang up on Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's landline threatening that he would be harmed soon. The call was made on the landline number of his residence around 10:45 am on Monday. The caller stated that there was threat to Kejriwal's life.

According to the police, the caller who did not name himself said that he was calling from West Delhi's Vikaspuri area. Since the caller ID of the landline was not working, the number could not be identified.

Caller ID installed at the office's landline telephone is not functional since May last year, sources said, claiming that despite several reminders to the General Administration Department (GAD) of Delhi government, it has not been fixed.

Police officials stated that the Personal Security Officer (PSO) of the CM informed them about the incident. "The caller had stated that a man identified as Bhola, owner of a tent house in Vikaspuri, is planning to attack the Delhi CM. The tent house and the owner were identified. The joint interrogation of the man is underway. He has no criminal record," said a senior police official.

Prima facie, it appears that Bhola has an ongoing property dispute with his family members and it might be possible that they are doing it to trouble him. Police are verifying his claims. He has been running the tent house for over a decade now.

Earlier, an e-mail was received threatening to kidnap the daughter of the Delhi CM. The accused was later arrested. An anonymous email on January 9 threatening to kidnap Arvind Kejriwal's daughter was received. Kejriwal's daughter was later provided with a Personal Security Officer.

The CMO's office received an anonymous email on January 9, which was forwarded to the Delhi Police Commissioner for necessary action.
