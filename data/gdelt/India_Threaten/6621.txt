Srinagar, April 27

Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday dubbed the Congress and the BJP as the “two sides of the same coin”. She said both parties had launched “unthinkable assaults against Article 370 and Article 35A from time to time”.

Mehbooba, who is the PDP candidate from the Anantnag parliamentary constituency, where the elections are scheduled in three phases, addressed rallies in Kulgam district, which will go to the polls on Monday.

She criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his remark that Article 370 and Article 35A had done damage to the state.

“If such is the situation, then it is high time for the Government of India to snap ties with Jammu and Kashmir and leave the state alone,” she said.

Mehbooba, whose party has run a coalition government with both BJP and Congress, said the parties were the “two sides of the same coin”.

“It was (Ghulam Nabi) Azad who as the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir scandalously transferred thousands of kanals to the shrine board, undermining Article 370 and ignoring the state’s core interests sans any remorse,” she said.

She said the BJP was “playing with fire” by tinkering with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

“As the Chief Minister, (I) had cautioned Prime Minister Modi that if any harm is done to the unique position of Jammu and Kashmir, the PDP will break ties with the BJP without a second thought,” she said.

She said the foundation of the “agenda of alliance” between her party and the BJP was laid for the protection of Articles 35A and 370 and “it was taken in writing from the BJP that it will not fiddle with the special position of Jammu and Kashmir in any way”.
