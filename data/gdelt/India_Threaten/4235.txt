Congress wants 15 seats, RJD says no way

NEW DELHI: Awar of words erupted between allies Congress and RJD on Tuesday, a day before the crucial seat-sharing talks in New Delhi, with the former insisting to contest at least 15 of the 40 seats in Bihar while the latter refusing to part with more than 11 seats.Hoping for an early solution to the stand-off, Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh told reporters: “I hope issues will be sorted out soon. But if the situation arises, our party will fight it alone, like in Uttar Pradesh .” RJD retorted with its vice-president Shivanand Tiwari saying his party is not dependent on Congress. “If they can fight alone, if they have the power to do so, they can go ahead and do that,” he said.
