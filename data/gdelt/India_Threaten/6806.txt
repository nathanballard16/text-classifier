Shaurya Doval, Son of NSA Ajit Doval Accorded Z Category Security Amidst Life Threats

Amidst potential threats to his life, Shaurya Doval, son of National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval and head of the think tank, 'India Foundation' has been accorded a top 'Z' category level VIP security, reports The Hindu.

Shaurya Doval has been brought under the mobile security cover of a Central paramilitary force after a security perception report prepared by the Central security agencies alarmed that he faced threats from people inimical to his father and others.

Following the cause underscored in the report, Union Home Ministry ordered the deployment of Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) commandos to guard the 43-year-old. As a result, about 15-16 AK-47 equipped commandos will be guarding him round the clock, wherever he goes.

Shaurya's father, NSA Doval had been accorded the topmost 'Z+' security cover provided by the CISF about four years ago.

Meanwhile, in the light of heightened situation and recent attacks on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union Minister Babul Supriyo outside a polling booth in Asansol on West Bengal, a temporary security cover has also been accorded to 10 BJP leaders of the state which would last till the polls get over.
