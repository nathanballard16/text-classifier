New Delhi: Swami Om, the controversial self-proclaimed godman, on Sunday announced that he would contest the 2019 Lok Sabha Elections from the New Delhi constituency. In a statement, the former Bigg Boss contestant said he will fight against Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s "anti-Hindu" stance.

The statement alleged that various Hindu organisations finalised Swami Om’s name after holding a meeting on Saturday.

Notably, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had on March 20 drawn the ire when he tweeted a picture of a man chasing the Nazi symbol with a broom, which is the AAP election symbol.

The BJP had alleged that the picture showed a man chasing a "Hindu swastika" and hurt the religious sentiments of Hindus.

However, the AAP on Sunday clarified that the picture was, in actual, an "attack" on German dictator Adolf Hitler and not intended to hurt Hindu sentiments.

"The BJP should, first of all, understand the difference between Hindu and Nazi symbols," the AAP said in a statement. It added that it looks "very foolish" for the BJP to claim the Nazi symbol as its own.

"The BJP should apologise to Hindus for relating them with Germany's Hitler and for simply trying (to take) a cheap shot at the Delhi CM," the AAP statement said.

On Saturday, Kejriwal had alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is using the tactics which were adopted by Hitler to consolidate power.
