New Delhi: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu on Friday wore a black shirt to protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Visakhapatnam over the alleged unfulfilled promises by the Centre in the Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act 2014. One of the major demand of the ruling Telugu Desam Party is the Special Category status for the state, which the BJP says can't be given as per the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.

On the Special Railway Zone which was announced by Railway Minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday, CM Chandrababu Naidu said that it was "not on the lines of benefitting Andhra Pradesh," while adding that the NDA government cheated the state by giving the KK Line to Raigada Division.

The new zone, the South Coast Railway (SCR) will comprise of the Guntakal, Guntur and Vijayawada divisions, however, the existing Waltair division that churns a huge revenue will be split into two with one part being incorporated into the new Vijayawada division and the second into the East Coast railway (EcoR).

"The attitude of the Centre is like creating a rivalry between states while announcing separate Railway Zone for Vizag, it's is not on the lines of benefitting Andhra Pradesh," CM Chandrababu Naidu said.

In the past, TDP raked up the issue of a separate railway zone a number of times, highlighting that it was part of AP Reorganisation Act 2014, the division of the Waltair division has irked them.

According to reports, black flags and hoardings demanding Special Status Category for the state have also been put up in several places across Vizag.

As for PM Modi, he visited Tamil Nadu earlier in the day to inaugurate several developmental projects. Worth mentioning is the pre-poll alliance of BJP and ruling AIADMK in Tamil Nadu where the saffron party will fight on the 5 Parliamentary seats of the state.
