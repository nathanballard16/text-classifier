Rahul Gandhi to take final call on Congress's alliance with AAP

As confusion over Congress-AAP alliance for the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi refuses to die down even after repeated denials by leaders of both parties, Rahul Gandhi will hold a meeting of Delhi Congress leaders at 10 am today to discuss the matter and take a final call.

Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit, PC Chacko and other senior leaders will attend the meeting.

The Congress leadership seems divided over forging an alliance with the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). While one faction wants an alliance to defeat the BJP in Delhi, the other is vehemently against it.

Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit has repeatedly voiced her opinion against the alliance, however, she has also said that the final decision will be taken by the party leadership.

On the other hand, AAP has announced candidates for all 7 Lok Sabha seats while Rahul Gandhi, too, has said that Congress will fight to win all the 7 seats in Delhi.

Both the parties have however, continued to send to feelers to each other as leaders of both have time and again come out to say talks are on for an alliance.

Earlier it was reported that NCP chief Sharad Pawar is mediating between the two arch-rivals to agree on an alliance in order to defeat the BJP.

Amid the confusion, Rahul Gandhi's crucial meeting with the Delhi Congress leaders is expected to come to a final decision before the Lok Sabha elections commence from April 11.

Congress will also hold its crucial CWC meet in Delhi on Monday to finalise the party's manifesto for the Lok Sabha elections.
