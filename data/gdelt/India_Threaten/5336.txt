DMK indulging in personal attacks: Sarath Kumar

All India Samathuva Makkal Katchi leader and actor R. Sarath Kumar alleged that the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) was indulging in personal attacks on individuals during campaigning.

Canvassing votes for All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam candidate P. Kalliappan for the Namakkal Parliamentary constituency on Thursday, Mr. Sarath Kumar criticised that the DMK and Congress had formed an opportunist alliance while political parties with different ideologies had formed an alliance with the AIADMK to ensure that a stable government took charge at the Centre.

He also said that handling threats from China and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was leading a strong country today.

Criticising the Opposition’s alliance, Mr. Sarath Kumar said that the DMK did not bring any welfare schemes to the State when it was in power along with the Congress. Minister for Electricity P. Thangamani was also present during the campaign.
