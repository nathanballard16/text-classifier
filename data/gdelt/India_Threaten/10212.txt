WhatsApp flood alerts turn saviour for Assam villagers

GUWAHATI: WhatsApp, much maligned for being a tool in spreading fake news, paranoia and mass hysteria, has redeemed itself somewhat in the borderlands of India’s northeast. Villagers living along the Assam-Bhutan border now get flood alerts on WhatsApp from ‘friends’ across the border.As many as 56 big and small rivers flow into India from Bhutan via Assam . Historically, this area has been prone to flooding, the intensity of which varies every year. But most of the time, people living downstream, that is on the Indian side, find themselves amid the raging torrent as information flows slower than flood waters. The consequences are often tragic.But for a month now, a system has been in place to issue early flood warning from the Bhutanese side to those in Assam. Sample this recent alert from a Bhutanese villager to someone in India: “Hi gud mng bro. Please caution your communities who are vulnerable to swollen river disaster. There is heavy flooding all over Gelephu and her peripherals (sic).”For someone who lives on this side of the border, this can be a lifesaver.
