PM Narendra Modi in Paris, flew over Pakistan airspace

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday used the Pakistani airspace, the first time since the Balakot airstrike in February, as he reached Paris in the first leg of his three-nation visit for a bilateral meet.

The airspace was shut following the airstrike by the Indian Air Force on February 26. IAF planes had destroyed terror camps in Pakistan’s Balakot, following the February 14 Pulwama terror attack which killed over 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir. The CRPF personnel lost their lives after their convoy was attacked by a JeM terrorist. During the day, Modi will have talks with French President Emmanuel Macron.

Macron will also host a special dinner for him at the Chateau de Chantilly, a 19th-century site located in Oise, about 60 kilometres from Paris.

On Friday, the PM would meet his French counterpart Edouard Charles Philippe. He is also slated to meet UNESCO Director-General Audrey Azoulay. He will also address the Indian diaspora in Paris and inaugurate a memorial for the Indian victims of the Air India crashes at Nid D’Aigle.

Modi will also visit UAE and Bahrain and then head back to France to participate in the G-7 summit.
