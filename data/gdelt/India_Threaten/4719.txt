Mandya Congress leader expelled for backing Sumalatha Ambareesh

Bengaluru: Mandya district Congress leader and KPCC member, Sachidananda, was expelled from the party for sharing the dais with Mrs Sumalatha Ambareesh at a rally in Mandya earlier this week and for accompanying her to various Assembly constituencies despite a diktat issued by top leaders of Congress.

Sources in Congress said such disciplinary action against Mr Sachidananda would serve as a warning for scores of party workers who accompanied her in a procession in Mandya ahead of submission of her nomination papers on Wednesday. Soon, party leaders acted against Mr Sachidanana as a furious Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy complained to them that such support of Congress workers would impact the prospects of his son and JD (S) candidate Nikhil Kumaraswamy. He also discussed the issue with energy minister D K Shivakumar with the latter chairing a meeting with Mandya Congress leaders to warn them against expressing their support for Mrs Sumalatha Ambareesh.
