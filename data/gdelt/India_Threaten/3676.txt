India's dossiers on Pulwama contain 'no actionable evidence', claim Pakistani media quoting sources

ARY and Geo channels carried similar reports on this, which clearly reflected Pakistan government's disinterest in acting on the evidence provided by India like it has been doing in the past.

India gave the dossiers to Pakistan after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan promised to act against JeM if "actionable evidence" was provided.

JeM, which is based in Pakistan, had carried out a ghastly terror attack on a CRPF convoy on February 14 in Pulwama district of Kashmir, killing 40 security personnel.

The terror outfit had lated claimed responsibility for it and issued the video of the suicide bomber.

Geo TV, quoting "high level government sources" , also said that security agencies of Pakistan and India "remain in contact despite the tension"and that "there was also contact on the night of February 27-28."

The two TV channels, quoting "sources", also claimed that India was planning to launch missile attacks at various targets in this country with the help of Israel on February 27.

ARY News said that in retaliation Pakistan had "also aimed eight to nine targets"in India.

"India had planned to carry out an attack on Pakistan via Rajasthan and it had also decided to use missiles," the ARY claimed, quoting "sources".

The report also claimed that Israel had "an aim to dent Pakistan's nuclear assets".
