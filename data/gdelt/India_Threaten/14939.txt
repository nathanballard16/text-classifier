RAJKOT: A woman from the royal family of Rajkot lodged a dowry harassment complaint against her husband and in-laws with Rajkot mahila police station on Saturday.

According to the complaint filed by Meghaviba Chudasama (37), the granddaughter of Rajkot’s king late Pradyumansinh Jadeja, her husband Meghrajsinh Chudasama (42), father-in-law Manharsinh Chudasama, mother-in-law Vinadevi Chudasama and brother-in-law Abhayrajsinh Chudasama harassed her for dowry and threw her out of their house.

In her complaint, Meghaviba said she was married to Meghrajsinh in 2008. After her marriage, she moved to live with her husband’s family in Judges Bungalow area of Ahmedabad. During her married life, she gave birth to a daughter, Ahanaba, who is now 11 years old.

“Ten days after her marriage, Meghaviba realized that Meghrajsinh was alcoholic. He squandered all his salary on alcohol and parties and subjected Meghaviba to physical assault. When she complained to Manharsinh and Vinadevi, they took the side of their son. Her brother-in-law Abhayrajsinh threatened to kill her,” said an official from Rajkot mahila police station.

Meghrajsinh got jobs first in Surat and then in Mumbai, where he turned chronic alcoholic. When Meghaviba got her mother to Mumbai to try to reason with her husband, Meghrajsinh hurled abuses at her.

Meghaviba has alleged that her husband and in-laws have got the custody of the jewellery and furniture worth lakhs of rupees that she had brought from her family after marriage.

“My husband and in-laws have made a condition that if I want to take back the jewellery, I will have to sign papers for divorce. Apart from the jewellery and furniture, they have also kept the paintings drawn by me,” said Meghaviba in her complaint.
