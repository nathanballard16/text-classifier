Ahead of 2019 polls, opposition parties plan protests against Modi govt

NEW DELHI: As the last Parliament session of the 16 Lok Sabha winds up next week, opposition parties plan to troop into Delhi for protests against the ruling Narendra Modi regime before all the parties go into the election mode for the 2019 battle.The protests in the Capital begin from Monday. On February 11, Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu will be in Delhi, sitting on a day-long dharna (sit-in) at the Andhra Bhawan premises along with his party colleagues, to protest against the Centre for denying “special status” to the state that the TDP government has been demanding since its bifurcation in 2014.Other anti-BJP opposition party leaders (22-odd parties) who have come together on a “Save Democracy” platform to combat the ruling BJP together, are likely to call on the chief minister and TDP chief, making it a rallying point, with the message that the entire spectrum of parties are preparing to take on BJP at the national level together.This show of solidarity will be followed by a “dharna” by West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee between February 13 and 14, as she is planning to bring her protest movement that started in Kolkata last weekend, to Delhi, to ensure that her battle with the centre on the issue of “attack on federalism” is also fought in the national capital and not just at her doorstep.Last Sunday, Banerjee turned “a CBI attempt to raid the Kolkata police commissioner’s residence” into a political stage, where most of the opposition leaders came out and stood with her making it national issue about “the Centre’s strike on the state,” yielding only after a Supreme Court intervention in the matter the next day. What unfurled overnight as the chief minister sat on a “dharna” on the streets of Kolkata, ensured that solidarity among the 22-odd anti-BJP parties found a new cause and reassembly in Delhi before, the nation goes in for elections.Between Banerjee, Naidu and leaders of NCP, RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, JD(S), Left and Congress among others, the opposition hopes to make an impact with its strong presence and clear message to their respective electorate on the eve of the next general elections.
