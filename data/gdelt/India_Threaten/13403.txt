Light showers in Chennai for the next two days

Cyclonic circulation off A.P. coast to influence thundershower activity till Thursday

There is a possibility of light rain in parts of Chennai for the next two days, even as northern districts in the State will continue receiving thundershowers.

A cyclonic circulation off the Andhra Pradesh coast, tilting southwestwards, may influence thundershower activity till Thursday. Officials of the Meteorological Department said rainfall would however reduce from Thursday evening or Friday.

During the last 24 hours, ending 8.30 a.m. on Tuesday, several places across the State received widespread rainfall. Thirumanur in Ariyalur district recorded 11 cm — the highest volume of rainfall for the day. Rain gauges in Ennore, Ponneri and Poonamallee received 1 cm during the same period.

Low pressure area

N. Puviarasan, director, Area Cyclone Warning Centre, Chennai, said the weather system is likely to develop into a low pressure area, and move in a northwesterly direction by Wednesday or Thursday. It may not bring much rain to Tamil Nadu, but after a slight lull, thunderstorm activity may resume later in the week due to convective activity.

Widespread thundershowers ensured an overcast sky over Chennai. The maximum temperature in Nungambakkam and Meenambakkam dropped by one degree Celsius, and both weather stations recorded around 33 degree Celsius on Tuesday. The same weather trend may continue, and there are chances of light rain in some areas till Thursday, officials said.

Southwest monsoon activity continues to be moderate. The Met Department has also issued warning for fishermen not to venture into the sea, as strong winds are likely to prevail over the Gulf of Mannar and south Tamil Nadu coast till Thursday.
