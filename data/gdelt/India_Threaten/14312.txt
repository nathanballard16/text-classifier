RBI will not let any co-operative bank to collapse, says Shaktikanta Das

NEW DELHI: RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das on Friday said one should not use one incident to generalise the situation in the entire co-operative banking sector. He said the central bank would not allow any such bank to fail.Responding to a question on PMC Bank , a corporative bank in the eye of a storm, he said the central bank acted promptly and swiftly with the issue and that EOW is looking at the case.Das said RBI is in talks with the government on changing the regulations for co-operative banks. “RBI won’t allow a co-operative bank to collapse,” the Governor said, and appealed to depositors to not worry about banks.Das said RBI would use prompt corrective action where ever appropriate.Promoters of HDIL Rakesh and Sarang Wadhawan were arrested by the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police in connection with the alleged irregularities at PMC Bank.More than two-thirds of PMC Bank’s loan exposure is said to be to the bankrupt developer. RBI has since frozen operations at the bank.Das said matters with respect to co-operative banks and NBFC are not within the purview of MPC.PMC Bank allegedly diverted large amounts of money to the bankrupt HDIL promoters and seven other realty firms.On the Indiabulls Housing Finance-Lakshmi Vilas Bank merger proposal, Das said he won’t comment on individual cases. He said he was unaware of any government demand from RBI for an interim dividend.PTI had earlier quoted sources as suggesting that the government may seek an interim dividend of about Rs 30,000 crore from the RBI towards the end of the financial year to meet its fiscal deficit target of 3.3 per cent of GDP for 2019-20.
