Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) has cautioned farmers against the attack of locust. The last locust attack was observed in 1993 when 172 swarm incursions were noted.

Giving this information, Dr PK Chhuneja, Head, Department of Entomology, PAU, said, “After 26 years, locust has attacked crops at Jaisalmer in Rajasthan. It has been confirmed by the Director of Plant Protection, Faridabad. There is every possibility that it may attack crops or trees in Punjab.”

The magnitude of the damage and loss caused by locusts is enormous. On an average small locust swarm eats as much food in one day as about 10 elephants, 25 camels or 2,500 people. Locust devour leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, bark and growing points and also break down trees by their weight when they settle down in masses. It’s a short-horned grasshopper with highly migratory habit, having marked polymorphism and voracious feeding behaviour.

“They cause great devastation to natural and cultivated vegetation. They are indeed the sleeping giants that can flare up any time to inflict heavy damage to crops leading to national emergency of food and fodder,” he added.

Dr Chhuneja advised farmers to keep a constant vigil through field survey to prevent crop losses due to locust attack. “If any locust attack is observed, farmers should immediately contact experts of PAU or the Department of Agriculture,” he said.

Discussing about the control measures, the expert from PAU said: “In case locusts are noticed in large number, go for ploughing, digging and harrowing of places where eggs are laid on a large scale. For mechanical control, collect hoppers with catching machine, kill them with flame-throwers and crush them with rollers. In case they are found in bushes, destroy them by burning.
