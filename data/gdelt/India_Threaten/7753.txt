Election Results 2019: BJP, allies hail Modi 'tsunami'; all losers are not losers, says Mamata

Riding on a massive Modi wave sweeping through most parts of India, the BJP was set to return to power Thursday as it led in 298 seats while the Congress trailed far behind with 52, according to trends released by the Election Commission for all 542 seats that went to polls.

With the BJP heading for a historic win in the Lok Sabha polls, senior ministers and alliance partners credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Amit Shah for the victory described by many as a "tsunami". While there was euphoria in the BJP-led NDA camp, both the Congress and the Left parties were muted in their reactions after the trends clearly showed that they were heading towards another poll debacle after 2014. However, TMC and West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee's reaction to the poll outcome was pragmatic."Congratulations to the winners. But all losers are not losers. We have to do a complete review and then we will share our views with you all. Let the counting process be completed fully and the VVPATs matched," she tweeted.
