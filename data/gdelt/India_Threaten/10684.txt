Mumbai: Animal rights activists plan protest over gruesome dog beating

Animal rights activists have organized a rally near Worli on Tuesday to protest the physical assault on a male dog in a building in Worli last week. Due to the excessive physical torture, the dog is experiencing seizures and is put on a urine catheter. Poonam Samtani, Co-Founder of Bombay Animal Rights and her team of rescuers are handling the dog's medical expenses. The animal rights group have given a call to action for other animal rights stakeholders to join the protest. John Abraham shared an update about the incident on Twitter and called for animal lovers to stage a protest in front of the Turf View building.
