BERLIN, June 24 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures will be very high across most of Germany this week and the 40-degree mark could be broken on Wednesday in the west of the country, according to a warning issued by the German weather service (DWD) on Monday.

The DWD also warned that the level of UV rays would be extremely high across the country, particularly in the south of Germany.

"A health hazard potential must be expected due to the thermal conditions occurring outdoors. Protective measures for the skin are equally essential," cautioned the DWD on Twitter.

Wednesday is expected to be the hottest day of 2019 so far and could even break a 70-year-old temperature record, according to the DWD.

In 1947, an air temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius was measured in Frankfurt, which was the previous record for June.

"Weather data show that heat waves and other weather extremes are on the rise in recent decades," said Stefan Rahmstorf, co-chair of Earth System Analysis at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK).

"While in Europe we worry about reaching 40 degrees Celsius this week, India has seen temperature records above 50 degrees Celsius recently," noted the German climate expert.

"Heat waves can heavily impact societies by leading to additional deaths in vulnerable groups such as old people and children, and the combination of hot and dry conditions can lead to water shortages and harvest failures," stated Rahmstorf.
