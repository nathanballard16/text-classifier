piyush goyal: No global company in multi-brand retail: Piyush Goyal, Retail News, ET Retail

NEW DELHI: Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Monday said the government would not allow multi-brand retail trade by foreign ecommerce companies and that they could only be agnostic platforms.Goyal said this at a meeting with ecommerce companies including Amazon, eBay and Walmart-owned Flipkart, and other global digital giants such as Facebook, Dell, SAP, Google, PayPal and IBM. “The minister forcefully said that India will not allow multi-brand retailing by foreign companies...they can only be an agnostic platform,” said an official present in the meeting.In December last year, the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) tightened the foreign direct investment (FDI) rules for ecommerce companies through a Press Note. It barred marketplaces from selling products from sellers in which they have an equity interest and entering into deals with brands to sell product exclusively on their platforms.It also stipulated that the inventory of a vendor will be deemed to be controlled by the marketplace if more than 25% of the vendor’s purchases are from the marketplace entity, including its wholesale unit. The marketplace entity or its group companies cannot have control over inventory under the FDI rules.The rules had a direct bearing on Amazon and Flipkart. They had sought an extension of the compliance deadline of February 1, but did not get it. “(We discussed) that the FDI guidelines are not being implemented and if the ecommerce marketplaces were just tech platforms, then why is there losses in thousands of crores,” a top executive from a leading Indian ecommerce company, who attended the meeting, said.According to him, industry players pointed out that Press Note 2 had not been implemented in the sense that the statutory auditor certification, which was a part of the ecommerce policy, was not being made mandatory right now.FDI issues were taken up at one of the meetings that Goyal had with industry on issues related to digital trade and data localisation, as India looks to finalise its national ecommerce policy.The meetings come ahead of the G-20 Leaders Summit in Japan later this month when Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump are scheduled to meet. G-20 host Japan is keen to negotiate on ecommerce rules at the World Trade Organization and had pushed for consensus on the matter among the members.“While the meeting was ostensibly on many WTO countries trying to have ecommerce as part of the negotiations and want India to give an irrevocable, perpetual access to data of Indian consumers and how that doesn’t suit the Indian interests at all, it spun into all the ecommerce issues,” the company executive who attended the meeting on ecommerce said.The meetings come also in the wake of a draft policy on ecommerce in which the government has proposed regulating cross-border data flows, locating computing facilities within the country to ensure job creation and setting up a dedicated data authority for issues related to sharing of community data, asserting that the data generated in the country are a national asset and citizens and the government have a sovereign right over it.As per a statement by the commerce and industry ministry, issues like strengths and weaknesses of Indian companies who may benefit from ecommerce, threats from large foreign competition, level playing field and impact of anticompetitive practices such as predatory pricing and other discriminatory practices were also discussed during the meetings.With Indian information technology firms, Goyal discussed the likely increase in costs and efficiency losses due to data localisation and timelines to create a data infrastructure to comply with data localisation rules and developing Indian data servers, clouds and emails. Officials from Nasscom, Infosys, Wipro, WNS, NIIT Tech, Tech Mahindra, Quatrro, Cognizant and Data Security Council of India were present in this meeting.Representatives from Reliance Jio Infocomm, OLA, MakeMyTrip, Shopclues, Yatra and Snapdeal, among others, attended another meeting.
