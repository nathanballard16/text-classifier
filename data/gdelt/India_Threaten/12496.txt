Kashmir dispute poses a serious threat of atomic war in South Asia: Hurriyat activists

In occupied Kashmir, Hurriyat activists have warned the Indian rulers, who are claiming Jammu and Kashmir as an internal matter of India, that the unresolved Kashmir dispute poses a serious threat of atomic war in South Asia.

The Hurriyat activists in posters and handbills issued in occupied Kashmir said that in such a war, millions of people would die.

They said that the world powers must realize the fact that Pakistan would not hesitate to use any option, even atomic bomb, on the issue of Kashmir.

The Hurriyat activists asked the people to come to the streets and stage protests to defeat India’s designs of finishing the Kashmiris’ identity and changing the demographic composition of the territory.
