NEW DELHI: In a bid to end the use of multiple smart tags to travel on tolled roads and to pay entry tax in different cities, a 'One Nation One Tag' is set to be rolled out in the next couple of months.Currently, FASTag , the RFID-based smart tag can be used to pay toll on the national highway network and a few state roads and it's mandatory for commercial vehicles to have a separate tag to enter Delhi, which is issued by the municipal corporation.Sources said if more municipalities follow the Delhi model of issuing separate tags for paying entry tax, commercial vehicles with all India permits may up having several tags on their windscreens. TOI has learnt that there is already a discussion to bring both the municipal toll tag and the FASTag on one platform.Road transport ministry officials said to bring all state governments on board for "One Nation One Tag", it has called a meeting of transport ministers and top officials in the second week of October, which will be chaired by Union highways minister Nitin Gadkari . "Why should people be made to buy multiple smart tags to pay toll on different roads? There have been complaints from many commuters that they can't pay the user fee on state roads through the FASTag fitted in their vehicles. Until the same tag is allowed across all roads and even for paying the parking charges in cities, this will not be that popular. The benefits of using the FASTag should drive people to go for the tags rather than forcing people to buy them," said an official.The transport ministry has set December 1 as deadline for vehicles to have FASTags for seamless travel through NH toll plazas Till now nearly 60 lakh FASTags have been issued or sold for cars, taxis, buses and trucks across the country. Currently, these tags are allowed to pay toll on 17 state roads in Uttar Pradesh, Outer Ring Road of Hyderabad, some roads under the state road development corporations in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Sources said the Centre and states would need to work out a mechanism to share the user fee. The highways ministry has already announced that states can join the central platform without any additional expenses.
