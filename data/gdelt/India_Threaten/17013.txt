AMU students oppose Citizenship Amendment Bill

AGRA: Students of Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) have unequivocally opposed the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, (CAB) that aims to grant citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians from Bangladesh Afghanistan and Pakistan , and shuts India’s doors for Muslims.According to a statement, issued by the students, this bill is a threat to the fundamentals of India, and those supporting the bill are anti-nationals and want to break India in the name of religion. “The political parties that support this divisive bill are a threat to the unity and integrity of India. India was born on the basis of equality and explicit prohibition of discrimination on the basis of religion and this bill is an attempt to alter the foundations of India,” the statement read.The students further dubbed the bill as a product of an “obnoxious mindset” that functions on the basis of cultural assimilation and hate, and wants to rob India of its Constitution and diversity.Former students’ union members condemned the mindset behind the bill and asked all stakeholders in peace and unity of the nation to rise and challenge the government on this divisive bill.“We call upon all the citizens of India to speak against this drastic and unconstitutional change in the character of the nation that aims to violate the core idea of India. Former students’ union called upon all the parliamentarians of India to speak against this anti-people and anti-India bill and nip the evil in the bud,” said Salman Imtiaz, former president of students’ union. He added that it is high time for the President of India and the Supreme Court of India to caution about the India’s character, as any structural alterations in the idea of India “will demolish the very basis of our existence in the country”.Former vice-president of students’ union, Hamza Sufyan, said it is against the secular framework and spirit of the Constitution of India as the CAB is intended to give citizenship to the people on the basis of their religion. “Since CAB is religion-based and excludes exclusively the Muslims from it, then the NRC will automatically be religion-based as the people left out of CAB are Muslims and they will be the one who will have to face the wrath of NRC,” said Sufyan.He said, moreover, CAB is also against the Assam Accord (1985) which granted citizenship to the people who came to India before the year 1971. “The sole purpose of this exercise is to increase communal hatred, polarize people and increase the vote bank of a particular section of people to gain political advantage in the upcoming elections,” added Sufyan.
