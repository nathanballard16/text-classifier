Sherry slams Musharraf’s statement about Israel

ISLAMABAD: Parliamentary Leader of the Pakistan People’s Party in the Senate, Sherry Rehman criticised former president Pervez Musharraf’s statements regarding Pakistan’s ties with Israel – a state Pakistan has refused to recognise since its inception and demanded that the government must immediately respond and clarify Pakistan’s stance.

“The entire country is shell-shocked over Pervez Musharraf’s pro-Israel statements in his press conference. Israel cannot tolerate Palestinian Muslims, how would it ever tolerate a nuclear power like Pakistan,” she said while reacting to the statement of former president General (R) Pervez Musharraf regarding his statement about Israel.

Senator Sherry Rehman pointed out that the recent pro-Israel statement from Pervez Musharraf is not a first as in 2005, it seemed like Pervez Musharraf’s regime tried to break the ice with Israel without any consultation, in what would have been a stark departure from Pakistan’s justified stand to support the Palestinian people. “Such statements give credence to the controversy over Israeli journalist’s tweet that an Israeli jet had flown from Tel Aviv to Islamabad in October. The government must immediately respond and clarify Pakistan’s stance”.

The former president jumped into a war of words that has escalated since the deadly attack in Pulwama that took the lives of 44 people. Musharraf warned India over the response it should expect from Pakistan if it were to launch an attack.

On this, Sherry Rehman said, “What we need right now are suggestions to reinstate peace in the region.
