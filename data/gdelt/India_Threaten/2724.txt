'Pakistan will surprise India in war': Pak Army warns India, raises questions over 'timing' of Pulwama attack

Pakistan continued in denial mode on Pulwama incident and even raising finger on India over the terror attack.

Despite being further isolated in the international community, Pakistan continued in denial mode on Pulwama terror attack. It even raised questions on the timing of the attack and hinted at Indian role in the incident.

The powerful UN Security Council has strongly condemned the "heinous and cowardly" Pulwama terror attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed and underlined the need to hold perpetrators of these "reprehensible acts" of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice. Terror watchdog FATF has also slammed Pakistan for not doing enough to curb terror finances saying "it does not demonstrate a proper understanding of the terror financing risks posed by JuD, FiF, LeT, JeM".

However, Pakistan's Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Asif Ghafoor was soon back to issuing 'hollow' threats and warnings to India. Ghafoor repeated Pakistan PM Imran Khan's words warning India against initiating any action against it. He said that Pakistan army would surprise its arch-rivals in case of a war.

“Pakistan armed forces will never be surprised by you (India) but we shall surprise you," Ghafoor said while addressing a Press Conference in Rawalpindi on Friday.

On February 14, a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district, killing at least 40 personnel and leaving many critically wounded.
