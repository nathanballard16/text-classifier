Our CORRESPONDENT

KOKRAJHAR: The Kokrajhar district committee, All Bodo Student’ Union (ABSU) on Friday expressed deep concern over the step motherly treatment towards Bodo medium students by the Education Department of Assam.

The education secretary Khampa Basumatary said, “The Bodo medium students have not got adequate text books till date. We all know that the education is the universal human rights of every human being and fundamental right for every citizen of India as provided under Article 21A of the Constitution of India. Further, the right of children to free and compulsory education act, 2009 has made it more accessible to all children under the age group of six to fourteen years in the country, making it free and compulsory to all children. However, the Right to Education provides that every child be taught in their own language as per section 29(2) i.e. the medium of instruction should be in child’s mother tongue. It is more specific for the Bodo language being the constitutionally recognized language under the eight schedule of Constitution of India.”

He further added that the Education department of Assam has totally failed to issue text books of elementary and secondary section timely in the district of Kokrajhar. He also said the classes started on January 2 but till now, the students have not got their text books.

Activists of the KDC, ABSU vehemently criticized the Education Department of Assam and demanded immediate supply of text books for Bodo medium students within February 12, 2019 and if the department fails to meet the demand then the union would be compelled to organize massive indefinite dharna, bandhs, etc, they warned.
