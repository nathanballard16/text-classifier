Twenty-four people died at the Holey Artisan Bakery terror attack in Dhaka in July 2016. Despite counter-terrorism measures taken by the Bangladesh security forces, groups supported by terrorists are continuing to flourish in the eastern neighbour’s territory, Indian intelligence reports said. Delhi has already warned Dhaka and the Bangladesh PMO has confirmed to Times Now that the two countries are working together on the issue. Only recently, similar intel reports sent by New Delhi to Colombo were reportedly overlooked by the island nation’s officials and the multiple terror attacks that unfolded in Sri Lanka soon after, led to huge casualties.

India has alerted Dhaka that despite Bangladesh’s efforts to the contrary, a large number of terror organisations are still active inside Bangladesh and are continuing to provide training in handling weapons to their cadres.

* For a fortnight (between April 19 and May 3), the HIZBUT TAWHEED, provided weapon-training to 20-25 men and women in Majampur, in Kushtia. Mizanur Rahman Majnu was the chief organiser of the training programme.

* The ISLAMIC CHATRASHIBIR began an online recruitment effort on April 21 that went on for about ten days. About 500 people joined the movement, led by Mobark Hossen, the Islamic Chatrashibir president and Mohammed Sirajul Islam, the organisation’s central secretary.

* The AHLE HADEES ANDOLAN organised a jihadi camp from April 26 in the Airport Road area of Rajshahi. The chief organiser was Abdul Salafi, a maulana of the Al-Markajul Islam As-Salafi Madrassa. The organisation was also responsible for a week-long arms training camp during Ramzan. The main organisers were HH Rahman and Ismail Ghoni.

* The JAMATUL MUJAHIDEEN BANGLADESH organised a week-long training camp from April 5 to 11 at Bhaganpur, in Rangpur. The participants included a dozen members each from Thakurgaon and Dinajpur and seven from Panchagarh.

* THE ISLAMIC JIHADI DAL has also been active, restructuring its organisation. Intelligence reports say it has a presence in Thakurgaon, Lalmonirhat, Kurigram, Dinajpur, Nator, Sirajganj and Jamalganj.

* Despite efforts by the Bangladesh government authorities, insurgents from India-based banned organisations like ULFA still appear to have links there. According to an intelligence report, Dristi Rajkhowa – the deputy “commander-in-chief” of ULFA, and a confidant of the organisation’s supreme leader – Paresh Barua, was in Khagrachari, in Chittagong, to meet other leaders.
