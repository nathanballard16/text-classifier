Centre issues veiled threat on intermediate fiasco

BJP TS president K. Laxman calls off his five-day fast by accepting a glass of juice from Union minister Hansraj Gangaram Ahir at Nims on Friday.

Hyderabad: Union minister Hansraj Ahir on Friday cautioned the Telangana state government that the Centre would not remain as a mute spectator on the issue of suicides of Intermediate students following the results fiasco.

The minister visited Dr K. Laxman at the Nizam’s Institute of Medical Sciences who ended his fast on Friday.

Dr Laxman later called off his hunger strike by accepting lemon juice in the presence of Mr Ahir.

Later, talking to mediapersons, Mr Ahir accused the TRS government of failing to provide justice to students.

He said, “The Centre will move the High Court to take action against the officials who are responsible for the mistakes, even if it needs a CBI inquiry. We assure every student that they will get justice even if the state government has failed to provide it. We are there for you.”

He claimed that the result goof-up that happened in Telangana state had never happened anywhere in India before.

He said, “As of now more than 20 students have committed suicide and Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and education minister G. Jagadish Reddy have remained silent.”

Elsewhere State NSUI president B. Venkat and TS Youth Congress president Anil Kumar Yadav’s 48-hour deeksha, held to protest against the marks fiasco ended at 5 pm.

Former ministers Komatireddy Venkata Reddy, Ponnala Laxmaiah and Purushottham Rao were present when the 48-hour deeksha ended.
