Bangladesh Man Cuts Off Wife's Locks After Finding A Strand Of Hair In His Breakfast, Arrested

In a tragic turn of events, a man from Bangladesh forcibly shaved his wife’s head after finding a hair in his breakfast. The man has been arrested. Meanwhile, rights groups warned violence against women was rising in the conservative Muslim nation.

Police raided a village in the northwestern district of Joypurhat and arrested Bablu Mondal, after villagers told officers about the incident. "He found a human hair on the rice and milk breakfast his wife prepared for him," local police chief Shahriar Khan told AFP.

"He became angry seeing the hair and blamed the wife. He then took a blade and forcibly shaved the head of the wife," he said. Khan said Bablu was charged with ‘voluntarily causing grievous hurt’. The offence carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in jail and also for ‘outraging modesty’ of his 23-year-old wife.

The incident highlights growing repression of women in Bangladesh and all the conservative Muslim nations. According to the local rights group Ain O Salish Kendra, there were an average three rapes a day in the first six months of the year.

In another tragic incident, a 26-year-old man divorced his 23-year-old wife. He went to the rooftop and shouted triple talaq because she could not fulfill his demand for dowry.
