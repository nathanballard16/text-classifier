Supercyclone ‘Kyarr’ set to veer off India’s coast

Cyclone ‘Kyarr’ lay 830 km west-southwest of Mumbai and 1160 km east-northeast of Salalah (Oman).

Supercyclone ‘Kyarr’ in the Arabian Sea has moved westwards and away from India's coast, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

‘Kyarr’ lay 830 km west-southwest of Mumbai and 1160 km east-northeast of Salalah (Oman). It is “very likely” to move west-northwestwards till October 30 to recurve west-south-westwards thereafter and move towards the Gulf of Aden off south Oman-Yemen coasts in the next three days. “It is very likely to maintain the intensity of a Super Cyclonic Storm till 28th October evening and weaken gradually thereafter,” the IMD said in a press statement.

Gales reaching 230-240 kmph and gusting to 265 kmph, were prevailing around the cyclone's centre over the central Arabian Sea and it was very likely to reduce gradually to 130 kmph by November 1. ‘Kyarr’ is the first supercyclone in the Arabian Sea after cyclone Gonu in 2007. Its formation had brought rains over the weekend to Goa and coastal Karnataka but adverse weather was unlikely over India. However, seas were expected to be rough and fishermen have been advised not to venture into the east-central Arabian Sea till Wednesday and into west-central Arabian Sea till November 2, it said.

The IMD also warned of a fresh low pressure system that had formed over the equatorial Indian Ocean to the south of Sri Lanka on Monday morning. It would intensify in the next 24 hours and was very likely to become a 'depression' over southeast Arabian Sea and adjoining Lakshadweep & Maldives by Thursday.

“Under its influence, squally weather is likely over Comorin, Lakshadweep & Maldives area and adjoining southeast Arabian Sea from 29th October onwards till 31st . Under its influence, the sea condition will be rough to very rough from 29th onwards till 31st over these areas,” the IMD said.
