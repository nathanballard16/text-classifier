As Many As 22 Terror Camps Still Active In Pakistan; It Will Pay The Price For Every Attack, Says Indian Official

Pakistan has as many as 22 active terrorist training camps on its soil, including nine of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), but no action is being taken against them, a senior Indian official said on Thursday (7 March), reports Business Standard.

The official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, also warned of India carrying out strikes similar to Balakot on 26 February in case there is an act of terrorism emanating from across the border.

According to the report, the official accused Pakistan and its leadership of being in denial mode and trying to create a war hysteria between both nuclear-weapon states.

"As many as 22 terrorist training camps, including nine of JeM are still being run in Pakistan and there has been no action against them," the official was quoted in the report as saying.

The official said the Indian strike on Balakot was a counter-terrorism operation, falling within international laws. However, a day later Pakistan attacked Indian military installations with as many as 20 fighter jets, he claimed.

The official said the responsibility to end terrorism now lies with Islamabad. "India will carry out retaliatory counter-terrorism operations like the one on 26 February, deep inside Pakistan, anytime there is an act of terror coming from across the border" warned the official.

"For every terrorist attack coming from across the border, India will retaliate and there will be a price that the neighbouring country would have to pay,” the official said.
