rajan s mathews: Affordable, adequate and clean 5G spectrum need of the hour: Rajan Mathews, Telecom News, ET Telecom

NEW DELHI: While limited participation from telecom operators is being speculated in the upcoming 5G spectrum auction, the telecom industry representative body has made clear that the current spectrum pricing is not appropriate and the industry would need affordable, adequate and clean spectrum to take up 5G.In an interaction with ETTelecom, Rajan Mathews, director general of Cellular Operators Association of India ( COAI ) said, “The industry needs affordable spectrum – present pricing is not appropriate. Secondly we need clean spectrum because now there appears to be all types of contention among various government, space and satellite agencies.”“Globally when everybody is looking at 28 GHz to be added to what we call as the mobility band of spectrum; we're finding that we're locked out of that because of the use of that band by the satellite industry,” he added.Global rating agency Fitch had recently said that India's reserve price of $70 million per MHz is "expensive", and will force Vodafone Idea and Bharti Airtel to participate in 5G spectrum auctions in a "limited" way.“We’re seeing balkanization of spectrum, such as in 3.3 GHz to 3.5 GHz band. Even when we look at 26 GHz band, we’re seeing the same problems,” commented Mathews.He explained that going forward, 10 MHz or 25 MHz of contiguous spectrum won’t be adequate for 5G and that the industry needs a minimum 100 MHz of contiguous spectrum.“From a pricing perspective, when you have this volume, you can see that the per MHz pricing has to come down and secondly it has to be clean spectrum otherwise you're not going to get the quality that the customer will demand,” he added.The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) recently cautioned that participation of Indian telecom companies may be severely constrained in the upcoming auction for 5G spectrum due to low average revenue per user, and added that high reserve prices could further subdue this.On a similar note, Mathews said that to be able to make investments for 5G, the sector's financial health has to be improved. “..this is the most important thing that government and industry has to work towards in order to make 5G a reality.”Meanwhile, The Department of Telecommunications ( DoT ) is considering a raft of changes to ease operators’ financial burden from auction of airwaves. Key steps include reducing upfront payment, increasing the tenure of annual payments to 18 years and reducing spectrum usage charges (SUC).
