Days ahead of Ayodhya verdict, terrorists enter Uttar Pradesh to plan attack

Days before the Supreme Court is to announce its verdict in connection with the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case, there are inputs of Pakistan-based terror outfits that have entered into the northern state of Uttar Pradesh to carry out a major terror attack in the state.

There are reports of seven terrorists that have already entered into the state via Nepal to execute their nefarious plan. Sources have revealed that these terrorists are hiding in Ayodhya and Gorakhpur.

The intelligence agencies have succeeded in identifying five out of the seven terrorists who have sneaked into Uttar Pradesh. Those five identified, include Mohammad Yakub, Nisar Ahmed, Mohammad Qaumi Chaudhary, Abu Hamza and Mohammad Shahbaz.

Acting on the inputs, the security has beefed up in the state ahead of the SC verdict. “The state police is on high alert and if needed the National Security Act (NSA) will be imposed to maintain law and order in the state,” said Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh. He further added, “We are absolutely ready. Under no circumstances, anybody will be allowed to take law in hand. Our Intelligence machinery is geared up. If needed, the National Security Act will be imposed on elements who attempt to disrupt law and order.”
