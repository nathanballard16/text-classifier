Nitish Kumar says JD(U) will not tolerate Pragya Thakur's remark on Mahatma Gandhi's assassin

Nathuram Godse Ji deshbhakt the, hain, aur rahenge, unko aatankwadi kahne wale log swayam ki gireban me jhank kar dekhe chunav main aise logon ko jawab de diya jayega

PATNA: Bihar CM Nitish Kumar on Sunday condemned the statement of BJP's Bhopal candidate Pragya Singh Thakur describing Nathuram Godse as a "patriot", and asserted that JD(U), an ally of BJP in the state, would not tolerate such remarks in support of Mahatma Gandhi 's assassin."It is highly condemnable. We don't agree with such views. Mahatma Gandhi is the father of the nation. People of this country will not like if anyone talks about Godse in such manner. JD(U) would not tolerate such remarks," Nitish told reporters while responding to a query over Pragya's controversial remark.Bihar CM was talking to reporters after casting his vote at a polling booth near Raj Bhawan in the state capital.During a roadshow in MP a few days back, Pragya had said that "(Nathuram Godse was a patriot, is a patriot and will remain a patriot. Those who call him a terrorist should look within, they will get a reply in this election.)On being asked whether the BJP should expel Pragya from the party, Bihar CM said, "The issue of expelling her from the party was an internal matter of the BJP. Taking action against such person is an internal matter of their party. But as much as we are concerned, JD(U) will not tolerate this kind of view."Reacting over Nitish's statement, former Bihar CM and RJD's national vice president Rabri Devi said, if he is peeved over Pragya Thakur 's statement, then he should have separated from BJP and resigned from the CM's post. "Nitish Kumar should have resigned if he is really pained by Pragya Thakur's remark. He should have snapped his ties from BJP over this comment," Rabri told a news agency in Patna on Sunday.
