Washington: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday called the Pulwama terror attack a 'horrible situation'. Talking to reporters at the Oval office, Trump said that it would be 'wonderful' if the two Asian neighbours got along well. 40 of CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber blew up an explosive-laden car near the 78-vehicle convoy in Pulwama, South Kashmir, on February 14.

"I have watched. I have got a lot of reports on it. We will have a comment (on it) at an appropriate time. It would be wonderful if they (India and Pakistan) get along," Trump was quoted as saying by news agency PTI. "That (the terrorist attack) was a horrible situation. We are getting reports. We will have a statement to put out," Trump said.

Shortly after the attack, the US had condemned the act and country's National Security Advisor John Bolton had defended India's right to self-defence in a conversation with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval. Mike Pompeo, US Secretary of State and White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders had, in separate statements, asked Pakistan to take action against the terrorist outfit involved (Jaish-e-Mohammad) JeM.

Meanwhile, in the days following the dastardly attack on the CRPF convoy, India tightened the diplomatic noose around Pakistan and appraised the international community about that country's covert and overt support to the terror infrastructure operating from its soil. Pakistan has, however, denied its role in the attack and its PM Imran Khan, in an address on Radio Pakistan, on Tuesday, threatened India of retaliation if India took any punitive action against the country.
