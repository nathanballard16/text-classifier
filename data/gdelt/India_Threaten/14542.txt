Faculty sees red in move to restructure medical colleges

Karam PrakashTribune News ServicePatiala, October 8The move of the Punjab Government to restructure the administrative set-up of government medical colleges in Patiala and Amritsar has not gone down well with the faculty of medical education in the state. Highlighting their reservations, professors said the move was a step forward towards privatisation of government-run medical colleges in the state. They said the state government could not all of a sudden make medical colleges autonomous without taking all stakeholders into confidence. Professors at both medical colleges warned against the entry of private players into medical education, saying that they would not allow the move at any cost. Instead of opening new ones, the government is planning to get rid of its existing two medical colleges, while in Haryana, a number of new medical colleges have come up in the past few years.”
