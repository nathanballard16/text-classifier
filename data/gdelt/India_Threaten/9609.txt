By 2022 all rural families to have electricity connection: Nirmala Sitharaman during budget speech 2019

New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman during her maiden Budget speech on Friday spoke about the government’s focus on rural development and electrification of rural areas. Sitharaman said the government will ensure round-the-clock power supply for all.

She said the government will work towards improving the supply of electricity to all states at affordable rates. A special package for the power sector is in the pipeline along with a new power tariff policy for the stressed sector.

“By 2022, every single rural family except those who are unwilling to take the connection will have electricity and a clean cooking facility,” Sitharaman said.

"In 2017, PM Narendra Modi had launched a new scheme, the Pradhan Mantri Sahaj Bijli Har Ghar Yojana - ‘Saubhagya’, for free electricity for all. The objective of the scheme was to provide free electricity connections to the poor and at very low cost for others.

The government had initially set March 31, 2019 as the deadline for providing electricity for all households. As per Saubhagya website, nearly all states have achieved 100 per cent electrification barring Chhattisgarh where 99.67 per cent was achieved.

While presenting the 2019 Union Budget, the finance minister also spoke about the current power situation in the country and proposed steps that the government is taking up to improve the sector.

FM Sitharaman elaborated on steps to boost the rural economy stating it's important to upgrade roads connecting villages to rural markets. For this, Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana Phase 3 is envisaged to upgrade 1,25,000 km of road length over the next five years.
