RTC JAC decides to continue strike

HYDERABAD: The Joint Action Committee of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation workers’ unions on Friday announced that the strike by employees will continue if the state government does not respond positively to their decision of joining duties unconditionally.

The announcement was made after JAC leaders held a meeting with various trade unions at the Mahatma Gandhi Bus Station here on Friday.

Briefing media after the meeting, JAC convener Ashwathama Reddy said none of the workers were allowed to join duty by the management of the RTC though a number of employees had been queuing up before depots across the state since the last two days. As a result, he said, they will continue their strike with workers holding rallies under the slogan of ‘Save RTC’ on Saturday. RTC JAC co-convener Raji Reddy accused CM K. Chandrasekhar Rao of having no intention to resolve the issue.
