Dairy farmers take out protest march

They were agitating against Centre’s move to allow duty-free imports

Farmers and members of the district milk producers union took out a protest march in Belagavi on Monday against the Union government’s decision to allow duty-free imports of milk and milk products into India.

The protesters walked from Sangolli Rayanna Circle to the Deputy Commissioner’s office with a few buffaloes and cows and raised slogans against this move. They said that there was no need to allow duty-free import of milk and milk products while Indian farmers were producing enough milk and milk products. Some of them milched buffaloes at Rani Channamma Circle during the protest.

If the Union government’s policy is implemented, millions of cattle farmers will be pushed to the streets. They will be rendered job-less as they will not be able to fight the multi-national milk companies. This will also adversely affect the cooperative agencies in milk and milk production.

Vivek Patil, district union president, said that milk producers from across the country were opposed to this.

“We have decided to launch a letter agitation where milk producers from villages will write to Prime Minister Narendra Modi opposing this import policy. We will intensify the agitation if this is not dropped,” he said. Mallappa Patil, Kallappa Girennanavar, Rayappa Dooga and others led the protest.
