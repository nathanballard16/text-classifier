Municipal Affairs dept warns ULBs against unauthorised appointments

Kolkata: The state Municipal Affairs department has issued a stern warning to the urban local bodies (ULBs) not to appoint any casual worker on monthly remuneration basis, without the approval of the state government. It has come to the notice of the department that some ULBs have recruited staff in the past, without prior approval of the department. The official added that recruiting people without obtaining prior approval leads to several complications. Next, such recruitments lead to legal challenges and staff recruited without prior approval cannot be provided service benefits and post-retirement benefits at par with regular staff. "These staff often move courts for obtaining orders for such payments, creating an embarrassing situation for the government," the official said.
