Pakistan summons Indian envoy to protest against ceasefire violation along LoC

The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security, says FO.

ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) - Foreign Office has summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh and condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by the Indian occupation forces along the Line of Control, in Bagsar Sector, which martyred an innocent civilian Azeem, while a woman sustained injuries.

In a statement on Monday , Foreign Office Spokesman Dr. Mohammad Faisal, said the Indian forces along the Line of Control and the Working boundary are continuously targeting civilian populated areas with heavy weapons.

This unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1970 ceasefire violations, says the statement.

He said the deliberate targeting of civilian population is indeed deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws.

The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation, he added.

The Director General (SA &SAARC) urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 Ceasefire arrangement; investigate this and other incidents of ceasefire violations; instruct the Indian forces to respect the ceasefire, in letter and spirit and maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary.

He also urged that the Indian side should permit UNMOGIP to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions.
