Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate from West Bengal’s Ghatal constituency Bharati Ghosh has stirred a controversy by threatening Trinamool Congress (TMC) workers. A video shared by news agency ANI where Ghosh can be seen telling two TMC workers that she would bring musclemen from Uttar Pradesh and kill them like a dog if they dared to act smart. "Get inside your houses and do not try to show your smartness here. There will be no place to hide. I will drag you out of your house and kill you like a dog.... I will bring over 1,000 men from UP, put them inside your residence and teach you a lesson," the BJP nominee said. Ghosh is a former IPS officer and was once a close aide of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee, but resigned from the party in 2017 to join BJP after she was transferred out of West Midnapore. She was later accused of extortion by the state Criminal Investigation Department.
