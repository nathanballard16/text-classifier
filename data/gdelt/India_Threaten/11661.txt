Pakistan President Warns Conflict With India Could Impact Entire World

The impact of a war between India and Pakistan would be "felt in the whole world,” according to Alvi, who warned that the presence of thousands of troops in the Kashmir valley made it one of the world's most militarised zones.

“India should not forget that there are three stakeholders in the resolution of Kashmir issue – Pakistan, India and the people of Jammu and Kashmir,” added Alvi .

Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said his country “feels saddened to see our Kashmiri brethren in IoK (Indian occupied Kashmir) being subjected to the worst kind of oppression and ruthless state terrorism.”
