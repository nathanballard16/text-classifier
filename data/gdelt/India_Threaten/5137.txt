Married Indians are looking for same-sex affairs after decriminalization

In the six months since India decriminalized gay sex, users looking for same-sex encounters on an extramarital affairs service have increased by 45%.

‘People feel freer to express their sexual preference and to pursue homosexual or bisexual encounters outside the wedlock’ Gleeden said in a press release.

Based in France, Gleeden is a female-run dating app for people looking to cheat on their husbands or wives. It has more than 4.5 million registered users.

Three percent of Gleeden’s 500,000 users in India’s are listed as homosexual while 1% are listed as bisexual.

In September last year, India’s Supreme Court ruled that a colonial-era law banning gay sex with up to 10 years in prison was unconstitutional.

What’s more, in October the same court scrapped a law which criminalized adultery.

According to a survey conducted by Gleeden, nearly 70% of respondents agreed the changes ‘will liberate people from their marriage burden and help in having love affairs out of wedlock.’

A state government in India last month promised to replace textbooks that claimed affairs caused HIV.

It listed ‘premarital/ extramarital sexual contact’ as one of ‘the ways by which HIV spreads’.

High School students in the state have been studying this incorrect information for the last three years, according to local media.

India’s Supreme Court in September last year ruled the country’s anti-gay law was unconstitutional.

Section 377 of India’s colonial-era Penal Code punished gay sex with up to 10 years in prison. But, the Supreme Court said it violated rights to privacy.

Indians, therefore, celebrated the decriminalization of an estimated 4.5 million LGBTI people.

But, LGBTI activists and leaders warned it would take time for society and businesses to accept homosexuality.
