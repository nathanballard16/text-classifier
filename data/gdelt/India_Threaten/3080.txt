Maharashtra Assembly hails Balakot strikes

Mumbai: The Maharashtra Assembly on Tuesday unanimously adopted a resolution hailing the air strikes in Balakot, Pakistan.

Moving the resolution, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis lauded the efforts of the Indian Air Force (IAF) in carrying out the strikes and annihilating the terror camps operating there.

He added that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has “kept his promise” that the sacrifice of the 40 CRPF troopers killed in the Pulwama terror attacks would not go in vain.

“The armed forces have shown their strength and proved what they can do to avenge our soldiers’ lives. The camps where Pakistan was training terrorists and sending them to India have been completely destroyed,” Fadnavis said, amidst thumping of benches.

Senior Congress leader and former minister Naseem Khan said all political parties support PM Modi’s decision “to give a free hand” to the armed forces.
