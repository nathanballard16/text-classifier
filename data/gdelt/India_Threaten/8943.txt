Lucknow, June 18

A special court in Prayagraj sentenced four persons to life imprisonment and acquitted one in connection with the 2005 Ramjanam Bhoomi-Babri Masjid (Ayodhya) terror attack in which two locals were killed and seven CRPF men injured.

Special Judge SC-ST Dinesh Chandra imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 each on the convicted persons — Asif Iqbal, Mohammed Shakeel, Irfan, and Mohammed Naseem. Accused Mohammad Aziz has been acquitted due to lack of substantial evidence.

The case hearing was concluded on June 11 after the cross-questioning of 62 witnesses and the judgment had been reserved. The case has been pleaded in front of five Benches during the past 14 years.

On July 5, 2005, five terrorists had hired a jeep on the outskirts of Ayodhya. Blasting their way into the outer cordon of the high security makeshift temple at the Ram Janmabhoomi site, they had blown up the Marshal Economy jeep which they had hired bearing a Faizabad registration number before entering the complex. The five militants had been liquidated by the police after a one-and-a-half-hour exchange of fire.

The sixth body recovered at the site was of Ramesh Pandey, a junior priest-cum-guide, living in Katara. Another woman caught in the cross fire had succumbed a month later.

CM Adityanath Yogi said the government would examine the ruling to challenge the acquittal of one person.
