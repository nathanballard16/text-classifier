Follow us on '19 terrorists to bomb 4 states of India': Threat call sends police on wild goose chase

Police of at least four southern states went into tizzy after a hoax call threatening bomb blasts rang up. The man, Sundar Murthy in his 60s, was later arrested for allegedly raising the false alarm.

According to PTI inputs, Murthy had called the police control room in Bengaluru on Friday night and said 19 terrorists were holed up in a town in Tamil Nadu and were set to bomb cities, trains and buses in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

The police immediately swung into action and managed to trace the person who made the call. Interrogation revealed that he made the call allegedly in an inebriated state.

"During interrogation, he told us that he gets possessed by some divine souls who make prophecies in his vision and his call was based on one such vision," said Additional Commissioner of Police Alok Kumar.

The fact is he is a drunkard, said the police official.

Murthy told police that he was an ex-serviceman, who is now driving a tipper-lorry.

His two sons are serving in the army while he was staying with his third son at Avalahalli.

A threat call to bomb the Pamban sea bridge in Tamil Nadu's Rameswaram was also received on Friday, prompting police to carry out extensive searches.

Recently, Bengaluru Police commissioner T Suneel Kumarhad convened a meeting with heads of various temples and religious places and managers of commercial establishments to take extra precautions and alert police on finding something suspicious.
