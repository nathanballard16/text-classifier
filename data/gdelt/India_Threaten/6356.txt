‘Terror suspect held from Delhi, planned attacks’: NIA

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Tuesday arrested Mohammad Faiz, a resident of Delhi’s Jaffrabad area, for conspiring to carry out terror attacks in the national capital region (NCR) and Uttar Pradesh by an Islamic State inspired module.

Faiz is the founding member of pro-Islamic State module — Harkat-Ul-Harb-E-Islam, also popularly known as ‘ISIS Amroha module’ — that was recently unearthed by NIA. So far, 14 members of the module, including its leader Mufti Mohammad Suhail, have been arrested.

NIA spokesperson Alok Mittal said Faiz was closely involved in the procurement of arms and ammunition for the group to carry out terrorist acts in and around NCR.

Suhail, according to a NIA officer, had even travelled to Tral, Rajouri and Bandipora twice last year and had sought arms training by a Pakistani trained “mujahideen”.

The agency had claimed in December last year, following raids at 17 places in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh, that this new ISIS inspired module was at an advanced stage of preparation for carrying out a series of bomb blasts in Delhi . The outfit members, according to NIA, were “highly radicalised and motivated”. The agency had recovered 25 kg of explosive material, including potassium nitrate, potassium chlorate, sulphur and sugar paste, 112 alarm clocks, 51 pipes, mobile phone circuits, remote control switches, steel containers and electric wires from the members.
