However, analysts warn that the positive uptake of Samsung Galaxy S10 and the growing status of Xiaomi in Europe will put some pressure on Huawei. “Huawei P30 and P30 Pro can definitely make an impact on the high-end, but like last year’s P20 this will be heavily dependent on a flurry of big budget marketing activities by Huawei,” Ben Stanton, analyst at Canalys told indianexpress.com in an email.
