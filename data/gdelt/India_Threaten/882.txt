A cleanliness poster at Howrah Railway Station in West Bengal is doing the rounds on social media for its subtle yet sarcastic communication that is directly linked to one of Bollywood’s most iconic films.

The poster, which has an image of Bollywood legends Amitabh Bachchan and Shashi Kapoor from the 1975 blockbuster ‘Deewar’, is strategically placed at all corners of the station. It also has a smart message that is a direct reference to a very famous dialogue from the film.

It reads:

Mere paas rail gaadi hai

Reserved seat hain

Twitter hain



Tumhare paas kya hai



Mere muh mein paan hain

Deewar par math thukna

The message is a tweaked version of “Aaj mere paas paisa hai, bangla hai, gaadi hai, naukar hai, bank balance hai, aur tumhare paas kya hai? Mere paas maa hai.”

An image of the poster was shared on social media by the Ministry of Railways with the caption, “DRM/Howrah launched the poster campaign on Sep22 in English&Hindi has received a phenomenal response from commuters.”

The tweet also had images of other quirky movie posters that recently highlighted the cleanliness mission.

One user wrote “Very interesting. We need such campaigns at all the stations and maybe at other public places as well.”
