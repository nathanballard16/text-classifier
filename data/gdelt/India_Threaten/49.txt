Gel nails are passé. Enter powder nails, also known as SNS (Signature Nail Systems), that last for a month, without damaging the cuticles as much. Sana Dhanani, founder at The White Door spa says the powder dip trend has still not picked up here. “Although, I foresee the awareness building in early 2019 as brands are coming up with such products. The technician starts with regular buffing of the nails. It is then followed by the application of a primer coat and a base gel coat. The nails are then one by one, dipped into pigmented dip powder. This process is done twice for each nail and then sealed with a top coat,” she explains.
