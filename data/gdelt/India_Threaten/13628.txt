Bomb threat letter to Registrar General of Karnataka HC, police registers FIR

An FIR has been registered in connection with a bomb threat letter to the Registrar General of Karnataka High Court by a person who claimed himself belonging to "International Khalistan Support Group".

The accused identified himself as Hardarshan Singh Nagpal and the FIR was registered at Vidhana Soudha police station in Bengaluru on September 18.

The accused mentioned in the threat letter that he will blast bombs in Karnataka High Court on September 30.

The demand of Khalistan, a Pakistan-backed movement seeking a separate homeland for Sikhs in India, was completely squashed by the Indian security forces in the 1990s. Hundreds of innocent people had lost their lives due to militancy. It however still has its supporters in India and abroad.
