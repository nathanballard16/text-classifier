The Indian Army officials on Thursday said that they are fully prepared to tackle the Pakistan military-backed march by locals from Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. The march has been scheduled for October 4.

The march is being planned in protest against India's decision to abrogate provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status.

The officials also said that the Indian Army will follow standard operating procedures against any attempt to violate the Line of Control (LoC) and the Indian territory. A warning has already been given to the Pakistan Army against such attempts, they said.

Pakistan's law enforcing agencies must ensure the sanctity of the LoC, Indian Army officials said ahead of a march on Friday. Indian Army officials also said the Pakistan Army is using Kashmiris in PoK as cannon fodder and Indian security forces are ready to deal with any eventualities along the LoC.

Indian army is aware of the public utterances of Pakistani leaders aimed at instigating unarmed civilians, the sources were quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

Ties between India and Pakistan came under severe strain after New Delhi abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5 to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status, and bifurcated it into two union territories.

Pakistan reacted angrily to the move and expelled the Indian envoy. Since then, Pakistan has been trying to rally international support against India on the issue.
