Kenya warns against falling bilateral trade

"India's bilateral trade with Kenya has dropped from $3.4 billion in 2014 to $2.05 billion in 2018. African countries are on way to creating a unified market enabling traders an investment to do business in a friendlier environment. In the same period, Chinese bilateral trade has increased from $2.8 billion to $3.9 billion," said Willy Bett, High Commissioner of Kenya in India while talking to media persons in the city. Bett, who led a Kenyan delegation to Ahmedabad, was hardselling Kenya and Tanzania as a gateway to African countries in the hinterland. Kenyan authorities, on Friday, warned India against falling exports to the African country, while the exports from China are rising.
