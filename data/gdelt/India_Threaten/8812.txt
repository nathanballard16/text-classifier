No Threat To Amarnath Yatris, They Are Our Guests: Geelani

Srinagar

Calling the warm hospitality of the people of Kashmir a globally acknowledged fact, Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) in the backdrop of Amarnath Yatra said that Kashmiri people will continue to retain and nourish this tradition as also the tradition of brotherhood communal amity.

In a joint statement issued here, the leadership said Kashmiri people never compromised on their tradition of hospitality, even in the toughest and trying times, and always played a friendly host, whether to a tourist or an Amarnath pilgrim who came to Kashmir.

Ridiculing “electronic media” channels for running a smear campaign and propaganda about the threats to Amarnath Yatra and pilgrims, the leadership said that some electronic channels are hell bent to spread hate and falsehoods on Kashmir. There is no threat to Amarnath Yatris from Kashmiris, pilgrims are very much safe in the Valley.

JRL said fake news, twisting of facts and projecting villainous pictures of Kashmiri’s has been the modus operandi of these news channels and people of Kashmir and tourists have understood their ulterior motives and nobody is paying heed to their false reporting any more “We want people of other parts of India to come to Kashmir and stay here and to see for themselves, the ultimate form of “repression” being unleashed by the lakhs of government forces, who are muzzling the genuine rights of people under and how youth are being pushed to the wall,” the leadership said.

The leadership said tourists and Amarnath Pilgrims visiting Kashmir can go places of their choice and tell the actual ground reality to rest of the people across India and also expose these sections of national media who have adopted a jingoistic approach vis-a-vis Kashmir just to get their TRPs high.

The leadership appealed to the pilgrims and tourists not to pay heed to the false propaganda stories being run by a few “Delhi-based” news channels and instead focus on their Kashmir sojourn without any fear and intimidation.
