Hyundai says salary increase for technicians of Chennai factory

In its statement, the company said, as per the agreement technicians will receive an average salary increase of Rs 25,200 per month spread over three years.

The company said that it had concluded a long term wage agreement with the recognised United Union of Hyundai Employees (UUHE).

Hyundai Motor India Limited (HMIL) on Monday claimed via a statement that the South Korean company had quelled a workers protest.

This would mean that a monthly salary raise of Rs 13,860 will be given in the first year, Rs 6,300 in the second year and Rs 5,040 a month in the third year.

The three year wage settlement will be implemented with retrospective effect from April 2018 and will remain effective until March 2021, the statement added.

The workers' unrest in Hyundai's Sriperumbudur factory had been reported ever since 2010. In 2012, news reports claimed that workers had resorted to strike over negotiated wage settlement and reinstatement of a dismissed worker.

In late 2018, two unions, the United Union of Hyundai Employees (UUHE) and Hyundai Motor India Employees Union (HMIEU), were reportedly considering a strike to demand better wages.

E. Muthukumar, President, HMIEU, had in an interaction with IANS in late 2018 had claimed that the union did not want to strike work, but wanted better wages comparable with their counterparts from Hyundai's factory in South Korea.

It had been reported that Hyundai India had refused to recognise HMIEU on the ground that the company has a works committee to take care of workers' issues. According to an unverified source, the union of UUHE has a membership base of 2,062 while HMIEU has 201 members.

An official comment from the Unions is awaited even as one is made to believe that Hyundai's latest salary increase could quell the workers' unrest.
