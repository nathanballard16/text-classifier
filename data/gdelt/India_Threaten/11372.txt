President Kovind gives assent to National Medical Commission Bill

President Ram Nath Kovind has given his nod to National Medical Commission Bill 2019.

The move came after Parliament passed the bill in the just-concluded session. The Bill seeks to repeal the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.

It has provisions to set up the National Medical Commission which will frame policies for regulating medical institutions and medical professionals and assess the requirements of healthcare-related human resources and infrastructure.

Union Health Minister Dr. Harsh Vardhan hails the NMC Act as historic and milestone in the medical education sector.

Addressing a press conference in New Delhi yesterday, Dr Harsh Vardhan said, the rules will be framed and the NMC will be constituted within six months.

He said, the NMC Act is progressive legislation which will reduce the burden on students and bring down costs of medical education.
