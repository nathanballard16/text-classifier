In a major revelation in connection with the Pulwama terror attack that took place on Thursday in which 40 CRPF personnel were martyred, sources informed that the terrorists had initially planned to execute the attack on the death anniversary of Afzal Guru that falls on February 9. They said that the attack was perpetrated to avenge the death of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar’s nephew Usman Haider. It was earlier planned by the JeM terrorists to carry out their operation on February 9 which is terrorist Afzal Guru’s death anniversary, or on February 11, which is the death anniversary of Maqbool Bhat, the founder of the militant organisation National Liberation Front, but due to heavy snowfall the highway was shut and the attack could not be executed. Suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, (who did the van ramming on February 14) had gone to the Srinagar-Jammu highway on 2,6, and 8 February also. Full preparations were in place to execute attack on February 9, but snowfall prevented it. At first, they had planned to attack the army camp or by mine blast.
