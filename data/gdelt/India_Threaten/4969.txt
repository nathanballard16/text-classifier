Mission Shakti: Space debris warning after India destroys satellite

Debris from such tests can harm civilian and military satellite operations, and collide with other objects in space. But India said that it had intentionally carried out its 'Mission Shakti' test in the lower atmosphere - at an altitude of 300km (186 miles) - to ensure that there was no debris and that whatever was left would "decay and fall back onto the earth within weeks".
