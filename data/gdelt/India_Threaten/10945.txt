Govt warns of punitive action as doctors continue strike

AMN / NEW DELHI

The Health Ministry has warned the striking resident doctors of AIIMS and Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi, of punitive action like termination of their service if they do not join duty immediately.

The doctors are protesting against National Medical Commission Bill.

Following the Ministry’s direction, the Hospital Administrations have issued memorandums to their resident doctors to resume work. AIIMS resident doctors resumed emergency services around midnight last night but non-essential services, including OPD services, remained suspended. At Safdarjung Hospital, the doctors did not join duties in any department, including the emergency department.

Yesterday, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan had appealed to the resident doctors to end their strike following a meeting with them in New Delhi.
