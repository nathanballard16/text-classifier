IAF Inducts Supersonic Fighter Jets

India’s first indigenous supersonic fighter jet, the light combat aircraft (LCA) Tejas, has been inducted into the Indian Air Force (IAF).

The LCA, which is meant to replace MiG 21s and MiG 23s, is considered to be the world’s smallest military aircraft with a single seat.

The aircraft is also considered to be among the top eight aircraft in the world in technological design and performance terms.

The LCA has been developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s (DRDO) Aeronautical Development Agency and manufactured by Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).
