Pakistan To Skip Chinese Navy Birthday Parade Due To Heavy Indian Deployment in Arabian Sea, India Sending Two Ships

The Pakistani navy is unlikely to take part in China’s maritime parade to mark the 70th anniversary of the Chinese navy to be held in China’s east coast later in April and the reason for this non-participation is believed to be the heavy deployment done by Indian navy in the Arabian Sea. The Hindustan Times reported. India, however, will take part in the parade with two warships participating in the parade, the PTI reported.

Pakistan navy was expected to send two ships to attend the parade which is going to be inspected by President Xi Jinping on the coastal city of Qingdao on April 23.

The tensions were high between India and Pakistan after the Pulwama attack on February 14th in which more than 40 CRPF soldiers were martyred. In response, India has launched a pre-emptive non-military action in Pakistan by destroying a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) camp using IAF Mirage 2000.

In response, Pakistan on February 27, had breached Indian Air Space and an air skirmish between the two air forces had happened after which Indian pilot was captured by Pakistan. Though Wing Commander Abhinandan was returned by Pakistan, tension is still high.

Yesterday, fueling the tensions, Pakistan foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that India is planning another attack on Pakistan between April 16 to 20. India in response rubbished the Pakistan minister’s claims.

Two Indian naval ships — INS 'Kolkata' and 'Shakti' — would take part in the Chinese Navy's 70th anniversary of celebrations later this month.
