Enough is enough, India cannot suffer terrorism till eternity: PM

Ghaziabad: Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday issued a stern warning to terrorist forces targeting India, saying the country cannot keep suffering forever.

“Enough is enough,” he said, while referring to the terror attacks in Pulwama and Uri.

“We cannot keep suffering till eternity.” Addressing the 50th raising day of the Central Industrial Security Force as the Chief Guest here, Modi said the role of security forces like the CISF becomes very significant when the nation faces a hostile neighbour, and when some elements hatching conspiracy within the country get encouragement from across the border.

“When the neighbour is very hostile but does not have the capability to fight a war and various conspiracies hatched within the country are getting encouragement from across the border and when the ghastly pictures of terror come to light, under such difficult situations, (ensuring) security of the country and its institutions becomes very challenging,” the PM said.

In an indirect reference to the air strike at a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan, Modi said sometimes the government has to take certain strong decisions. Congratulating the CISF, the Prime Minister also said it is easier to protect an individual but very difficult to protect any institution.

The CISF is mandated to provide security to major critical infrastructure installations — nuclear installations, airports, seaports, power plants, government buildings, Delhi Metro Rail Corporation — of the country both in public and private sectors. (PTI)
