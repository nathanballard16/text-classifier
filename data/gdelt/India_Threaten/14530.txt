While many believe that the upcoming Maharashtra assembly polls in the state are going to be a one-sided affair, the BJP, it seems, doesn’t want to take chances.

Not only did CM Devendra Fadnavis undertake the Mahajanadesh Yatra touring various constituencies, the central leadership is also prepared.

Home Minister Amit Shah on Tuesday participated in the Dussehra rally in Marathwada’s Beed district.

With this, Amit Shah officially sounded the poll bugle in the state.

Addressing a large gathering at Savargaon Ghat, Amit Shah not only praised PM Narendra Modi over the issue of Abrogation of Article 370 but also lauded him for doing great work for the OBCs.

Amit Shah said that PM Modi addressed the issue of backward classes by setting up the OBC Commission which the previous governments couldn’t do in the last 70 years.

PM integrated Jammu and Kashmir with India. His work should reach every house in the region( Marathwada), Amit Shah added.

The BJP has already asserted that the issue of Article 370 would be a major election issue. Even Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis endorsed the same.

The Dusherra rally at Savargaon Ghat was organised by state BJP Leader Pankaja Munde. Amit Shah was welcomed with 370 canon shots being fired in the air and at the same time 370 flags were waived. It was a symbolic gesture to appreciate the Centre’s effort in abrogating Article 370.

Pankaja Munde, contesting from the Parli assembly seat, is facing stiff competition form her cousin and NCP candidate Dhananjay Munde.
