Apple iPhone 11: Review, what stands out

The big change with the iPhone 11 is that it comes with dual-cameras with Apple adding the ultra-wide angle sensor this variant. Last year’s iPhone XR had a single rear camera. Apple has also added the Night Mode on this camera as well.

In our review, we pointed out that the iPhone 11 could be a big winner from the company, given the price and the overall package. The camera, especially the Night mode stands out, and the ultra-wide mode is something else. Regarding the ultra-wide camera and the video camera we had this to say,

“In fact, the 120-degree field of view is packed into a 4:3 frame, which is unique and giving a whole new perspective.”

Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max: Review, what stands out

In our review, we have called the iPhone 11 Pro Max, the best offering from Apple at the moment and there’s good reason for it. The ultra-wide angle camera adds a completely new look and angle to the photos, especially to landscape shots, which is not seen on other phones.

The Night Mode is the other new addition, which can brighten up even the darkest lit scenes. The A13 Bionic chipset is the most powerful in the market, and it shows its prowess in the camera and the overall performance.

The experience of gaming, with the display, audio playback and processing power is something else.

Apple Watch Series 5 Review

There’s no doubt that the Apple Watch is the best-selling smartwatch and with Series 5 it is just continues. Apple has kept the design completely same as the Watch Series 4, though the new Series 5 comes with an Always-On display and a magnetic compass as well. Apple has also rolled out the ECG feature to India, which is now available on Series 5 and Series 4.
