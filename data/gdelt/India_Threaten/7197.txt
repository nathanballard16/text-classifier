Punjab CM says Congress would not allow secular ideology of nation to be destroyed

Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said that Congress party would not allow the secular ideology of the nation to be destroyed at any cost.

“India belonged to all religions, which was its strength, and the Congress would not allow anyone to destroy its cherished secular values,” said Capt. Amarinder at Sardulgarh in Bathinda as he sought vote for change and for the protection of the nation’s secular fabric.

Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his failure to fulfil any pre-poll promise, the Chief Minister said the Prime Minister had been fooling people with his ‘jumlas’, and his attempts to take credit for the armed forces’ victory only to divide the nation.

“The Modi government did nothing for any section of the society, particularly the farmers, who were reduced to desperate straits because of their anti-farmer policies. It was the Congress government in Punjab which came to the farmers’ rescue with the loan waiver scheme,” he said, adding that Congress president Rahul Gandhi had also promised waiver of debts for farmers across the country once the party comes to power.

Capt. Amarinder said that only the Congress could ensure Punjab’s and the country’s progress and promised to fill up the 1.2 lakh vacancies that the previous SAD-BJP government completely ignored during their tenure, which they spent misusing the government funds and resources.

“The Congress government in Punjab had already facilitated more than 8 lakh jobs in the state in just two years, as against the mere 40,000 given by the SAD-BJP government in 10 years,” he said.
