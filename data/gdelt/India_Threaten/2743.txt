TS Budget lacks clarity, disappointing: Bhatti

Hyderabad: Leader of Opposition in Telangana State Legislative Assembly Mallu Bhatti Vikramarka has described the 'Vote-on- Account' budget presented by Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao in Assembly today as totally disappointing and hopeless.

Speaking to media persons, Bhatti said that the budget lacks clarity on lot of sectors and it clearly exposed the State Government had no financial discipline. He said loans borrowed from various sources have been shown as revenue and the State Government was still planning to take more loans.

Bhatti said there was no proper government in place till two days ago. It was only after the formation of Cabinet that the government actually started functioning. Apparently for the same reason, lot of critical issues were neglected in the budget. He said it would have been ideal if the government would have brought a full-fledged budget instead of going for 'Vote-on-Account'. He said that the introduction of a full-fledged after the formation of a new government at the Centre would take lot of time.

The Opposition Leader also expressed concern over lack of mention of steps proposed to be taken by the State Government to fill vacancies and create more jobs. He said there was no clarity on the date from which enhanced amounts for Rythu Bandhu and Aasra Pensions would be given.

Bhatti said that the Congress party would expose the financial failures of TRS Government during the discussion on budget in the House. However, he said that there was not enough time to discuss the budget in the House due to three-day session.
