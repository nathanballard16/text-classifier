Delhi-Meerut RRTS: 82-Km Sahibabad-Duhai Stretch To Be Operational By March 2023

The Delhi-Ghaziabad-Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System (RRTS) will have its Sahibabad to Duhai corridor opened by March 2033, Rail Analysis India reports. The project worth Rs 30,274 crore, once completed will reduce the travel time between Delhi and Meerut to just 55 minutes.

The 82-km stretch will be the first-of-its-kind rail based high-speed regional transit system in India and will be the fastest, most comfortable and most secure mode of transport in the National Capital Region (NCR).

The corridor will pass through one of the most populated sections of the NCR and will be beneficial for the development of the region connecting a large number of townships and centres of economic activity. The RRTS trains will be available at a frequency of 5-10 minutes and have an operational speed of 160 Kmph. The trains would run at an average speed of 100 Kmph.

The NCRTC (National Capital Region Transport Corporation), the implementing agency of the RRTS projects, has set March 2024 as the deadline for completion of the entire project from Sarai Kale Khan to Meerut.

The project is funded by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) as part of its effort to improve the urban transport system in India.
