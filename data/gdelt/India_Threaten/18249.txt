Shiv Sena targets private banks amid tiff with ex-CM’s wife

MUMBAI/THANE: Days after a bitter Twitter spat between Amruta Fadnavis — the banker wife of former Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis — and Shiv Sena functionary Priyanka Chaturvedi and a brewing controversy over a Maharashtra government proposal to move employees’ salary accounts from private to nationalised banks, Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske on Friday urged the city’s civic administration to carry out the shift at the earliest.Maharashtra finance minister Jayant Patil had said earlier this week that the Shiv Sena-led government was “considering” shifting employees’ salary accounts from Axis Bank , where Amruta holds a senior position. Patil’s statement was seen to perpetuate the impression that Fadnavis had favoured his wife’s employer during his tenure. Mayor Mhaske, however, said his own statement was merely aimed at directing the administration to comply with rules governing investments of civic bodies.“There is a rule that government-related accounts should be in nationalized banks,” he said. Hours later, Shiv Sena corporator and Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar echoed her party colleague’s refrain saying BMC, India’s largest civic body by assets, needed to ensure that its investments were safe.She said “there is need to think about the best available option” in the light of irregularities in financial institutions. However, she sought to dispel the impression that the ruling party was keen to shift accounts from Axis Bank.“If we decide to shift money from a private bank, it will be from all private banks.” Amruta said it was obvious that the ruling parties were targeting her husband. She said her criticism of the Maha Aghadi regime through recent tweets had contributed to it.“The government should take criticism positively for betterment instead of adopting such a step,” she said, adding that she worked in the back office of Axis Bank and had never been asked by her employer to give any references.PTI on Thursday reported that the private bank might end up losing Maharashtra police departments salary accounts, worth Rs 11,000 crore annually if the Sena government transfers them to a public sector bank.Amruta had last week taunted Shiv Sena chief Uddhav, saying one cannot be a “Thackeray” just by putting Thackeray after his name. This came as a follow-up reaction to Congress MP Rahul Gandhi ’s “My name is not Rahul Savarkar” remark.
