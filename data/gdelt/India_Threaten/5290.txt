Dummy EVMs seized in AP

The machines were transported in a mini-truck and were to be delivered to Polavaram YSRCP candidate Balaraju, police confirmed.

However, the YSRCP sources claimed that the machines were to be used for educating the voters.

On the other hand, the Income Tax department raided the house of Putta Sudhakar Yadav the TTD chairman and the TDP candidate from Mydukuru Assembly segment of Kadapa district in Proddutur on Wednesday afternoon. The I-T raids came a day after Yadav made a complaint to EC against the YSRCP for printing dummy ballot papers showing Yadav and his symbol cycle third in the list. The YSRCP cadre was found distributing the ballot papers across the Assembly segment.

“On Tuesday YS Jaganmohan Reddy stayed back in Hyderabad. The very next day there are I-T raids on AP leaders,” said Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu accusing Jagan of planning attacks.

In yet another incident Telangana police allegedly chased Gannavaram TDP candidate Vallabhaneni Vamsi with a non-bailable warrant in connection with a 2009 case of unlicensed firearms.
