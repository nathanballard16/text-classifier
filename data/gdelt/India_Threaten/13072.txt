BJP’s Telangana Unit Calls For Struggle Against Razakars To Be Included In State’s School Syllabus

As part for its push for 17 September to be officially declared as ‘Telangana Liberation Day’, BJP’s Telangana unit has now sought for the state’s school syllabus to include a lesson teaching about the people’s fight against the Nizam’s private militia, the Razakars, reports The Times of India.

The Razakar militia wanted to preserve the Nizam’s rule and were inclined towards eventually acceding to Pakistan. They played a brutal role in repressing the majority Hindu population of the Hyderabad princely state because the latter wanted to join India. The group was defeated after India launched Operation Polo to integrate the state with the rest of the country.

Commenting on how people had forgotten about the fight against the Razakars, BJP leader Srivardhan Reddy stated, “There is a lack of awareness on the people’s struggle against Razakars and this has to be made known to people in Telangana.”

According to Reddy, they will be conducting a large-scale awareness campaign among college students about the people’s struggle in Hyderabad on 10 September. An exhibition with liberation day as the theme will also be organised on the same day at the Constitutional Club of India.
