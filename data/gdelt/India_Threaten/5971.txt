Even if BJP rules for next 200 years, Congress won’t allow them to revoke art-370: Azad

Srinagar: Senior Congress leader Ghulam Nabi Azad today said even if BJP rules for the next 200 years, Congress will never allow them to revoke Article 370.

“Till Congress exists in India, it will never allow BJP to revoke Article 370,” he said.

Azad while talking to reporters after addressing an election rally in south Kashmir said Congress will win with a huge majority in the Lok Sabha elections. “After victory here, both G A Mir and I will address a rally here,” he said.

Hitting hard at BJP led government, Azad said BJP talks about Beti Bachao and Beti Padao, but every other day a rape incident is reported in the country.

“They have failed to ensure security of women across country,” Azad said. (KNS)
