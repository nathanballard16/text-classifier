In a campaign speech in Rajasthan on April 22, prime minister Narendra Modi casually threatened Pakistan with the use of nuclear bombs, saying India’s nuclear arsenal has not been saved for Diwali. Another world leader, US president Donald Trump has been just as cavalier with mentioning nuclear weapons to make threats in the past.
