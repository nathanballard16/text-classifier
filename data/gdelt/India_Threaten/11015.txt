GREATER NOIDA: A day after residents of Rabupura blocked the Yamuna Expressway in protest against the police’s failure to trace two “missing men”, the cops have registered a case of kidnapping.Police said an FIR has been lodged against unknown persons for kidnapping two men, who went missing from Dankaur on Thursday while they were returning home from Haryana after selling fodder.After meeting the family of the victims, the police scanned multiple CCTV cameras and retrieved footage of the tractor trolley in which they were travelling.Police said that the footage of the missing duo — Naresh Pal and Aslam — has been found from different spots along the Eastern Peripheral Expressway in Haryana.Rabupura SHO Vineet Kumar told TOI that the men were seen at a petrol pump and a shop in Haryana’s Chainsa area. The cops said the family members have identified the duo in the CCTV footage. However, the family members said they were not satisfied with the work done by police in the case.Mukesh, Naresh Pal’s brother, told TOI that the missing duo could have been attacked. “We found their clothes and footwear from the tractor that was parked in the village,” he said.Meanwhile, the villagers have threatened to take out a protest on the expressway again in case the men are not found.“The administration won’t listen to us. We will have to resort to blocking traffic in case Naresh and Aslam are not found,” he said.
