F.P. Report

ISLAMABAD: Former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar on Saturday said that the mentality of Narendra Modi was the basic cause of escalation between Pakistan and India.

Chaudhry Nisar in his statement said that fire would be spread everywhere when Modi-like person was made the ruler of a country.

The former interior minister claimed independence of Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir was not possible under the rulership of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress.

“I am among those people of Pakistan who don’t expect something good from India.”

He urged the government to be readied on every front amid tensions between Pakistan and India.

Nisar said that an army will only fight firmly to its enemy when nationals support them.

While commenting over Prime Minister’s speech, Chaudhry Nisar said that he was quite surprised after listening to Imran Khan’s address. The premier should be well aware of the fact that an army always fights an enemy when nationals support them, he added.

The politician advised Prime Minister Imran Khan and its political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, to unite the nation to avoid taking such steps that distributes them. He urged PM Khan to be focused on uniting nation instead of listening speculators sitting around him.

Nisar had contested the July 25 general elections on four seats of national and provincial assemblies as an independent candidate but won only one seat PP-10, Rawalpindi-V by securing 53,145. He, however, didn’t take oath as member Punjab Assembly.
