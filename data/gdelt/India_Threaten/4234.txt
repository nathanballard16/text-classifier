India has asked its oil companies to cut back on their purchase from Venezuela even as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked New Delhi to stop being the “economic lifeline for the Maduro regime”.

The Indian decision could sound the death knell for the Nicolas Maduro regime because New Delhi is Caracas’ second largest customer after the US.

The Venezuelan economic crisis will intensify once both countries stop buying its crude.

At its peak, India was purchasing 4 lakh barrels per day of Venezuelan oil, of which Reliance accounted for 75 per cent of the heavy sulphur crude. India’s total purchases have now whittled to 3 lakh barrels a day.

“The Indian government is warning companies to halt purchases of Venezuelan oil or face undisclosed consequences,” agencies quoted MM Kutty, Petroleum and Natural Gas Secretary, at an event in Houston, US.

The issue had also figured in talks between Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale and US State Department officials.

After the meeting, Pompeo said, “In the same way that India has been incredibly supportive of our efforts on Iran, I am confident that they too understand the real threat to the Venezuelan people. So, we had a good conversation around that.”

India does not have much interest in engaging with the current regime after its major investment in the San Cristobal oil field turned dud due to poor management. India had been giving around $600 million every year for meeting working capital expenses and in return received oil of the same amount. But for the past two years, there has been no economic activity at the oil field.
