Sri Lankan top cop points finger at President over Easter attacks

COLOMBO • Sri Lanka's suspended police chief has petitioned the Supreme Court, accusing President Maithripala Sirisena of failing to prevent the Easter bombings that killed 258 people.

In a 20-page complaint, Inspector-General Pujith Jayasundara disclosed serious communication gaps between intelligence agencies and security arms of the government, all of which fall under Mr Sirisena.

In the petition submitted to the court last week and seen by the media yesterday, Mr Jayasundara said the country's premier spy agency, the State Intelligence Service (SIS), ordered him last year to stop ongoing police investigations into Islamist militants.

The SIS, which reports directly to Mr Sirisena, wanted the police's terrorist investigation department to stop all inquiries into extremist Muslim factions, including the National Thowheeth Jama'ath (NTJ), which was blamed for the Easter attacks.

Mr Jayasundara said SIS head Nilantha Jayawardena did not take seriously the intelligence shared by neighbouring India which warned of an impending attack by the NTJ.

Mr Jayasundara said that despite the SIS not sharing information warnings with the police department, he had initiated action to alert his senior men, but he had no input from the main spy agency.

Mr Sirisena suspended Mr Jayasundara after he refused to accept responsibility for the deadly attacks. Attorney-General Dappula de Livera has asked for a full Bench of the apex court to decide the case.
