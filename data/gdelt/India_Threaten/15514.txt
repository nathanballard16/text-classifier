2 Pune cops dismissed for ‘seeking financial favours’ in land deal

It has been alleged that the two policemen accepted money from a person with a criminal background during the deal.

Two personnel of Pune City Police have been dismissed from service for allegedly taking part in a land deal illegally for financial gains. The order against Police Havaldar Shailesh Jagtap and Police Naik Parvez Jamadar was passed by Additional Commissioner of Police Sanjay Shinde on Friday.

A departmental inquiry against Jagtap and Jamadar had revealed that the two policemen sought financial favours in a land deal in Parvati area. It has been alleged that the two policemen accepted money from a person with a criminal background during the deal. An inquiry was initiated against Jagtap and Jamadar after the woman who owned the land filed a complaint with Pune Police Commissioner K Venkatesham. Both cops have refuted the allegations against them. Jagtap told reporters that he and Jamadar have been framed and they will appeal before the Maharashtra Administrative Tribunal against the order.

Venkatesham has also given a ‘strict warning’ to Senior Police Inspector Murlidhar Karpe of Bibvewadi police station for failing to take action against illegal activities in his jurisdiction. He also passed an order to stop any salary hikes for a year for Inspector Bhaskar Jadhav for failing to take action against illegal activities.
