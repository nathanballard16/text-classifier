Voting for BJP will play into Pakistan’s hands, says Arvind Kejriwal

MARGAO: Delhi chief minister and national convenor of AAP Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday warned that voting BJP to power will amount to playing into the hands of Pakistan whose agenda, he said, is to create communal violence in the country. Stating that the return of Narendra Modi-Amit Shah pair to power posed a threat to the Constitution and the secular structure of the country, Kejriwal also warned of mob lynching across the country, including in Goa, if Shah became the Union home minister, which he said was a high probability if BJP returned to power.Addressing the gathering at Lohia maidan, Margao, Kejriwal said, “The country is in danger. If Modi-Shah pair come back to power, neither will this country survive nor will its Constitution and its secular structure. Bear this in mind when you go to vote.”Casting aspersions on Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s statement that Modi should become PM again, Kejriwal said, “What Pakistan failed to do in the last 70 years (creating communal disharmony), the Modi-Shah pair did in the last five years — poisoning the minds of the people and creating communal tension.”Pointing out to a statement reportedly made by Shah to the effect that every single infiltrator, except Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs, will be expelled from the country, Kejriwal said, “In his eyes, every Christian, Muslim, Parsi, Jain, is an infiltrator. I want to ask Amit Shah how will he implement his vision in Goa that has nearly six lakh minorities? ”Further projecting his government’s achievements in Delhi, Kejriwal said that AAP has created a revolution on all fronts in the last four years it has been in power there.Goa AAP convenor Elvis Gomes reacting to accusations by Congress of AAP being the B-team of the BJP as it will split Congress votes, accused the Congress of facilitating BJP’s march to power over the last few years. Referring to splits in Congress that had led to Goa getting 13 chief ministers in 10 years, Gomes said, “You have split so many times, is there anything left to split this party any further?”
