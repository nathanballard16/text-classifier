And I had also warned them that if they ignore the farmers' claims, then we'll shut down their offices in Mumbai."He added that complaints are registered by farmers everyday at theoffices which are located in the rural areas.He said that even though the protest will take place in Mumbai, it is a warning for insurance companies which are present even in other cities."We also demand an independent Agriculture Commission with powers to deal with agriculture-related issues. The commission should be empowered to rectify loopholes in various schemes meant for the agriculture sector since governments come and go but the official machinery remains the same," he said."If the warning doesn't work, we will talk to the insurance companies in the language of the Shiv Sena," the party chief said.— With inputs from agencies
