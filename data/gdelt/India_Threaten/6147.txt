A recap of what has happened

A special bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi was constituted on Saturday to hear a "matter of great public importance" touching upon the independence of judiciary.

During the hearing, CJI Ranjan Gogoi dismissed the allegations and said they were malafide in nature. He said it is a bigger ploy to destablise the judiciary. He said this is a "very very serious threat" to the independence of judiciary.

"This is unbelievable. I don't think I should stoop low even to deny these allegations. Nobody can catch me on money, people have to find something and they have found this," PTI quoted CJI Ranjan Gogoi as saying.
