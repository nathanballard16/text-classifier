An exclusive control room would function with immediate effect at the Collectorate complex to handle election-related queries. Public can call the toll free numbers 1950 or 18004258530 to lodge their complaints. They can also report MCC and election expenditure violations through a mobile application called ‘c-Vigil’.

Defacing properties
