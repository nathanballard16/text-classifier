Article 370: Away from home, Kashmiri students in Greater Noida share concerns, say many questions unanswered

NOIDA: While many are celebrating the Union government ’s decision to scrap the contentious article 370 Kashmiri students in Greater Noida have voiced concerns.The students, who have not been able to speak to their families back in Kashmir since Sunday night, are asking for clarity while many want to return home.Most of the students said their families back in Kashmir had hinted about the possibility of the phone services also getting scrapped after the internet services were suspended on Sunday night.Internet and mobile services were suspended in several places in Srinagar as public gatherings were banned in the district as section 144 was imposed from midnight.Some students have asked their authorities to allow them to leave for home as they are concerned about what was happening back in Kashmir and are out of touch with their families.Students who had to go to Kashmir and have their flight tickets booked already, are in a wait and watch mode now, looking at how events unfold.Irfan, a student from Srinagar who studies in Sharda University , said that he hasn't been able to talk to his parents since Sunday night."I called up my parents yesterday and they said that since 10 pm, the internet was shut. They said that curfew has been imposed and they had started stocking up essential items. We are concerned about what is going to happen. It’s an emotive issue which is likely to have a reaction," he said.Students say that the suspense around what was going to happen had led to long lines being witnessed outside ATMs and petrol pumps in Srinagar.While many students are already at home in Kashmir due to vacations, some of them had booked their flights for Srinagar and they are now wondering whether they would be able to go back or would have to cancel the travel.Taiyyaba, another Sharda university student from Kashmir told TOI that she hasn't been able to speak to her family since Sunday night.A general feeling among Kashmiri students was that the article 370 should not be scrapped as it gives a special status to J-K including the contentious issue of land purchase in the state."People are going to be very angry as there are a lot of concerns which are yet to be addressed," said Faizal Geelani, a student from Galgotias college.Irfan said that so far, only students from Jammu and Kashmir can apply for a government job in the state. "Further, only locals can buy land in the state. These two issues that need to be addressed. There should be provisions that address these concerns of the locals who have no idea about what is happening," he said.Geelani said that most of his friends from Kashmir want to return home."I had met an unknown person yesterday outside the college and he wanted to draw me into a debate over the issue but I refused. We know these things can turn serious since we are out of home," Faizan told TOI.Kashmiri students of the college have asked the Galgotias college authorities to allow them some relaxation in attendance because they want to go home."They have said that it is our personal decision and they will help in considering some relaxation in attendance," said Faizan.Shrishant Sharma, spokesperson, Galgotias College of Engineering and Technology told TOI that although attendance will not be an issue if students want to leave for home as some have demanded, the issue is security of the students. "Since we can't talk to parents, we can't be sure about whether or not they have reached their home safely, the security concerns would remain. Hence, this risk cannot be taken. What if they reach Jammu and the local administration there does not let them go beyond. Students are emotional and hence want to go home, hence the same cannot be allowed. But if they feel insecure inside the campus, the university is standing with them," he said.While students are concerned, universities and colleges are too exercising caution in a bid to ensure that there is no untoward incident or rumour –mongering or entry of outsiders inside the campuses.Ajit Kumar, spokesperson, Sharda university said that they are keeping special watch and ensuring no outsider enters the varsity."We are monitoring that no anti-social element enters the varsity. There is a helpline number for students and we have asked the students to use that number in case of any problem," he said.The varsity had disallowed the entry of media on Monday.Some professors have verbally told students "to exercise caution," said students."I am one of the few Kashmiri students in my batch and my professor today told me to exercise caution especially if I was going out as the issue was a sensitive one," said a Sharda university student.Meanwhile, Kashmiri Pandit students have welcomed the move.Sakshi Bhat (19), a BJMC student studying in Amity university, Greater Noida told TOI that she welcomes the decision and wants to know whether they will ever be able to claim their properties in Kashmir which have been occupied by locals back there after the exodus of Kashmiri Pandits from the area.“My parents share stories about how our land was occupied by locals there. My grandfather still lives there but has not been able to claim that land where construction has started. I don’t know what’s going to happen in future but I am happy that this decision has been taken,” she said.
