The BEST strike is now a week old

The Bombay High Court said yesterday that it will issue “appropriate orders” today if those involved in theare not able to resolve the issue. The court also noted that “things cannot continue as they are”.A division bench of Chief Justice Naresh Patil and Justice NM Jamdar directed the state government-appointed committee to negotiate with the striking union and submit a report in a sealed cover clarifying its views on some of the urgent demands of the employees.The bench has been urging theled by, the, the government, andto resolve issues in a “congenial environment” and ensure minimum inconvenience to the public.The court was hearing a PIL by lawyer Datta Mane, urging it to pass interim orders directing BEST workers to call off the strike immediately. Over 32,000 employees of BEST are on strike since last week, and 3,700 buses in its fleet are off the roads.Following the high court's intervention, the state government constituted a committee headed by the chief secretary and held meetings with the union and other stakeholders.State Advocate General Ashutosh Kumbhakoni and the BMC told the Bench that they had proposed several solutions to resolve the issues faced by the BEST employees, but the union remained adamant on not withdrawing the strike. The AG termed the strike as illegal in view of the state's laws on essential services and a previous order of the industrial court in the city.“The strike has no legal sanction. The union has made its point by calling the strike and all concerned authorities, including this court, have taken a serious note of their demands. Therefore, the strike must now be called off and the union must enter negotiations with the committee with an open mind,” Kumbhakoni said.The union's counsel, Neeta Karnik, told the Bench that the BEST workers were most concerned about the pay grade of around 15,000 juniorlevel employees who earn less than Rs 15,000 per month. Karnik said the employees will return to work only when convinced that the authorities will address the issue on a priority basis.The advocate general and BMC's counsel Anil Sakhre told the bench that the authorities were ready to look into the grievance surrounding the pay scale of the junior level employees subject to the strike being called off.
