NPP launches unit in Assam

GUWAHATI: Meghalaya chief minister Conrad K Sangma on Wednesday said the Centre should allow a discussion on the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill by taking all stakeholders, including those opposing it, on board for finding a middle path."If there is a situation wherein we are asked to come for a discussion, we will consider a discussion on the bill from all angles. Our concern is not removing Clause A or Clause B of the bill. There are complicated issues in the bill and the northeast cannot be made a target of these complexities," Conrad said here after launching a unit of National People's Party (NPP) in the state.Founded by former Lok Sabha Speaker Purno A Sangma, NPP is part of the ruling Meghalaya Democratic Alliance (MDA).Conrad, whose NPP is part of the NDA, emerged as the most vocal opponent of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in the northeast that triggered protests across the region. While Asom Gana Parishad, BJP's ally in Assam , snapped ties with the saffron party in opposition to the bill, Conrad, along with Mizoram CM Zoramthanga, had threatened to walk out of the NDA if the bill was passed. However, the bill, which was by the Lok Sabha, was not tabled in the Rajya Sabha "I am not saying there is a middle way. As I am an optimistic person, I hope there is (a middle way). We can discuss it and if still we are not satisfied, we will not accept it," the Meghalaya CM said. He added that all stakeholders, including civil society groups and student bodies opposed to the bill, should be taken on board to discuss if there is a discussion on the bill.
