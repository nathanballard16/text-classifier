Lucknow, July 11

Bareilly SSP Muniraj has provided police protection to the daughter of Bareilly BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra after she complained against her father, brother and his friend for threatening to kill her for marrying Dalit youth Ajitesh Kumar on July 4.

A petition filed by her before the Allahabad High Court came up for hearing today. In her petition, Sakshi stated that she and her husband faced threat to life from her father and other family members. She claimed to be a major (above 18 years of age) and that she had married the man of her choice without any pressure. She also claimed that the Bareilly police were “apparently being pressurised” by her father.

A Single-Judge Bench of Chief Justice Govind Mathur listed hearing for July 15.

In a video on the social media, Sakshi claimed: “My father will kill me and my husband if he finds us. He cannot tolerate his daughter marrying a boy from a Dalit family. My father’s men are tracking us.”

In his statement, the BJP MLA denied the allegations, saying these were “false”. He said his daughter was an adult and well within her rights to make decisions. “I am busy with my party work and membership drive. I have not said a word to my daughter. These allegations are false.”

The MLA also said it was not Ajitesh’s caste but the fact that he was nine years older than his daughter that worried him. “He does not earn much. As a father, I am concerned about my daughter’s future. I want them to return home,” he told the media.
