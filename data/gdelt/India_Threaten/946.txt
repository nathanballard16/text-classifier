BJP MLA backs Sadhana Singh's 'transgender' remarks against Mayawati

Two days after a BJP MLA triggered outrage for saying BSP chief Mayawati was "worse than a transgender", a legislator from the saffron party expressed support for his colleague.

Surendra Singh, who represents Bariya constituency in the state legislature, said there was nothing wrong in the remarks of Sadhana Singh. Surendra, who has previously courted controversy for his incendiary remarks, told reporters in Ballia, “There is nothing wrong in what Sadhana Singh said... any person who has zero self-respect is called a transgender. The manner in which Mayawati has joined hands with the Samajwadi Party after the state guest house case of 1995 goes on to prove that she has no self-respect."

Surendra also dismissed the possibility of a police complaint being filed against Sadhana, warning, “we will protest against it.”

On Saturday, Sadhana had declared at a rally Mayawati was a “blot on womenkind” and “worse than a transgender” for having agreed to an alliance with the Samajwadi Party. Following a wave of criticism from across the political spectrum and threats of legal action, Sadhana expressed regret for her statement.

In November, Surendra declared “1992 could be repeated in Ayodhya”, warning of violence similar to the demolition of the Babri Masjid 26 years ago during the movement seeking construction of a Ram temple. In April 2018, Surendra claimed the 2019 Lok Sabha elections would be fought on the lines of 'Islam versus Bhagwan' and 'Pakistan versus India'. He had even defended BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, who was accused of raping a 17-year-old girl in Unnao.
