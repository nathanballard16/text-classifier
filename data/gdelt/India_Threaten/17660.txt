Uddhav likens police action on Jamia Campus to Jallianwala Bagh Massacre

Mumbai: Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday likened the police action against the Jamia Millia students in Delhi on Sunday to the ‘ Jalianwala Bagh massacre ’, accusing the BJP government of deliberately creating ‘chaos’ in the country.“There is a deliberate situation being created to create chaos and insecurity in the country. I am using my words very carefully --the manner in which the police entered the compound of (Jamia Millia Islamia) and shot at the students, it was almost like the days of Jalianwala Bagh.” said Thackeray in Nagpur on Tuesday. The Maharashtra CM further said, “Jalianwala Bagh-like situations are being created in the country. There is fear everywhere. In a country where the youth is disturbed, there won’t be stability.”He warned that the government was playing with fire, reminding that India will be the country with the largest population of youth by 2022. “They are our strength, the power of the country’s youth is like a bomb, and I request the government not to disturb them.”BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis slammed Thackeray for his comments, saying the Sena chief had ‘insulted’ the martyrs of the Indian freedom struggle by comparing them with the Jamia Millia students. Referring to the Sena’s stance espousing Hindutva, Fadnavis also tweeted a video clip where protestors were chanting slogans against Hindutva.
