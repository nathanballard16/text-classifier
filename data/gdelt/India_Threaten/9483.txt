Some 55 Flights Diverted From Mumbai to Nearby Airports Due to Heavy Rain - Reports (Video)

Heavy rain began battering India's financial capital Mumbai beginning early on Monday causing mass disruptions to the local commuter train network and delaying flights from the country's second-busiest airport.

According to the broadcaster NDTV, the main runway at Mumbai Airport remains closed on Tuesday after a SpiceJet flight overshot its mark while landing amid heavy rainfall at around 11:45 p.m. on Monday. A Boeing 737-800 is reportedly still stranded at the end of the runway. A secondary runway is operational but flights are likely to be delayed, according to NDTV.

"Spicejet SG 6237 Jaipur-Mumbai flight overshoots runway while landing at Mumbai Airport. All passengers are safe, no injuries reported", a spokesperson for the airline said in a statement, quoted by NDTV.
