MIM helped BJP-Shiv Sena win in Maharashtra polls: Congress

Hyderabad: Senior Congress leader and former minister Mohammed Ali Shabbir today said the Congress has made an impressive performance in the just concluded Assembly elections in Maharashtra and Haryana States. Similarly, the party has done well in the bye-elections for Assembly seats in 17 States, he added.

Addressing the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Friday, Shabbir Ali said the Congress has not only won more number of seats this time, but its vote share too has risen significantly compared to 2014 elections. He said the BJP has failed to woo voters in the name of scrapping Article 370 or other emotional issues. He said the voters preferred Congress and its ally Nationalist Congress Party. He also pointed out that Congress was able to win three out of six Assembly seats in the bye-elections in Gujarat showing that the party was making a comeback.

On the Huzurnagar Assembly by-election result, Ali said the TRS has won the seat by misusing official machinery and through distribution of cash and liquor. He said KCR showed interest only in elections and not in delivery of service to people. He ridiculed that the Chief Minister had no time to hold a review meeting on spread of viral diseases, especially Dengue, across Telangana. He did not respond even when several people, including a woman magistrate of Khammam died of Dengue.

He also condemned KCR’s remarks on RTC and said a well-established public transport system could not be finished citing financial losses as the reason. He congratulated AIMIM president Asaduddin Owaisi on his party winning two seats in Maharashtra and one seat in Bihar. He also congratulated Owaisi for helping BJP-Shiv Sena retain power in Maharashtra. Shabbir Ali said while BJP Governments were targeting minorities across the country, the MIM was helping BJP form governments.
