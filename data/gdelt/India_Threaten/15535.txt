Mumbai: Days after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) threatened President's rule in Maharashtra due to ongoing standoff with its warring ally Shiv Sena, the latter on Sunday claimed that it has more than enough support in the state Assembly to form the government in the state.

While speaking to media, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut claimed that his party has the support of more than 170 MLAs in Maharashtra and by a rough estimate, it could also reach 175.

The Shiv Sena has been vehemently demanding a 50-50 share of ministerial berths in Maharashtra cabinet with sharing of chief minister's post for 2.5 years each being the bone of contention.

Incumbent Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis is in no mood to bow down to the Shiv Sena's demands and the BJP has reiterated that he will be the Maharashtra CM once again for the whole five years.

With Sena's unyielding stance in the ongoing power tussle, BJP even threatened with President's rule in the state if an agreement is not reached between the two allies by November 8, when the term of current Assembly expires.

Meanwhile, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) has asserted that it will respect the people's mandate and is happy to sit in the Opposition. However, its ally Congress has hinted that it is open to holding discussions about a potential alliance with Shiv Sena.

Elsewhere, AIMIM chief Asaduddin Owaisi lambasted the Shiv Sena and the BJP over the rift for power. He asked, "What is this 50-50? Is this a new biscuit? How much 50-50 will you do? Save something for Maharashtra's public. They (BJP and Shiv Sena) are not bothered about the destruction rain has caused in Satara. All they talk about is 50-50. What kind of 'Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas' is this?"
