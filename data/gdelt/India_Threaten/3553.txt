Supreme Court Comes To The Rescue Of Aravali Green Patch In Delhi-NCR After Haryana Govt Allowed Construction

The Haryana government drew sharp criticism from the Supreme Court over its law to allow construction in Aravali, the only green lung of the Delhi-NCR region. The Aravali is also an ecologically fragile region and efforts have been made to revive and conserve the forest area.

Upset at Haryana Assembly’s effort to overturn the Supreme Court’s ban on construction, the apex court labelled it as sheer contempt.

On Wednesday, Haryana Assembly passed an ordinance to the Punjab Land Preservation Act, 1900, throwing open thousands of acres of land in Faridabad, Nuh, Mehendargarh and Rewari, under the Aravalis and Shivalik ranges for construction purposes and mining which is a potential threat to the ecologically sensitive region.

“Legislature is not supreme… At times, court also has to prevail,” said the Supreme Court. The bench said “we want to say a lot of things, but cannot”.

“We will not allow such kind of misadventure...You are not above the law,” said court.

The apex court said, “But no action should be taken under the amended Act … It is really shocking that you are destroying the forest … It is not permissible.”

The amendment was passed in the state assembly amid uproar from opposition INLD and Congress.

The opposition claimed that the BJP government in the state has passed the contentious bill allegedly to win support of real estate dealers ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.

Over the past few months, protests by residents of Gurugram, Faridabad and Delhi have intensified demanding shutting down construction and other commercial activities in the Aravali green belt. The area is a fragile ecological zone and biodiversity hotspot. It’s home to nearly 400 species of plants and some 200 species of native and migratory birds.
