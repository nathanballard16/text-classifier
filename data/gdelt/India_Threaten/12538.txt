Civic officials act as residents threaten protest

Ludhiana: The civic officials swung into action on Friday after the residents of Chander Nagar protested against contaminated water supply in the area. The officials disconnected the contaminated supply lines after the residents along with some Congress leaders met the civic officials.The residents of Chander Nagar had been raising the issue of water contamination since January. Initially the officials did respond and even rectified the problem, but residents claim the water contamination recurred once the city was lashed by rains. Residents claimed that about a fortnight back they had collected samples of the contaminated water flowing from the tap and wanted to show it to the authorities as the colour of the water had changed indicating contamination. The officials suggested that it was due to the construction of an illegal manhole over the water supply line which could have lead to contamination. Congress leader Sandhu claimed that people in the area even put banners against the area councillor.
