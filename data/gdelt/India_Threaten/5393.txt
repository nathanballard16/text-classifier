New Delhi: The Election Commission on Friday warned Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over his ‘Modi ji ki sena’ remarks. “Be careful in your utterances in future,” the poll panel told the BJP leader.

Adityanath had controversially described the Indian Army as ‘Modi ji ki sena’ at a rally in Ghaziabad on April 1 while campaigning for Union Minister of State for External Affairs, General (retired) VK Singh.

The Uttar Pradesh CM had said: "Congress ke log aatankwadiyon ko biryani khilate hain aur Modi ji ki sena aatankwadiyon ko goli aur gola deti hai (Congress people feed biryani to terrorists, while Modi's army gives them bullet or bomb)."

The remarks had led to a controversy, with Opposition leaders demanding action against the senior BJP leader. The Election Commission, on Wednesday, issued a notice to Adityanath and sought his response by Friday.

Commenting on the remarks, General VK Singh said India's armed forces do not belong to any political party and those who say so are 'traitors'.

Singh said in an interview to BBC that he was not sure of the context in which the UP CM had made the remarks.

"During campaigning for the BJP, everyone also describes themselves as army. But which army are we talking about here? Are we talking about the Indian Army or are we talking about political workers. I am not aware of the context. If someone says that India's Army is Modi ji's army, then he is not only wrong but also a traitor. India's armed forces belong to India, not to any political party.

"Don't know who is saying all this. There are one or two people who say things like these because they do not have anything else,” the Union minister said.
