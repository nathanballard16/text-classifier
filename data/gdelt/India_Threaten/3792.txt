GAC India sharpens focus on project logistics & breakbulk

GAC is tapping into growing project logistics and breakbulk business potential in India.

“The country’s burgeoning energy and infrastructure sectors have contributed to an increasing demand for project and oversized cargo handling, as well as breakbulk shipping,” says Managing Director Mark Delaney. “Its potential is further bolstered by the significant investments made by India in Africa and the Middle East in the recent decades. With project cargo demand estimated to rise at a 17% compound annual growth, project logistics is huge business.”

GAC has appointed industry veteran Jayakumar Gopalakrishnan to spearhead its efforts in the country’s growing sectors. He brings more than 33 years’ experience in project logistics and breakbulk, as well as in the manufacturing and pharmaceutical industries, to his new role as GAC Shipping (India) Pvt Ltd’s General Manager, Projects and Breakbulk, based in its Mumbai office.

Jayakumar says project logistics service providers welcome the port infrastructure modernisation and the development of integrated transport infrastructure network under the Sargarmala project.

“Since the launch of ‘Make in India’, we have seen a significant increase in the project logistics business with the movement of construction equipment and manufacturing materials, among other over-dimensional cargo,” adds Jayakumar. “End-to-end project cargo handling is a complex and challenging activity that requires careful planning, specialised equipment, special permits from different authorities and often, multiple modes of transport. Our strong projects team has the expertise and resources to offer a total logistics solution.”

GAC Shipping (India) Pvt Ltd is one of the country’s leading shipping and logistics services providers with 26 offices nationwide. It has handled various types of project and breakbulk cargo including tunnel boring machines, pipes and anchor chains.
