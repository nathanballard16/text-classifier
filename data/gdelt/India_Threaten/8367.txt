West Bengal: A post office bears the brunt of Mamata Banerjee-BJP war

KOLKATA: What many thought was critically endangered has suddenly reappeared, that too by the thousands.For the last few days, Kalighat post office in south Kolkata has been inundated with postcards addressed to chief minister Mamata Banerjee , who lives under its jurisdiction, carrying the same message — ‘Jai Shri Ram’.Postcards, often called “first class mail” by postal employees, are a priority for the department. “Usually, there are around 30-40 items of mail, including registered letters, addressed to the CM’s residence. But this has shot up almost many fold all of a sudden,” sources in the post office said. They added that these postcards now comprise 10% of the total mail handled by the post office daily.Since she assumed office, the Kalighat post office has had a postman dedicated for Banerjee’s residence. “He goes with the mail and hands it over to a designated person each day,” said an employee.The usually calm post office has now geared up for large consignments of ‘Jai Shri Ram’ postcards. Meanwhile, the airport office of Railway Mail Service, part of the department of post, on Thursday sorted and separated around 4,500 such postcards addressed to the CM.Trinamool Congress is not amused and is replying in kind. It has started sending mail with the message ‘Jai Hind, Jai Bangla’ — Banerjee’s latest battle cry — to PM Narendra Modi . “Our supporters, mainly from North 24 Parganas, Howrah and Hooghly, are sending around 8,000 such postcards daily,” said TMC leader and state food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick. “There is currently a shortage of postcards now, and we have decided to print letters and send them to the PM. We will not stop flooding the PMO with such letters.
