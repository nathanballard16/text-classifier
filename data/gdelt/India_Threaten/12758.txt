The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will fight the coming Haryana Assembly elections on the issues of rise of drug abuse among youths and increase in incidents of crime and unemployment.

Also it will list out unfulfilled promises of the Manohar Lal Khattar government.

“The anomalous trend of drug abuse is snowballing in Haryana and affecting youth in villages,” said Haryana AAP president Naveen Jaihind here on Wednesday.

“The most dangerous trend emerging is increase in the abuse of chemically manufactured drugs,” he added.

The AAP leader met his party’s central leaders during his visit here.

“The rise in unemployment and abuse of drugs and liquor has acted as a heady cocktail for idle youth who have become more crime-prone. The government has failed to address the issue, Jaihind added.

He alleged that the BJP’s electoral promise in the 2014 Assembly election of providing five lakh jobs — one lakh jobs per year — during the five years of its rule was not fulfilled.

Leave aside creating new jobs, there are about three lakh vacant posts in government departments, he alleged.

Party units in assembly constituencies have been asked to furnish specific issues concerning them. They will be included in the manifesto separately from pan-Haryana issues, he said.

AAP national convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal will be the star campaigner in Haryana election.

Jaihind said the in-charges for 12 assembly constituencies appointed yesterday by AAP will be candidates for the constituencies concerned.

Their names will be announced in public meetings in their constituencies, Jaihind said.

Names of candidates for the remaining constituencies will be announced in phases.
