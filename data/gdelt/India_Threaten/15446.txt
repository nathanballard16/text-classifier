Saifuddin: Palm oil exports not affected

PALM oil export are not affected as there has been no official decision by the Indian government on the trade boycott, says Datuk Saifuddin Abdullah.

Citing Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, the Foreign Minister said palm oil was “strictly a trade matter” during a recent meeting in Baku, Azerbaijan.
