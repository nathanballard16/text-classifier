AJK President reaffirms PM Khan's stance on Pulwama attack

He said that India in the interest of peace and stability in the region should act responsibly.

ISLAMABAD (APP) - President Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Sardar Masood Khan Tuesday endorsed the statement of Prime Minister Imran Khan regarding the Pulwama incident.

He said that India in the interest of peace and stability in the region should act responsibly and abstain from giving provocative statements.

“The hype and fanatic frenzy whipped up in India by the ruling party and extremist groups are a systematic incitement to hatred which is the violation of international law, national laws and human norms”, he said.

PM Imran Khan has vowed to retaliate against any Indian aggression without thinking after New Delhi accused Islamabad of involvement in the Pulwama attack.

“Pakistan will not think of retaliation, Pakistan will retaliate,” he pronounced.

Imran Khan addressed the nation in a video message and said India alleged Pakistan without any evidence. The premier told India to leave its “judge, jury and execution” approach. He said, “War is easy to start but difficult to end as it does not remain in human hands afterwards. It is not a sane approach to start a war.”

Imran Khan said New Delhi needs to rethink its policies regarding Kashmir because oppression against them will not improve the situation. He urged India to move towards dialogues.
