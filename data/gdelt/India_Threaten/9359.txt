Jagan’s bulldozer keeps rolling, now Babu’s house target

Officials pasting notice on the main gate of Naidu's bungalow.

AMARAVATI: Barely a day after bulldozing Praja Vedika , the convention centre adjacent to former Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu ’s house, the Jaganmohan government has said Naidu’s leased bungalow on the banks of the Krishna is too illegal and wants it demolished.The Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority ( CRDA ) on Friday issued a show-cause notice to the owner of Lingamaneni Estates , where Naidu’s bungalow is located, for violating building rules.The notice asked Lingamaneni Ramesh to remove illegal structures on the ground and first floor of the building within a week. The CRDA Act states no new construction can come up within 100 metres of the river without the authority’s permission.TDP termed the decision as a vindictive measure and said the estate had come up before the CRDA Act was enacted. With the Lingamaneni Estates owner contending that they have secured all permissions before 2012, CRDA concentrated on the new structures raised in the bungalow after Naidu moved in.Naidu’s TDP and Jaganmohan Reddy’s YSRCP had fought a long and better battle in the campaign ahead of the assembly election which YSRCP with a landslide.During the TDP regime, Jagan had raised the issue of illegal construction along the Krishna in the assembly on several occasions.A team of officials headed by CRDA assistant director Narendra Reddy visited Naidu’s bungalow early on Friday morning and tried to hand over the notice to a member of the family.With security personnel refusing to let them in, the officials pasted the notice on the wall of the bungalow’s main entrance.
