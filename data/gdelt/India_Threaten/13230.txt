Jammu: Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Saturday dubbed militants in Kashmir as "Pakistan-purchased boys" and warned them to put a full stop to their nefarious activities. He went on to say that if the militants do not mend their ways and stop harassing fruit growers in the Valley then there is much likelihood that they will be killed soon.

While addressing a gathering after laying the foundation for state cancer institute in Jammu, Satya Pal Malik said, "Some Pakistan-purchased boys are roaming around (in the Valley) and threatening to kill orchardists to stop them from selling their fruit to outside markets."

"I am telling them to mend their ways as I don't know whether the fruit dealers will die or not but there is a guarantee you will soon get killed," he added.

He also shifted focus to Pakistan and talked about the miserable living conditions of people there. "When I came to take charge of Jammu and Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi told me that make Jammu and Kashmir shine so much that people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) wish to cross the border, come here, and say 'this is our Kashmir'."

Satya Pal Malik also took a dig at Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for asking PoK people to wait for his signal to march towards the LoC and asserted that the PoK residents will soon want to become part of India.

"We know nobody is going to come here at his (Khan's) instance. But, if we are able to take Jammu and Kashmir to the path of development, which is very much possible, the day is not far when the PoK residents, facing worst situation under the occupation of Pakistan, will race towards us on their own to be part of India," said Malik.
