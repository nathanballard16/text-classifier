MANGALURU: Following Karnataka cabinet expansion on Tuesday, six-time MLA from Sullia reserved constituency, S Angara, was left disappointed with his non-inclusion, so were his supporters, who had gathered in Bengaluru in large numbers hoping that their MLA would get a ministerial berth.Expressing his disappointment, Angara said that he was always loyal to the party and the organisation and will not forego party principles and integrity. "Do loyalty, party principles and integrity have no value? My people wanted me to be a minister. They are disappointed, so am I. But I am loyal to the party and the organisation," he said.But his supporters took to Twitter and expressed their disappointment. Mahesh Puchchappady tweeted tagging @BJP4India, @BSYBJP, @DVSadanandGowda, @CTRavi_BJP, @nalinkateel, @nimmasuresh, @BjpMangaluru, @BJP4Karnataka: 26 years as an MLA and still not a minister. This is an insult to Sullia.Just coz DK voters don't do hue & cry, threats, all kinda dramas over ministerial berths,and be with the people, development for entire length & breadth, doesn't mean that party can ignore the region! #KarnatakaCabinetExpansion tweeted Prabath Kotegar. Replying to @Tejasvi_Surya @BSYBJP and 4 others, he again tweeted: Dakshina Kannada people give unconditional support to BJP, still no ministry...in Bangalore people don’t turn up to vote, but still gets 4. Why this ignorance towards Dakshina Kannada. Leaders like Srinivas Shetty, Sunil Kumar, Angara are ignored.Mahi Poojary Mulki wrote: Not a single MLA from DK worth having a ministerial post??? @CmofKarnataka @BSYBJP ? It's unfair..He again tweeted: Congratulations @KotasBJP. much deserving, uncorrupt, straight thinking politician of our time for getting ministerial post in Karnataka cabinet. It looks like you are the only one to represent undivided DK in the cabinet. Do justice to our region. All the best Sir.
