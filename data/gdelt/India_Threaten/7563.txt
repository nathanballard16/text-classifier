Will resign if those guilty of desecration of religious scriptures not punished: Navjot Sidhu

"I had earlier left Rajya Sabha seat (when he was in the BJP)," Sidhu told the gathering.

Though he did not clarify whether he would resign from the cabinet or the party. Addressing a poll rally in favour of Congress' Bathinda candidate Amrinder Singh Raja Warring, Sidhu lashed out at the Badal family for allegedly "ruining" Punjab during the previous SAD-BJP regime. On the last day of poll campaigning, Sidhu addressed several elections rallies in Bathinda, which is considered a stronghold of the Akali Dal.
