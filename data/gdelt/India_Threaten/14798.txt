Defence Bases In Punjab, Jammu On 'Orange Alert' After Fresh Intel Inputs Of Terror Attack

There have been reports of a possible terror attack on major defence facilities since August 5 when the Centre moved to abrogate Article 370 that granted a special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

A fresh intelligence input shared on Wednesday warned of a possible terror attack as a large group of terrorists from Pakistan has possibly infiltrated into the Indian territory in Punjab and adjoining regions. According to reports, defence bases in Punjab and Jammu area have been placed on high alert. "The defence bases in and around Punjab and Jammu are on high alert. The Indian Air Force has put its airbases in Punjab including Pathankot and Jammu on orange alert," government sources told news agency ANI. "The inputs were received by forces today morning after which they are taking all precautions to protect the defence bases," they said. A similar intel was given earlier was security agencies warning that the terrorists would try to launch an attack on the Indian security installations. Several defence bases in regions such as Pathankot, Jammu, Srinagar and others have been put on a high alert. An orange alert is just below the red alert. A few days ago, the bases were on high alert but the alert levels were brought down a couple of days later, sources said.
