New Delhi: Calling out Prime Minister Narendra Modi over what it termed "contradictory policy", Chinese mouthpiece 'Global Times' has alleged that New Delhi should not rely on "national sentiments" to deal with issues with China. This has come after the Indian Army and Air Force announced that they will carry out joint war games in Arunachal Pradesh along China border in October.

According to reports, the troops have already started moving in Arunachal with more than 5,000 highly specialised troops in mountain warfare along with over 50 transport aircraft and helicopters set to take part in the war drills.

Given this development, the mouthpiece alleged that Indian administration wants a cooperative relationship with China on one hand but PM Modi is inciting nationalism against China on the other. Pointing to the abrogation of Article 370 that provided special status to Jammu and Kashmir, it claimed that such moves are "a bid to cover up domestic troubles".

Underlining the growing trade between the two countries, Global Times said that such dual policy with China at a time when relations are entering a crucial phase will only hurt mutual trust and harm India's own interests.

The Chinese mouthpiece warned against aggressive stance in Arunachal claiming the worsening ties with China amid the economic downturn "will bring India nothing but adverse impacts".

"China has been putting efforts in enhancing cooperation with India. Given New Delhi's concerns over its trade deficit with Beijing, China is adjusting accordingly. For instance, China's revised drug law removes drugs that are legal in other countries but illegal in China from the list of fake medicines, opening a door for Indian generic medicines. Contradictory policies can solve neither domestic nor diplomatic problems," it said.
