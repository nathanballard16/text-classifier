Won't hesitate from taking action, Assam CM warns protesters over violence

GUWAHATI: A day after BJP’s Dibrugarh district president was assaulted by Citizenship (amendment) bill protesters at Dibrugarh, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal said that the state government would not restrain itself from taking actions against people involved in violent protests against the bill.Few days back, protesters had clashed with a pro-government group at Nalbari when health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was on his way for bhoomi pujan for construction of a medical college there.Speaking at Me-Dam-Me-Phi celebration, a religious ceremony of the Ahom community, at Dhakuakhana, Sonowal stressed on the need for abjuring violence and adopting peaceful co-existence as the strongest tool to take the state forward.“The state government is commitment to safeguard the interest of the indigenous people of the state and at the same time the government is not against any democratic and non-violent dissent. However, if somebody takes law into his hand, the government would be left with no option but to take appropriate action against such person,” he said.He said the All Assam Students Union needs to be careful to protect itself from being penetrated by evil elements from outside. “Certain evil forces are hell-bent in tarnishing the image of All Assam Students’ Union, which is as an organization that follows the tenets of non-violence. The AASU leadership needs remain to be alert to thwart any such ulterior designs,” the CM said.He reiterated that a misinformation campaign is being spread by certain vested interest groups regarding Citizenship (Amendment) Bill and said that the state government is working with commitment for preserving the identity, culture, heritage and rights of the indigenous people over their land.“The indigenous people of the state have got a golden opportunity to secure their future through implementation of clause VI of Assam Accord and urged the AASU leadership to play an important role in its fruitful execution,” he said.Speaking on the occasion, Sonowal underlined the contributions of the Ahom Kings for giving a distinct identity to the Assamese community in the world and asserted the state government’s commitment to follow their ideals in building a robust and resurgent Assam.“The Ahom Kings gave a strong foundation to the Assamese community following the ideals of harmony, co-existence and mental sturdiness. Their principles of governance remain the fountainhead of inspiration for the Assamese community to march ahead in the days to come”, he said.
