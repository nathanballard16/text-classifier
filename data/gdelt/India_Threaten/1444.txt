Repeat of interference to have consequences, India warns Pak

NEW DELHI, Jan 31: India on Thursday warned Pakistan that any repeat of interference into India's internal affairs would have consequences.

Spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs Raveesh Kumar termed the telephone call by Pak Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Querishi to former Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Umer Farooq as 'direct interference in India's affairs'. A repeat of this will have consequences, he said, adding that he was not at liberty to reveal what these consequences would be.

Last night, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had summoned Pak High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood over the same issue to lodge a formal protest.

Raveesh Kumar said on Thursday it is clear that Pakistan aid and abets the elements who are associated with anti-India activity. "One part of Pakistan that says let us have talks (with India) and the other face entices people who are anti-India. It is duplicitous of Pakistan and that too the Foreign Minister doing it. They lack the seriousness," he said.

In the meanwhile, the issue led to high profile diplomatic tussle in the form of summoning of both the High Commissioners in Delhi and in Islamabad.

Pakistan’s actions only exposes the two “faces” of the government there – “One talks about peace and good relations with India and the other face takes actions which are completely anti-India,” he said.

The strong words from the MEA spokesman comes after the High Commissioner of Pakistan to India Sohail Mahmood was summoned by Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale here on Wednesday late evening while India’s envoy Ajay Bisaria was summoned in Islamabad on Thursday.
