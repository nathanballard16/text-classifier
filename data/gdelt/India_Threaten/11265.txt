RAJKOT: Tired of the alleged harassment by his three seniors, a staffer of the Gujarat State Road Transport Corporation (GSRTC) attempted suicide by consuming pesticide at Jamnagar ST depot on Tuesday.

Police have booked three officials, M B Rawal, divisional director, Milan Rathod, assistant traffic superintendent and Hitesh Koteja, clerk, for the crime.

In his suicide note, Raghuvirsinh Parmar (57), who serves as the assistant traffic inspector (ATI) at the ST depot, has alleged that Rawal had transferred him to Dwarka division. However, when the transfer was revoked after the interference of the ST union, Rawal allegedly opened an old case against Parmar and demoted him to his present designation from earlier traffic inspector.

When Parmar pleaded his case with the ST union, Rawal allegedly threatened to demote him to the post of a driver. Then Rawal, Rathod and Koteja started harassing him, pressurising him to withdraw his application with the union.

“The accused also slapped him with a notice of departmental inquiry into an old case. Tired of this, Parmar attempted suicide. We have booked the accused trio for causing harassment and issuing threats," said an official from Jamnagar A division police station.
