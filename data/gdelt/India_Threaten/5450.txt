India preparing for another attack against Pakistan: Qureshi

The Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said that India is preparing for another attack against Pakistan, claiming that Islamabad has received credible information in this regard.

Speaking to reports in Islamabad, Qureshi said the credible information received by Islamabad shows that India is mulling to carry out the attack between 16th and 20th of April.

Qureshi further added that the information has been shared with Prime Minister Imran Khan, international community, and permanent members of the UN Security Council.

“After consultation with Prime Minister Imran Khan, we have decided to share this information with the people of Pakistan as well as the international community immediately. It is our policy to keep the nation informed,” he was quoted as saying by Geo News.

Qureshi further added “The international community must take notice of India’s irresponsible behaviour. The world must not stay silent, or peace and stability in South Asia could suffer.”

This comes as Indian fighter jets bombed Pakistan in mid-February in reaction to a deadly suicide attack in Pulwama of Indian-administered Kashmir.
