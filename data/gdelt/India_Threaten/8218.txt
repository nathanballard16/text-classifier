'10 Most Urgent' monthly list highlights journalists under threat or attack

SINGAPORE - After spending more than 500 days in Yangon's Insein prison, Reuters journalists Wa Lone, 33, and Kyaw Soe Oo, 29, were released on May 7.

Their crime? Attempting to see justice served for the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys in the village of Inn Din in Myanmar's Rakhine state.

While the two men managed to receive presidential pardons, there are still scores of journalists who are harshly disciplined for trying to report the truth.

To counter the rising threat to media freedom, the One Free Press Coalition was established during a meeting of the International Media Council at the World Economic Forum in March.

It comprises a group of pre-eminent editors and publishers who safeguard journalists under attack for pursuing the truth.

"Protecting the freedoms of the press and the fundamental rights of journalists worldwide is a top priority, and something the Coalition will never stop fighting for," said Mr Randall Lane, chief content officer for Forbes.

"Every day we're inspired to see the outpouring of support for this important global cause, and as we continue to grow, our collective voice will not go unheard," he added.

The Straits Times joined the Coalition in May.

Said Mr Warren Fernandez, editor-in-chief of The Straits Times and Singapore Press Holdings' English, Malay and Tamil Media Group: "In many parts of the world, the safety of journalists, editors and publishers is under serious threat from those who would silence them. The best answer to this is good journalism, letting their stories be told in our media so many others will understand the implications of these developments."

As part of its attempts to spotlight journalists under attack worldwide, the Coalition compiles a monthly list of "10 Most Urgent" cases.

The 10, ranked in order of urgency, are:
