Kashmir liberation imperative to resolve Pak-India conflict: Siraj

LALAMUSA: The conflict between Pakistan and India cannot be ended without the liberation of Indian-occupied Kashmir. This is just the Kashmir dispute and not the issue of trade and border, said Sirajul Haq, ameer Jamaat-e-Islami, while addressing a gathering here on Tuesday. “The determination and bright faces of Pakistani nation is the message of death for India. India has shown aggression against Pakistan. We will never allow anyone to cast an evil eye on Pakistan because Pakistan is our motherland,” he added. Our youth is powerful than nuclear power, he claimed. The JI ameer also addressed at Kotla, Barnala and several areas near the Line of Control. He also distributed food packages among the Indian shelling victims of the LoC.
