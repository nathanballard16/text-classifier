'World must take notice of Rajnath Singh's irresponsible statement'

"The Council's meeting has exposed Indian claims that Kashmir was an internal matter."

ISLAMABAD (Dunya News) – Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan on Saturday stated the United Nations Security Council’s (UNSC) meeting on Kashmir has proved that it is considered as a disputed territory at the international level.

In a series of tweets, she said the Council’s meeting has exposed Indian claims that Kashmir was an internal matter of India.

Firdous said the voice of the Kashmiris, which had been suppressed by India, resonated at the world’s highest diplomatic forum.

“Prime Minister Imran Khan has emerged as the true spokesperson of Kashmiris.” She said: “The statement of Rajnath Singh is a threat to the [peace] of the entire world."

She said the international community would have to take notice of the irresponsible statement, which was an open challenge to the international law and the peace and stability of the world.

“Indian defence minister’s statement reflects the extremist ideology of RSS that can go to the extent of putting the world peace at stake to accomplish its nefarious designs,” Awan said while referring to India’s defence minister Rajnath Singh’s statement that India could reconsider "no first use" nuclear policy for change.
