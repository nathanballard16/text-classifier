Meanwhile, several experts and activists have approached the state government to warn that Bengaluru might be the next Chennai in terms of facing a water crisis. The experts, led by freedom fighter HS Doreswamy, have advised the government to make use of the rains the city receives in abundance to ensure water supply in the city is not hit, rather than going for plans of drawing water from Linganamakki Reservoir and the Yettinahole water project.
