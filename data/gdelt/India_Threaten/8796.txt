Doctors’ strike mishandled, says former MP Aziz Pasha

CPI leader says it has given BJP chance to reap political dividends

National Executive Committee member of the Communist Party of India and former MP, S. Aziz Pasha, on Saturday said the mishandling of doctors’ strike by Mamata Banerjee gave the BJP a perfect opportunity to exploit the issue for political dividends.

Mr. Pasha said in a press conference that the poor handling of the issue by Ms. Banerjee would benefit the BJP, which was looking to cash in on any deterioration in law and order, and potentially even precipitate the dismissal of the Government.

Not just West Bengal, the survival of the democratically elected Governments in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Karnataka was under threat from the machinations of the BJP, he said.

The CPI leader, in a recent review of the Left’s debacle in the Lok Sabha elections where the party only won five seats in a historic low, said the Balakot counter-strike tipped the scales in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

“If you take the situation a few months prior the elections, the country was in the doldrums and there was widespread discontent over the impacts of demonetisation, GST and record unemployment levels. All this indicated that Mr. Modi’s and the BJP’s stock was down among the voters, but the Balakot incident dramatically reversed all that, especially in the Northern and Western belts,” he said.

Reunification needed

After taking stock of the situation, the CPI had come to the conclusion that a reunification of the Communist movement was needed to effectively counter the threat to the country’s secular and pluralist legacy from communal forces.

CPI State secretary A.M. Salim said that the party State Council met for a general review of the political situation at the U.T. and the Centre and the recent Parliamentary and by-election in Puducherry.
