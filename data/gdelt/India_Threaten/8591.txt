10 Congress MLAs in Goa want to break away, join BJP: Vinay Tendulkar

PANAJI: Goa BJP president and Rajya Sabha MP Vinay Tendulkar on Wednesday fueled the ongoing speculation about some Congress MLAs jumping over to the BJP when he claimed that 10 Congress MLAs had approached the BJP a fortnight ago to join the saffron party en masse.Tendulkar said that the move was rejected by the BJP's national leadership since the BJP-led coalition government in Goa is stable."The government is stable, we don't need to break any party," said Tendulkar while addressing a press conference. "It has happened that some 15 days back, 10 Congress MLAs came to us to join the BJP by leaving the Congress but our central leadership and even the Goa leadership rejected the offer."Tendulkar made similar claims earlier too, especially after the Lok Sabha election results and state bypoll results. On June 8, Tendulkar claimed that four Congress legislators were in touch with the BJP. On May 23, Tendulkar had said that a couple of Congress MLAs had shown interest in joining the BJP.When questioned about his earlier statement, Tendulkar said that such statements "have to be said in electoral politics."State Congress president Girish Chodankar recently accused the BJP of trying to lure its lawmakers to switch sides by offering crores of rupees and posts. Three Congress MLAs - Vishwajit Rane, Dayanand Sopte and Subhash Shirodkar - had in the past quit the Congress and resigned from their assembly constituencies to join the BJP."If as Girish Chodankar says that he has a recording then he should release it. Let us see whose voice is there, what is being said in the recording," said Tendulkar as he challenged the Congress to prove its allegations.
