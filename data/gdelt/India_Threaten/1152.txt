Odisha's KALIA Scheme Aims To Benefit Agri Eco-System

It is not often that top economists take notice of a scheme launched in Odisha. Therefore, the fact that Krushak Assistance for Livelihood and Income Augmentation (KALIA) won universal approbation from people who make or influence policies is noteworthy. Pol­icy-makers and agricultural experts like Finance Commission chairman N.K. Singh, Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices chairman ­Vijay Pal Sharma and leading agro-­economist Ashok Gulati have hailed the scheme launched by the Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha on Dec­ember 31, 2018 as a more effective way of add­ressing farm distress than the populist loan-waiver option.

The “best conceived scheme for the dis­tressed agriculture sector”, said Singh, while Gulati suggested that “KALIA can be the lighthouse to guide the nation on the kind of agriculture policy we need in future for India’s farmers”.
