BJP leaders to discuss city limit expansion today

Surat: City BJP leaders will discuss with state party leaders the issue of expansion of Surat municipal limits in a meeting to be held here on Saturday. BJP in-charge of Surat Bharatsinh Parmar and Gujarat minister Ganpat Vasava will be present in the meeting to be attended by two MPs, 12 MLAs , party leaders in the municipal corporation and city and district BJP office-bearers.There is a proposal to bring 22 villages of Olpad and Choryasi talukas along with two nagarpalikas of Sachin and Kanakpur Kansad within Surat city limits. “There was no consensus among leaders on this in the last meeting. The two MPs could not attend it because they were busy attending winter session of Parliament. The MPs are likely to present their views on the proposal to expand the city limits at the meeting,” a BJP leader said.Expansion of Surat city limits will take its area to 500 sq km from 326 sq km. Some leaders are against expansion because it will bring down their clout in Surat district.
