If protests turn intense, then screening could be called off.Two major bank unions — All-India Bank Employees’ Association and Bank Employees’ Federation of India — have informed the Indian Banks’ Association that their members will take part in the strike. “We expect 25 crore workers to join the strike, largely from the unorganised sector, and 6 lakh from banks,” said Vishwas Tyagi, association secretary, bank employees’ association.IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda, Allahabad Bank and Karur Vysya Bank, among others, have informed BSE banking services are likely to be hit.
