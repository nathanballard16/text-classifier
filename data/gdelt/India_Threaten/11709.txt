Pakistani PM Imran Khan Reiterates Support to Kashmiris on Indian Side

Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan (right) listens to the national anthem as he arrives at the legislative assembly in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir on Aug. 14 to mark the country's Independence Day. His visit to mark the country's Independence Day comes more than a week after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a surprise executive decree to strip its portion of the Muslim-majority Himalayan region of its special status.
