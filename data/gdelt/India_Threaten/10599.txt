Man Calling For Job Asks 'Bombay Airport Hai?' Control Room Hears ‘Bomb Hai Airport Pe’

A 20-year-old Maharashtra man’s job enquiry at Mumbai airport apparently turned into bomb scare, forcing the authorities to form a bomb threat assessment committee.

The poor guy had called up Mumbai airport’s control room to enquire about job openings and referred to Mumbai as ‘Bombay’ and set off a bomb scare. The authorities ended up increasing security at the airport.

The caller, a hotel management graduate, was looking for a job and found the airport’s number on Google. He then called the number to find out about any job openings.

The call ended up in the control room where the person who received the call heard the caller’s query, “Bombay Airport hai?” (Is this Bombay airport?) as “Bomb hai Airport pe” (There is a bomb at the airport).

The receiver immediately confronted the caller who then clarified and even apologised for the miscommunication, but the staff at the control room still alerted the security personnel, because they did not want to take any risks. The incident took place on July 19.

“The call was received at the control room of Mumbai International Airport Limited (MIAL) and the caller first enquired about vacancies at Mumbai airport. When he was told that the section deals with operational matters, he uttered something which the person who received the calls heard as the presence of a bomb at the airport,” a Mumbai airport official told Hindustan Times.

After checking for two hours, the call was termed as non-specific and the caller was let off with a warning.

“Taking no chance, the staff informed the security personnel and a bomb threat assessment committee was formed. After analyzing all the details, it declared the call as non-specific, which means there was no threat. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) was however alerted and security (at the airport) was increased,” the official added.
