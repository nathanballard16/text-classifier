However, such an exercise can become less than therapeutic when promotional sales spiels offering deep discounts turn shopping malls into free-for-all mauls. As a counterbalance to such concerns, a revival of consumer demand is widely seen to be necessary to prevent a recessionary `Eek!’ returning to a global economy already beset by turbulent headwinds. In such a scenario, to avoid a future tense, we should make the most of a festive present perfect, suitably gift-rapt.
