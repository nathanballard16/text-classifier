It's not that easy to end Article 370: Mehbooba Mufti

Hardening her stand, Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) president, Mehbooba Mufti on Saturday cautioned centre against fiddling with Article 370 saying revoking it means the end of Jammu and Kashmir's relation with the Union of India.

"Article 370 is a bridge and the Constitution of India applies to through it. And when you break that bridge, then how come this Mehbooba Mufti, who swears by the constitutions of J&K and India, will take an oath", said Mehbooba while addressing a function here on Saturday.

Former chief minister noted that in case special status is revoked or scrapped, the relation between Jammu and Kashmir and union of India has to be renegotiated and redefined. "Then you will have to redefine the relations between India and Kashmir. And then there would be new conditions for forging this relation. Then there would be new negotiations with a Muslim majority state of J&K like it was done in 1947. Are you ready for that?" she asked.

Mehbooba also noted that there would be a question that whether Kashmiris would like to join back or not because they will have to probably rethinks that relation (with India).

"If you have given us a certain position within the framework of the Indian Constitution, which you want to end today, then really we will have to rethink those conditions. We will have to rethink whether we want to remain with you without those conditions. Arun Jaitley sahab will have to think that it is not that easy to end the Article 370. If you do away with 370, then your relations with the J&K will end", she said

On the other side, National Conference president Farooq Abdullah called for a second revolution to put up a joint effort to trounce the forces who are bent to destroy the integrity and unique Constitutional character of the state.
