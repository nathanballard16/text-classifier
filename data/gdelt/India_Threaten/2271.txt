CRPF issues advisory against fake photos

New Delhi: The CRPF on Sunday cautioned people against “fake pictures” being circulated online of body parts of its 40 jawans killed in the Pulwama attack. “It has been noticed that on social media some miscreants are trying to circulate fake pictures of body parts of our martyrs to invoke hatred while we stand united.

“Please DO NOT circulate/share/like such photographs or posts,” the CRPF said on its official Twitter handle @crpfindia. It also asked people to report any such content by sending an email to [email protected]

Officials said a number of such photographs of badly mutilated bodies were being circulated and the development was brought to the notice of force officials after which the advisory was issued.

The paramilitary force, that has deployed about 65,000 personnel as part of 61 battalions in Jammu and Kashmir, issued another advisory on bogus messages being circulated on social media vis-a-vis Kashmiri students based in various places in the country.

“Fake news about harassment of students from Kashmir is being propagated by various miscreants on social media. CRPF helpline has enquired about complaints about harassment and found them incorrect. “These are attempts to invoke hatred. Please DO NOT circulate such posts,” CRPF in another tweet.
