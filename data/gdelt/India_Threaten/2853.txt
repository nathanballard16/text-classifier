Government warns two-wheeler manufacturers, logistics firms against use of 'three-deck' trailers

NEW DELHI: The transport ministry has warned two-wheeler manufacturers that they would be held responsible along with logistics companies if vehicle carriers engaged by them are found flouting norms. There have been instances of vehicle carriers or trailers having three decks and even putting structures over the driver's cabin to carry more number of two-wheelers.The ministry said such over-dimensional vehicles pose a risk to all other road users since such structures make the vehicle unstable making them prone to accidents and directed an immediate stop to plying of such vehicles. As per norms, such vehicles can have only two decks to carry two-wheelers.Representatives from the two wheeler carrier's logistics companies had approached the transport ministry claiming that some of the two-wheeler manufacturers were forcing them to violate the rule and to use such over dimensional vehicles with three decks. They had sought ministry's clarification on the issue.According to the minutes of the meeting chaired by the joint secretary, Priyank Bharti , on February 18, representative from Hero Motors said the truck trailers fabricated with "triple deck" would enable them to carry more number of two wheelers, within the limits of the axle load and this will help in saving time, environment and lesser congestion. Even the automobile lobby group, SIAM, had submitted that there was a need to find innovative solutions to help in improving the logistic efficiency while complying with the motor vehicle rules and regulations.The representatives of two vehicle testing and certifying agencies said no logistics company had obtained any type of approval for the trucks/ trailers with load body over the driver's cabin or triple decks."In the light of above, the chairman concluded that the compliance to rules with the safety of the driver and road safety in general are of prime importance and these are non-negotiable. OEMs are requested that they should ensure that the vehicles meant for carrying the two wheelers should conform to the rules. In case of violations, they are equally responsible. They should have the systems in place to ensure compliance whenever they are loading the two wheelers... This practice of loading the vehicles or part thereof over such structures over the driver cabins must stop immediately," the minutes said.
