Naidu warns Modi-KCR-Jagan trio of dire consequences

Hyderabad: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister and ruling TDP national president N. Chandrababu Naidu today came down heavily against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, his Telangana counterpart K. Chandrashekhar Rao and YSRCP Chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy and warned them not to target him. He also warned the three leaders that he would not keep silent if they targeted him continuously.

Referring to the statements of Prime Minister Modi, Telangana CM KCR and YSRCP chief Jaganmohan Reddy that they would ensure defeat of the TDP in the State, Chandrababu warned them saying “Don’t play hide and seek games. If you have guts, come straight and fight with us. We will show what we are. We will give respect to all those who respect us”. He alleged that the YSRCP leader made a minor attack against YS Jagan into a big political controversy.

He alleged that the YSRCP leaders have hatched plans to remove some eight lakh voters of the State from voters list while they were alive. Referring to the political campaign manager of YSRCP Prashant Kishore, Naidu said who was he to remove the votes and warned Kishore that his plans would not work in the State. “This is not Bihar to do whatever you want. We will fight against all those, who are resorting to cyber crime. We will drag them to courts,” Naidu warned. He told the people that they would not even get water if they voted for YS Jagan in the upcoming Assembly elections. He said Modi, KCR and Jagan trio would do nothing to the AP while he was developing the State without giving priority to any caste or creed.
