The way to tackle Pakistan: Modi govt implementing Doval's 2014 strategy

We are witnessing a different India for the past few years. India’s foreign policy under the rule of the Modi government has changed massively. The abrogation of Article 370 and bifurcation of Jammu Kashmir has gained massive recognition in both houses of the Parliament.

Indian Army's message to Pakistan through surgical strikes and airstrike at Balakot was plain and simple: If you mess with us, we will hit you back.

The strike is being seen as a major shift in India's policy of restraint with Pakistan. This essentially means the country can strike back at will, including pre-emptive ones, to counter cross-border terror.

This aggressive approach is the brainchild of none other than national security adviser Ajit Doval.

Doval's "offensive defence" strategy paid off as Pakistan soon found itself waiving truce flags after Indian firing caused massive damage on its side.

Ever since Doval took the job, he has supported a nationalist agenda while adopting a tougher line against hostile neighbours. India's policy shift in the last two years has boosted the morale of the security forces while Islamabad has got a clear message that "it will bleed more" if it continues its proxy war against India. A video of Doval speaking about ‘offensive defence’ in Sasthri Bhavan in New Delhi in 2014 has once again become a topic of discussion.

Narendra Modi picked Doval as his National Security Advisor in 2014. He was an ex-Intelligence Bureau officer where he spent three decades, including stints in the restive regions of the northeast, Jammu and Kashmir, and the UK.

The Union government doesn’t give much consideration to Pakistan’s nuclear threat. The statement of Union Defense Minister should be read along these lines. Pakistan should fear India from now on, this India will strike back.
