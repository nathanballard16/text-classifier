Varanasi: A day after Congress fielded Ajay Rai opposite PM Narendra Modi in Varanasi ending feverish speculation about AICC General Secretary (UP East) Priyanka Gandhi’s candidature from the seat, Congress sources told Times Now that she might still be in the fray.

Given that Congress president Rahul Gandhi forgoes one of the seats if he wins from both the pocket boroughs of Wayanad or Amethi, his sister might contest in the subsequent by-polls in the vacated seat. The final decision, however, rests with Rahul Gandhi.

The BJP attacked Priyanka Gandhi for “chickening out” after asking at her rallies in Uttar Pradesh asked if she should challenge PM Modi from his constituency - Varanasi. Congress, however, understands the gravity of the situation in fielding one of its top leaders from one of the tough seats in the country.

Congress said the decision was Priyanka’s alone and that she has other responsibilities. “It (not contesting from Varanasi) was Priyanka ji's decision, she has other responsibilities. She thought rather than concentrating on one seat she should focus on the job she has at hand. So, that decision was her and she decided it,” Congress Overseas chief Sam Pitroda said in a press conference Friday.

Polling will be held in Varanasi in the last phase of the seven-phase general election on May 19.

Ajay Rai contested against Modi in the 2014 general elections as well but finished third, behind Modi and Aam Aadmi Party convener and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal.
