Lt Gen under scrutiny over funds 'misuse'

NEW DELHI: A lieutenant general is in the dock for allegedly misusing government funds worth Rs 10 lakh to buy air conditioners and furniture for his personal use after the Army conducted a court of inquiry (CoI) into the case.Sources on Saturday indicated the CoI has found a prima facie case against the Lt-General from a non-combat arm (name being withheld since charges are yet to be conclusively proven), which could lead to disciplinary action in the shape of a summary of evidence and court martial. But the Army, on being contacted by TOI, officially refused to say anything on the matter.Sources said the initial findings of the CoI, which was chaired by a senior Lt-General, one of the principal staff officers at the Army headquarters, have been communicated to General Bipin Rawat to decide the next course of action."The high-level CoI was ordered into the case after complaints were received that the accused had misused government funds meant for institutions under him for buying air conditioners and furniture for his personal use in an unauthorised manner," said a source.The Army chief had warned that all those indulging in "corrupt practices" will be "weeded out" irrespective of their rank and stature. "Rising cases of moral turpitude are a matter of concern. Strict punishment, including dismissal without pension, is already being given to the offenders," he said.
