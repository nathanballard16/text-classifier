Kashmir turmoil: India revokes special status of disputed region

India's government said Monday it is revoking the part of the constitution that gives Indian-administered Kashmir special privileges, the BBC reports.

Why it matters: Tensions are running high in the highly militarized border region that is claimed by both India and Pakistan after the Indian government announced on Sunday night that it was imposing a lockdown, citing possible terrorist attacks by Pakistan-based militants, per Al Jazeera. The revoking of the special status would likely provoke backlash and violence in the Muslim-majority state.

The big picture: Kashmir has been the cause of 2 of the 3 wars fought between the 2 countries. Amid fears of possible attacks, which Pakistan has denied, there are reports that regional leaders have been placed under house arrest and that mobile internet services have been partially suspended.

India's president has signed a decree abolishing the special status, Article 370 of the constitution, which gave autonomy to the Himalayan region, Al Jazeera reports.

The local government on Friday called off a major Hindu pilgrimage and evacuated thousands of pilgrims and tourists.

The Indian government deployed 10,000 troops to the region last week after evacuating the region of tourists.
