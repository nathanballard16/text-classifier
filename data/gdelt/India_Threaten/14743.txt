SC orders security for wakf board chief

New Delhi, October 14

The Supreme Court today ordered the UP Government to provide security “forthwith” to the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Wakf Board Chairperson Zafar Ahmed Farooqui after he expressed apprehension about threat to his life.

The direction was issued just before the five-judge Constitution Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi rose after the 38th day of hearing.

Farooqui had recently sought resumption of mediation to solve the vexed Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid dispute at Ayodhya. The Bench, which also comprised Justices SA Bobde, DY Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and SA Nazeer, passed the order on the basis of a communication sent to it by senior advocate Sriram Panchu, a member of the mediation committee. Farooqui had informed the mediation panel member about the threat to his life.

Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, representing Muslim parties, alleged Farooqui might be facing threat from the state government itself, but the Bench chose to ignore his comments.

During the day, Dhavan alleged that questions were asked only from them and not from the Hindu side. “Your Lordship didn’t ask question to the other side. All questions have been asked to us only. Of course, we are answering them,” he told the Bench.

As Dhavan made submissions, senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan, representing “Ram Lalla” said, “This is totally unwarranted.”

Dhavan is likely to conclude his arguments in the pre-lunch session on Tuesday. The Hindu side will make its final submissions in the post-lunch session tomorrow. — TNS
