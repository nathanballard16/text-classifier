Earlier in the day, 26 MPs from Tamil Nadu had a meeting with the General Manager of Southern Railway in connection with projects in the Chennai and Salem divisions.

“We have insisted that the competitive exams in the Railways should be held in all regional languages, besides English. We have also been insisting that people from Tamil Nadu should get preference for Railway jobs in the State,” DMK Member of Parliament Tamizhachi Thangapandian told mediapersons after the meeting.
