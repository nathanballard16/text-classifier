At least one quarter of the fiscal deficit was not paid,” Naidu alleged.Referring to pre-poll surveys, Naidu alleged that the YSRC was behind such “wrong” surveys.

There is threat to national security due to the inefficiency of BJP rulers.Naidu found fault with the BJP for aligning with small parties ahead of general elections. The Act provided several promises to help the residual state of Andhra Pradesh, but most of the promises remain unfulfilled, said Naidu.Addressing Telugu Desam Party (TDP) leaders through a teleconference, Naidu said the Centre has done injustice to the state.
