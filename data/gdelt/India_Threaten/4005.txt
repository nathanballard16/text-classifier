Vijay Mallya: Enforcement Directorate to oppose private parties' claims to access Vijay Mallya assets

New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) will oppose any claims of first right of access to the assets of fugitive businessman Vijay Mallya by any private entity, said people with knowledge of the matter. It will only make an exception for state-run lenders.ET had reported on March 8 that British spirits maker Diageo , the majority owner of United Spirits, is seeking first right of access to Mallya's assets. Similar claims have been made by other borrowers in their responses to the application filed by State Bank of India (SBI) in January. The agency is likely to convey its stand to a local court in Mumbai on March 13, said the people."It needs to be appreciated that it is the consortium of public banks (led by State Bank of India) which is the complainant in the case registered against Mallya under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA)," said one of them. "How can a private entity which is not even a complainant in the instant case claim first access to the assets seized by the agency?"Money that goes to the state-run banks can be recovered later, this person said."Public banks have the backing of the state and carry with themselves a sovereign guarantee," he said. "If Mallya succeeds in future in the trial, the agency (ED) can recover the proceeds of sale of Mallya's assets from public banks using the sovereign guarantee. But the same (sovereign guarantee) is not applicable in the case of private entities.""Thus, any recovery would entail cumbersome legal procedure(s)," the person added.The agency also reckons that private entities can make their claims before the Karnataka High Court where Mallya has made a "comprehensive settlement" offer, sources further told ET."Since public money is involved, it is in public interest that the proceeds of the sale of Mallya's assets are realised by public banks," said the official cited above.Mallya, declared a fugitive economic offender in India, is fighting extradition proceedings in the UK. Banks say Mallya owes them in excess of Rs 9,000 crore after loan defaults by his. Mallya says he has offered to settle with the banks and that he wouldn't get a fair trial in India, where he's wanted for questioning over allegations of money laundering and loan fraud.ET was the first to report on January 16 that a 12-bank consortium led by State Bank of India had moved a Mumbai court seeking the release of Mallya's assets that the ED had attached so that these could be sold "immediately" to realise the best value.The banks, in a joint application, had urged the court that Mallya's assets be restored to them so that they can "appropriate the proceeds" without delay. The banks had contended that the attached assets were "amenable to market fluctuations and any delay in liquidating those assets may reduce their value."They also said that the "rights of the banks, which are second creditors to recover their dues, would take precedence over the state's right to attach the assets of Mallya being declared a proclaimed offender".ED had on February 5 approved liquidation of Mallya's assets by a consortium of banks. However, the agency had said that if the court allows the banks' application, the consortium should be directed to submit an "undertaking" to return the money "without any delay" if Mallya succeeds in trial in the future."In any case, the court has to be satisfied that banks have acted in good faith and has suffered the loss despite taking all reasonable precautions as is required under the PMLA," the agency had told the court.
