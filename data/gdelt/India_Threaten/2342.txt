Bengal police warns against efforts to stir up trouble after Pulwama attack

Kolkata, Feb 18 : The West Bengal Police on Monday warned of strong action against "planned efforts" to create law and order problems in the state by some groups by taking out sudden processions in areas with mixed population and spreading fake message and rumours through social media.

"In our state, after the Pulwama terror strike (in Jammu and Kashmir), planned efforts are being made to create law and order problems. There have been specific incidents in Sreerampur of Hooghly district, North 24 Parganas district's Bangaon and Habra two days back," Additional Director General of Police Anuj Sharma told media persons at the state secretariat.

He said some groups were taking out flash processions and entering areas which had a mixed population of various communities and trying to foment unrest.

Sharma appealed to the people not to heed rumours or get involved in any disturbances, but inform the police if they have any information about trouble.

"We have instructed the officers-in-charge, Superintendents and Commissioners of Police to strengthen policing. We will take very strong action. We are identifying all mischief mongers.

"Some attempts are also being made through the social media by spreading fake news to trigger violence. We have already started strong specific cases. We will take strong action against all such people," he said.

Sharma said in parts of South Parganas district, rumours were being spread about child lifters roaming in the areas. "We are apprising locals through loudspeaker announcements that these are mere rumours," he added.
