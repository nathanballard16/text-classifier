Jewish institutions and tourists warned of terror attack in India

Intelligence agencies in India have warned Israel that Jewish institutions and Jewish tourists are under threat of terror attacks in the country.

Terrorist organisations in India associated with the global jihad movement plan to attack Jewish and Israeli targets, including synagogues in Kerala, in the country’s south, and Chabad houses and other places where large numbers of Jews congregate, Israel’s Channel 12 first reported on Monday.

Indian security organisations will increase security around Jewish institutions and places where large numbers of Jewish and Israeli travellers congregate, according to the report.

A similar security alert for Jewish and Israeli institutions and tourists in the Indian capital of New Delhi was issued in early October ahead of Yom Kippur.

The Mumbai Chabad House was among several sites attacked in the city over four days in November 2008 by a Pakistani Islamist group that left 166 dead. The victims included Chabad house directors Rabbi Gavriel and Rivkah Holtzberg and four other Jewish visitors to the building.
