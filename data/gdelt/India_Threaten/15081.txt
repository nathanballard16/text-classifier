Pakistan minister warns of nuclear war in a bid to stifle local opposition

ISLAMABAD: Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed, Pakistan's railways minister, warned political rivals not to oppose the government as, in his opinion, there is a real threat of war with India at this juncture, which he said would inevitable culminate into a nuclear war The trigger for Ahmed's latest N-salvo was a call by Maulana Fazlur Rehman for a march on Islamabad in a bid to pile pressure on Prime Minister Imran Khan to resign. Ahmed called upon the Maulana, a staunch political rival of Imran Khan and his government, to call off his plans and realize the gravity of the situation along the LoC "We should not take the situation lightly by comparing it with the PTI's 2014 sit-in, as no one can predict the next move by India's war-mongering leader (referring to PM Narendra Modi )," the minister reportedly said, adding, "God forbid, a nuclear war could break out if India continues its aggressive designs.""The armies of both countries are standing eyeball to eyeball along the LoC. A neo-Nazi leader in India is threatening to block the flow of water to Pakistan and make this country into a barren land," Ahmed said. "I have some expectations from the opposition parties in these hard times. The Maulana should call off his march on Islamabad," the minister said.Ahmed has spoken far more than the country's defence, home, and foreign ministers put together on issues of national security, defence, and foreign policy since India nullified the special status of Jammu & Kashmir on August 5.But, rarely has he been heard speaking about the scores of casualties in the mounting train accidents in Pakistan.
