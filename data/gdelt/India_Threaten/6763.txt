Pak army will respond to any Indian aggression with full force: Asif Ghafoor

Director General Inter Services Public Relations Major General Asif Ghafoor has said Pakistan Army, will respond to any Indian aggression with full force.

He said nuclear power is a weapon of deterrence; however, if aggression is carried out, Pakistan has the right to use any weapon in its defence.

According to Radio Pakistan, the DG ISPR said instead of reacting to ‘Indian lies’ after Pulwama incident, Pakistan behaved responsibly and presented facts, proving false Indian claims about the Indian airstrike in Balakot on February 26 and the subsequent developments.

He said Pakistan shot down two Indian aircraft on February 27, responding to Indian air strike.

He said India should keep it in view while planning any aggression against Pakistan. Major General Asif Ghafoor stressed on resolution of outstanding issues between Pakistan and India, including Kashmir and invited New Dehli to dialogue.

He said only peace can guarantee development in the region.

He said Kashmir issue is linked with the ideology of Pakistan and every Pakistani is perturbed over Indian ‘atrocities’ in occupied Kashmir.

The DG ISPR said it is moral responsibility of Pakistan to continue supporting Kashmiris’ struggle to achieve their birth right to self-determination.
