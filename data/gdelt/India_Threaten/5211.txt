Congress manifesto has elements that will endanger the integrity of India: Arun Jaitley

Rejecting Congress manifesto, finance minister Arun Jaitley said that Rahul Gandhi 's ideas are dangerous for the overall welfare of the country.Jaitley came down heavily on Congress' promise of reviewing the Armed Forces Special Powers Act, stating that manifesto has the potential to destroy the very integrity of India.Jaitley further added that Congress' promise to reduce the presence of the army and CAPFs in the Kashmir Valley will prove counterproductive and in the long run threaten the security of India.The Congress manifesto, which was released earlier today by party president Rahul Gandhi, added that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act and the Disturbed Areas Act in Jammu and Kashmir will be reviewed. On AFSPA, Congress added that it will make suitable changes in the text of the laws to balance requirements of security and the protection of human rights.Even though there was a drafting committee, but it appears that some of the important points have been drafted by the Congress President's friends in 'Tukde Tukde gang' when it deals with Jammu & Kashir, said Jaitley.
