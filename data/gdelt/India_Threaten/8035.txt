Heat wave strikes the national capital Delhi, caution extended

Weather News and Analysis

Skymet Weather Team

After much anticipation, heat wave has finally arrived over Delhi NCR. Just yesterday, Palam touched the 45-degree mark for the second time this year. Earlier Palam recorded 45.3°C on April 30 which was the all-time record for the month of April. Moreover, this is one of the longest spells of dry and hot weather in Delhi, with the maximum temperature expected to cross the 46-degrees Celsius mark.

Now, we expect temperatures to rise further in the next two to three days, due to the continuous flow of hot and dry winds from Rajasthan and adjoining parts of Pakistan over the region. Any significant weather activity will remain absent for now.

We do not expect any weather activity for at least one week now. The intensity of Western Disturbances which were active earlier now has decreased. Although one or two feeble Western Disturbances may approach the Western Himalayas, during the next one week but their impact will be negligible over Delhi and NCR. Thus, we do not expect any alteration in wind pattern or any clouding or rains for the next week.

Heat wave conditions will spread to some more parts of Delhi and NCR leading to very uncomfortable and uneasy weather. We expect that the temperatures of Palam may reach 46 degrees in any course of time.

Even in the first week of June, we do not see any significant rain activity. For now, we will have to wait for any weather system to approach and give some activity, which may bring relief for a short duration at least.

Skymet further extends caution against the rising heat- stay hydrated, apply sunscreens while going out, wear loose and porous cotton fabrics. Take immediate medical care in case of heat stroke.
