As India-Pakistan tensions rise, people in Kashmir stock up on food, fuel

NEW DELHI - Kashmir is in the midst of panic as people hoard food and fill up on fuel amid growing tensions between India and Pakistan following the recent Pulwama terrorist attack.

The state has been on edge since a suicide bomber rammed a car laden with 350kg of explosives into a bus carrying paramilitary soldiers belonging to the Central Reserve Police Force, killing 40 and triggering an outpouring national outrage.

India has blamed Pakistan for the attack and stepped up security operations in Kashmir

The federal government over the weekend rushed in more than 10,000 paramilitary soldiers while police have arrested 100 political activists, including separatist leader Yasin Mallik, over the last couple of days.

Locals and politicians say the sense of panic has been increased by leaked government orders, including one asking hospitals to stock up on medicines and another from the food supplies department asking shops under it to sell foodgrains quickly.

These orders have been shared on social media, leading to long queues at petrol pumps and mass buying at grocery stores

"There is a sense of unease and panic in Kashmir. Nobody has a clue about what is to come but an ominous feeling of impending doom hangs in the air," tweeted former Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, leader of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP).
