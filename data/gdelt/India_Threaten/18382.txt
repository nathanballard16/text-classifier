Chotila mamlatdar threatened by sand mafia members

Rajkot: Chotila mamlatdar Prakash Gothi was alleged threatened by four members of a sand mafia after he seized their dumper trucks loaded with illegally mined sand.

According to police which registered the complaint on Sunday night, the accused, Kanti Bhuria, Rahul Herba and their two unidentified aides, had threatened Gothi on December 27.

“Gothi had seized the dumper loaded with sand on Rajkot-Ahmedabad Highway near Chotila on the morning of December 27. He had effected the seizure as the accused had not paid royalty for the sand. Bhuria, who was driving the dumper truck, did not even have the driving license,” said an official from Chotila police station.

While Gothi was taking Bhuria to the police station, Bhuria called up Herba. Soon, Herba and his three unidentified aides reached Chotila police station, and when Gothi came out of the police station, they threatened him.

“Later when Gothi left his office in the evening, the accused allegedly followed his official car in their car, allegedly waylaid his vehicle and intimidated him,” added the police official.
