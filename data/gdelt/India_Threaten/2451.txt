India's Modi breaks protocol to welcome Saudi's crown prince

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke with government protocol to personally welcome Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to New Delhi on Tuesday.

Ordinarily, the prime minister would not receive a foreign dignitary at the airport, but instead send an official or a junior government minister.
