'Mentally Unstable' Man Who Scaled Lions' Enclosure Killed in India – Reports

A tourist safari driver named Johnny spotted him first. "He was mentally unstable or under influence of alcohol", Jonny said. He added that when he saw him being dragged by a lioness, he informed the authorities immediately and began blowing the horns of his minibus and racing with the vehicle to shoo the lioness away. The lioness by then was joined by another lion.

Zoological park authorities say that the lions, although well fed, felt were threatened by the entry of a strange human into their space and hence might have attacked the man.

Earlier, in October 1999, a driver was killed by a Himalayan black bear when he fell into the restricted enclosure in an intoxicated state.

The Chhatbir Zoo had 87 lions in 1996. The number has dwindled down to four. At a time, only two lions of the four are released for the tourist safari.
