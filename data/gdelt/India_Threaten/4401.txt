Jana Sena, BSP meet a Political Stunt: Kavitha

Hyderabad: MP Kavitha today ridiculed that Jana Sena Chief Pawan Kalyan meeting with BSP chief Mayavathi as a political stunt.

Speaking to the media, she said that the meeting between Pawan Kalyan and Mayavathi is only to make some publicity ahead of LS polls and there is no clarity on their alliance. They must tell us whether they will fight for the LS polls in the two Telugu states alone or will have truck with Telugu Desam in AP. Will they contest independently or go with Chandrababu Naidu the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, she demanded. Jana Sena and BSP have to come out clearly on this. Her remarks came at a time when Jana sena chief wanted to see Mayavathi as future Prime Minister and the latter said she wants to see Pawan Kalyan as the chief minister of AP.
