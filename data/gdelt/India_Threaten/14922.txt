Wife of Kamlesh Tiwari, (45), the head of the Hindu Samaj Party had registered a complaint against these two alleged that they had threatened to kill her husband.

Blasphemy By Tiwari

In 2015, Tiwari allegedly made objectionable remarks against Muslims and Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in response to the Samajwadi Party leader Azam Khan “homosexuals” remark.

Tiwari faced the wrath of scores of Muslims for allegedly making derogatory remarks. He was arrested on charges of hate speech and the National Security Act (NSA) was slapped on him.

The same year, Maulana Haq had allegedly announced a Rs 51-lakh bounty for beheading Tiwari in Deoband, Saharanpur.
