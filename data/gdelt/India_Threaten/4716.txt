Don’t ask guests to park vehicles on road, Satish Sharma tells societies

SURAT: Surat police commissioner Satish Sharma on Friday warned residential societies of the city that compel visitors to park their vehicles outside the compound. “In areas like Varachha, Sarthana, Yogi Chowk, Katargam etc, residential societies have put up boards on the gate saying – Guests must park their vehicles outside, Parking for flat holders only – which violates the law. When guests are made to park outside in small roads, it creates lot of traffic issues,” he explained, while replying to a members presentation at Road Safety Council meeting at the police headquarters on Friday.The top cop rued that this is mostly seen in Varachha, Mota Varachha and others where the high rise and apartment builders have made their own parking laws.Talking to TOI Sharma said, “I have instructed my officials to look in to the issue comprehensively. We will take whatever action needs to be taken after we study the whole situation and have a comprehensive idea about such activities.” He also emphasized the need for awareness among people on traffic, safety and strict compliance to existing laws.
