1st in 105 days: Shops open all day in Kashmir Valley

SRINAGAR: For the first time since the defanging of Article 370 on August 5, complete normalcy was restored in Kashmir Valley on Monday with shops remaining open for the entire day and J&K State Roadways Transport Corporation buses plying across districts of the Valley.Informed sources said broadband services were likely to be restored in the Valley by the end of this week. This would completely restore communication links in the Valley.For the first time in 105 days, shops in the Valley remained opened in the afternoon hours as well. Till a day ago, traders were opening their shops from 7 to 11 in the morning and from 5 to 8 in the evening following threat from militants who had issued posters specifying these timings.People of the Valley had also altered their shopping timings accordingly, turning up to buy items only in the morning and evening hours.For the first time in 105 days, unauthorised hawkers in busy areas like Lal Chowk - who used spaces outside closed shops to put up their stalls – could not do business as the commercial establishments were opened through the day.“I came to set up my stall at the Polo View, which I have been doing for the past few months. But, today, police told me that I cannot set up my stall here as regular shops are opening,” Muzaffar Ahmad, a street vendor, said.Similarly, J&KSRTC buses plied across districts through the day for the first time on Monday.The authorities in Kashmir have already restored broadband internet facilities in most of the government offices. Internet services have also been restored at the data centre of the University of Kashmir for students, officials said.By this weekend, restoration of broadband services is likely to be extended to the common people, officials said.
