Raj Thackeray-led MNS quells its poll fight mode

Putting to end speculations, Raj Thackeray-led MNS announced it would not contest the Lok Sabha elections in the state due next month. Senior MNS leaders were negotiating with the NCP for a possible pre-poll adjustment. However, the Congress had opposed this considering the party's anti-migrant stance.

Last week, the NCP had announced the names of former MP Sanjay Dina Patil from Mumbai North East, while Babaji Patil will fight from Kalyan. The MNS was seeking either of these for a Lok Sabha contest.

On Sunday, MNS leader and general secretary Shirish Sawant issued a press release stating that the MNS would keep away from a contest. However, MNS leaders said this could lead to drift within the rank-and-file before the state assembly elections due later this year.

The MNS faced an electoral washout in the 2014 Lok Sabha and state assembly polls after a stellar showing in the previous elections. This time, the party fancied its chances due to disgruntlement in a section of the Shiv Sena's cadre after the party announced it would contest sans an alliance with the BJP, but made a U-turn later.

In 2009, the MNS had fielded 12 candidates across Maharashtra and its presence in the fray saw nine nominees of the Shiv Sena and BJP bite the dust against their adversaries from the Congress and NCP. However, due to a series of missteps and tactical errors, which saw Raj supporting Narendra Modi as the Prime Minister and yet fielding candidates against the Shiv Sena and the BJP, the MNS faced a severe electoral reverse in 2014, with all of its nine Lok Sabha candidates losing the elections. The MNS also lost all of its 13 seats in the Maharashtra legislative assembly, with Sharad Sonawane from Junnar in Pune being the only victor.
