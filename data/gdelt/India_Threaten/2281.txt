Iran summons Pakistan envoy over suicide bombing on its troops

TEHRAN: Iran's parliament speaker Ali Larijani said on Sunday that an attack that killed 27 members of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guard was "planned and carried out from inside Pakistan", which he said should answer for it.Iran's foreign ministry summoned Pakistan's ambassador on Sunday to protest the attack. Pakistan condemned Wednesday's attack and its foreign minister, Shah Mahmood Qureshi, spoke with his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, by phone on Sunday to assure him that Pakistan would fully cooperate in the investigation, according to two government officials who spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to brief media.The suicide bombing on Wednesday killed 27 members of Iran's Revolutionary Guards travelling on a bus in the volatile southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, which straddles the border with Pakistan. The militant Sunni group Jaish al-Adl , which claimed responsibility, is believed to operate from havens in Pakistan.The head of Iran's powerful Revolutionary Guard, Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari, on Saturday accused Pakistan's security forces of supporting the militants. India too has blamed Pakistan for the Pulwama terror attack on Thursday that killed 40 CRPF troops.Iran's President Hassan Rouhani meanwhile vowed "revenge for the blood of these martyrs," in remarks on Sunday. "They cannot escape God's and Iranian people's vengeance," Rouhani said. AP
