Congress MLA seeks civic body intervention

Ludhiana: Congress MLA from East constituency Sanjay Talwar has written a letter to the MC commissioner K P Brar and mayor Balkar Sandhu on Wednesday wanting them to intervene and caution those who are into business of hosiery waste. Talwar claimed that it was usually from here in Diwali that many fire incidents took place in these areas. He has requested the civic authorities to take stern action against such people and ask them not to keep the material in open as it can cause fire incident on Diwali after some crackers fell anywhere on the stock. He had raised this issue earlier but no action was taken over the same.

In the letter the MLA mentioned that in various wards coming under East constituency on almost every Diwali fire incidents are reported due to which people suffer big losses. Most of the incidents take place at those places where people keep the stock of hosiery waste in open area or in streets and in his constituency there are so many people involved in this business. He claimed that even last year on November 12 he had requested the MC to take action against such people but action was not taken. Subsequently two buildings collapsed in fire incidents at Grewal flour mill, Mayapuri, Tibba Road and waste kept in the houses and a few people also received the burn injuries. He said Diwali is approaching near so it is high time to take strict action against such people and in case they do not mend their ways then MC should take legal action against them. Meanwhile when contacted the mayor Balkar Sandhu he said, “I am yet to go through the letter but suitable action will be taken on the complaint.”
