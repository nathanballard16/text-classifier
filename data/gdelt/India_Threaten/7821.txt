Dejected JMM vows to ‘avenge’ Shibu defeat

Dumka: A pall of gloom descended on the JMM rank and file after eight-time Dumka MP and party patriarch Shibu Soren was defeated by his one-time disciple Sunil Soren (BJP) in the Lok Sabha polls.Even as the counting of votes was in progress at the Government Engineering College here, JMM cadres gathered outside started dispersing by noon as Sunil maintained a healthy lead from the beginning and eventually emerged victorious by over 47,590 votes. Dinesh Murmu, a local JMM functionary, said: “We were prepared for a grand victory procession for Guruji, but all our plans were in vain.”JMM central committee member Vijay Singh said: “Despite the defeat , Guruji and his ideology will continue to inspire people of Santhal Pargana and elsewhere in the state for his contribution to the struggle for a separate state and tribal rights."Another JMM cadre, Satish Dubey, said: “The defeat has come as a blow for us, but Guruji and the party will continue to be relevant in the state’s political landscape.” He rejected the idea that Shibu’s age — he is 72 as per his nomination papers — and poor health were the reason for his defeat.Meanwhile, both Shibu and his son Hemant remained confined to their residence in Dumka on Thursday and did not address any press conference. They left the city on Friday. “We will avenge Guruji’s defeat and wipe out BJP from all the eighteen constituencies of Santhal Pargana,” Shiva Baski, Hemant’s political representative, asserted.
