I don't answer sheikhchillis: Maneka Gandhi on Rahul's minimum income scheme

New Delhi [India], March 27 (ANI): "I do not answer sheikhchillis (day-dreamers)," Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union Minister Maneka Gandhi said in response to a question on the minimum income guarantee scheme introduced by Congress president Rahul Gandhi.

"No comments on Minimum Income Guarantee Scheme. I do not answer 'sheikhchillis' (a person who does not understand the law of gravity)," Maneka told reporters here on Wednesday.

When asked if Samajwadi Party-Bahujan Samaj Party alliance will pose a challenge for the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, Gandhi, who will contest the upcoming polls from Sultanpur, exuded confidence in the BJP's victory.

"Every single election brings its own challenges. But in the last five years, the BJP has done a lot of work across the country. We will fight these elections as an organised army. I am sure that we will again emerge victorious," she added.

Polling in Uttar Pradesh will be held in all seven phases, starting April 11. Counting of votes will be held on May 23.

While Maneka will contest from Sultanpur, her son, Varun Gandhi, will contest from Pilibhit. (ANI)
