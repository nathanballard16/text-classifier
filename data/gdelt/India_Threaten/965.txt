Volkswagen deposited the amount, but appealed in the apex court too.A bench led by Justice DY Chandrachud heard Volkswagen counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi before passing a short order refuting punitive action as the case involved a fine and the top court itself had extended the deadline to deposit the sum till January 7, 2019.NGT had held the German car-maker prima facie guilty of polluting despite a partial recall of vehicles that allegedly had a software installed to cheat emission checks.NGT’s committee asked Volkswagen to pay a penalty of Rs 171.34 crore, saying the automaker was prima facie guilty and could not deny it had contributed to air pollution. On November 16, 2018, NGT asked the company to pay up Rs 100 crore as interim payment or face arrests.On Monday, Chandrachud also allowed three weeks for Volkswagen and citizens who had moved NGT against the company to present claims to the NGT committee The bench broadened the committee by directing that a ministry of road transport representative also be included.The committee also has representatives of the Central Pollution Control Board, ministry of heavy industries, the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute and the Automotive Research Association of India
