2019 Lok Sabha polls: Voters of Uttar Pradesh would deliver "final strike" in favour of BJP, says Keshav Prasad Maurya

Describing the alliance stitched by the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Rashtriya Lok Dal as "opportunistic", Marya said: "It is an alliance with vested interests. It has become redundant for the people as the public has made up its mind that instead of voting for the SP and the BSP on caste lines, it will vote for the BJP, which is toeing the line of development, nationalism and working to eradicate terrorism."

Uttar Pradesh's Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said Wednesday the BJP would win more than 300 seats across the country, confident of that the voters of Uttar Pradesh would deliver their "final strike" in favour of the saffron party in the upcoming general elections. "Not only the voters of Amethi and Rae Bareli (the Congress bastions in UP), but voters of Uttar Pradesh will deliver a their final strike in favour of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in all the 80 Lok Sabha seats and give an overwhelming majority to him," Maurya told PTI in an interview here. The main issues in this election will be development, nationalism, eradicating poverty, wiping out corruption, ending terrorism and making the country number one in the world, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said in an interview.
