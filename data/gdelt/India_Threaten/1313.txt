Prakash Ambedkar unlikely to drop AIMIM

Senior Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders have been unable to dissuade Bharipa Bahujan Mahasangh (BBM) president Prakash Ambedkar from calling off the alliance with All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM).

Former Congress State unit chief Manikrao Thakre, current president Ashok Chavan, and senior NCP leader Chhagan Bhujbal met Mr. Ambedkar on Tuesday to discuss the possibility of him breaking off from the Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi formed with the AIMIM to contest Lok Sabha elections in Maharashtra.

Opposition party sources said Mr. Ambedkar was firm that his alliance would continue. According to agency reports, Mr. Ambedkar on Tuesday said the talks with the Congress and the NCP for a grand alliance have come to a “standstill”.

“Talks (for an alliance) haven’t failed. They are at a standstill,” Mr. Ambedkar told PTI. “I told them discussion on the number of seats will happen only after their response regarding how to curb the RSS’ parallel administration,” he added.

A senior Congress leader told The Hindu, “We have already clarified that we are not going to associate ourselves with AIMIM.”

The BBM leader had set January 30 as deadline for Congress-NCP to accept his demands. According to sources, Mr. Ambedkar is seeking 12 Lok Sabha seats out of 48 in Maharashtra. Mr. Chavan said the talks with Mr. Ambedkar were inconclusive.
