Hina Khan recently told a portal that she will not be seen on Kasautii Zindagii Kay from March. Fans were upset and outraged thinking that she is going to quit the show. However, in a chat with Bombay Times, Hina Khan clarified that she is only taking a break from the show and will return whenever she is needed. She said, “I am not quitting 'Kasautii'..., but I am going on a break for five-six months, as I have given my nod to a movie. I can’t disclose much about the film, but yes, I have communicated my decision to the makers of the show. Having said that, I will be back on the show whenever I am required. In the earlier season too, the track would change and Komolika would take a break and come back. As of now, I won’t be seen post March.”

When asked if her decision revolved around the fact that Anurag and Prerna might be getting married soon, she said, “That’s not true. In fact, the focus will always be on Komolika, but I have to concentrate on my films and I will be attending the Cannes film festival this year. There is no other reason and people should not read much into this.”

We can’t wait to see what the actress chooses to wear to the film festival. Not to mention, we are quite intrigued about the upcoming plot in Kasautii Zindagii Kay. Stay tuned with us for more updates from the telly world.
