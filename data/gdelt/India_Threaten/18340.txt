'Why Switzerland, come to Delhi': Bhuvan Bam turns trip advisor for Varun-Natasha, Virat-Anushka

After bumping into Kareena and Karisma Kapooor, Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalal had a double date with Virat Kohli and Anushka Sharma, who are also vacationing in Switzerland’s Gstaad. It was a reunion for Varun and Anushka, who shared screen space in the 2018 lm 'Sui Dhaaga'.

Anushka took to her Instagram to share an adorable frame of the four clad in their winter wear. She captioned the picture as “Hello Frands”. However it was comedian Bhuvan Bam’s comment that will tickle your funny bones. He wrote, “Why did you go the hills? Delhi is freezing right now! Idhar aa jaate. Chole bhature bhi kha lete sab!”
