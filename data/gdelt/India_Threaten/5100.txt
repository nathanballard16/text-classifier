Haryana BJP president Subhash Barala said on Saturday that senior ministers of the state had not been recommended for Lok Sabha ticket. “The final decision rests with the central party leadership,” he added. Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma had been eyeing the Karnal Lok Sabha seat.

Barala, while addressing mediapersons at the party office in Chandigarh, refused to comment on Sharma or any other minister of Haryana as a probable for the Lok Sabha ticket. He added, “The ticket will be announced next week. The recommendations have been sent.”

On the possibility of an alliance with the Indian National Lok Dal (INLD), he said, “There is no chance.”

Asked whether he could contest, he said that he was a worker of the party and it was up to the party to decide.

On Rahul Gandhi’s visit to Haryana, he said that the only thing it could achieve was that all leaders hopped on to the bus. On the ‘chowkidar chor hai’ jibe, Barala said, “We will not tolerate if unsavory words are spoken about the Prime Minister.”

He added, “People of India know who is ‘chor’ and who is ‘chowkidar’. There are no allegations against the Prime Minister. He has done a lot for the country. On the other hand, Congress leaders are out on bail in corruption cases. People know that the ‘chowkidar’ is pure.”

The BJP will hold ‘main bhi chowkidar’ programmes in all 10 Lok Sabha seats of the state. Screens will be put up for the Prime Minister’s address at 11 venues in the state. Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar will be present in Gurugram and Barala will participate in the function in Faridabad.

“Every citizen who vows to fight against corruption, casteism and unemployment is a chowkidar,” said Barala.
