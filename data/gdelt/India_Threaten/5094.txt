Jyotiraditya Scindia will fight polls from Guna: MP CM Kamal Nath

Bhopal: In a significant development, Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath on Saturday ruled out possibility of changing Jyotiraditya Scindia’s constituency in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls, emphatically saying, “Mr Scindia will contest from Guna seat” which he was currently representing.

Talking to reporters here, Mr Nath said Mr Scindia would not be shifted to another constituency and would be re-nominated for Guna in the forthcoming parliamentary elections.

Mr Nath’s statement came in the wake of demand by an influential section of Congress men, said to be belonging to the camp of veteran leader Digvijay Singh, to field Mr Scindia in a tough seat this time, instead of Guna.

“It is the responsibility of veteran leaders in the party to contest from tough seats, which have remained with BJP for last three decades, and win them for the party. Hence, Mr Scindia being a senior leader, should also be fielded in a tough seat like Indore,” the Congress leaders demanded after Mr Singh was asked to contest from Bhopal despite his reservation.
