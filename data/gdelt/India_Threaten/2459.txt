Pakistan security forces are capable enough to defend the country with full force:

Lt. Gen. (Retd) Raza Muhammad Khan (Defense Analyst):

Prime Minister Imran Khan has communicated the sentiments of the entire nation and made it very clear that unless India does not provide actionable evidences, it is baseless to blame Pakistan for Pulwama attack. Pakistan is fully prepared to retaliate in response of any kind of misadventure and aggression. Pakistan security forces are capable enough to defend the country with full force. PM Imran Khan has conveyed a very well considered warning to Indian government. Pakistan’s response is always very calculated and sensible. PM Imran Khan has rightly mentioned that negotiation is the ultimate solution to resolve all disputes between Pakistan and India. The senior political leadership of Kashmir has also asked BJP led government to stop jingoism over Pulwama attack and resolve Kashmir issue through dialogues. India has failed to hide its security failure in Kashmir and now trying to divert the attention of the world.
