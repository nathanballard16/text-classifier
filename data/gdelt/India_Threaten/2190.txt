Young doctors' strike in Sindh enters fourth day

The young doctors’ protest against the Sindh government entered its fourth day as patients bore the brunt of the non-availability of services at out-patient departments (OPDs) in public hospitals across the province, Express News reported.During the protest, doctors maintained that the Sindh government failed to issue any notification regarding delivery of their demands, which prompted them to call for a strike again.The doctors have been demanding salaries and allowances, equal to their counterparts in Punjab. They also want promotions, regularisation of contractual doctors and an end to rampant corruption in the health department.The doctors, who were also protesting in January, had called off their strike after negotiations with the government.Earlier, it had been reported that several OPDs in Hyderabad, Jamshoro, Tando Jam and other districts of the province were closed that caused undue stress to the patients and delayed their treatment.
