Rahul Gandhi successor may be in place in about a week

NEW DELHI: Congress is likely select the successor to Rahul Gandhi in about a week, with indications suggesting that the party was also looking to appoint at least one vice-president to balance out age groups.The indication that party wants to settle the leadership issue shortly by calling a meeting of the CWC came after a meeting of senior leaders on Monday.“We hope to sort out the matter in 7-8 days,” said a source as the growing concern over the uncertainty found a public echo with veteran leader Karan Singh slamming the delay in finding Gandhi’s replacement, terming it “disorientation and confusion”.The leadership has started the exercise of winnowing the names from a pool consisting of veterans like Mallikarjun Kharge , Sushil Kumar Shinde, Meira Kumar, Mukul Wasnik and Anand Sharma. Others in contention include Jyotiraditya Scindia, Rajasthan deputy CM Sachin Pilot . Some of those being speculated about could be considered for vice-president, said sources.Importantly, Karan Singh suggested that an “interim president” be selected along with four “working presidents” from four zones to accommodate younger leaders. He also underlined the need for party elections to select full-time replacement of Rahul Gandhi.While party polls are a constitutional necessity to select the AICC president, his flagging it suggests that a section in Congress wants that the CWC pick should only be an interim arrangement to be followed by a genuinely open contest.As Congress churns with “Old vs Young” and “Nomination vs Election” lobbying, Singh said he was “aghast” at the “disorientation” in the party which chose to spend a month pleading with Rahul to take back his resignation instead of “honouring the bold decision” and finding a successor. He warned that any further delay would only deepen the demoralisation among the party workers and urged action before “it is too late”.
