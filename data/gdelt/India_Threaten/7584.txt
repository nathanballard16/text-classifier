Lok Sabha polls

Congress

BJP

Rahul Gandhi

MK Stalin

Parleys are on in earnest in the opposition ranks even as 59 constituencies go for seventh and last phase ofon Sunday.The focus already appears to have shifted to May 23, the day of results, with theconfident thatwill fall well short of the required numbers to return to power. In such a case, the Congress can bring together the opposition under its fold to form government.In such a scenario, UPA Chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress President's negotiating skills would be put to the test since the number of contenders for the Prime Minister's post is likely to be high.The possibility of various leaders clamouring for the Prime Minister's post cannot be ruled out, say political observers.In fact, on Friday, Odisha minister and senior Biju Janata Dal (BJD) leader Surya Narayan Patro suggested that Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik is the suitable candidate to become Prime Minister.A report in a Malayalam news website claimed that the name of former defence minister AK Antony is being considered by the Congress as çonsensus candidate --like Manmohan Singh--to appease the potential allies if there is any opposition to Rahul Gandhi becoming PM.But Antony dismissed the report as 'baseless'."Baseless. Baseless. Baseless," Antony kept repeating when when Mirror drew his attention to the report.Meanwhile, on Saturday morning, Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N.Chandrababu Naidu met Rahul Gandhi at Delhi to discuss the post-poll strategy to stop the BJP-led NDA from coming back to power. Naidu also met Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) President Sharad Pawar. He would also meet, among others, Bahujan Samaj Party leader Mayawati and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav, sources say.It might be recalled that Telangana Chief Minister K.Chandrashekar Rao has been holding parleys separately with leaders of regional parties with an aim to form a non-BJP, non-Congress government, but without much success as leaders like DMK Presidentpoured cold water on the idea. Stalin, right from the beginning, has been consistent about backing Rahul Gandhi for the Prime Minister's post.
