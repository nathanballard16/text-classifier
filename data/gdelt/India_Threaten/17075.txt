Mumbai, December 9

The Shiv Sena today accused the Narendra Modi government of bringing an ‘invisible partition’ between Hindus and Muslims through the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.

An editorial in Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’ warned that granting citizenship to Hindu illegal immigrants would cause religious war in the country. “There is no shortage of problems in the country. But we are creating new problems like the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill... the Centre has now made an invisible partition over the Bill,” the editorial said.

‘Saamana’ pointed out that there was no country for Hindus other than India. “.... but accepting only Hindu illegal immigrants... could lead to religious war in the country,” the editorial argued. It said illegal immigrants living in India, irrespective of their religion, should be sent back to their countries of origin. — TNS

Plot against muslims

It is against the Constitution.... Secularism is the basic structure of Constitution. It is a conspiracy to make Muslims stateless. Asaduddin Owaisi, AIMIM
