Tehelka sting: 3-year jail for retired Major General

NEW DELHI: Nearly 18 years after a sting operation in 2001 caught Army officials off guard, a special CBI court in New Delhi has convicted and sentenced a retired Major General in the case to three years’ rigorous imprisonment for accepting bribes.Special CBI Judge Shailendra Malik of Rouse Avenue Courts recently convicted Maj Gen S P Murgai for corruption and sentenced him to three years’ RI for push-ing the interests of a fictitious defence manufac-turer in exchange for a bribe of Rs 70,000. The court also fined Murgai Rs 25,000.In its judgment, the court relied chiefly on the witness testimony of former IAS officer L M Mehta and another major general of the defence ministry, P S K Chaudhary. Mehta was additional secretary (defence) at the time when Murgai took Tehelka journalist Mathew Samuel (posing as a defence manufacturer) to his residence.Murgai was then working in the Directorate General of Quality Assurance of Department of Defence Production and was recorded secretly by the scribe while agreeing to influence public servants to get the fake defence firm ‘deals’ in lieu of money. The court took note of Murgai’s attempt in the unscheduled meeting with Mehta to give him a gold chain, which was refused by the IAS officer.“Going to the house of someone working as ‘additional secretary’, department of defence, with someone ostensibly interested in supply of equipment to the Army... without any prior appointment and then discussing about that company (though fictitious) was evidence against Murgai that could not be ignored,” the court noted. It cited Mehta’s evidence that he warned the Army officer that no middleman could be entertained in defence ministry, yet Murgai persisted in the first meeting with the senior bureaucrat.Malik concluded that circumstances showed “that whatever step taken by accused S P Murgai along with Mathew Samuel was only to induce public servants like Mehta and Maj Gen P S K Chaudhary for promoting the products of that fictitious company, whom Samuel was representing”. Samuel himself was made a witness in the case by the agency.The CBI had registered the case on February 3, 2006, alleging that Murgai received of Rs 70,000 for himself from the representative of Tehelka.com. He received the money as a reward for influencing MoD officials.After a probe, the CBI filed a chargesheet on October 31, 2007, alleging that Murgai willingly went along with the Tehelka sting team to facilitate access to key officers dealing with armament procurement at army headquarters.The court relied on the witness testimony of ex-IAS officer L M Mehta, who was the additional def secy in 2001 when Murgai took Tehelka journalist Mathew Samuel (posing as adefence manufacturer) to his residence. The court cited Mehta’s evidence that he warned the Army officer that no middleman could be entertained in the defence ministry, yet Murgai continued to persist
