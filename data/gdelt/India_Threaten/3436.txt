Tap the chatter question: Where Bengalureans speak their mind

Should Congress take strct action against JN Ganesh , its MLA from Kampli?



Abhinandan

I definitely feel that we should set a deadline for Pakistan to release our officer as they should know that they CANNOT FOOL AROUND US INDIANS....They have already had a taste of our medicine..What if the deadline we give Pak ends up risking commander's life ? Two nuclear powers cannot set a deadline, it would only lead to war! It's a tough time now!I dont't think so. Certain procedures are already in place and we must stand united with patience and support our fighters in any way we can. I request all to control your affection towards Chinese goods, if you buy anything on daily basis, stop that.It is unfortunate that Wing Commander Abhinandan fell into the hand of Pakistan . It is extremely important to get him back safely through diplomatic channel . There will be a lot of uncertainty in getting him released safely through a military action. Deadline may not work at this juncture .Abhinandan is our pride and the government must ensure that Pakistan is compelled to release him immediately with full honour of the Article 4 of the third Geneva Convention. India should also wage a diplomatic war against the vulgar display of an injured soldier.If you want to be featured in this section tomorrow, mail us your answer to this question, in 25 words, by 5 pm today, with ‘Tap The Chatter’ in the subject line.
