Junior docs in Tgana call off strike against NMC Act

Vowing to continue their struggle against provisions objectionable to them in the National Medical Commission Act, junior doctors in Telangana, who have been agitating on the issue, called off their stir on Friday.

The junior doctors announced their decision following a meeting with state Health Minister E Rajender who assured them that he would convey their grievances to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan.

Rajender, who met Vardhan in Delhi on Thursday, quoted the Union Health Minister as having said that the new legislation would be progressive.

The protesting junior doctors told reporters that they cannot continue the strike as the next parliament session would take place only after three months.

They said they have asked the state health minister to convey their concerns to the Centre once again.

The Telangana Junior Doctors Joint Action Committee said in a release that their plan of action include challenging the NMC Act legally, holding a protest in Delhi and calling for an indefinite strike, if necessary, before commencement of the winter session of parliament.

They said they will resume services, including non-emergency services, from August 10.

President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday gave assent to the key legislation aimed at ushering in mega reforms in the medical education sector and replacing the nearly 63-year-old Indian Medical Council Act.
