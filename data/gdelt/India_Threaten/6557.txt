MSU to tighten noose on student leader for fake ragging complaint

VADODARA: M S University is tightening noose on the student leader of Faculty of Arts on whose behest a fake complaint of ragging was submitted before the University Grants Commission (UGC) last month.Last month a first year student of Faculty of Science had complained that he was beaten up by a group of senior students hailing from Bihar The student – Vaibhav Bajpayee, an inmate of N V Hall at the Halls of Residence (boys hostel) – had also submitted an application before the police alleging that he was assaulted at the hostel premises by a group for organizing ‘ Holika dahan ’ programme.A probe panel formed by MSU has now arrived at the conclusion that while ruckus did happen at the hostel campus, it was on the behest of a faculty representative (FR) of Faculty of Arts that Bajpayee approached the UGC alleging that it was a ragging incident.According to the committee members, a third year student by the name of Nirbhay Mishra had misguided Bajpayee and asked him to submit a complaint against his seniors before the UGC through the anti-ragging forum.The university has now decided to issue a warning to Mishra. “We will issue a showcause notice asking the student leader to explain the reason behind misguiding other student and submitting false claims before the UGC,” said a committee member.University sources said that the ruckus has its origin in rivalry between a set of former student leaders of the university who want to settle their personal scores through the current lot of hostel students.“We are investigating the matter thoroughly and will look into it within the framework of the rules,” said MSU’s in-charge registrar N K Ojha.
