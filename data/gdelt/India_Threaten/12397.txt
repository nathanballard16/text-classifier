Pakistan on Wednesday also warned the President of the UN Security Council that India was readying for another false flag operation to divert world’s attention from its illegal and unilateral

actions of 5 August 2019 and it was important to note India’s irresponsible and belligerent rhetoric on the nuclear issue continues. Pakistan has also requested for doubling the number of United Nations Military Observer Group (UNMOGIP). Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has addressed another letter to the President of the UN Security Council underscoring the continuation of troubling developments including the dire humanitarian situation as a result of total lockdown in Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) and the attendant risks to peace and security in South Asia.

“Referring to the Security Council meeting of August 16, 2019, the foreign minister has emphasised the importance of immediate lifting of India’s indefensible lockdown of the entire Kashmiri population for three weeks and reiterated Pakistan’s concerns over India staging another false flag operation to divert world’s attention from its illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019.
