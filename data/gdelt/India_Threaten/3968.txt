Owaisi welcomes mediation, takes exception to Ravi Shankar

MIM President Asaduddin Owaisi on Friday welcomed the Supreme Court order for mediation to settle the Ayodhya dispute but voiced concern over Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar being made a mediator saying he was related to the subject matter and was also a party to the dispute.

The Hyderabad MP said Ravi Shankar had made a statement on November 4, 2018 threatening violence. He said the spiritual leader had warned that if Muslims did not give up the land, India will become a Syria.

Owaisi said Ravi Shankar had also asked Muslims to give up their claim as a goodwill gesture. He said it would have been better if the Supreme Court had not appointed him as a mediator.

He, however, hoped that Ravi Shankar would realize the huge responsibility entrusted to him by the apex court and act as a neutral mediator.

The MP said he was welcoming the Supreme Court order on behalf of the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (MIM). He said the All India Muslim Personal Law Board would spell out its stand.

The MIM leader, also a member of Personal Law Board, said the Muslim side should go to the three mediators appointed by the Supreme Court and put forward its view.

He also welcomed the Supreme Court order that the mediation process would be confidential. He said this would leave no room for speculation in media and thus avoid a situation where politicians could draw mileage for electoral gains.
