Trucks move, but too few in Calcutta outskirts

Trucks carrying vegetables and fish spent Monday night stationed outside the city but several of them were forced by police to drive to their destinations and unload early on Tuesday. Truck operators, however, said the strike would continue to protest a state government decision to lower the carrying capacity of vehicles when the Centre is allowing up to 25 per cent more.

Trucks that had remained parked in North 24-Parganas, Hooghly and Burdwan entered the city on Tuesday morning and reached wholesale hubs in Howrah and Sealdah early on Tuesday but the number was far less than usual. “Some 14 trucks reached Koley Market early on Tuesday carrying onions from Nashik. Vegetables from other parts also arrived,” said Kamal Dey, the president of the West Bengal Vendor Association. “But the usual stream of trucks was missing.” Over five lakh trucks carrying raw materials and medicines enter the city every day. Transport department officials and the police met truck operators late on Tuesday to resolve the matter but the operators sought a meeting with chief minister Mamata Banerjee. All previous meetings with officials and ministers have proved futile, they said.
