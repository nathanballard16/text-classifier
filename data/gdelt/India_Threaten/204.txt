BJP leader demands judicial inquiry

The Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Legislative Assembly Vijender Gupta on Saturday demanded the ordering of a judicial inquiry by the Lieutenant-Governor into the factory collapse accident.

He said the accident which claimed seven lives was one of several of its kind recurring in the Capital for which the administration was answerable and needed to be held accountable even as he demanded that the Delhi government pay “adequate compensation” to the next of kin of those who lost their lives and provide free quality treatment facilities to the injured.

“Such incidents recur time and again in different parts of Delhi but the administration keeps waiting for the next accident without taking any lessons...It has also come to the fore that this factory was being run violating all norms and had also been served a notice for sealing,” Mr. Gupta said.

Demanding a special committee be constituted to survey and identify areas with similar issues in the city, the leader said preventive measures needed to be taken immediately to avoid similar tragedies in future.

“This is not the first such disaster...if administration had taken some action by taking lessons in a similar factory disaster in Moti Nagar in April 2015, the present disaster could well have been avoided. If the administration still takes no action in the present case, the possibility repetition of such incidents cannot be ruled out,” he added.
