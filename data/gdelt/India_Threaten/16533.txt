Washington: US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday remembered people who lost their lives in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack and said that it is an affront to them and their families that its perpetrators have still not been convicted.

Speaking to mediapersons at the Foggy Bottom headquarters of the State Department here, Pompeo said the cowardly attack shocked the entire world.

“Today also marks the 11th anniversary of the Mumbai terrorist attack. We remember the 166 innocent victims including six Americans. The cowardly attack shocked the entire world,” he said.

“It is an affront to the victims and families that those who planned the Mumbai attack have still not been convicted,” Pompeo said.

Acting Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asia Alice Wells took to Twitter, expressing deepest sympathies to the families of the victims.

“The US honours their memories and is committed to seeing those responsible for these horrific acts brought to justice,” Wells said.

Meanwhile, hundreds of Indian-Americans and members of the Pakistani minority and ethnic communities protested outside the Embassy of Pakistan against Islamabad's role in supporting cross-border terrorist activities. They demanded that the perpetrators behind the terrorist attack be brought to justice.

On November 26, 2008, in one of the deadliest terror attacks in India's history, 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in Mumbai, killing 166 people and injuring over 300.
