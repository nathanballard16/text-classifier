'Dead' Man Wakes Up In His Own Coffin

An Indian man was almost late to his own funeral -- but, fortunately, he woke up moments before he was about to be lowered into the ground.

Mohammad Furgan, 20, fell into a coma following a June 21st traffic accident in Lucknow and was declared dead over the weekend. But apparently he wasn't completely dead, according to his brother, Mohammad Irfan.

"Devastated, we were preparing for the burial when some of us saw movement in his limbs," Irfan said. "We immediately took Furqan to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital where the doctors said he was alive and have put him on ventilator support."

Lucknow Chief Medical Officer Narendra Agarwal told the hindustan times that the man is now recovering.

“We have taken cognizance of the incident and the matter will be thoroughly probed,” Narendra Agarwal told the outlet. “The patient is in critical condition but definitely not brain dead. He has pulse, blood pressure and his reflexes are working. He has been put on ventilator support.”

Now, Furgan's family is considering taking legal action against the first hospital, which they suspect had a motive for declaring him dead.

"We had paid [$10,000] to the private hospital earlier and when we told them that we had run out of money, they had declared Furqan dead," Irfan added.
