Fresh deadline for accessible India drive set to March 2020, targets missed by 1 to 3 yrs

NEW DELHI: Four years after its launch, the government’s Accessible India campaign to ensure universal accessibility to public transport, buildings, and websites has yet to make much ground, with several targets and plans missing their deadlines by one to three years.The government has now set a final deadline of March 2020 to complete all works under the initiative.“We have achieved a lot in this landmark initiative over the last four years, but targets have not been met,” said social justice and empowerment minister Thawar Chand Gehlot who last week held a meeting of all nodal ministries responsible for implementation of Accessible India. “Now we have set a fresh deadline of March 2020 to complete all works,” Gehlot told ET. “I have asked departments to bring forth any issues that are coming in the way as the programme is running behind schedule.”Accessible India campaign, launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on December 3, 2015, is being implemented under three broad categories — accessibility in public transport (airports, railways and road), public buildings, and information and communication technology (websites and television viewing). Making websites accessible was considered a low hanging fruit of the flagship programme of the department of empowerment of persons with disabilities (DEPwD), the nodal agency for the campaign. It decided to conduct an accessibility audit in March 2017 by when 50% of state and central government websites were to be made fully accessible. However, till date, only 36% of state government websites — 336 out of 917 identified websites — have been made accessible by 23 participating states, according to data presented by DEPwD in the meeting.The Centre has made much progress in this goal though, with the electronics and information technology ministry (MeitY) making 95 of 100 central government websites accessible by the start of this month.In public transport, the target was to conduct accessibility audit of all domestic airports and convert them into full accessible airports by March 2018. According to data provided by DEPwD to Parliament, so far, 55 of 104 domestic airports have been provided accessible features. The government also had to ensure that by March 2018 10% of government-owned public transport carriers in the country are converted into fully accessible carriers. Over a year after the set deadline, only 3.6% of buses — or, 5,244 out of a total fleet of 145,287 buses — have been made fully accessible (wheelchair friendly) by the road transport and highways ministry.Sources said 20.97% of the buses have been made accessible in some form, but without wheelchair accessibility.
