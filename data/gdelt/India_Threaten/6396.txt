The temperature was registered in the community of Huong Khe in Ha Tinh Province on Vietnam's north-central coastal region.

Unusually hot weather covered the entire Indochina peninsula over the weekend with Da Nang registering 37.7 °C (100 °F) and Hue 40.5 °C (105 °F), Capital Weather Gang's Matthew Cappucci reported.

Most places in Vietnam usually don't see their hottest temperatures before June or July.
