Congress brushes aside reports on tie-up with AAP in Haryana

Stays mum on pact with the party in Delhi; announces slogan

The Congress on Sunday dismissed reports stating a possible tie-up with the Aam Aadmi Party or other regional players in Haryana and Punjab. However, the party said it is yet to finalise on a pact with AAP in Delhi.

“There is no conversation or alliance with AAP or any other party either for Haryana or Punjab. We are soon going to declare our candidates [for the two States]”, said Congress communication chief Randeep Surjewala at a press conference where the party announced 2019 campaign slogan Ab Hoga Nyay [Now, justice will prevail].

However, Mr. Surjewala refused to give a categorical answer about a tie-up in Delhi. “As I have said before, for Delhi please wait for some more time. As soon as we finalise something, we will inform you,”he added.

On Saturday, party president Rahul Gandhi met senior leaders from Delhi, including senior leader P.C. Chacko and Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president Sheila Dikshit, to discuss the issue.

Sources said Mr. Gandhi is yet to take a decision but Ms. Dikshit would follow the diktat of the party president.

On April 6, AAP had said it would form an alliance with the Congress in Delhi only if the two parties fight the Lok Sabha poll jointly in Haryana and Chandigarh too.

Equal number of seats

The party had asked for Faridabad, Gurugram and Karnal seats in Haryana in exchange for an equal number of seats in Delhi. It had added that it would be ready to support the Congress’ candidate for Chandigarh as well. AAP had also made a precondition that the Congress must openly declare its support to full statehood for Delhi if there was to be an alliance.
