LDF govt won’t give security to women visiting Sabarimala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The LDF government on Thursday described the Supreme Court’s verdict on Sabarimala as “very complex” and refused to spell out clearly how it would handle the situation if women attempt to enter the hill shrine in the coming days.“There is ambiguity. The verdict has created more confusion and its implications need to be understood in depth. We will consult legal experts and formulate a stand. Whatever the verdict, the government is bound to implement that,” Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan told mediapersons in the evening.When asked about the stand of the government if women pilgrims reach the temple in the initial days of the pilgrimage season, Vijayan said: “There is ample time to discuss and decide on that.”Law minister A K Balan was more forthright. Describing the verdict as “one that creates more trouble for the government”, he said the government won’t provide security and protection to any woman pilgrim going to Sabarimala. This is in sharp contrast to the situation last year, when the LDF government had provided security to some of the women devotees who had attempted to visit Lord Ayyappa’s shrine.Soon after the SC pronounced its verdict, Congress leader Ramesh Chennithala urged the government not to send “atheist women” as pilgrims to Sabarimala and create tension. BJP leader Kummanam Rajasekharan warned of dire consequences if the government took the initiative to allow women to trek to Sabarimala.The LDF government has been maintaining a pro-woman stand on the issue since 2007, when the government led by V S Achuthanandan submitted an affidavit in the SC favouring the entry of women of all ages to Sabarimala. This is likely to be the government’s formal position when the review petitions are filed in the SC before the larger seven-member bench.Soon after the SC verdict, Congress’s Ramesh Chennithala urged the government not to send “atheist women” as pilgrims to Sabarimala and create tension.
