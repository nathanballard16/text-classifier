Nation stands behind armed forces: Shehbaz

Condemning the Indian aggression, Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly and the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif has said India should know the whole Pakistani nation stands solidly behind their armed forces for the defence of their motherland.“Any aggression from across the border will be a grave mistake that India will regret for times to come. Pakistan’s contributions and sacrifices against the war on terror are known to the world,” Shehbaz wrote on Twitter.“The Indian leadership is jeopardising the regional peace for its petty political interests by taking lives of innocent Kashmiris,” the PML-N leader added.He remarked that every Pakistani is ready to give a befitting response to India and fight for the honour, security and integrity of the motherland. He said the nation has always faced challenges with determination and fought the enemy with exemplary passion.The PML-N president said the Indian leadership should play politics on any other subject and abandon its negative approach which may darken the future of the poor people of South Asia.He regretted that before every general election in India, their leadership adopts an anti-Pakistan rhetoric.Shehbaz condemned the murder of a Pakistani prisoner in Jaipur jail and the attacks on Kashmiris and Muslims living in India. He called upon the Modi government to stop atrocities and ensure safety of Kashmiris and Indian Muslims.He expressed grief with the families of the victims of Pulwama attack and asked the international community to resolve the Kashmir issue at the earliest so that the bloodshed could come to an end.The PML-N leader pointed out reaction to the Indian oppression in held Kashmir was natural, adding that issues could not be resolved through guns, bullets and violence.Earlier, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said Islamabad would take action if Delhi shares any actionable evidence concerning last week’s suicide bombing in Pulwama.While offering cooperation and dialogue over the Kashmir issue, the premier had also warned India against any act of aggression, saying Pakistan would not hesitate in retaliating to a provocation. Tensions between Pakistan and India are once again running high following the February 14 attack.Over 40 Indian paramilitary troops were killed in the attack, which has been claimed by the Jaish-e-Mohammad, a proscribed organisation.India has alleged that those who planned the attacks have links with the Pakistani state — a charge that Pakistan has vigorously denied. Shortly after the attack, the Pakistan Foreign Office condemned the attack, saying it was “a matter of grave concern”.Published in The Express Tribune, February 24, 2019.
