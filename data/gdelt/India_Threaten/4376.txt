Through The Mizo PRISM: A Political Party Seeks To Contest Polls On Issue Of Secession

Mizoram presents a curious picture of a state at peace with itself and yet finding ways to disturb the narrative in the most radical manner. Ever since the Mizo Peace Accord was signed in 1986—that ended a violent uprising for secession from India—the tiny state in India’s Northeast has been an enduring image of peace in a region rife with militancy. A new Mizo political party is now seeking to contest the forthcoming general elections on the issue of secession. And it intends to take their cause right to Parliament, provided it can win the lone Lok Sabha seat in the state.

But leaders of the People’s Repre­sentation for Identity and Status of Mizo­ram (PRISM) would know that the “idea” is not too controversial for the Mizos. This January, when the state was roiled by the now-lapsed Citizenship Amendment Bill, protesters carried banners and placards that proclaimed the people’s anger against the controversial bill. “Hello China, Bye-Bye India”, one of the banners had said in Aizawl.
