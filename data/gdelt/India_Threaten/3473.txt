Miffed Pakistan To Boycott OIC Meet As Islamic Nations Ignore Its Demand To Disinvite India

As an indication of escalating tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi has said in the joint session of the country’s parliament that he will not be attending the foreign ministers' meet of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) states over the invitation extended to India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj, reports News18.

"I requested them (OIC) to review the decision [to invite Sushma Swaraj]. UAE said that when we extended the invitation, Pulwama had not occurred. If it had, the case would have been different. Now we have extended invitation it would be hard to retract, but they would still consult, " Qureshi reportedly said.

Swaraj was invited as a guest of honour despite Pakistan being a founding member of the Islamic grouping. In 1969, India’s delegation to the grouping was asked to withdraw after Pakistan threatened to boycott. Swaraj, who is in Abu Dhabi to attend the meet, is likely to raise the issue of terrorism.

This development comes amid heightened tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad. Pakistan had responded to India’s air strike on a terror camp deep inside its territory by targeting military installations. In the air duel that followed, India shot down an F-16 fighter of the Pakistan Air Force and lost a MiG-21. Pakistan is set to release the pilot of the fighter who was captured after ejecting.
