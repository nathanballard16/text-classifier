Amit Shah optimistic of winning hearts in Jammu & Kashmir

New Delhi: Home minister Amit Shah reached out to the people of Jammu and Kashmir during a Rajya Sabha debate on Monday on extension of President’s rule in the state by saying he was optimistic of winning the support of all sections through non-discriminatory welfare schemes.Shah reiterated most points he made in the Lok Sabha . He underlined that the Modi government would follow the ‘Jamhooriyat, Kashmiriyat, Insaaniyat’ policy of former prime minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee but would not tolerate terrorism or those perpetrating it, while cautioning the youth against being misled.“We talk about holding simultaneous elections… We have no interest in ruling a state by proxy. We have governments in 16 states. But for holding assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, we would have to take care of security of around 1,000 candidates, security for public meetings, interactions with voters, nukkad meetings, security during travel and so on,” Shah said, while explaining why assembly polls were not held along with Lok Sabha polls.Striking a positive note for bringing normalcy, Shah said: “I am not a pessimist. I am confident that the Sufis and Kashmiri Pandits will one day pray in the temples there.” He alleged Sufis and Kashmiri Pandits were killed or driven away by separatists. Shah said the Centre had re-opened shut schools or those burnt down by terrorists. Government officials now visit villages to enquire if people were getting the benefit of welfare schemes like Ujjwala, construction of toilets, power, etc.Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad defended Jawaharlal Nehru on Article 370 . Azad said that it was needed then and cited Nehru’s contribution in making Jammu and Kashmir an integral part of India. Azad questioned the government’s zero tolerance by asking why “16 Army and CRPF installations were attacked and jawans killed,” when BJP was in government with the PDP and central rule later.
