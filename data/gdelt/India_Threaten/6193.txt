PM mentions Abhinandan in rally, polling official says report will be sent if MCC violation found

Ahmedabad (Gujarat) [India], April 21 (ANI): Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi mentioned Indian Air Force wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman during an election rally in the state, Gujarat’s Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) S Murali Krishna has asserted that a local election official will send a report on it if any violation is found.

He also asserted that the commission has not taken any cognizance on the issue.

Earlier in the day, while addressing a poll rally in Patan district, Modi had said that he had warned Pakistan of consequences after Abinandan was detained.

“When Abhinandan was captured by Pakistan, I said (to Pakistan) that if anything happens to our pilot then we will not leave you,” he had said.

Earlier, the EC had directed political parties to advise their candidates and leaders to desist from displaying photographs of defence personnel in advertisements as part of their election campaign and exercise caution while making reference to armed forces.

The EC in its advisory had stated, "The Armed Forces of a nation are the guardian of its frontiers, security and the political system. They are apolitical and neutral stakeholders in a modern democracy. It is, therefore, necessary that the political parties and leaders exercise great caution while making any reference to the Armed Forces in their political campaigns."

It added, "The Commission is of the view that photographs of functions of Defence Forces should not be associated with or used in any manner in advertisements/propaganda/campaigning or in any other manner in connection with elections by political parties and candidates."

The Model Code of Conduct came into effect after Chief Election Officer Sunil Arora announced the Lok Sabha election schedule on March 10. (ANI)
