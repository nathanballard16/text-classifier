TSRTC Strike: Will CM KCR Stand On His Decision Of 50 % Privitisation?

HYDERABAD: Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao convened an emergency review meeting with Telangana Transport Minister Puvvada Ajay Kumar and other officials on Wednesday, November 6 over the TSRTC strike. It was learnt that during the meeting CM KCR has asked officials to prepare an affidavit that has to be submitted in High Court today, which asked to provide information on Road Transport Corporation's revenue, assets, salaries of the employees and other details. The ongoing meeting will also focus on the issue of privatization of TSRTC.

It has to be recalled that even after CM KCR set November 5 as deadline for agitating Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC) employees to resume work, only 350 have reported to work out of 48,000 TSRTC.

CM KCR announced that Telangana state cabinet had decided to allot 5,100 of 10,400 routes to private operators and warned that the other routes would also be given to them if those on strike don't join duty by midnight of November 5. He further clarified that Telangana governmnet is not ready for merger of TSRTC with the state government.

But the RTC Joint Action Committee (JAC) unions didn't pay attention to CM KCR's deadline and continue to intensify their protest all over the state demanding the merger of TSRTC with state governmnet. Even RTC JAC president Ashwatama Reddy said that that they have boycotted CM KCR's Call to resume their services.

If CM KCR stands by his announcement then TSRTC will have 50% RTC and 50% private buses operating in Telangana.
