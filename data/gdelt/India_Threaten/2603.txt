Pulwama attack: UP cop goes on 3-day leave to collect funds for families of martyrs

A lean, yellow rope fastened the collection box to Firoz Khan's body as he rode his bike around town in uniform.

A printed placard announced the constable's mission: "Donations for the families of jawans martyred in Pulwama."

Last week, 40 CRPF paramilitary soldiers were killed when a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber attacked a convoy in Jammu and Kashmir, sparking a national outpouring of rage and grief.

Twelve of the soldiers who were martyred were from Uttar Pradesh.

Firoz Khan, who spoke to ANI in Rampur in northern UP, said he had asked to go on leave for three days. He said he would collect funds from locals and police officials.

As a police jawan, he said, losing a fellow jawan in the CRPF felt like losing a brother.

India has vowed to exact revenge for the terrorist attack in Pulwama, and has since killed three terrorists, including the mastermind of last week's bombing.

The Army has urged parents of Kashmiri terrorists to ask them to surrender, warning that anyone who picks up a gun in the Valley will be killed.

Pakistan, where the Jaish-e-Mohammed is based, has denied responsibility for the bombing in Pulwama and threatened to retaliate if attacked by India.
