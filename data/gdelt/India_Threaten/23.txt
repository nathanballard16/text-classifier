Rajasthan to revoke cases against Dalits

The Rajasthan government will revoke cases registered against Dalits during the Bharat Bandh of April 2 last year after reviewing them, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said on Tuesday.

He made the announcement a day after Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati threatened to withdraw her party's support to the Congress governments in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan if the cases were not withdrawn immediately.

Speaking to the media at the Congress office, Gehlot said: "Our government will review all such cases to ensure that innocents are released."

He said that Mayawati's demand was valid. The previous government had framed cases against many people "and hence our government will review all such cases".

"In fact, I am thankful to Mayawati for giving support to our party. She herself took the initiative to extend support to the Congress and hence I am thankful to her."
