P Chidambaram: It Was Wrong To Use NSA in MP Cow Slaughter Case, State Government Informed

Former Union Minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram conceded on Friday, 8 February, that the use of National Security Act (NSA) in the Madhya Pradesh cow slaughter case was wrong. Congress President Rahul Gandhi has pointed out the mistake to the party-led MP government, he added.

Earlier this week, the Kamal Nath-led government had slapped NSA against three men accused of killing a cow at Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh.

Chidambaram was speaking at the launch of his book Undaunted: Saving the Idea of India at the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in Delhi at 6:30 pm on Friday, 8 February.
