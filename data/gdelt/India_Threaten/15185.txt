Weather News and Analysis

Skymet Weather Team

The Deep Depression over the Arabian sea has intensified into 'Cyclone Kyarr'. However, there is no severe threat to the Indian Coast as the Cyclonic Storm would keep moving west/northwestwards away from the coast towards Oman. There are also chances that the system would intensify into a Severe Cyclone by tonight and later into a Very Severe Cyclonic Storm by October 26.

According to our meteorologists, although the Cyclone would not impact the Indian Coast much, its movement could give moderate to heavy rain in parts of Karnataka today.

There may be a ‘Yellow alert- like situation’ considering the chances of heavy showers in parts during the next 24 hours. Thus, Karnataka State Natural Calamity Monitoring Centre has requested the residents to be cautious and fishermen have been advised against venturing into the sea.

By tomorrow, as the system would move further away from the coast, the intensity would start decreasing and only light to moderate rains are predicted thereafter until October 28.

On October 29 and 30, a slight increase in the rainfall activities is expected, however, intense or heavy showers are ruled out.
