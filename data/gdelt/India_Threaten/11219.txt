Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed the armed forces to continue to be vigilant, the government has said. The news comes after Mr Khan said he would fight India's decision to revoke Indian-administered Kashmir's autonomy, including at the UN Security Council. He said this was in breach of international law and added that he feared ethnic cleansing by India.

Mr Khan told parliament on Tuesday: "Through the United Nations Security Council, we are studying it now, we will raise it in General Assembly.

"We will talk to heads of States at every forum... we will raise it in the media and tell the world,"

A spokesman for India's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

But Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi told the BBC: "India is playing a dangerous game which will have serious consequences for regional peace and stability."
