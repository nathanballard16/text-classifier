New Delhi: Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla on Tuesday pulled up all Members of Parliament who were missing from the lower house during discussions on pollution, among other key issues.

The absence of key Parliamentarians in meetings where a critical issue like pollution is brought up has left a sour taste in the BJP ranks, the last such incident being on November 15 when a Parliamentary panel was supposed to meet to address the issue.

The Lok Sabha Speaker also warned the Members of Parliament to make sure that such a thing is not repeated ever.

The head of the panel, that was to discuss the pollution matter, BJP MP Jagdambika Pal had earlier written to Birla regarding the matter and expressed his “displeasure” over the absence of senior officials in the government, since they were supposed to brief parliamentarians on the pollution issue, especially in the Delhi-National Capital Region.

Though the issue was raised multiple times, three out of the seven BJP MPs from Delhi, including Ramesh Bidhuri and Hans Raj Hans, skipped the Parliament debate, while Union Minister Harsh Vardhan was in the Rajya Sabha to speak on the Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2019.

When asked about the photograph he shared on social media with Union Minister Kiran Rijiju on the latter’s birthday, and that if he had skipped the parliamentary debate because of that, Delhi BJP chief and MP Manoj Tiwari said, “The picture was taken last night. We celebrated the birthday of Kiran Rijiju ji. Should we not do that also?”
