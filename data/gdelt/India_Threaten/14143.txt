Discom losses to have adverse impact on state government finances: RBI

The Reserve Bank has warned about the risks to debt sustainability of state governments that could arise from losses of Distribution Companies -DISCOMs and from potential invocation of guarantees. Outstanding debt of states have risen over the last five years to 25 per cent of GDP, posing medium term challenges to its sustainability, the central bank in its latest report on state government finances.Revenue generation holds the key to prudent debt management - improving tax buoyancy by capitalising on technology enabled efficiency gains under the GST architecture, and raising user charges, wherever possible, should bolster revenue raising capacity.Given the role state governments play in the country's growth story, the report highlighted that it is important for states to pursue their capital expenditure plans as budgeted in 2019-20, considering that states account for two thirds of general government capital expenditure with implications for overall economic activity and welfare.The report advises state governments that they must not compromise on their social and capital expenditures as they have profound macroeconomic and social implications as evident in the slowdown in economic activity in India which is leading and coincident with the cutback in spending by states.States have to balance aspirational policy choices against two major operating constraints: generating adequate revenue within the Legislative Framework and adhering to Fiscal Responsibility Legislations (FRLs). Prudent fiscal housekeeping has to be, therefore, balanced with developmental and sustainability perspectives. Key to an optimal mix is states’ own revenue generation capacity coupled with adequate support from federal transfers so that the states can absorb exogenous fiscal shocks in the form of schemes like farm loan waivers, the UDAY, farmer income support schemes and structural reforms such as the Goods and Services Tax (GST), without sacrificing the hard-earned gains of fiscal consolidation so that their finances remain sustainable over the medium-term.For 2019-20, states have budgeted a consolidated gross fiscal deficit or GFD of 2.6 per cent of gross domestic product or GDP. States’ GFD has remained within the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act or FRBM threshold of 3 per cent of GDP during 2017-18 and 2018-19.
