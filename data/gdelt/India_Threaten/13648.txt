Something once equivalent of a do-it-yourself kit was enough to blow up half of Saudi Arabia’s crude oil output on September 14. The 18 low-cost drones (along with cruise missiles), supposedly deployed by Houthi rebels in Yemen to attack the Saudi oil facilities, caused oil prices to jump more than 10 per cent in a day.In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles ( UAV ) or drones that used to improve our daily lives with logistics and mapping support can now be programmed to destroy things remotely. What makes them lethal and effective for warfare are advancements in video-camera techniques, precision operations with improved GPS, stealth operations and faster speed. In fact, capability improvements can be seen from India’s own drone procurement and manufacturing.Back in the 1990s, the Indian Army bought Israeli drones for recce and surveillance. But this year, an order was placed for more than 50 Harop attack drones from Israel. Meanwhile, state-run Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and a clutch of private Indian companies are making drones and developing UAV technologies.The software is like an auto pilot linked to onboard motors, propellers, payload activators and weaponsSecurity, surveillance, attackMach* 0.18 (222 kmph)-Mach 1 (1,234 kmph)*Ratio of a drone’s speed to speed of soundRs 50 lakh+Lithium polymer batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, jet fuelCompanies are developing hypersonic weapons — missiles that can dodge air defence system by flying up to five times faster than sound. Thus, combat drones moving at hypersonic speeds (beyond Mach 5) could bypass detection systems making them more lethalIndia has a fleet of around 100 drones and it plans to add 54 Harop attack drones from Israel to enhance unmanned warfare capability. These drones have electro-optical sensors to loiter over high-value military targets like surveillance bases and radar stations before attacking them.DRDO is developing MALE drones that can travel at 200 kmph and fly at altitudes of 6,000-10,000 feetCan fly up to an altitude of 30,000 feet and travel over 200 kmCan go beyond 30,000 feet and has a range of a few thousand$886 million$21 billion$100 billion50,000>50
