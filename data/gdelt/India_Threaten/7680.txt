Mumbai: Posing the tiffin carriers as a security threat, schools in South Mumbai have barred dabbawallahs from delivering tiffin to students. Meanwhile, some parents fear that their child's health will be affected by the food from outside, or sharing tiffin that does not suit their taste or religious ideology.

Reportedly, the tiffin suppliers claimed that approximately 50 per cent of all schools across the city, mainly convents have stopped dabbawallahs entry. At a point of time, they were supplying one lakh tiffin to schools and now the number has dropped to 20,000.

According to a report in the Times of India, while the volumes have been dropping over a period of two or three years, consignments have fallen to drastically lower levels in this summer. This has caused resentment among the Dabbawallahs Association to issue a press note.

Subhash Talekar while promoting the association told TOI that on the one hand, schools are banning junk food while and promoting home cooked healthy food and on the other hand they are forcing children to buy school canteen.

The TOI report further mentioned Medge and Talekar both term this ban a moneymaking scam by the school-appointed canteen contractors. They added, Contractors, are in league with school principals to share profits with them.

Meanwhile, Fr Anthony Fernandes of St. Teresa's school, Girgaum, told TOI that the convents timings had been reduced to five hours and the students were back home in time for lunch. Meanwhile, parents whose children are studying in the convents told TOI that nowadays given the security situation, it is understandable how schools do not wish to allow dabbawallahs inside the school premises. They also alleged that these dabbawallahs do not carry identification proofs.
