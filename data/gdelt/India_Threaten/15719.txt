From social media monitoring to imposition of the National Security Act (NSA) against troublemakers, officials in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar are gearing up to maintain peace in the region ahead of the Supreme Court’s Ayodhya verdict, which is expected before November 17.

District officials have issued directives with regard to posts on social media and other platforms in order to maintain law and order. According to police, 50 potential troublemakers have been identified through social media presence. “If an inflammatory post is forwarded on a WhatsApp group, everyone on the chain, including the admin, is liable for action under the Gangsters Act. If anyone tries to disturb peace in this regard, the administration will also look to impose the NSA and the accused could face prison up to one year,” said B N Singh, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate.

Meanwhile, police in Gautam Budh Nagar are holding peace meetings in various villages with representatives from different communities. In Ghaziabad, police have issued directions to WhatsApp group administrators, warning them of strict action if inappropriate comments are made. “We are asking admins of WhatsApp groups to change their settings where only they can send messages. If any objectionable content is found, action will be taken against the admin as well,” said SP City Ghaziabad Manish Mishra.
