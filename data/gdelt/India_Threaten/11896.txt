Announcing himself as chief ministerial candidate irrespective of whether or not he stays in Congress, Hooda declared that he shall fight the “battle of the people of Haryana”, seeking support of all 36 biradaris (communities) of the state. The Vidhan Sabha polls are scheduled in October.

“There is one chief minister and I shall have four deputy chief ministers. One will be from Backward Class, one shall be from Dalit community, one shall be from Brahmin community and there can be a fourth one too from another community,” Hooda said, adding that he shall also ensure that people from Backward Classes get due representation in ticket distribution for the upcoming Vidhan Sabha polls.
