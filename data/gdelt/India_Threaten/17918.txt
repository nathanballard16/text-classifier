‘Mardaani 2’ intends to make the country aware of threats to women from underage criminals

“‘Mardaani 2’ is a reflection of society and the times that we live in…Our intention was to make India aware of the new and growing threat that women and girls face from underage criminals, who are resorting to such violent crimes,” said actress Rani Mukerji after the success of her latest release “Mardaani 2”.

“If ‘Mardaani 2’ is making people sit up and take notice of the situation, our job is done,” she added.

The actress hopes that her character in the film, Shivani Shivaji Roy that stands for women empowerment and against gender inequality, inspires others to do the right thing and be self-reliant.
