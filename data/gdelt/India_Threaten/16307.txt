VIJAYAWADA: Once again, the district administration had set a deadline for the completion of the long pending Kanaka Durga flyover (elevated six-lane corridor) in the city, commissioned in December 2015 at an estimated cost of Rs 447 crore.

As per the new deadline, the project is likely to be completed by January 31, 2020. In June, the government said that the project would become operational by January 1 but due to various reasons the deadline has been extended.
