At UN, Pakistan warns Islamic heritage in India being wiped out by ruling BJP's "Hindutva" ideology

Pakistan has welcomed a unanimously passed resolution by the UN General Assembly's Third Committee, calling for promotion and protection of human rights of persons belonging to minorities.

Second Secretary at Pakistan Mission to the UN, Qasim Aziz in his remarks drew the international community's attention towards the plight of Muslims in India, who are facing an existential threat due to the ruling BJP's anti-minorities policies.

Referring to the current crisis in occupied Kashmir, he said the abrogation of Article 35A and 370 of Indian Constitution was clearly aimed at changing demography of the disputed state, to turn the indigenous Muslim majority population into a minority.

He said the current human rights and humanitarian crisis in occupied Kashmir could lead to forced displacement of its Muslim population and render them stateless.

The Pakistani delegate said the recent report of the Special Rapporteur on minority issues has also deplored the treatment of millions of Muslims in Assam, who face the threat of being deemed 'foreigners' and treated as non-citizens.

Qasim Aziz also warned the committee that the Islamic heritage in India is being wiped out in pursuance of the ruling BJP party's “Hindutva” ideology.
