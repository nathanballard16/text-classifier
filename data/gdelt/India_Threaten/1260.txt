HC warns judicial staff against joining strike

Disciplinary action against those who do

The Madras High Court on Monday warned members of the Tamil Nadu Judicial Employees’ Association (TNJEA) that they will face disciplinary proceedings if they go ahead with their plan to join the ongoing strike by the Joint Action Council of Tamil Nadu Teachers’ Organisations and Government Employees’ Organisations (Jactto-Geo) on Tuesday.

The president as well as the general secretary of the TNJEA had written to the High Court on Monday, intimating it of their decision to join the strike. Immediately, the matter was taken to the notice of Chief Justice Vijaya Kamlesh Tahilramani, who directed Registrar General C. Kumarappan to issue a warning against any such endeavour.

Accordingly, the Registrar General issued an official memorandum instructing all Principal District Judges, District Judges and heads of units of the subordinate courts to ensure non-participation of officers and staff members of the subordinate judiciary in the indefinite strike by warning them of disciplinary proceedings.
