I don’t mind contesting from Udupi-Chikkamagaluru: Pramod Madhwaraj

Congress leader says JD(S) approached him to be coalition candidate

‘If both parties agree, the candidate will be a Congressman fighting under JD(S) symbol. I will be the coalition candidate in its purest sense,” said Pramod Madhwaraj, former Minister and Congress leader, on Monday.

Mr. Madhwaraj told The Hindu that he had met Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy in Bengaluru, where the proposal of fighting as a coalition candidate from Udupi-Chikkamagaluru parliamentary seat was mooted. He later spoke on the phone to the former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on the issue.

“I have told them the proposal would require clearance from JD(S) workers and also from Congress leaders. If both parties agree, I don’t mind contesting,” he said. “If my candidature gets the nod of both the parties, there would be a joint campaign by both parties,” he said.

Shobha Karandlaje, senior BJP leader, had won the Udupi-Chikkamagaluru seat in 2014 LS polls by a margin of 1.81 lakh, defeating the then Congress candidate, K. Jayaprakash Hegde. Mr. Hegde has since joined the BJP and is an aspirant for the seat from the BJP, along with Ms. Karandlaje
