Some trying to trigger riots: NCM

In the backdrop of the clashes and protests over the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple, the national commission for minorities has written to home minister Rajnath Singh calling for action in the wake of "deliberate attempts" to trigger communal riots in Kerala by "some political parties". The letter written on Tuesday, coincidentally, came on a day when PM Modi was in Kerala. NCM vice-chairman George Kurian has called for extreme caution on part of the "three pillars of democracy" while taking any decision on the prevailing situation in the state.In his letter, Kurain warns that "Kerala is sitting on a communal tinderbox". He has further stated that "there have been clear attempts by political parties to vitiate the body polity of the state by using religion to polarise the society on communal lines over the last three decades".
