Shame: ‘Lunch time’ cites Doctor, patient forced to give birth on street

Davanagere: Refusing to attend a pregnant woman in labor has forced her to give birth to a girl on the busy street in a village in Chitradurga District.

Duty doctor and the nurse refused 30-year-old Gangamalamma in labour citing lunchtime. The incident is reported from Chitrahalli village of Holalkere taluk, about 240km from Bengaluru, TOI reports.

A group of women rushed to the woman’s help and hastily stitched sarees to cover the woman on the busy road.

The drama unfolded on Monday when Chowdappa rushed wife Gangamalamma to the health center after she complained of severe stomach pain.

Recalling the incident, the husband Chowdappa says he rushed his wife to the health center after she complained of severe stomach pain.

“We reached the center around 11 am, but doctors kept us waiting till noon. Later, a duty doctor and a nurse asked us to go home, saying it was lunchtime,” Chowdappa alleged.

An inquiry into the matter was launched by the District health officer Dr Niraj Patil regarding the lapses at the village health center and promised action against the doctor identified as Mohammed, currently on contract.

“We’ll submit a report to the deputy commissioner on Wednesday,” the officer added.
