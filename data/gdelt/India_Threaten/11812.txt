TDP Leaders Trying To Deflect Gaze From Chandrababu’s Illegal Residence

Senior YSR Congress Party leader K. Parthasarathi criticised TDP leaders for politicising the issue of flood waters entering Chandrababu Naidu's illegal residence in Lingamaneni Guest House on the banks of river Krishna.

With the river overflowing its banks near the Prakasam barrage, water entered the illegal construction which was being rented by Chandrababu Naidu. YSR Congress party leaders had cautioned the TDP supremo on this count, he pointed out.

Their apprehensions were borne out by overflowing river water and instead of viewing things from a proper perspective, the TDP leaders saw them through a narrow political prism. This was unfortunate, Parthasarathi said, adding that the TDP leaders were trying to cover up the illegal nature of construction by the riverbed in violation of all rules.

The senior YSR Congress Party leader said that to divert the attention of the people from the truth of flood water entering the TDP chief's house, his party leaders were enacting all kinds of dramas in the name of a drone camera taking pictures of his house.

Moreover, Chandrababu fled to Hyderabad knowing that flood water would enter his house here, the YSRCP leader said. Instead of standing by people in this hour of need as the Leader of Opposition, Chandrababu is sitting in the cool comfort of Hyderabad hidden from the fury of the flood-affected areas. Is this what his 40 years of experience which he brags about, has taught him, Parthasarathi questioned.
