India orders end to assaults on Kashmiris

The Supreme Court acted on a petition filed by lawyers Colin Gansalves and Tariq Adeeb saying that Kashmiri students had to lock themselves up in several cities and towns to escape mob violence after the February 14 attack.

The attack in the Muslim-majority Kashmir Valley has raised tensions elsewhere in Hindu-majority India, where Kashmiri Muslims in many cities are increasingly facing a backlash in the form of attacks mainly on students, job suspensions and eviction from rented apartments.

India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday promised to take steps to ensure their safety and security.

India's autonomous National Human Right Commission also sought reports from troubled states about the ill-treatment of Kashmiris.

"Such kind of violence by the people against their fellow countrymen cannot be accepted in a civilised society," it said.

Last Sunday, shops and businesses were shut in the Kashmir Valley with several students and unions protesting attacks on fellow Kashmiris.

Most Kashmiris support rebel demands that their territory be united either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country, while also participating in civilian street protests against Indian control.
