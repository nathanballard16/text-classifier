‘TDP will vote against CAB’- N Chandrababu Naidu

A CORRESPONDENT

NEW DELHI: Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday extended his support in opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill (CAB) in the Rajya Sabha.

“The Bill goes against the interest of the indigenous people of Assam and Northeast. We will stand against the Bill,” said Naidu here.

The Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister who has been staging a dharna programme in New Delhi demanding special status to Andhra Pradesh has accused the BJP government of playing “communal politics.”

“We have seen what has happened in Punjab and Jammu & Kashmir. We don’t want the same to be repeated in Northeast,” said Naidu, adding: “Our party will vote against the controversial Bill.”

Chandrababu Naidu’s Telegu Desam Party (TDP) has six members in the Rajya Sabha.

Meanwhile, Congress is determined that they will oppose the Bill at any cost.

“We are firm on our stand. We will never allow the Government to bring the anti-people Bill. It goes against the interest and sentiments of the people of Assam,” said Assam Pradesh Congress Committee (APCC) president Ripun Bora.

Meanwhile, a NESO delegation called on Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad A Sangam and discussed strategies to oppose the Bill.

Sangma has already said that “if the Government brings the Bill in the Rajya Sabha, the National People’s Party (NPP) will walk out of the NDA alliance.”
