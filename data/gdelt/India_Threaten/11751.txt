Terrorism is war against humanity, India's policy on it is clear: PM Modi

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday addressed the nation on the occasion of country's 73rd Independence Day. Without naming Pakistan directly, the prime minister slammed the countries who are supporting terror.

During his speech from the rampart of Red Fort today, PM Modi said that India's policy on countries sponsoring terror is clear.

"For world peace, India has to play its role. India can't be a mute spectator and India is strongly fighting against those who are supporting terror," he said.

"Terrorism is a war against humanity and that is why the world needs to speak in one voice against those who support, promote and export terror. India will play its role to fight against those who are exporting terror," the prime minister added.

India, at various international forums, has been highlighting Islamabad's support to terror groups. Pakistan has been facing the heat especially with anti-terror financing bodies like the FATF or the Financial Action Task Force where it faces a blacklisting.

PM Modi also mentioned Sri Lanka Easter day terror attacks that killed more than 100 people. "Some people have targeted our neighbours like Bangladesh, Afghanistan and in Sri Lanka people where people were killed in church... our policy against those who spread terror is clear," he said.

PM Modi had visited St Anthony's church, one the locations of the April terror attacks, during his visit to Sri Lanka in June. He was the first world leader to visit the location and pay homage to those who died in the attacks. The attacks were claimed by an Islamic State-inspired group.
