New Delhi, September 3

Union Home Minister Amit Shah today assured a panchayat delegation from Jammu and Kashmir that those vulnerable to threats from terrorists would get police protection and an insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh each.

Noting that the demand for increasing the honorarium of panch and sarpanch would be considered too, the Home Minister, who met 20 representatives, said at least five youth from each village of the state, reorganised into two UTs recently, would be given government jobs soon.

“We requested the Home Minister to provide us security and he agreed,” said Mir Junaid, a sarpanch from Kupwara. But officials later clarified that security would only be provided after assessing the threat perception. The visiting members claimed Shah assured them of restoration of mobile phone services in 15-20 days. “He told us that J&K statehood, as promised in Parliament, will be restored once situation becomes normal,” said one of the members.

Union Minister for PMO Jitendra Singh said a new leadership, free from dynastic links, was emerging at the grassroots and they were happy about abrogation of special status as Central funds would reach them directly now. — TNS
