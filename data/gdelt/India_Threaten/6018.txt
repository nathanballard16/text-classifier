BJP will never allow two PM’s in India, says Amit Shah

Srinagar: Following National Conference Vice-President and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah’s claim of restoring Prime Minister and President to the state, Bhartiya Janta Party’s President Amit Shah said that as long as the BJP exists, Kashmir is an integral part of India.

Mr. Shah’s remarks came in a poll rally in Tasgaon in western Maharashtra, over Abdullah’s recent suggestion of having a separate prime minister for Kashmir.

“No one can take away Kashmir from us. As long as the BJP exists, Kashmir will continue to be an integral part of India,” Mr. Shah said. He added that their party will never allow two prime ministers in India.

He further said that the opposition Congress party wants to separate Kashmir from India.

Earlier, Mr. Abdullah has said that Jammu and Kashmir bargained for a separate Prime Minister and President and hopefully they would have it. His statement has also drawn a strong response from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who demanded during a series of poll rallies that the Congress explain its ally’s comment.

He also said that India is the land of Shivaji Maharaj and its security is responsibility of every individual.
