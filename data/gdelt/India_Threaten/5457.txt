SP-BSP-RLD alliance will win provided BJP doesn't tamper with EVM, says Mayawati in Deoband

Lucknow:

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati on Sunday launched a scathing attack on Prime Minister Narendra saying the voters will put an end to 'drama of chowkidari'. "Gathbandhan is winning and the BJP is going, provided they (BJP) don't tamper with the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs)," she said, adding that the voters would end the "drama of chowkidari".Â

Mayawati, while addressing her first joint rally along with Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav, said that Modi government has not fulfilled even one-fourth of the promises that he made before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to the women, farmers, labourers and everyone in the country.Â

Slamming PM Modi for making false promises, Mayawati said that clearance of dues of sugarcane farmers remains unfulfilled.

She also criticisedÂ the BJP-led-Yogi government and said the voters need to show him the door too. "Removing Modi is not enough, Yogi also needs to be shown the door, Mayawati said at the rally in Deoband," Mayawati said in Deoband.Â Â

Targetting the Congress, Mayawati said that the grand old party is not capable of defeating the BJP and therefore voters should vote for the SP-BSP-RLD alliance. The BSP leader said that her party never issued election manifestos as she believed in talking less and delivering more.Â

Mayawati, in Saharanpur's Deoband: I'm warning, especially people of Muslim community, that Congress isn't in a position to fight BJP in UP. Only 'gathbandhan' can fight BJP. Congress knows this but they're going by mantra 'Hum jeete ya na jeete, gathbandhan nahi jeetna chahiye'. pic.twitter.com/m22IHKsN62 â€” ANI UP (@ANINewsUP) April 7, 2019

"Don't get divided, vote en masse for gathbandhan. We have BSP vote in every seat, SP is also mobilised. If Muslims want BJP to lose, they have to stand firmly behind Gathbandhan," the BSP chief said.

The Prime Minister had also failed to protect the borders, she added, citing increasing instances of terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir in particular.Â

With a large number of people in the rally being Muslims, she asked the minorities to vote en bloc for the BSP-SP-RLD alliance after accusing the Congress of trying to split the anti-BJP votes.

"If Muslims want BJP to lose, they have to stand firmly behind Gathbandhan."

The SP and the BSP, which announced their alliance in January, will contest on 37 and 38 seats respectively. The RLD will fight on three seats. The alliance has decided not to field candidates from Rae Bareli and Amethi, the constituencies held by Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi.

Yadav, Mayawati and RLD's Ajit Singh will address 11 joint rallies between April 7 and May 16, a spokesperson said. After Deoband, rallies will be held in Badaun, Agra, Mainpuri, Rampur, Firozabad, Kannauj, Faizabad, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur and Varanasi. In Mainpuri, the SP has fielded Mulayam Singh Yadav, while Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple Yadav is contesting from Kannauj.
