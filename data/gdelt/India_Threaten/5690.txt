Worst day as a citizen, top Apollo exec Shobana Kamineni says after vote deleted

An angry Shobana Kamineni, a top executive at Apollo Hospitals, said on Thursday she had returned from a trip abroad to learn that her vote had been deleted.

"This is the worst day for me as an Indian citizen," she said in a video posted by The Hindu newspaper.

"I come to the booth, and I'm told that my vote is deleted. Am I not an Indian citizen? Am I not counted in this country?"

"This is a crime against me as a citizen and I will not tolerate it," said Kamineni, the executive vice-chairperson of Apollo Hospitals Enterprise Limited and a Hyderabad voter.

Shobana Kamineni said she had voted in the Telangana assembly election in November. "I feel cheated today."

The New Indian Express reports, citing officials, that Kamineni had two EPIC cards since September in 2017, and "both the entries were deleted in the first week of March" by mistake.

They had been found in a "recent data purification process", the newspaper said.
