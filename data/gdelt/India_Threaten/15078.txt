Mumbai: Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) on Tuesday wrote a threatening letter to cinema theatre owners in Maharashtra warning them against ignoring Marathi films and giving preferential treatment to Hindi films. This has come a couple of weeks after several MNS activists visited theatre owners for not giving screen time to a Marathi film in favour of Akshay Kumar's 'Housefull 4'.

According to reports, the letter to cinema theatre owners read: "Don't forget that you have your cinema halls on the land of Maharashtra. So, you cannot afford to ignore Marathi films."

Earlier on October 7, MNS activists had met with hall owners in Mumbai after Marathi film 'Hirakani' struggled to find theatre screens in Maharashtra in the wake of Housefull 4's release.

The activists had warned the theatre owners that they either give an adequate number of screens to the Marathi film or face the consequences.

However, this is not the first time MNS, a political party led by Raj Thackeray, has locked horns with cinema hall owners. Last year in June, MNS workers had thrashed a movie theatre manager in Pune over high prices of food items inside a movie theatre.

The entire incident was caught on cam in which the MNS workers could be seen holding the theatre management to ransom and hitting an employee of the movie theatre.
