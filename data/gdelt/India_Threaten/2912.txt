International community rejects Indian policy to involve Pakistan in Pulwama incident:

Syed Yousaf Naseem (Hurriyet Leader):

Whatever Indian government and its forces are doing in Held Kashmir was expected. Indian policy to involve Pakistan in Pulwama incident has been rejected by international community as India could not provide a single evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in Pulwama attack. The policies of Narendra Modi have been criticized by Indian politicians as well. The freedom fighters of Kashmiris will never step back from their demand for just right to self-determination. Narendra Modi after being failed to pressurize Pakistan has adopted a flexible attitude. It is my perception that BJP will be badly defeated in upcoming elections. According to Indian constitution Indian citizens from other states cannot purchase land or even could not compete in elections in Held Kashmir. Pakistan's military warned India against any misadventure as it is capable of responding to any threats as tensions continue to simmer between the countries.
