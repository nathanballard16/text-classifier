New Delhi: Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said no middlemen were allowed into the corridors of South Block since 2014 in defence purchases done by Manohar Parrikar and Arun Jaitley. Attacking the Congress for calling Chief of Air Force Birender Singh Dhanoa a liar for saying that Rafale is a good aircraft, Sitharaman added that he didn't say this because he loves PM Modi or he likes BJP.

“He knows that Rafale is a damn good aircraft and that is his job as the head of the Indian Air Force,” she further said.

On Congress’ intention to sabotage the Rafale procurement even now the defence minister said it will be a great disservice to the nation.

Sitharaman’s comment comes after Mallikarjun Kharge said that Rafale will be one of the main issues raised by Congress president Rahul Gandhi in the budget session.

Meanwhile, BJP national spokesperson Syed Shahnawaz Hussain said the Congress is raking the Rafale issue because alleged AgustaWestland middleman Christen Michel has opened can of worms on the VVIP chopper scam. Hussain said that despite the fact that Defence Minister and Finance Minister gave their clarification on the fighter jet deal for hours in Parliament Gandhi is still raising the issue.

Hussain further added that Congress is raking up the Rafale issue as they want to distract people from the real issues like VVIP chopper scam. He further claimed that the Congress made a doctored tape in Goa and said that it is a party of frauds.
