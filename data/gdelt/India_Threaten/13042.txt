Govt to buy apples directly from J&K farmers, use DBT

NEW DELHI: Apples produced in Jammu and Kashmir this season will be procured directly from local farmers by government-run Nafed and payments will be made through direct benefit transfer (DBT).Announcing the new apple procurement scheme for J&K, the government on Tuesday said Nafed would complete the procurement process through designated state government agencies by December 15.The scheme follows a meeting between home minister Amit Shah and representatives of fruit growers from J&K here last week. The representatives had expressed concern over the possibility of unsold and wasted produce, citing threats from terrorists not to sell it in the market in the wake of dilution of Article 370 Shah had reassured the apple growers that the government was in touch with agencies concerned to resolve the issue, and noted that with dilution of Article 370, benefits of schemes like PM Fasal Bima Yojana would reach farmers of J&K.Under the new apple procurement scheme, procurement will be made directly from genuine apple growers of J&K. The state government will make direct payment in the bank account of the apple grower through DBT.All categories of apples — classified as A, B and C — will be procured from the apple-producing districts of the state as well as designated mandis in Sopore , Shopian and Srinagar.Fair prices for various categories of apples will be fixed by the price committee that comprises a representative from the National Horticulture Board. The quality committee will grade the varieties of apples.The implementation and coordination committee for the procurement scheme at the state level will be chaired by the chief secretary, while the ministries of agriculture and home affairs along with other central agencies will oversee its implementation.National security advisor Ajit Doval had said on Saturday that 750 trucks carrying apples left the Kashmir Valley every day for trade in other parts of the country.Following diktats of Pakistan-based handlers to disrupt trading of fruits, two militants had last Friday attacked family members of a prominent fruit merchant in Sopore, injuring his 25-year-old son and two-and-a-half-year-old granddaughter.
