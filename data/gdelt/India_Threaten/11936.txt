CPI flays arrest of party worker

‘We will take all steps to counter case’

Communist Party of India (CPI) Ernakulam district secretary P. Raju on Monday reacted strongly to the arrest of a CPI worker from Vazhakulam, near here, in connection with an attack on the police during a Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police office march taken out by CPI activists on July 23. He said the arrest was a vindictive act by the police.

He said it was in fact a counter case against the government action in placing the sub-inspector (SI) of the Ernakulam Central police station Vibin Das under suspension in connection with the caning of the CPI workers.

He said the arrest of CPI Vazhakulam local committee member Anzar Ali by the Crime Branch was illegal as the police had not adhered to the required procedure.

‘Workers not at fault’

No party worker had attacked either the Assistant Police Commissioner (ACP) or any other police personnel. No party worker could be arrested on the basis of a statement given by the suspended SI. In fact, it was the SI who had assaulted the party workers, he alleged.

Mr. Raju said that the party would take all legal and political steps to counter the false case against the party worker. The CPI workers were caned as they took out a march to the DIG office seeking action against the Njarackal SI who had allegedly taken a biased stand in a case relating to a clash between All India Students Federation and Students Federation of India activists. Muvattupuzha MLA Eldho Abraham and CPI workers and police personnel were injured during the melee.

Action sought

The CPI Ernakulam district unit had demanded action against Assistant Commissioner of Police K. Lalji and Kochi Central SI Vipin Das in connection with the police action. The SI was suspended by DIG and Kochi Additional City Police Commissioner K.P. Philip on grounds of lack of adequate caution on his part, leading to the MLA and others sustaining injuries.
