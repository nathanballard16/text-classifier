A few parts of India including Ahmedabad, Kochi, Kozhikode, Chennai and Bhuvaneshwar witnessed the last solar eclipse of the decade. The solar eclipse that took place on December 26, 2019, was also viewed from Dubai. Here are the images of the last solar eclipse of 2019.

Captured on the lens, Prime Minister Narendra Modi was seen watching a live feed of the solar eclipse from Kozhikode. Delhi’s winter fog prevented a clear view of the eclipse, hence the live feed. Similar to Delhi many other states of India also missed out this eclipse.
