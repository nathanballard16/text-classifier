Protestors torched two police booths near Gandhi Maidan and also set over a dozen motorcycles on fire forcing the administration to use force to control the angry mob. A shop near Mona cinema was also burnt and it took over two hours for the fire department to douse the flame and stop it from spreading to adjacent shops in the area.

Police used water cannon, tear gas, and lathi charge to disperse the crowd that left many protestors and cops injured requiring immediate medical attention.

Eyewitnesses said many of the motorcycles owned by press reporters also became the target of the arsonists.

Among those injured in the fierce brick-batting included Gandhi Maidan police station in-charge Sunil Kumar Singh, Town DSP Suresh Prasad and over two dozen protestors and by-standers.

The riot soon spread in other parts of the state capital as police resorted to lathi-charge and lob tear gas in Sabzi Bagh area where protestors had set some shops on fire.

Sanjay Singh (IG-Range) said the protestors had come prepared with petrol to set fire on vehicles and other private and government properties.

"We have identified many people and will be taking proper action against them," he said.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has come out in support of the CAB, is yet to make a statement to the press on this matter.
