Bomb threat on Air India Mumbai-Newark flight a hoax: Airline official

The bomb threat on an Air India passenger flight that made an emergency landing at London Standsted Airport on Thursday, June 27, turned out to be a hoax, reported news agency Reuters. The plane is back in the air, according to an Air India official.

The flight from Mumbai to Newark airport near New York, made an emergency landing at London Stansted Airport following a hoax call received at the Mumbai International Airport.

Flight AI 191 took off from Mumbai International Airport on Thursday morning and was supposed to go to Newark International Airport near New York. According to reports, the flight was taken to an isolated spot at the London Stansted Airport.

An RAF Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon aircraft was launched this morning to intercept the AI aircraft.

"The aircraft was safely escorted to Stansted airport. The Typhoon aircraft were authorised to transit at supersonic speed for operational reasons; any inconvenience caused to local residents is regretted," an RAF spokesman reportedly said.

The Standsted Airport runway was closed off after the emergency landing, but started functioning later.

"An Air India Boeing 777 diverted into London Stansted at approximately 10:15hrs and landed safely with Essex Police in attendance," said a statement by Stansted Airport.

Air India said it will provide updates on the situation.
