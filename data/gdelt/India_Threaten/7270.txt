Senders of letters with bomb threats yet to be traced

TIRUPUR: Police are yet to trace the accused responsible for sending four fake threatening letters to a corporation middle school in the city in the past five months.All four letters were sent by registered post to the Headmistress, Krishnasamy Gounder Puspavathiyammal Memorial Government Middle School, Mannarai. Delivered on January 2, February 5, May 8 and May 9, the letter carried the sender’s name as M Shahul Hameed and Fathima of Mannarai.One of the letters said, “A private recreation club was functioning near Aathupalam in Mannarai, and many sexual offences like the Pollachi sexual assault case have been committed in the club. The police were allegedly conniving with the club and permitting the illegal activities, which were affecting the school and college students.”“If the authorities fail to remove the club, school buildings and government offices will be blown off with bombs,” it said.A senior school education department official said, “We have conducted an enquiry and found that there was no threat to the school children of the Krishnasamy Gounder Puspavathiyammal Memorial Government Middle School. Some people in Mannarai or from nearby areas were trying to create tension. The last two letters have reached the school when the summer holidays had begun. The Bomb Detection and Disposal Squad checked the school campus and confirmed it was a hoax. We did not lodge any complaint since it did not have any impact on the school.”A senior police officer said, “We did not register a case, but we have been conducting investigations to find the culprits behind the letter.”
