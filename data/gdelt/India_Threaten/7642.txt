Indian Army Warns Pakistan Against Any Misadventure Along the Border

He also slammed Pakistan, accusing it of indulging in a proxy war with their cross border mischiefs. "The security situation in Jammu & Kashmir is under control. Across the Line of Control, Pakistan has continued with its activities which are mainly anti-India. With promoting cross border infiltration, ceasefire violations, drug-trafficking, narcotics and circulation of fake Indian currency, they are working towards ensuring that the proxy war by them against India continues."

"But I must assure you that our efforts to thwart each of these actions by them are in place and Pakistan is not able to succeed in their designs," he added.

Pakistan has time and again denied the allegations by India of waging a proxy war, terming them baseless.

Lieutenant General Ranbir Singh further asserted that the check on militancy in Jammu and Kashmir was vindicated by the fact that the Indian Parliamentary elections in the region, were held in a largely peaceful manner with no serious mishappening.

"There wasn't any major violence during this period. While we have been able to ensure peaceful elections, we have continued with our effort towards neutralisation of terrorists based on very hard specific intelligence that led to surgical operations (against militants)."
