Illegal detention of JKML chairman, others denounced

Srinagar, April 01, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the Jammu and Kashmir Muslim League (JKML) has denounced the illegal detention of party Chairman, Masarrat Aalam Butt and other Hurriyat leaders and activists and described it as the worst kind of political vendetta and human rights violation.

The JKMC General Secretary, Muhammad Rafiq Ganai in a statement issued in Srinagar said the authorities are deliberately prolonging their illegal detention by booking them in fabricated and baseless cases.

He said the unprecedented sacrifices of Kashmiri people for Kashmir cause would not go waste. He said New Delhi cannot silence the voices of Kashmiris through use of brute force. “Suppressing pro-freedom voice and curbing peaceful activities is no bravery but shameful and cunning cowardice,” he added.

He also strongly condemned the slapping of draconian Public Safety Act (PSA) on party leader, Muhammad Akram Najar and termed it the worst example of political victimization. Muhammad Rafiq Ganai said the oppressive measures will further strengthen the Kashmiris’ resolve to fight for the resolution of Kashmir dispute. Delhi by displaying the might cannot weaken the freedom sentiment of the people of Kashmir.

He deplored that Hurriyat leaders including Muhammad Yousuf Mir, Abdul Ahad Parra, Assadullah Parray, Muhammad Akram Najar, Bashir Ahmad Budgami, Showkat Hakeem, Merajuddin Nanda, Sajad Molvi, Muhammad Hayat Butt and Muhammad Yousuf Butt had been languishing in different jails of the territory.
