Raj Thackeray warns govt against 'turning forts into hotels'

Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray on Saturday warned the Maharashtra government against pursuing its plan to convert some of the forts in the state into 'heritage hotels'.

The state tourism department's plan to promote tourism on forts which are not in the protected list of the Archaeological Survey of India has come under fire from opposition leaders.

Addressing party workers at Dombivali in Thane district, Thackeray said the government "should not even touch the forts".

"It is stupidity," he said, adding, "The government should rent out the bungalows of ministers for marriage functions if it wants to earn additional income."



Some reports had said on Friday that forts could be rented out for weddings and other events under the policy which is being drafted.

Thackeray said forts in Maharashtra cannot be compared to the forts and palaces in Rajasthan (some of which have been turned into hotels).

Anyone who is aware of Maharashtra's history would not even think of such a plan, the MNS chief said.
