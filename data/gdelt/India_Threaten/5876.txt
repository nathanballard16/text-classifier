Delhi traders threaten to boycott LS polls

The Mayapuri Traders Welfare Association, however, has not formally endorsed the boycott and are waiting for relief from the NGT. “I appeal to everyone from Mayapuri Industrial Area to not waste their vote…. “There are over 50,000 voters from these areas; many of their families work in the Industrial Area. Meanwhile, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) has appealed to people in the West Delhi Constituency to vote. Most of them moved here during the Partition and set up motor vehicle parts shops in Motia Khan until they were asked to shift to Mayapuri Industrial Area in 1975.
