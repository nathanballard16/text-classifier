Vadodara civic body to make fire services smarter

VADODARA: The Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) is planning to equip its fire department with the latest information and communication technology (ICT) systems. The project taken up under the Smart City initiative will have a series of IT interventions as well as facilities like tracking of vehicles and even keeping a track of water in fire tenders The VMC had come up with the plan for ICT-enabled services earlier this year. A vendor has shown interest in taking up the project after initial rounds of unsuccessful tendering. The civic body has made another attempt to identify more bidders for the project, failing which the only interested vendor may be roped in for the project.The VMC is eyeing to integrate caller location tracking, GPS for all fire and emergency vehicles, centralized monitoring of the services from the control room at the Central Command and Control Centre (CCCC). According to sources, VMC was eyeing to have a system where the coordinates of the caller were relayed to the control room. The system would automatically identify the nearest fire tender and fire station so that the response time is brought down significantly.The fire tenders will also have sensors that will monitor water levels in fire tenders to ensure that they have sufficient water while on duty. At the same time, this will ensure that tankers are rushed in time to replenish them when they are fighting a fire and water level reduces.A live video feed will also be relayed by the fire tenders to the control room that will guide them using the feed. The video will also be recorded using network video recorders (NVR). Vadodara Smart City Development Ltd GM and VMC’s IT director Manish Bhatt said that some more vendors had shown interest in the project. “We are hopeful on identifying someone,” he said.
