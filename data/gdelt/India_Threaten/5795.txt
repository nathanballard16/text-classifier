Malaysia's Axiata group renounces shares entitlement

KOLKATA: Malaysia ’s Axiata Group Berhad has renounced its shares entitlement in Vodafone Idea’s ongoing Rs 25,000 crore rights issue in favour of global investors, a move which will bring down its stake in India ’s largest telecom operator to 2.6% from 8.1%.“Axiata has renounced its rights entitlements in favour of investors through transactions on BSE,” a Vodafone Idea spokesperson told ET, adding that investors keen to participate in the telco’s rights issue “have acquired the rights renunciations on the exchange, which shows their interest in VIL and its issue”.A senior Vodafone Idea Limited (VIL) executive said on condition of anonymity that several investors had reached out to bankers and the company, expressing interest in buying rights renunciations, if available.Separately, a person aware of the matter said that Axiata Group’s non-participation won't hurt VIL’s rights issue as the Malaysian telco’s “renounced rights entitlement is learnt to have already been oversubscribed more than three times by global investors, translating into demand worth $1 billion”.ET had reported on April 10 that Axiata Group was likely to skip the VIL rights issue.Till press time, Axiata Group did not reveal the names of the specific investor entities in whose favour it had renounced its rights entitlement.Earlier this week, a spokeswoman of the group had told ET that as financial investors to VIL, the Malaysian telco had no intention of exiting the Indian market at this juncture.VIL’s rights issue opened on Wednesday (April 10) and closes on April 24. The entitlement ratio is 87 equity shares for every 38 held by eligible shareholders as of April 2. The company’s board has priced the rights issue aggressively at Rs 12.50 a share. The company stock ended 1.53% lower at Rs 16.05 on the BSE on Friday.Vodafone Group and the Aditya Birla Group will infuse up to Rs 11,000 crore and Rs 7,250 crore, respectively, via the rights issue. They have also committed to subscribe to part or the whole of any unsubscribed portion.VIL intends to spend Rs 18,674.79 crore out of the Rs 25,000 crore it raises from its rights issue – the largest ever in India – on repaying debt and paying spectrum dues. It will use Rs 6,220 crore for general expenses, according to a regulatory filing with the stock exchanges.The company’s focus will be on profitable districts, ways of reducing operating expenditure and improving average revenue per user, a key performance indicator that plummeted after the entry of Reliance Jio Infocomm in September 2016.VIL’s leadership expects the combination of the rights issue proceeds and monetisation of its 11.15% stake in Indus Towers will allow the company to make the required investments in the telecom business to achieve strategic goals.At present, the telco lags rivals Jio and Bharti Airtel in terms of 4G coverage. It expects to use the funds to pare its over-Rs 1.14 lakh-crore debt and free up cash to invest in expanding its 4G coverage, which is critical in its battle for subscribers.The telecom market leader has been steadily losing users and, as per the latest data from the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, it lost as many as 3.6 million users in January while both Jio and Bharti Airtel gained users during the month.
