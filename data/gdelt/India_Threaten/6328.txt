Miffed With 'Modiji Ki Air Force,' Owaisi Asks, ‘Is PM Running The Nation Or Playing PUBG?’

The election campaign is at its peak in the country, as the politicians want to leave no stone unturned to target their opponents. This time All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen chief Asaduddin Owaisi had the better of BJP campaign strategy when he compared it to popular mobile phone game PUBG.

The firebrand leader, apparently angry with BJP chief Amit Shah's claim the PM Modi “sent his Air Force” to destroy terror camps in Pakistan said that all the national assets do not belong to any particular person, not even the PM.

“Modi’s Army. Modi’s Air Force. Modi’s nuclear ‘cracker’. What used to belong to the nation has become Modi’s in five years,” Owaisi tweeted. “Is he running the country or playing PUBG?” Owaisi was referring to the online multiplayer PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds mobile video game.

Modi ki Sena, Modi ki Air Force, Modi ka nuclear ‘pataka’. 5 saal mein jo sab desh ka tha, wo Modi ka ho gaya

Desh chala rahe the ya PUBG khel rahe the? @PMOIndia https://t.co/1fvTzAZ39h — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) April 22, 2019

He was responding to Amit Shah's claim in which he said, “Forty-four of jawans were martyred [40 were killed] in Pulwama terror attack. Earlier, nothing used to happen after such incidents. Narendra Modi ordered his Air Force on the 13th day [after the incident] and our aircraft blew the terrorists to pieces in Pakistan.”

Mr Owaisi, in his well known witty style lambasted the BJP leaders with his jibe.

The Election Commission, On April 17, had already issued a warning to Union minister for minority affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi for referring to the defence forces as “Modiji ki Sena [Narendra Modi’s Army]” and asked him to be careful in the future.
