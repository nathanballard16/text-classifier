THIS Bollywood heartthrob to rub shoulders with Avengers: Endgame and Thor actor Chris Hemsworth; Find Out

Avengers: Endgame star Chris Hemsworth is stepping out of his Asgard armour and donning the suit for Men In Black: International. And he has his Thor: Ragnarok co-star Tessa Thompson to accompany him in the chase. The actor will leave his Stormbreaker behind for advanced gadgets and fights with aliens in MIBI. While it is an English movie, it was recently revealed that the movie will be dubbed in Hindi for the Indian audience. A recent report revealed that Gully Boy star Siddhant Chaturvedi and Dangal star Sanya Malhotra will be dubbing for Chris and Tessa in the Hindi version.

And now, we learn that Siddhant will be meeting Chris soon. We are so jealous! Siddhant will be interacting with Chris early next week. We hope our on-screen rapper makes Chris rap too. We heart that the idea for their meeting came up after the producers roped in Siddhant to dub for Chris in the movie. We also hear that there are plans of getting the two stars to rap, jam and bond.

Oh man, we cannot wait to see videos from their meet. This wouldn't be the first time Chris would be interacting with someone from India. Chris has already visited India a couple of times. The last time he was in the country, he was shooting for a movie for an online streaming platform. The movie features Pankaj Tripathi and Manoj Bajpai as well.

Coming back to Men In Black: International, the movie is based in London. Secret agents Agent H (Chris Hemsworth) and Agent M (Tessa Thompson) get involved in a series of alien attacks which results in the agents globetrotting. With the help of high-tech weaponry, they set off to battle mischievous aliens on Earth.
