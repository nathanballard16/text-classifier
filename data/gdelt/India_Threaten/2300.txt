Kapil Sharma throws starry tantrums, refuses to click selfies with fans?

Post his comeback on TV, Kapil Sharma has been making news for all the right reasons, from his punctuality on sets, mature behaviour on social media, to his show topping rating charts. The comedian admitted that marriage to Ginni has brought a lot of positive changes in him.

So, recently when Kapil was present at a Mumbai event along with other Bollywood personalities, his fans were in for a rude shock when he declined to pose for pictures and selfies and was rather curt in his refusal, reported DNA.

A guest from the event informed the Mumbai tabloid that Kapil's attutude completely put off the guests who were hopeful of clicking pictures with their favourite comedian.

The source also informed the tabloid that Ranveer Singh, on the other hand, was quite warm and friendly to the guests and his charming personality floored everyone present. Apparently, apart from Kapil, all the other celebs obliged to the fans' request and the comedian was the only one who outrightly refused to get clicked.

Meanwhile, Kapil's show is in the middle of a controversy after comments by Navjot Singh Sidhu on Pulwama terror attack have created a storm on social media. Sidhu has been removed from The Kapil Sharma Show after the outrage after Twitterati demanded boycott of The Kapil Sharma Show. There are reports doing the rounds that he has been replaced by Archana Puran Singh. However, there is no confirmation on Archana being a permanent part of the show. She had said that she shot for only two episodes in Sidhu's absence.
