Lucknow: Even as new details emerge on the murder case of Hindu Samaj Party chief Kamlesh Tiwari, a Shiv Sena leader has announced a reward of Rs 1 crore for the heads of Tiwari’s killers. Shiv Sena leader Arun Pathak made the announcement in a social media post on Saturday.

In the video, Pathak condoned of his “brother” Tiwari’s death saying the police might have caught the assailants but he will be relieved when “their throats will be slit”.

Earlier Uttar Pradesh Director General of Police (DGP) OP Singh earlier today announced they apprehended three persons in connection with the criminal case. The leader of the fringe organisation affiliated to Hindu Mahasabha was shot dead his Khurshed Bagh residence in the state capital on Friday afternoon.

Tiwari’s killers entered his residence, sat and had tea with Tiwari and later sprayed the leader with bullets. The attackers, who had donned saffron attires, had entered Hindu Samaj Party chief’s office on the pretext of giving him a box of sweets in which the firearm was hidden.

OP Singh while addressing the media announced, "A joint team of UP and Gujarat Police has detained Maulana Mohsin Sheikh Salim (24), Faizan (21) and Khurshid Ahmed Pathan (23) and is interrogating them in Gujarat."

Earlier in the day UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath vowed to bring the Tiwari’s killers to justice.

"Whosoever will create an atmosphere of fear will be dealt with severely. No such incident will be tolerated. Anyone found involved in Kamlesh Tiwari's death case will not be spared," said Adityanath.
