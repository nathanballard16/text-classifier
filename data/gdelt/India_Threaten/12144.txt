New Delhi, August 23

The Congress said the government’s advisers had “confessed” the country’s economy was in “crisis”. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said the government should remonetise the economy by putting money in the hands of “the needy and not the greedy”.

His comments came hours after the Finance Minister announced steps to address distress in various sectors.

Rahul wrote on Twitter: “Government’s own economic advisers have finally acknowledged what we cautioned for long — India’s economy is in a deep mess.”

The Congress too tweeted “Essentially, the FM has backtracked on several provisions presented in her maiden Budget. The only thing that remained the same: no mention of job creation then, no mention today either.” — PTI
