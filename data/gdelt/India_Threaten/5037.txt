A rape victim in Maharashtra threatened to kill herself after the accused got a bail.

The rape victim threatened to commit suicide at the Bombay High Court on Friday (March 29) after the accused in the case got bail.

The woman started shouting "I want justice" and threatened to jump off the second floor after the high court granted bail to the accused, said a police official.

The police personnel on duty outside the courtroom succeeded in calming her down.

She was given a counselling session and allowed to go, the officer said.
