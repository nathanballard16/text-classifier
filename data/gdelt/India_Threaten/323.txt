Private bus owners not to support two day Bandh

Mangaluru: Dakshina Kannada district private bus owners association has not yet expressed support to the two day bandh call given by 10 labour associations for Tuesday and Wednesday.

The two day all India bandh has been called by the central trade unions against the alleged repressive policies for workers adopted by the government. The nationwide general strike is against the alleged anti-worker policies of the union government.

In this backdrop, the Dakshina Kannada district private bus owners association has not yet expressed support to the two day bandh. Therefore it may be expected that the private buses in the district will be functioning as per usual.

Buses are the lifeline of the district and in the backdrop of the private buses not pledging their support to the nationwide strike, it is doubtful if the strike will take place in the undivided districts of DK and Udupi.

Meanwhile, the strike has garnered support from the farmers from across the country under the aegis of the Left peasant wings. The strike will also be supported by the public sector employees, unorganised sector workers, port and dock workers, bank and insurance employees.

Ten trade unions who have jointly called for the nationwide general strike including the INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, AICCTU, UTUC, TUCC, LPF and SEWA.
