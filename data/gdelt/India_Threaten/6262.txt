Sapna Choudhary campaigns for Manoj Tiwari as she joins the roadshow; says Manoj Tiwari is a good friend

Bigg Boss Season 11 contestant and popular dancer Sapna Choudhary was in the news a couple of months ago for having joined BJP as pictures of hers were doing the rounds on the internet. However, soon, they turned out to be wrong as she herself denied any such rumour and went on to say how she was just there to meet good friend Manoj Tiwari and that she hasn't joined the BJP or any other political party for that matter.

And today, Sapna was spotted campaigning for Manoj Tiwari in Delhi. The actor turned politician will be fighting in the Lok Sabha elections from the North East constituency of Delhi for Bharatiya Janata Party. He will be standing against Sheila Dixit from Congress, and as known, she has been the Delhi chief minister in the past for three years. And well, looks like the Bhojpuri actor has full support from friend Sapna as she joined him at the roadshow in Delhi today.
