Congress cautions Muslims against voting for TRS

Hyderabad: The Congress party has cautioned the Minorities, especially Muslims of Telangana State against voting for TRS in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Addressing the media at Gandhi Bhavan on Thursday, TPCC Minorities Department chairman Shaik Abdullah Sohail predicted that the TRS would join the BJP-led NDA on April 12, the next after first phase of polling in Telangana. He also said Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao would campaign for the BJP, its allies or other parties that could split the secular votes in other parts of the country.

Referring to the recent statement made by Union Minister Piyush Goyal, Sohail said Goyal himself has confirmed that the TRS and YSRCP were allies of BJP in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh respectively. He said that the Congress party has exposed the nexus between TRS and BJP long back and now the relationship between them was confirmed by none other than a top minister in Prime Minister Narender Modi’s cabinet.

He ridiculed the claims being made by TRS of winning 16 seats in forthcoming Lok Sabha elections. Despite having the support of 15 MPs in the last term, KCR merely acted like an agent of Modi. Therefore, the addition of one more MP seat will not change his status. TRS will continue to act as an ally of BJP and KCR will remain a Modi-Bhakt,” he said.

Sohail said that the ‘Nyuntam Aay Yojana’ or NYAY scheme proposed by Congress President Rahul Gandhi to provide Rs. 72,000 per annum to poorest of poor families would benefit a majority of Muslims in Telangana. He claimed that the previous Congress-led UPA regime from 2004-2014 was the Golden Decade for Muslims in India when a series of schemes were implemented for the upliftment of the community.
