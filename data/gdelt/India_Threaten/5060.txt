Ex-BSF jawan, who complained about bad food, to contest against Modi from Varanasi

The BSF had sacked constable Tej Bahadur Yadav after a court of inquiry found he had damaged the "image of the BSF" when he uploaded a video on "substandard food" on social media.

Tej Bahadur Yadav, former Border Security Force (BSF) constable who triggered uproar after he uploaded videos on the "substandard food" served to soldiers on social media, has said he will be contesting the Lok Sabha polls against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Tej Bahadur Yadav has said he will fight the polls from the Varanasi constituency in Uttar Pradesh, Hindustan Times has reported.

Speaking to HT, Yadav claimed he took the decision to fight as an Independent even though he was approached by many political parties.

Tej Bahadur Yadav said his motive was not to win or lose. "The government has failed the forces. PM Modi seeks votes in the name of jawans but has done nothing for them," he told the newspaper.

Tej Bahadur Yadav had posted four videos on Facebook in January, 2017, complaining about the unpalatable food at his camp along the Indo-Pakistan border in Jammu and Kashmir. Yadav had further alleged that the senior officials illegally sold off the food supplies meant for the troopers.

Yadav had also said that he was "mentally tortured" and had expressed apprehension that his seniors may take action against him for exposing the condition of soldiers on the border.

The videos triggered outrage across the nation, but the BSF dismissed his allegations. He was later sacked after a three-month-long proceeding at a summary court-martial held in Jammu and Kashmir's Samba district.
