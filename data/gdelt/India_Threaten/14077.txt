Sena names candidates for 'tussle-free' seats

The Shiv Sena on Sunday announced its candidates for some seats for the Maharashtra polls scheduled for October 21.

The Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party are in the midst of some hard- nosed seat-sharing talks and sources in the Uddhav Thackeray-led party said the names announced on Sunday were for those seats over which there was no tussle.

Maharashtra minister of state for home Deepak Kesarkar will contest from Sawantwadi in Konkan's Sindhudurg while Rajesh Kshirsagar will fight the polls from Kolhapur city, Sena sources said.

While it was believed that the Sena and the BJP would fight an equal number of seats for the 288-member House and leave a fraction for smaller allies, the seat-sharing talks have been uneasy with no agreement on the formula.

While the BJP wants a bigger share, on the back of its spectacular performance in the April-May Lok Sabha polls, the Sena is not willing to play ball, said sources from both parties.
