Kanhaiya to fight from Begusarai

Patna: Student leader Kanhaiya Kumar declared that he will contest the elections as the Left candidate from Bihar's Begusarai, but without weakening the coalition of Opposition parties that intends to take on the ruling BJP in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

"I will fight the elections because that is what the people want," the former president of the JNU student union said.
