Chennai: After the death of a critically endangered crocodile, the founder of the Madras Crocodile Bank Trust blamed the Sheraton Grand Chennai Resort and Spa on social media. The founder, Romulus Whitaker alleged that the crocodile might have died because of the vibrations of the heavy bass music that was being played at the resort.

The owner also alleged that in February, the Trust had mentioned the dangers posed on the reptiles after the resort was opened there. According to Romulus, the vibrations created by the loud music used to cause stress among the animals.

Allegedly, the volume and timing of the music did not conform to the legal guidelines. Romulus stated that the music was "auditory torture" to the animals and used to affect their breeding pattern as well as their behaviour. After the post was uploaded, the representatives of the resort met with the trust and promised to them that they will keep the volume according to the legal guidelines.

In his Facebook post, Romulus stated that the vibrations caused by the music might be a reason for the crocodile's death. The crocodile was separated from the resort with a 50 feet wall. The speakers used by the resort had been installed right next to the wall. According to Romulus, there are only for such crocodiles in the world.

While talking to the News Minute, the Marketing Communication Manager, Jayadev stated that they hosted an event on the beach side and not on the lawn side. He even stated that they had kept the volume withing legal limits. The hotel is now planning to meet the authorities of the bank to discuss the incident.
