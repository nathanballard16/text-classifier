PHOTOS: Taimur Ali Khan is in full mood to give playing lessons to Inaaya as she watches him run to the swings

Clearly, Taimur Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Kemmu’s daughter and Tim Tim’s cousin, Inaaya Kemmu, are the cutest kids of B-town and as soon as the clock strikes 5, we eagerly await pictures of these little munchkins. Every day, while sometimes, Taimur-Inaaya are snapped going for evening strolls, on other occasions, Taimur and Inaaya are clicked at their play school or enjoying horse riding. And today, just as the ritual is, we were treated to pictures of Taimur Ali Khan and Inaaya Kemmu at their play school.

In these pictures, as soon as Taimur stepped out of the car, he ran to the swings wearing a red Polo shirt and blue jeans, and Inaaya, on the other hand, was tugged into her maid’s arms. Well, looks like an excited Taimur wants to give playing lessons to his younger sister Inaaya and therefore, ran straight to the swings. Besides hanging out in Mumbai, Kareena Kapoor Khan- Saif Ali Khan and Soha Ali Khan and Kunal Kemmu, take the kids for vacations and their last vacation was in the Maldives.

As the Junior Nawab turned 2 in December, after throwing a party for his friends in Mumbai, Taimur, along with Bebo and Saif jetted off to South Africa for his birthday celebrations. Post that, Taimur returned to Mumbai for a short break, and after celebrating Christmas with family, the Pataudi khandan went off to Europe to ring in the New Years. Just a few days back, Taimur returned to the bay with his mother and soon after, Mr. Taimur went to attend a friend’s birthday party, a video of which has gone viral online where Taimur, Inaaya and Nisha are seen dancing and enjoying themselves.
