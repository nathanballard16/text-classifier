(Reuters) - Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will warn that UK is “not remotely prepared” to leave the European Union in less than two months, the Times newspaper reported on Monday.

Sturgeon will use a speech at Georgetown University in Washington on Monday to call again for a second Brexit referendum, the newspaper said. She will say the situation had made it clear that Scotland’s interests were not properly served by remaining in the United Kingdom.

Britain is due to leave on March 29.
