WhatsApp to take legal action against spammers from December 7 | The Guardian Nigeria News - Nigeria and World News

Facebook chat platform, WhatsApp, will take legal action against users who send too many messages from December 7, 2019.



The company hoped to put a stop to the abuse of the service by spammers, who send huge number of messages to particular users, it said.



Such rules are banned in its terms, and users can be banned for contravening them. But the company has now pledged to pursue other punishments too.



This feature was initially tested in India in 2018 after a string of mob attacks in the country were blamed on fake reports which were said to have spread via the app.
