Samajwadi Party (SP) is putting all its weight to support its candidate Poonam Sinha who is fighting against BJP heavyweight Rajnath Singh in Lucknow.

On Friday, her daughter Sonakshi Sinha, a popular Bollywood actor, took part in a roadshow in Uttar Pradesh's capital. Poonam Sinha's husband actor-turned-politician Shatrughan Sinha, who is the Congress candidate from Patna Sahib, had joined her last month when she filed her nomination papers for Samajwadi Party.

This had angered many in Congress as the party has fielded its own candidate in the prestigious Lucknow constituency where Shatrughan was campaigning for his wife. Clarifying why he turned up at the Congress rival's roadshow, he said he was there as a "dutiful husband".

Sonakshi was accompanied by her brother Kushh Sinha and MP Dimple Yadav. The roadshow that moved through three assembly constituencies covered a distance of about 6km, across the old parts of the city.

Poonam Sinha made her debut in politics last month. She will be fighting on an SP ticket against Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Lucknow, the constituency which is considered to be a stronghold of the BJP. SP-BSP-RLD are the three parties fighting the election in an alliance in Uttar Pradesh with 37 seats for SP, 38 for BSP and 3 for RLD.

The Congress has picked self-styled spiritual guru Acharya Pramod Krishnam as its Lucknow candidate.

Lucknow will vote in the fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections on May 6. The result will be declared on May 23.
