In a scathing attack on former ally BJP, TDP president and Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Wednesday accused the ruling party of “jeopardising national security, playing with the Army for self-interest and political gains and belittling the nation by petty actions”.

In a teleconference with party leaders on Wednesday, he said the TDP would not “tolerate jeopardising national security for self-interest and playing with Army for political gains” and demanded tough action on the Pulwama terror attack.

“Law and order needs to be protected on the borders. Apprehensions are there among people over the Pulwama attack and the Pakistan Prime Minister’s statement, Naidu said.

He said there is threat to national security because of “inefficiency” of the ruling party, accusing the BJP leaders of “belittling the nation with their petty actions and wrongdoings”.

“People have lost trust in the BJP. That’s why it is trying for alliances with small and petty parties. The BJP will resort to anything to come to power. It is trying to remote-control states.

“All non-BJP parties have got together only because of democratic compulsion, also because of secular compulsion,” he added.
