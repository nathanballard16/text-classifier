First time pregnant woman delivers premature quadruplets normally

Four babies, including one female and three males, at the neonatal ICU

Vadodara: A 23-year-old woman gave birth to quadruplets (four babies) at state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara in wee hours of Tuesday.

Rukshar Gufran, a resident of Vadi area in the old city, delivered the four babies, who were born premature at 32 weeks.

Doctors said that it was a rare case as quadruplets are born once in every five lakh births. What makes the case medically more interesting is the fact that it was the first pregnancy of the woman and the babies were delivered normally. Also it was a non-IVF pregnancy.

Birth of twins, triplets and quadruplets is common in cases for in-vitro fertilization. “It was a spontaneous quadruplet delivery. This was her first pregnancy,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer from the Department of Paediatrics.

The four babies, who were born between 1 am and 1.55 am, include one female and three male. “They are very low birth weight babies with their weight ranging from 1 kg to 1.2 kg,” said Aiyer.

The babies have been kept at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which is an intensive care unit specializing in the care of ill or premature infants.

“The journey of premature and very low birth weight babies has its own share of complications. But, one can offer them good care and survival is not non-achievable,” she said, adding that the babies will require four to six weeks of hospitalisation.

Rukshar, whose husband Ganif, runs a small cloth shop in Mangal Bazaar area of the city, had developed labour pain on Monday night after which she was rushed to Jamanabai General Hospital from where she was referred to SSG Hospital. Her condition is stable while the newborns are getting special care.
