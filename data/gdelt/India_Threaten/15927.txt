Shiv Sena fails to show letters of support, NCP gets Maharashtra governor’s invite

Shiv Sena on Monday failed to show the letters of support to the Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari to form the government in the state. Governor Koshiyari also refused to extend the time to Shiv Sena and invited third largest party NCP and gave them time of 24 hours (till 8.30 pm on Tuesday night) to show the support of required MLAs needed to form the government.

Contrary to earlier reports, the Congress made it clear in Delhi that it has not yet decided to support the Shiv Sena and it will be decided only after talks with Sharad Pawar. The NCP has also not given a letter of support to the Shiv Sena. Raj Bhavan has issued a release saying that Shiv Sena had asked for three days’ time which has not been given to it.

Possibility of Sharad Pawar becoming a contender for the post of Chief Minister cannot also be ruled out. Earlier there was a discussion that for first two-and-a-half-year, Sharad Pawar should be made CM and Aaditya Thackeray for the next half. Overall the situation remains interesting.
