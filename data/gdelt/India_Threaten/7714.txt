What's next for Adani, the coal project that helped to return Morrison to power?

Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Adani's proposed mine in Queensland has long been a lightning rod for division over coal-mining and climate change in Australia. It is also being named as a big reason for Labor's lost seats in Queensland amid the Morrison government's upset re-election. Queensland's Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says everyone's "had a gutful" of the issue – and she wants it sorted out – and has finally set a June 13 deadline. So what's next for this controversial project and what are the implications of it finally going ahead?

The basin is about the size of Victoria and contains one of the world's largest untapped deposits of thermal coal – the type used to make electricity. The mine, which is proposed by Adani Mining (a subsidiary of India's Adani Group), is meant to be a keystone project for the Indian company's so-called "pit-to-plug" strategy of owning coal mines to feed its power plants in India. Adani also runs ports in India and has other interests, including renewable energy. Its chairman and founder, Gautam Adani, was the 10th richest Indian in 2018, worth $17 billion ($US11.9 billion), Forbes reported. He has a poor environmental record.

Queensland is no stranger to coal mining, of course. The Bowen Basin, which runs along eastern Queensland into NSW, contains about two-thirds of the state's coal reserve, including the higher value (and harder to substitute) coking coal, used in steel making. Still, the nearby Galilee's "greenfield" nature is attractive for new entrants. Beyond Adani, other billionaires are in the mix, with Gina Rinehart backing GVK's proposed mine and would-be senator Clive Palmer seeking to advance his Waratah Coal venture. If all nine proposed Galilee ventures get going, output could climb to 320 million tonnes of coal a year. That's equivalent to expanding global seaborne coal trade by a third, says Tim Buckley, a director of the Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA). The basin's distance from the coast and its moderate quality are key reasons why the region's coal hasn't been dug up before now. Its viability remains challenged. Galilee coal has a relatively high ash and low energy content for Australian coal, he says. The mining industry, though, says Galilee coal is up to 5800 kilocalories per kilogram, better than an average Indian energy content of as much as 4600 kcal/kg. The Climate Council estimates those mines could lead to an additional 705 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emitted per year when the coal is burnt. That amount of pollution is equivalent to 1.3 times the annual emissions of Australia – although how much is additional depends on the amount by which total coal use increases rather than Galilee bumping other suppliers out of the market.

Mr Adani plans to ship coal from the Galilee Basin to India, where his companies make up the largest private electricity supplier led by the "ultra mega" Mundra power plant, with more than 4000 MW capacity. Adani is betting on forecasts, such as by BP, that India's power demand will roughly triple between 2017 and 2040. The Queensland Resources Council notes International Energy Agency estimates point to India's coal-fired power plant capacity doubling by 2040. The Queensland government, meanwhile, has downplayed reports that another project in the Galilee Basin, the $6.7-billion China Stone "mega coal mine", next to Carmichael, was in doubt, with thousands of jobs at risk.

Adani says it will generate more than 1500 direct jobs on the mine and rail project – which would transport the coal 200 kilometres to another rail line, from where it would go to Queensland's northern-most coal port, Abbot Point – with about 6750 indirect jobs in towns such as Rockhampton, Townsville, Mackay and the Isaac region.

The project's economic impact would be multiplied if other Galilee mines open up. But the Australia Institute, an opponent of the Carmichael Mine, has noted how industry analysts expect Galilee coal to displace demand for coal elsewhere in Australia. It says Galilee Basin output of 150 million tonnes a year would cut coal volumes from the NSW Hunter Valley by 116 million tonnes by 2035 – something the minerals lobby has typically had little to say about. What's been the hold-up? Adani paid $500 million plus a future coal royalty stream in 2010 to the now disgraced Linc Energy for its Carmichael coal tenements of some 2.3 billion tonnes of coal. The following year it promised to start coal production from 2014. Adani failed to find banks willing to support its plan for the $16.5 billion "mega mine" that would have produced as much as 60 million tonnes of coal a year. It also hit a series of regulatory and legal challenges, both at the state and federal level, and the project is now a smaller first-stage version that Adani will fund itself at $2 billion.

But there are still 15 plans needing federal approvals, eight of which require the nod before the mine's operations can begin. Adani's not done with the courts either. Its lawyers are fending off appeals against the mine by the Wangan and Jagalingou Traditional Owners Council, which will be heard in the Federal Court on May 27 and 28. And the Environmental Defenders Office in Queensland has hearing dates set for June 27-28 for its challenge – on behalf of the Australian Conservation Foundation – of Minister Price's handling of the approval process for the North Galilee Water Scheme, which is meant to funnel 12.5 billion litres of water a year along a 110-kilometre pipeline to the Adani and other mines from the Suttor River. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk thinks the community is "fed up" with the Adani approval process. Credit:AAP What's happening now? The blowtorch for approval is firmly turned on Annastacia Palaszczuk's Queensland Labor government. Queensland has granted Adani most of what it needs to start building the mine, such as approving a water licence that grants the Adani mine unlimited access to groundwater for 60 years.
