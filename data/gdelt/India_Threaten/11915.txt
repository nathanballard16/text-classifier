Pakistan summons Indian diplomat over LoC ceasefire violations

Pakistan on Monday summoned India's Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia to condemn and register a protest over India's continued unprovoked ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC).The Indian diplomat was summoned by Dr Mohammad Faisal, the director-general (SA & SAARC), following Sunday's unprovoked ceasefire violation in Hot Spring and Chirikot Sectors of LoC.Two elderly civilians, 75-year-old Lal Muhammad and 61-year-old Hassan Din, both residents of village Nagrai, were martyred in the Indian firing, while a seven-year-old boy, Saddam Noor, suffered serious injuries."Indian forces along the LoC and Working Boundary have continuously been targeting civilian populated areas with artillery fire, heavy-caliber mortars, and automatic weapons. This unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing since 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1,970 ceasefire violations," read a statement issued by the Foreign Office.Dr Faisal said the deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas was "deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights, and humanitarian laws.""The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation," read the statement.He urged India to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement in letter and spirit and to instruct its forces to maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary.Dr Faisal also called for an investigation into the continuing ceasefire violations by Indian forces and said New Delhi must permit the United Nations Military Observers Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions.
