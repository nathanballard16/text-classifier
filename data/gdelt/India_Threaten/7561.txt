Ghaziabad: Police step in to tackle fights over strays

GHAZIABAD: As cases of dog bites and arguments between residents continue to rise, police on Friday directed SHOs to book such cases under Section 133 F (conditional order for removal of a nuisance) of the Code of Criminal Procedure ( CrPC ).SP (city) Shlok Kumar, who passed the order, said in many instances, residents have been found taking law in their hands. They clash with each other and register cases of molestation and assault, he said.The decision has come in the wake of the incident reported at Ajnara Integrity in Raj Nagar Extension on May 14 where two groups of residents fought against each other and lodged two FIRs against more than 45 people after a team from Ghaziabad municipal corporation came to catch strays from the society premises over several complaints of dog bites.Kumar said that under the particular CrPC section, the police or even the residents, can approach the district magistrate or a sub-divisional magistrate ( SDM ), or any other executive magistrate and submit a report regarding the problems being faced by them due to stray animals.The administrative officials will then pass a suitable order to deal with the situation.“Police will be asked to handle the case under the particular CrPC section so that relief could be provided to residents,” he added.Notably, the sub-section F of CrPC Section 133 reads “that any dangerous animal should be destroyed, confined or otherwise disposed of, such magistrate may make a conditional order requiring the person causing such obstruction or nuisance…”PFA district president Sumeidha Iyer said, “It will be good if people go to the police for help instead of fighting with each other. At the same time, the department should ensure that cops dealing with such cases are not harassing dog lovers. Cops can only forward the report to the administrative officials and they should stick to that”Iyer, however, claimed that the CrPC Section 133 F is only applicable to pet dogs and not strays.Police should also know that they can’t make dog lovers owners of stray dogs just because they feed and provide them shelter.Nitin Tyagi, president of the society, said there are around 40 stray dogs in the society which on a daily basis target residents and bite them.
