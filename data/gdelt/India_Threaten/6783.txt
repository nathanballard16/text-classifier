Srinagar, Apr 30

Pakistani terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) is planning another Pulwama-like attack, a news source has learnt. According to reports, the JeM is again planning to attack the security forces again in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district.

However, this time there are two differences in the modus operandi of the terror outfit, as learnt through the intel report accessed by the Times Now. First, the place of attack has been changed, now the terror groups are reportedly planning to carry out an attack in Lethipora region of the district – approximately 40 kilometres away from the last targeted area.

Second, this time the intel reveals that the terror group will not use any vehicle to target the security personnel as used on February 14, but security establishments, camps and buildings might be targeted using Improvised Explosive Device (IED).

Moreover, there have been not one or two but several reports coming in from the Valley about JeM planning another attack. Given the intel, security forces have been put on high alert in the state with more security arrangements in place in the aforementioned district.

On February 14, JeM operative identified as Adil Ahmed Dar had rammed his IED laden vehicle into a moving CRPF convoy in Pulwama. At least 40 personnel lost their lives in the dastardly attack. Two weeks later, India responded with air strikes across the Line of Control targeting the JeM training camps.

The next day, Pakistan had made an unsuccessful attempt to intrude the Indian air space. An F-16 of the Pakistani Air Force and Mi-21 Bison of the IAF had crashed during a dogfight.
