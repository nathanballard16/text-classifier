When two people fight, both have to face losses: RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat

NEW DELHI: In a veiled reference to the BJP-Sena break-up, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat said ‘selfishness is bad’ and both sides would lose if they continued to fight over a matter. “Everyone knows that selfishness is a bad thing but very few people give it up. This is true about the country, individuals. When two people fight, both of them have to face losses. Still people fight, knowing well it will bring no good,” Bhagwat said at an event in Nagpur on Tuesday. Sena and BJP contested the assembly polls together but parted ways after disagreement over power-sharing.
