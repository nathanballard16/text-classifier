"Believe In Forget And Forgive," Says BS Yediyurappa Ahead Of Trust Vote

Ahead of the crucial test in the assembly, Mr Yediyurappa, 76, offered prayers at a temple in Bengaluru. Facing an assembly with a truncated strength, Mr Yediyurappa moved a one-line motion that said the House expresses confidence in the ministry headed by him. He said the administrative machinery had collapsed and his priority was to bring it back on track.

On Sunday, Mr Yediyurappa had said he was confident of proving majority in the house. "On Monday, I will prove my majority 100%," he told reporters in Bengaluru.

The disqualification of the 14 lawmakers brings down the majority mark in the assembly within the reach of the BJP government.

All the lawmakers have been disqualified from the assembly till the end of its term, which calls for by-elections in all 16 constituencies. The disqualifications will not have any direct impact on today's trust vote.

The 14 disqualified lawmakers said they would challenge the Speaker's decision in the Supreme Court today.

Five of rebels, along with an Independent lawmaker, returned to Bengaluru from Mumbai this morning. Independent Nagesh said he would vote for Mr Yediyurappa.

The effective strength of the 224-member assembly excluding the Speaker, who will cast vote in case of a tie, is 207. The magic figure required will be 104.

The first test of strength took place last week after 13 lawmakers of the Congress and three from the JD(S) resigned and two Independent lawmakers who were supporting the government switched sides earlier this month.

The coalition could scrape up only 99 votes against the BJP's 105.
