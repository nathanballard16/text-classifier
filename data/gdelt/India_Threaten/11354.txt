AMN / NEW DELHI

President Ram Nath Kovind has given his nod to National Medical Commission act 2019. The move came after Parliament passed the bill in the just-concluded session. The Bill seeks to repeal the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.

It has provisions to set up the National Medical Commission which will frame policies for regulating medical institutions and medical professionals and assess the requirements of healthcare-related human resources and infrastructure.

Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan hails the NMC Act as historic and milestone in the medical education sector. Addressing a press conference in New Delhi today, Dr Harsh Vardhan said, the rules will be framed and the NMC will be constituted within six months.

He said the NMC Act is a progressive legislation which will reduce the burden on students and bring down costs of medical education. He said it will simplify procedures and help to enhance the number of medical seats in the country.

The National Medical Commission will be an overarching body, which will frame policies and co-ordinate the activities of four autonomous boards. These Boards will look after the work of Under Graduate and Post Graduate education, medical assessment, rating and Medical Registration.
