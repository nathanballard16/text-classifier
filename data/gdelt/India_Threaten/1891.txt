Agencies

Uttar Pradesh government has set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the hooch tragedy claiming over 100 lives in UP and Uttarakhand

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath asked the SIT to submit its report within 10 working days.

An official spokesman said, the SIT will be headed by Additional Director General of Police (Railways) Sanjay Singhal.

On sSundaytwo senior officers have been suspended by the Uttar Pradesh government, in connection with the hooch tragedy in the state and neighbouring Uttarakhand, which killed 104 people.

While 67 died in UP, 37 people have been killed in Uttarakhand. After a statewide crackdown, 79,000 litres of country-made liquor have seized across the state.

The UP government, yesterday, announced a probe by a special investigation team (SIT) into the deaths, most of which occurred Saharanpur and Kushinagar in UP. The five-member SIT, headed by senior officer Sanjay Singhal, has been asked to specifically focus on any conspiracy angle and submit its report within 10 days.

The state government has also decided to suspend the circle officers in Saharanpur and Kushinagar. The action against officers came after a blame game over spurious liquor tragedy between the Yogi Adityanath-led government and the Samajwadi Party (SP). Ally Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief, Mayawati sought a CBI probe into the incident and claimed that it was the result of “sheer callousness” of the BJP government.

The Chief Minister has warned of strict action against anyone found linked to the illicit liquor trade, even if they were associated with any political party. “In the past too, such mischievous acts by SP leaders had come to fore. In Azamgarh, Hardoi, Kanpur and Barabanki, SP leaders were found to be involved in past hooch tragedies. We can’t deny conspiracy this time too,” Yogi Adityanath told reporters on Saturday.
