Medical counselling panel issues warning on ‘double-seat’ practice

Postgraduate students, colleges told not to block seats

The Medical Counselling Committee (MCC) on Thursday issued a warning to postgraduate medical students and medical colleges ‘deliberately’ trying to block seats.

Admission processes for the first all-India list closed earlier this month, and the second round will end on April 22. The second-round list in Maharashtra is expected to be released by the month end.

While two all-India and State lists are issued separately, some people claim seats on both the lists. According to the rules, one of the two have to be surrendered.

“MCC, Directorate General of Health Services, is actively tracking/monitoring such candidates and colleges. If at any level of the counselling, it is found that seat blocking is done deliberately, with malicious intent, such colleges/candidates will be dealt with accordingly,” the notice read.

However, this has not brought in much hope for students in the State, who have been protesting against the fewer open category, post-graduation (PG) seats. “This has mainly got to do with the all-India list. Some candidates hold on to one State seat and one all-India seat through their respective lists. According to the rules, you need to surrender one of the two seats that can be shown vacant, and appear in the second round for somebody who needs it,” said Neil Prabhu, a Mumbai-based PG applicant.
