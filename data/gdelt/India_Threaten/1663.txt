Wham! How to give it back

Mamata positions herself as a national trendsetter who ferociously struck back at Modi's attempt to browbeat her

Mamata’s statements were made on the dharna dais on Tuesday after the Supreme Court issued the directives. The BJP’s version was collated from news conferences of Union ministers Smriti Irani and Ravi Shankar Prasad in New Delhi, besides interactions with multiple state unit leaders, including national secretary Rahul Sinha and Bengal general secretary Sayantan Basu.

How come both sides are claiming victory?

Court: The Calcutta police commissioner has to “faithfully cooperate” with the CBI.

Mamata: He was always willing to cooperate. We never said we will not cooperate. Our fight was against the political vendetta that resulted in this abuse of the agency.

BJP: Egg on Mamata’s face as she was trying to shield Kumar from having to cooperate with the CBI.

SC: No “coercive steps, including arrest”, can be taken against the police commissioner.

Mamata: We are grateful. We welcome the Supreme Court verdict. This is what we wanted.

BJP: It shows nobody, including the police commissioner, is above the law.

SC: Kumar should appear before the CBI in Shillong.

Mamata: Shillong is a beautiful place. We welcome it. Kumar doesn’t get any break, he will get two days to relax there. This is the court upholding our stand. Kumar had written five letters to the CBI seeking meetings and discussions in a neutral venue.

BJP: This is the court’s recognition of the total lawlessness in Bengal.
