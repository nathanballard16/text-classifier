Watch: Uttarakhand BJP MLA does Tamanche Pe Disco, stirs row

Pranav Singh Champion was reportedly celebrating his return to home after a leg operation.

Controversial Uttarakhand Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA, Pranav Singh Champion, who is currently suspended from the party on the grounds of indiscipline and misbehaviour, is once again in the limelight.

This time he is not in the news for misbehaviour or violence but for dancing to Bollywood item numbers while brandishing guns.

In a video that has gone viral, Pranav Singh Champion can be seen dancing Gangs of Wasseypur style with arms and using vulgar language.

Pranav Singh Champion along with his supporters were reportedly celebrating his homecoming after a leg operation.

Not just one or two, Pranav Singh brandished four guns while shaking a leg to Bollywood numbers.

His supporters while praising him can be heard saying, "No one else, only you can do something like this in Uttarakhand."

"Not just in Uttarakhand, no one can do this in entire India," Pranav Singh Champion says while responding to the praises.

According to sources, the BJP has taken serious note of Pranav Singh Champion's video. He currently stands suspended from the party for three months. A party disciplinary committee will look into the latest indiscretion, after speaking to the state unit.

A few months ago, a video of Pranav Singh Champion went viral in which he was heard threatening to kill a journalist. After the incident, the journalist had lodged a complaint against Singh in the Chanakyapuri police station in Delhi.

Uttarakhand BJP chief Naresh Bansal, acting on the complaint, had suspended Pranav Singh for three months from primary membership of the party on June 22 on charges of misbehaviour with journalists.
