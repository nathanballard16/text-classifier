Ashoka dismisses HDK’s claim on prior knowledge of Balakot type strikes

MANGALURU: Former home minister R Ashoka on Saturday ridiculed a claim by chief minister H D Kumaraswamy that a retired military officer had told him 2-years-ago that the Modi government would build a narrative about a war-like situation between India and Pakistan. The CM had claimed that the government would script a Balakot-style strike close to elections to politically benefit from military tension along the international border.Ashoka, who with other local BJP leaders performed ‘chappara muhurath’ for PM Narendra Modi’s April 13 rally at Nehru Maidan earlier, later told reporters that after this statement of the CM, one must wonder whether to believe him or the armed forces. “We have seen in the case of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman of how armed forces personnel put nation before self and don’t divulge state secrets even under the gravest of threats,” he said.“No armed forces personnel of any of the three wings or central armed police forces will ever share such sensitive information in the public domain – whether while serving or after retirement—he said,” adding every personnel is bound by the oath they taken when enlisting into the force – not to ever utter a word of their professional engagement ever. “They will never do such an act, and any former military officer disclosing such a big matter is ruled out,” he said.Taking a political pot-shot at his one-time boss, when Ashoka served as deputy CM under Kumaraswamy, the Padmanabhanagar MLA, in-charge of Modi’s political rallies in Karnataka, said, “Everyone knows the ease with which you lie. We have seen this in the case of former Prime Minister H D Deve Gowda who said the 2014 elections would be his last, and several elections before that, and Kumaraswamy is continuing the same legacy.”
