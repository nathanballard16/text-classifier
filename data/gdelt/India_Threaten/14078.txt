Minister promises action against those who threatened social activists

Those who threatened social activists who filed cases against brick kiln owners for illegal mining will face the law, Municipal Administration Minister S.P. Velumani said here on Sunday.

“Whoever threatened the activists for filing a case in the Madras High Court against brick kiln owners for illegally mining red earth in Thadagam will face the law and the State government will ensure action,” he said after flagging off new buses at the Ukkadam bus stand.

Two activists, including a farmer, were threatened on Sunday morning at Thadagam.

Mr. Velumani said the Municipal Administration Department would render all support by providing necessary infrastructure for the smooth conduct of local body election.

He flagged off 104 buses that the Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation had allotted for the Coimbatore Zone.

The Minister said that 22 buses would ply in the Erode division, seven in Tirupur, 13 in Ooty and the rest in Coimbatore.

He earlier provided welfare assistance to 300 pregnant women in a programme organised by the Social Welfare Department.
