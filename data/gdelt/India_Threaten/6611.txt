6 held for threatening MSU student leaders with acid attack

Accused members of infamous Pathan Group in police custody

VADODARA: Six persons of the infamous Pathan Group of MS University (MSU) were arrested on Saturday for issuing threats of acid attack to MSU Students’ Union vice-president Saloni Mishra and former general secretary of arts faculty Shreya Negandhi.

The six arrested identified as Zuber Khan Pathan, Fazal Khan Pathan, Akib Pathan, Mohsin Khan Pathan, Sajid Khan Pathan and Kalim Khan Pathan and two others Rustam Pathan and Ati Pathan were booked at Sayajigunj police for rioting and criminal intimidation on the basis of complaint given by Mishra.

Mishra told the police in her complaint that the group led by Zuber gathered at the head office of the university when they had gone to submit a memorandum to the vice-chancellor on Friday afternoon. The complainant alleged that Zuber instigated his group by saying that when these girls go out they will have to throw acid on them. The group even hurled abuses at her. Later when Mishra called police, the group fled away.

Names of some Pathan Group members had earlier cropped up in harassment of girls and female staffers of the university. There were allegations of assault and intimidation to students against them too.

Frightened by the acid attack threats Mishra met senior police officials at Police Bhavan and then lodged a complaint at Sayajigunj police station. Mishra and the other students had gone to submit the memorandum in connection with fake complaint of ragging which had irked the Pathan group.

The university has also sought an explanation from Nirbhay Mishra, the third-year student of Faculty of Arts, for filing fake complaint of ragging in the name of Vaibhav Bajpayee, last month. The Pathan group is supporting Mishra ahead of the students election.
