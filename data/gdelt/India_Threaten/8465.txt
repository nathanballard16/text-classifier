Sri Lanka's President, Speaker clash over Easter attacks probe

COLOMBO • Sri Lanka's Parliament warned President Maithripala Sirisena not to scuttle a controversial investigation into security lapses before the Easter suicide bombings, said the Speaker's office yesterday.

The warning came after Mr Sirisena said he would not cooperate with the parliamentary probe and would not allow defence or police officials to testify before the select committee.

The President called an emergency Cabinet meeting last Friday night to oppose the legislature's investigation into the April 21 attacks that killed 258 people and wounded nearly 500.

"Any public servant summoned by the PSC (select committee) is obliged to give evidence," Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in a hard-hitting response to Mr Sirisena. "Officials are fully aware of the consequences if they fail to respond."

Officials at the Speaker's office said Mr Jayasuriya made it clear to Mr Sirisena that he will not call off the select committee and that it will continue its public hearings.

Evidence before the committee, which began its publicly televised sittings late last month, has placed the President in a poor light, suggesting that he failed to act on advance warning of the attacks.

Last Saturday, the President's office said he sacked his national intelligence chief Sisira Mendis, who had testified that the attacks against three churches and three luxury hotels could have been avoided.
