Budget 2019: FM Piyush Goyal introduces Anti Camcording provision for filmmakers to curb piracy

Piyush Goyal, the interim Finance Minister, presented the 2019-2020 Budget to the Parliament today. Goyal presented the budget in absence of Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, who is currently in the United States for medical treatment. Goyal presented the Budget on a host of issues including the Indian film industry. The Budget focused on anti-piracy measures and Goyal stated that an anti-camcording provision will be introduced to the Cinematography Act to fight piracy.

Goyal's statement pertaining to the Indian film industry brought smiles and cheer as he also mentioned the recently released war film URI: The Surgical Strike. The Indian film industry has had a hard time dealing with the issue of piracy and the film fraternity heaved a sigh of relief on Friday when Goyal announced the provision to fight piracy.

Siddharth Roy Kapur, President, Producers Guild of India said that they were delighted about the acknowledgement received from the Indian government. He said, "The amendments in the Anti-Camcording provisions will support the industry’s growth by curtailing illegal recordings of films in cinema halls and will go a long way towards reducing piracy.”

As per a Free Press Journal report, in the 2018 budget, the government had set aside Rs 110 crores for cyber security projects, including the National Cyber Security Co-ordination Centre and others. However, it failed to make any significant impact as the proportion of amount that could be attributed to prevent piracy has been meager.

Films like Petta, Simmba and Kangana Ranaut starrer Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi were leaked online within days of its release, whereas Aditya Dhar's Uri had taken strong measures to fight piracy. Despite that, the film was leaked online a few days after its release.
