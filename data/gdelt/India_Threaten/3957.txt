On February 1, the Maharashtra Government told Bombay High Court that the authorities will require two weeks to bring down the structure.

The first stage of demolition started on January 25, after which the district administration found that demolishing the 30,000-sq ft structure will take longer if done manually using earth movers and would be a costly affair. Excavators were used to drill into the thick concrete pillars of the bungalow to make space for fixing the detonators. A technical team was then called in to install the explosives.

The bungalow was built partly as a ground-plus-one structure and has a driveway, high metal fencing and a huge security gate. It includes a swimming pool, resort-like slides and expensive fittings. Situated at Kihim beach, over 90 km from Mumbai, it was declared illegal along with 58 other structures that flouted all environmental norms.
