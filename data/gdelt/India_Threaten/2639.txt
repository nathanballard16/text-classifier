The statement referred to the terror attack as just an “incident”.

In the key meeting of Pakistan’s National Security Council, chaired by the country’s Prime Minister Imran Khan after India’s strict warning over Pulwama terror attack, the premier authorised the military to respond “decisively” to any Indian misadventure. The meeting was called to discuss the security situation as the country faced worldwide flak for supporting JeM which carried out the deadly attack. The body issued a statement after the meeting saying that the country was "not involved in any way" in the Pulwama "incident", which was "conceived, planned and executed indigenously".
