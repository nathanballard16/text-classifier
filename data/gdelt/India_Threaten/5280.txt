Belgian Malinois dogs to sniff out explosives

The Visakhapatnam Police are planning to deploy trained Belgian Malinois dogs to detect landmines in interior parts of Maoist-affected areas in the Agency during elections. The trained dogs, accompanied by their police units, will soon be deployed in the Left Wing Extremism-affected areas.

Mindful of a possible threat from Maoists during elections, paramilitary forces such as Border Security Force (BSF), Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) will be arriving in the district. About 50 units of the State’s anti-Naxal elite force Greyhounds and 80 units of the District Special Party have already been mobilised at various parts. The Belgian Malinois dogs will aid the police teams in detecting explosives and landmines.

"These dogs are exclusively trained by police to detect explosives in any kind of terrain. They are fast and active, and the police units have a sufficient number of these dogs," said a senior police officer from Visakhapatnam district.
