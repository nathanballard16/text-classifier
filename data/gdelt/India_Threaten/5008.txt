Maharashtra: SP-BSP to field candidates against Prakash Ambedkar in Akola and Solapur

The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) alliance will field candidates against former MP and Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi (VBA) chief Prakash Ambedkar in Akola and Solapur, the two constituencies where he is in the fray.

The SP and BSP announced their first list of 19 candidates. SP will fight five of the 48 seats in Maharashtra, whereas the BSP will contest from 43.

While SP MLA from Saidpur in UP, Subhash Pasi, will contest the Mumbai North West seat, the BSP's BC Kamble and Rahul Sarode, both Buddhist Dalits, will fight against Ambedkar from Akola and Solapur.

Suresh Vidyaghar, who heads the BSP's Mumbai unit, said the party had significant strength in Solapur, with four corporators in the town. Ambedkar is pitted against senior Congress leader and former union home minister Sushilkumar Shinde and Lingayat math pontiff Jaysiddheshwar Swami from Solapur, while he will take on BJP MP Sanjay Dhotre and Hidayat Patel of the Congress.

Ambedkar, the grandson of Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, has tied up with the All India Majlis E Ittehadul Muslimeen led by the firebrand Owaisi brothers from Hyderabad.

The SP-BSP alliance will try and capitalise on the votes of the Muslims, who form around 14 per cent of Maharashtra's population, while the Scheduled Castes (SCs), including Buddhist Dalits, who are among the most socially and politically organised, are around 14 per cent.

The BSP, whose founder Kanshiram, began his political activism from Pune, has a committed vote base in most constituencies. However, it despite playing the spoiler, it has drawn a blank in the Lok Sabha and assembly polls in spite of a committed cadre base and a transferable share of votes, especially in Vidarbha..
