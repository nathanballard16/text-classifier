UP: Special session on Constitution Day today, all parties to attend

The Uttar Pradesh State Assembly will convene a special session on Tuesday to mark ‘Constitution Day’.

Governor Anandiben Patel will address the joint session of the Legislative Assembly and Council before proceedings begin. At the daylong session, lawmakers will discuss constitutional provisions, especially fundamental rights. Constitution was adopted on November 26, 1949 but it came into effect on January 26, 1950, celebrated as Republic Day.

Earlier, the government had called a non-stop 36-hour special session to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi birth anniversary in the first week of October. The Opposition boycotted the session, thought a few defied the party whip and attended it. This time, political parties said that there would not be any mass boycott and that they would raise their issues inside the Assembly.

“We will attend the session as it is on Constitution and raise the issues concerning Constitution inside the state Assembly as well as outside in the form of protest,” said Samajwadi Party spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary.

BSP legislative party leader Lalji Verma and Congress’s leader in the Assembly, Aradhana Mishra, said that their parties would attend the session.

However, Congress MLA and state president Ajay Kumar Lallu has convened a special lecture series on Constitution Day at the state party headquarters as well as in Kanpur on November 26.
