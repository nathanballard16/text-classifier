‘Dismiss My Government If You Can, You Will Have To Implement CAB Over My Dead Body’: Mamata Dares Centre

In a rhetoric fuelled speech, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday (16 December) vowed that come what may, she will not allow the Citizenship Amendment Bill (CAB) to be implemented in her state.

As quoted by ANI, Mamata addressed her supporters to assert that she will never allow CAB in Bengal and dared the Narendra Modi led centre to dismiss her government.

She took things to the next level by saying, “If they want to implement CAA, they will have to do it over my dead body”.
