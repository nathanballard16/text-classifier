BJP will soon start process to remove Article 370: Chugh

Ludhiana: The national general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Tarun Chugh claimed that the NDA government was committed to resolve the issue of Kashmir, and added that the process to remove Article 370 would begin soon. “Terrorism will have to be eradicated,” he stressed. Chug was here in the city to flag off the ‘Mann Ki Baat’ campaign in the Central constituency on Friday.Addressing mediapersons, he pointed out that after the Pulwama terror attack, the strategy being adopted by the Centre was coming to the fore gradually, and soon people would come to know the actual plan. He said his party had always advocated abrogation of Article 370, whereas Congress had been opposing the move. Chugh said PM Narendra Modi has given a free hand to the army, and the latter have also started their operations in Kashmir. “The government will fight terrorism in a very diplomatic way,” he added.Chugh also clarified that SAD-BJP will contest the parliamentary polls in Punjab with 10:3 seat ratio, like the previous polls. He also ruled out any possibility of seat swapping with the Akali Dal in Ludhiana.Meanwhile, in an ongoing drive initiated by the BJP, he also took suggestions from migrant labourers, who said they had come all the way from Bihar and other states for work in the city, but owing to differences in caste, they were not getting any benefits of reservation. They demanded a uniform policy on the issue. In a bid to create awareness about the various schemes of the union government, the party has deployed mobile vans in the city, and installed suggestion boxes. The leader said he would take these suggestions to the senior leadership so that more people-friendly schemes can be introduced.
