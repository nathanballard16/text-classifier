Naval Commander Warns of Iran's Improved Weapons Systems

Iran has reportedly acquired more improved and dangerous weapons systems that are "destabilizing in nature" to critical waterways, CNN reported.

According to the news outlet, Vice Adm. James Malloy, the commander of U.S. Naval Forces Central Command, issued the warning in Bahrain on Wednesday.

"They have a growing capability in cruise missiles, they have a growing capability in ballistic missiles, they have a growing capability in unmanned surfaced systems, all these things that we watch that are offensive, and destabilizing in nature," he said, CNN reported.

CNN noted unmanned surface systems, which can include explosive boats designed to target enemy vessels, have been a concern for U.S. officials. Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen used such a boat to attack a Saudi vessel, the news outlet reported, and the United States has accused Tehran of supplying Houthis with these boats.

Iran's military also has advanced sea mines, including acoustic and magnetic variants, an unnamed defense official told CNN, which also could pose a risk to maritime traffic.

The maritime area where Iran operates includes the Strait of Hormuz, linking the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Sea, which has been labeled "the world's most important oil transit chokepoint," according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, with 20 percent of the oil traded worldwide moving through the waterway, CNN reported.

Malloy said he’s “cautious,” but not worried.

"I look at our capabilities -- both U.S. capabilities here and the capabilities that the coalition brings to the fight -- and I compare and contrast with what our capabilities are to [Iran], and I don't worry,” Molloy said, CNN reported.

“I prepare and I'm prudent and I'm cautious. But I think worrying would be a strong word -- I'm pretty confident with our capabilities.”
