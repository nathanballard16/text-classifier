Reminding of the teachings of Guru Ravidas on his 108th birth anniversary, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday warned against those who highlight castes differences for their “self-interest”.

Urging people to end caste discrimination, PM Modi quoted the words of Guru Ravidas to point out that “till caste discrimination exists people will not connect with each other.”

Addressing a public meeting after laying the foundation stone of Ravidas Janmasthali (birthplace) area development project in his Lok Sabha constituency of Varanasi, he quoted the Guru: “Aisa chahun raj mai jahan miley sabbo ko aann, Chot-badon sab samaan basey, Raidas rahe prasann” (Want a rule where everyone gets food, big and small live together making Raidas content), to illustrate that his four and a half years rule was inspired by the guru’s philosophy.

PM Modi said his government’s ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas’ where development schemes reached the most marginalised irrespective of caste and creed was based on the teachings of Guru Ravidas.

Clearly targeting the alliance parties in the state, PM Modi asked people to identify those who for their self-interest create caste discrimination and promote it.

According to him BJP’s ‘New India’ which is ‘Digital India’ the youth are participating politically and socially bringing in the change.

Stating that his government focused on “panch dharma” (five tenets) he said he is determinedly pursuing to get “bachchnon ko padhai, yuva ko kamai, buzurg ko dawai, kisan ko sinchai aur jan-jan ki sunwai, (education for children, earnings for the youth, medicines for the elders, irrigation for the farmers and addressing grievances of all).
