New Delhi:

Interim Budget 2019 Live Updates: Railways Minister Piyush Goyal, who has been given the additional charge of Finance Ministry due to Arun Jaitley’s ill health, will present the Interim Budget 2019 in the Lok Sabha on Friday. With general elections looming large, the Narendra Modi government is likely to present a ‘pleased-all’ budget and tax sops for the middle class and farm relief package may figure in its last budget. According to reports, the Modi government is expected to project the country’s economic growth at around 7.5 per cent for the next financial year. However, ahead of the interim budget 2019, Fitch Ratings on Thursday warned the Modi government that India may face second consecutive year of fiscal slippage if it resorted to woo the voters by populist measures. So, will Modi go for votes over country's economic growth? Finance Minister Goyal has all the answers in his briefcase. Stay with us for full live coverage of Interim Budget 2019.
