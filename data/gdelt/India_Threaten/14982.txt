Wanawadi manhole poses accident risk

Locals place tree branches to caution commuters, want PMC to put a lid on the gutter without any further delay



An open manhole on Vitthalrao Shivarkar Road has left thousands of commuters navigating the stretch and residents of Wanawadi fuming. The gutter has been lying unattended for the past couple of days after its lid went missing, posing a high accident risk to commuters. Locals claim that while Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has turned a blind eye towards the issue, heavy rains in the last two days have increased accident risk on the busy thoroughfare. They have demanded the civic body to fix the problem before any untoward incident takes place, thanks to the open pit.



“The road witnesses heavy traffic daily. The open manhole poses huge risk to the citizens, and the downpour has only added to our collective plight. A few locals got together and placed tree branches and tyres around the open manhole to caution commuters,” said Dinesh Bansode, a resident of Wanawadi.



“The authorities are playing with the lives of the citizens. Action should be initiated against the officials concerned for such a callous attitude. An open manhole on an arterial road can prove dangerous, which also houses several educational institutions and hospitals. The situation worsens at night as the stretch isn’t welllit,” he claimed.



“Even the internal roads in the locality were dug up by the civic body for development work, which haven’t been fixed yet,” he informed.



Sanjay Gawade, assistant commissioner of Wanawadi-Ramtekdi ward, however, said that he is aware about the open manhole and assured to get it covered at the earliest. “Almost all the engineers from my ward office are stuck in the election work, with the day-to-day functioning taking a hit. However, I have instructed my staff to get the work done on priority.”
