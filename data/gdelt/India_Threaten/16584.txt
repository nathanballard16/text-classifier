Opposition attacks government over growth, walks out of Rajya Sabha

NEW DELHI: The opposition took on the government over demonetisation , hasty implementation of GST regime, rising unemployment and recent controversies surrounding government data during a debate in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday on the current economic situation in the country.After the debate which saw23 members from both the treasury and opposition benches participating, members of most parties, including Congress, TMC and the Left, staged a walkout as soon as finance minister Nirmala Sithraman started speaking, saying it was a"repeat" of her budget speech rather than addressing the concerns over the economy.Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu expressed disappointment at the walkout by members as "discussion time was extended to four hours on the insistence of the opposition". The opposition's assertion that India is heading towards a deep crisis was countered by BJP members who said it was a cyclical slowdown. Anand Sharma of Congress said the gap between the rich and poor has widened in the past few years and "wrong decisions of the government like demonetisation and hasty implementation of GST have led to the present slowdown".Jairam Ramesh, also of Congress, said it was important for the government to acknowledge the reality that for the last eight quarters, GDP growth has declined. He warned the government against "panic privatisation" of public sector undertakings (PSUs). Countering opposition charges, BJP member Sudhanshu Trivedi said the opposition's apprehensions reflected "anti-Modi" obesssion. "Yes I agree, the slowdown is there... in rough weather, what we are doing our best," Trivedi said. Suresh Prabhu, another party member, said the Indian economy can't remain insulated from global slowdown
