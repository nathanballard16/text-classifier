Citizenship Amendment Bill: Impact on Assam, West Bengal, Delhi elections

NEW DELHI: Though BJP-led NDA succeeded in getting the contentious Citizenship (Amendment Bill) ( CAB ) 2019 passed by Parliament on December 11, it is struggling to quell the unrest which has broken out in the northeast, particularly Assam , where two persons have died so far in the ongoing violent protests.CAB has been passed by Parliament at a time when assembly election is underway in Jharkhand. Three of the five phases have already been held. However, CAB will hardly have any impact in this tribal-dominated state except that BJP ’s star campaigners, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah, will try to woo the voters by claiming that the party has fulfilled one more of its election manifesto promise - some of the others being banning instant triple talaq, nullifying Article 370 and pushing for an early verdict on Ayodhya.However, three of the seven states that will go to polls in 2020 and 2021 will be impacted by CAB.Two states - Delhi and Bihar - will face assembly elections next year. While Delhi will go to polls in early 2020, Bihar will face elections towards the end of the year.Five states - Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal - will witness elections in April 2021.Of all these seven states, those which are likely to be impacted by CAB are Delhi, West Bengal and Assam because these three states are inhabited by a large number of immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh - the three countries covered under CAB.The national capital houses thousands of immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh. There are several colonies, including ‘Majnu ka Tila’, where these immigrants have been living for several years.BJP will hope to reap dividends of according citizenship to Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Christians and Parsis from the three neighbouring countries.On the other hand, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal-led AAP, which had won 67 of the 70 assembly seats in the 2015 election, will have to work harder to counter this challenge.While the first test of CAB will be held in a couple of months in Delhi, the next tests will be in West Bengal and Assam which face elections in April 2021.According to the 2001 census data, more than 55 lakh people - constituting 7 per cent of West Bengal’s population - are immigrants from other Indian states and from abroad.BJP, which has emerged as the second largest political party in West Bengal, will aim at winning the support of the immigrants of the six religions from the three neighbouring countries. It will seek to offset - to the maximum possible extent - the support of Bangladeshi Muslims which chief minister Mamata Banerjee-led TMC allegedly gets in the state.It is one of the prime reasons why Banerjee is one of the strongest critics of CAB. Also, TMC leaders vociferously protested the legislation in both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.TMC is also against Amit Shah’s plan to implement National Register of Citizens (NRC) on the national scale by 2024. Mamata Banerjee has claimed that she will never allow NRC to be implemented in West Bengal.While NRC is unlikely to see the light of the day by the time West Bengal will go to polls in 2021, CAB may get implemented by then if the Supreme Court gives a nod to it. BJP will hope to reap the benefits of the new law.On the other hand, TMC hopes to counter BJP by raising the NRC issue and consolidate the votes of the Bangladeshi Muslims in her party’s favour.However, Mamata Banerjee played the NRC cards well and TMC won the recently-held bypolls in all the three constituencies of Kharagpur Sadar, Kaliaganj and Karimpur. Significantly, it won Kharagpur Sadar and Kaliaganj Assembly for the first time since its formation 22 years ago. These were also the two seats which BJP was confident of winning.While CAB may help BJP in Delhi and West Bengal, it appears to have compounded the party’s problems in Assam.The state has witnessed several bouts of protests over the issue of immigrants, one of them being the six-year-long agitation led by All Assam Students' Union (AASU) against infiltration of foreigners from Bangladesh into the state.The agitation, which had started in 1979, came to an end with the signing of the Assam Accord in New Delhi on August 15, 1985 when Rajiv Gandhi was the prime minister. Among other things, the Accord had promised NRC for the state.However, NRC remained a dead letter for about three decades. The process to implement it gathered momentum after BJP won the 2016 assembly election and Sarbananda Sonowal became the chief minister.Monitored by the Supreme Court, the final NRC was published on August 31. Of the 3.3 crore people who had applied with the competent authorities, over 19 lakhs were left out of the final list.The final NRC came as a rude shock to BJP and the locals who had expected a much larger number of people to be excluded from it. Secondly, of the 19 lakh people who could not make it in the final NRC, a large number of them are Bangladeshi Hindus. While Assam finance minister and some other BJP leaders claim that only 5.40 lakh Hindus have been left out of NRC, others put the figure at 13 lakhs.Faced with such an awkward situation, BJP rejected the Assam NRC and Home Minister Amit Shah announced that a nationwide NRC would be prepared before the next Lok Sabha election in 2024.The Modi government also went ahead with implementing CAB to include the six minority communities in the three neighbouring Islamic countries.However, this has sparked a wave of protests in the Northeastern states and Assam in particular. The Assamese feel they have already suffered immensely all these years due to the influx of Bangladeshi Muslims. They feel they will further lose their land, language, culture and jobs if immigrants from other religions are allowed to settle down in the state on the basis of CAB.The locals grudge that the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which gives special rights of administration to the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram, covers only 35 per cent of the state’s land mass.Moreover, the Assamese people also complain that Inner Line Permit (ILP), which does not allow outsiders to stay in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram without valid documents, is not applicable to their state. Manipur has become the fourth Northeastern state to be covered under ILP. While replying to the debate in Parliament on CAB, Amit Shah announced that ILP was being extended to Manipur.CAB has fuelled the discontent of the local Assamese people who already felt suspicious about NRC. The state administration and BJP leaders are trying their best to douse the fire.PM Modi sought to assuage the feelings of the Assamese by telling them that they did not have anything to worry about because of CAB.Though assembly election is about a year away, for the moment CAB has certainly given some anxious moments to BJP.
