India government ordered to pay residents compensation for enduring toxic smog

India's state governments must pay residents compensation if they fail to provide clean air and water, the country's Supreme Court has has ruled.

India’s capital has endured record-breaking levels of air pollution over the past two months.

Its air quality index – which measures the concentration of air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide and particulates – has regularly exceeded the safe level set by the World Health Organization more than tenfold since the beginning of November.

Despite introducing an odd-even number plate rule to limit the number of cars on its roads, activists argued this wasn’t enough, with the air quality index in the city remaining at 339 on Monday.

“We urge governments to speed up the adoption of renewable energy and electric mobility, public and commercial, to help put an end to the pollution crisis and risk to human health,” said Jarnail Singh, the India Director of The Climate Group.

The judicial court has also ordered the Delhi government to come up with a plan to install two giant air purification towers in the city over the next ten days.
