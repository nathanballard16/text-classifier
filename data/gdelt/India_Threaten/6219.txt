Don't be rash, vote in unison, Bengal clerics tell Muslims

KOLKATA: Prominent Muslim clerics in West Bengal have issued a cautiously worded message exhorting the community to vote carefully, a move that political analysts feel is an attempt to prevent a division in Muslim votes and to blunt the strategy of certain political outfits attempting to marginalise the community constitutionally and politically.

The appeal neither identifies any candidate the community should put its weight behind nor cautions them against any political party. But it urges Muslims to think carefully before casting their votes as a mistake will mean a wait of five years before it can be rectified.

The message has been signed by All India Milli Council president Qari Fazlur Rahman, who leads the Eid prayers on Kolkata's Red Road, and vice-president Qari Mohammad Shafique, also the imam of the prestigious Nakhoda Mosque.

On Saturday, TOI reported Easter messages from the Christian clergy similarly urging their community to vote out hatred and choose peace.

"In a democracy there is no substitute to elections. It gives us an opportunity to elect a government every five years. But if we make a mistake there will be a wait of five years before we can rectify it. So be careful and think before you decide who you are voting for," the appeal reads.

The message acquires significance as Muslims comprise a little less than a third of Bengal's voters, and if the community's votes consolidate in favour of a candidate or party, the chance of that candidate getting elected increases manifold.

"It is our duty to serve both our religion and our nation. So besides possessing religious knowledge we also need political maturity to elect the right candidate and a party which will work for the progress and safety of every citizen of this country," Qasmi said.
