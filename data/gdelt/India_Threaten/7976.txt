NIA team in Colombo to probe IS cases of TN, Kerala

NEW DELHI: A two-member NIA team is in Colombo as part of investigation into two Islamic State-related cases involving modules hailing from Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu and Kasaragod, Kerala. The purpose of the overseas probe is to unearth any links between the two modules and Sri Lankan bombers behind the Easter Sunday bombings.NIA had last month arrested Riyas Aboobacker, a resident of Palakkad in Kerala, for being in touch with some members of an Islamic State-inspired module from Kasaragod including its leader Abdul Rashid Abdullah, who is now based in Nangarhar in Afghanistan and having intentions to carry out a suicide attack in Kerala. Aboobacker, during his questioning by NIA, said he had been following speeches and videos of Sri Lanka bomber and National Thowheed Jamaat leader Zahran Hashim for more than a year.Earlier, NIA had come across videos of Hashim's jihad-inspiring speeches from computer resources seized during raids at premises of six accused in IS Coimbatore module case. The module was allegedly planning to attack Hindu leaders in Tamil Nadu.Aboobacker's arrest follows raids at his residence in Palakkad as well as of two other suspects in Kasaragod. The raids followed inputs that a group of four persons had been in contact with IS Kasaragod module accused Abdul Rashid Abdulla, Ashfaq Majeed, Abdul Khayoom etc who had already migrated to Afghanistan and Syria.During interrogation, Aboobacker disclosed that he had been in online contact with absconding accused Abdul Rashid Abdulla @ Abu Isa for a long time and had been following his audio clips including the clip which he had circulated on social media platform instigating others to carry out terror attacks in India.The ISIS Kasaragod case was registered in July 2016 following the disappearance of 15 youths from Kasaragod and their subsequent migration to ISIS territory in Afghanistan and Syria.As per NIA chargesheet in the case, Abdulla and his wife Ayisha had travelled to Sri Lanka in February 2016 to attend classes in Islamic studies at Al-Quma Arabic college in Colombo. Two other couples from India, Bestin Vincent and his wife Mariyam and Ashfaq Majeed and Shamsiya were also there with Abdulla attending the same course.However, when the teacher found out that Abdulla, Bestin and Ashfak were propagating ISIS ideology and views of jihad among other students, they were expelled from the college and returned to India on April 14, 2016.It was after Abdulla returned from Sri Lanka that he started arranging resources for travel of 15 of his radicalised followers to IS territory between May 31 and July 5, 2016.Late last year, NIA while carrying out searches at premises of six accused in ISIS Coimbatore module case allegedly involving a plot to target Hindu leaders in south India, seized computer devices with jihadi videos of Zahran Hashim. NIA alerted the Indian intelligence agencies which developed the information and generated intelligence on terror attacks being plotted in Sri Lanka. The intelligence was shared with Sri Lankan authorities on three different occasions, including hours before the bombings.
