Earlier in December last year, a Lucknow-bound Indigo flight was grounded at the Mumbai airport after a passenger informed that there was a bomb in the aircraft. However, the bomb threat turned out to be false and the flight departed safely.

The Indigo flight 6E 3612, carrying 169 passengers on board was scheduled to depart at 6.05 in the morning.

An Indigo spokesperson said that the passenger, who raised the bomb threat was reportedly found to be of unsound mind.

In another incident of a bomb scare, a passenger was detained at Jaipur airport in August last year after he claimed that he was carrying a bomb in his luggage.

The passenger, identified as Jai Prakash Choudhary reportedly raised a hoax bomb threat as he was asked to undergo a second round of security check. He was later handed over to the police for further interrogation.
