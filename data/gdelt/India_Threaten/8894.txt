The OPD services took a hit across the state as the Haryana Civil Medical Services (HCMS) Association and the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Monday observed a day’s strike and took out protest marches in solidarity with their West Bengal counterparts.

Health Minister Anil Vij said, “The arrogance of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has vitiated the environment. Instead of adopting a dictatorial attitude, the Chief Minister should have addressed doctors’ grievances.”

Dr Jasbir Singh Parmar, president, HCMS Association, said: “Doctors cannot work under life-threatening conditions. These acts of assault on doctors across the country are the failure of the authorities. We request the Haryana Government to resolve pending issues of HCMS doctors which were agreed upon in the past to avoid the West-Bengal-like situation.”

He added, “It was only a one-day strike. The casualty ward, post-mortem, labour room, emergency and OT services were not affected.”

Dr Punita Hasija, president, IMA Faridabad, said the diagnostic laboratories in Faridabad joined the one-day strike. A protest march was taken out.

In Karnal, doctors of government hospitals, including that of the Civil Hospital and Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College (KCGMC), took out a peace march in the city.

In Panipat, doctors sporting black badges held a protest march on the NH-44. Dr Anjali, IMA president Panipat, and Dr Narain Dabas, district president, HCMS Association, led the protest.

Dr Anjali said, “The objective is not to harass patients, but to demand a strong law for the safety of doctors. More than 30 doctors have been murdered in the past 10 years across the country.”
