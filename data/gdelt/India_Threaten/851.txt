Thailand seeks custody of Chambal turtle smuggler

STF has got a letter from Thailand, which says the case against him is still open in that country and they have initiated process of extradition. Murugesan's alleged role in the smuggling surfaced after the arrest of a businessman for stealing red-crowned roofed turtle from a breeding centre in Morena district. Thailand airport police had earlier issued an international arrest warrant against Murugesan.STF objects to his bail plea, alleging that he was behind smuggling of hundreds of endangered turtles from the state. Murugesan was arrested by MPSTF-wildlife from Chennai on January 31, 2018, for smuggling endangered red crowned roofed turtles from Morena and has been in Sagar jail ever since. STF has arrested more than 20 people in this case so far.
