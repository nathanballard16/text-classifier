PM Imran warns India from conducting a 'false flag operation'

ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday warned India of a 'befitting response' in case it decided to conduct a false flag operation to "divert attention from its domestic chaos".

Taking to Twitter, the prime minister addressed the mass protests in India over its controversial citizenship bill.

According to the new amendment to the Indian constitution, people belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, or Parsi and Christian faiths, and fleeing ‘persecution’ in Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, may be granted Indian citizenship. There is no similar provision for Muslim refugees, enraging the Muslim minority of India.



Khan said that for the past five years, India has been moving towards "Hindu Rashtra with its Hindutva Supremacist fascist ideology".

The prime minister said that a bloodbath can be expected anytime the siege is lifted from occupied Kashmir.

Prime Minister Imran said that in case India decided to conduct a false flag operation to divert attention from its domestic crisis "to divert attention from its domestic chaos plus whip up war hysteria to mobilise Hindu nationalism" Pakistan will have no option but to give a 'befitting response' to India.
