The “bomb threat” to Air India 191 Mumbai-Newark flight, which made a precautionary landing at London Stansted Airport, was a hoax, an official of the airline told news agency Reuters, adding that the flight has landed safely at London and all the passengers were safe.

The official added that the call received at Mumbai Airport was a hoax and that there was no security threat to the plane.

“AI 191 Mumbai-Newark of June 27 has made a precautionary landing at London’s Stansted airport due to a bomb threat,” the airline had written on Twitter earlier. However, Air India later deleted its tweet.

United Kingdom’s Ministry of Defence said that British fighter jets safely escorted the Air India plane to Stansted airport.

The London Stansted Airport, in a statement, said that the flight landed at around 10:15 hours approximately with the Essex Police in attendance. It added that the flight was parked on an isolated stand, away from the normal airport operations.

“An Air India Boeing 777 diverted into London Stansted Airport at approximately 1015 and landed safely with Essex Police in attendance. It is parked on an isolated stand away from the normal airport operations,” the airport wrote on Twitter.

“Our runway has now re-opened and is fully operational following a precautionary landing of Air India flight,” it added.

UK’s aerial warfare force Royal Air Force tweeted about the incident.

“Quick Reaction Alert Typhoons were scrambled earlier from @RAFConingsby to intercept a civilian aircraft; this was safely escorted to Stansted. The Typhoons were authorised to travel at supersonic speed and any inconvenience caused to local residents is regretted,” the warfare force wrote on Twitter.
