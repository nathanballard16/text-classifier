Yasin Malik’s wife wants to return; daughter says ‘I want to see my father’

Talking to media at Lahore Press Club, as per local reports, Ms. Mullick revealed that India was keeping Mr. Malik as a prisoner which led him to go on a hunger strike.

She said that Mr. Malik went on hunger strike for 12 days due to which his health worsened. Calling an all-party conference on an abrupt basis, she has demanded “to raise her voice for Kashmir issue on global forums to end the atrocities faced by helpless Kashmiris.”

She added that the Kashmiris will fight their case on the International platform and also demanded Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan to voice for justice.

On this occasion, Malik’s seven-year-old daughter also expressed her wishes of seeing her father in India.

“I want to see my father alongside me when I spend my birthday”, the seven-year-old said.
