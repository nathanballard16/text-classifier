Pakistan demands UN probe of India actions in Kashmir, fears ‘genocide’

GENEVA: Pakistan’s foreign minister demanded Tuesday that the UN launch an investigation into the situation in Indian Kashmir, warning that a “genocide” could be looming in the Muslim-majority region.

“The people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir are apprehending the worst,” Shah Mehmood Qureshi told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, adding that “I shudder to mention the word genocide here, but I must.”
