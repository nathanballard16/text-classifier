‘Give peace a chance’, Imran Khan to Narendra Modi

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to “give peace a chance” and assured him that he “stands by” his words and would “immediately act” if New Delhi provided Islamabad with “actionable intelligence” on the Pulwama terror attack.

The appeal came just a day after PM Modi threw a challenge to Khan, asking him to act honourably by bringing to justice those behind the strike.

In response to Modi’s comments. A statement released by the Pakistan Prime Minister’s Office said, “PM Imran Khan stand by his words that if India gives us actionable intelligence, we will immediately act.”

“In my meeting with PM Modi in December 2015, we had agreed that since poverty alleviation is a priority for our region, we would not allow any terrorist incident to derail peace efforts, however long before Pulwama, these efforts were derailed in September 2018. Sadly, now peace remains elusive due to elections in India. PM Modi should give peace a chance,” the statement added.

Khan had assured India on February 19 that he would act against the committers of the Pulwama terror attack if it shared “actionable intelligence” with Islamabad but warned New Delhi against launching any “revenge” retaliatory action.

India said Imran Khan’s offer to investigate the attack if provided proof is a “lame excuse”.

“It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan and these should be enough proof for Pakistan to take action,” the Ministry of External Affairs said.
