Zaira Wasim bids goodbye to Bollywood after working for 5 years

NEW DELHI: Actor Zaira Wasim of ‘Dangal’ fame has put to rest claims that her social media accounts may have been hacked by reaffirming that she personally handles them.“This to clarify that none of my social media accounts were or are hacked and are being handled by me personally. Kindly refrain from believing or sharing claims that state otherwise! Thanks,” Wasim tweeted around 5pm on Monday. In other words, she reaffirmed that her decision to quit Bollywood for “religious reasons” was final.Her announcement on Sunday that she quit acting found supporters and detractors on social media. Among those who backed her was former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah while actor Raveena Tandon criticised her decision. Actor Anupam Kher said he “respects” her decision though it “saddens” him. Soon after Wasim’s first post, Omar had tweeted, “Who are any of us to question @ZairaWasimmm’s choices? It’s her life to do with as she pleases. All I will do is wish her well & hope that whatever she does makes her happy.”‘I think we should leave Zaira alone’However, actor Raveena Tandon posted on Monday, “Doesn’t matter if two film olds are ungrateful to the industry that have given them all. Just wish they’d exit gracefully and keep their regressive views to themselves.”Filmmaker Onir wrote, “It’s someone’s right to choose what profession one finds happiness in. Wish the decision did not have to be accompanied with a sermon on “good way of life” #ZairaWasim. The opposite is a huge struggle for many who are prevented to make the choice citing the idea as anti-religion.”“My first reaction was, if she has taken this decision in the name of religion then maybe this is not her decision. Maybe she is forced to take that decision, that was my first thought. But it is her life, if she wants to take that decision, I respect her decision. I think we should leave her alone,” actor Anupam Kher told ANI.In a detailed post on various social media platforms, Wasim had said that “her relationship with her religion was threatened” because of her career. Her secretary Tuhin Mishra, however, had told TOI on Sunday that she might not have written the post.Senior Congress politician Randeep Surjewala also supported Wasim’s decision but added a word of caution. “While I respect Zaira Wasim’s decision to quit films & her creative liberty, faith has nothing to do with artistic expression. Such remarks give fodder to bigots on either side of the divide...,” he tweeted.
