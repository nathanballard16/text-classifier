As India Inc steps into the New Year, staying in step with rapid technological changes and skilling of staff are key focus areas for companies, as are driving diversity and dealing more effectively with a millennial workforce. Human resources heads of leading companies across sectors weigh in on the top HR trends for 2019. Sreeradha D Basu & Rica Bhattacharyya report.Large IT services companies have pursued a templated framework to drive learning and career growth. However, technology can bring in customised and personalised learning options for individuals and get people to learn continuously. There will be a greater focus on flexible career development options.More than 80% of organisations have some form of structured learning and development programme, said Mettl’s State of Workplace Learning and Development Report 2018.A movement towards greater agile development will also lead to more agile performance management by integrating real-time data and crowdsourced inputs from the team.In rewards, we will see a greater focus on key skills, specialist and high-performing talent, and on longer-term retention levers such as benefits and stock plans.In India, the critical need for organisations to make sure that they have the right leadership will never change. Going forward, this will even more be a high priority for companies and will further increase because of the sheer pace of growth in the country.Millennials in the workforce will force all of us to relook at things in traditional human resources such as compensation, development, team formation, etc. We have to find out ways to keep up with the change and be at the forefront of managing the expectations of the millennial workforce.43% of millennials envision leaving their jobs within two years; only 28% seek to stay beyond five years, according to Deloitte India Millennial Survey 2018.With technology disruptions, expect employees to consistently stay relevant on the skill curve. The technologies to help people collaborate are helping people stay connected but also isolating them from real connection. HR teams will have to figure out how they make employee well-being a priority and ensure their employees are at peak energies physically and mentally, and their hearts are truly engaged.2019 should see CHROs looking at their talent acquisition strategy more closely to enhance candidate experience. This means actively investing in strengthening their employer brand digitally to ensure the value proposition stands out to their prospective talent pools. Virtual, AR, chatbots and application self-selection tools will all help create a highly personalised candidate experience.Employers in India expect workplace automation to increase to 27% from 14% in three years, higher than global and APAC average, as per Wills Towers Watson Global Future of Work Survey.Being engaged and leading intelligently with predictive and prospective analytics, rather than lagging and reacting, will be the key change in HR. Maths, quantitative analysis, statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence will be used across years of employee data to make strong suggestions. This data will talk only if a company is able to rejig it and extrapolate information to suit the current context.The workforce will move into a gig-engagement structure. Employees will be looking for shorter stints with cross-functional learning on their own time-terms. There will no longer be a restricted 9-5 long-term construct. Factor in changing expectations and therefore innovative well-being mechanisms to make employees know that the company cares and that the employees matter.There are too many things on the long list of things to be done by HR. Prioritise ruthlessly and stay close to the most urgent business, people strategy and issues. Everything else can be managed through automation or through enabling tools.39% of surveyed candidates and hiring managers in India favour freelance roles, found Kelly Services survey ‘Gig Economy: How Free Agents are Redefining Work’Getting HR a seat at the table: Since HR emerged as a separate function, one of the things it has grappled with is how to get a seat at the table. HR has been seen as a function that keeps the kitchen clean and rarely recognised as one that makes a strategic contribution.HR has rarely been the first choice for the best and brightest when it came to either education or career choices.And HR has never been a deep discipline calling for a rigorous study unlike, say, medicine, engineering or law.Driving diversity and inclusion: Companies will also be more thoughtful about enhancing diversity and inclusion as well as creating safe and secure workplaces for women. The #MeToo campaigns in the closing of months of 2018 will accelerate this in 2019.A survey of Indian and multinational companies by ProEve showed that the share of women in middle management is 17%, in senior management 14% and further down to 12% at the top level.
