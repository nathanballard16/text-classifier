Mandi, July 17

Four pilgrims were critically injured as parts of a glacier broke off and collapsed on way to the Shrikhand Mahadev shrine in Himachal Pradesh's Kullu district on Tuesday night.

The incident occured at Nain Sarovar near Parwati bag. Considered tougher than the Amarnath pilgrimage, the ten-day Shrikhand Mahadev yatra had begun on July 15.

The melting of the glacier, rain and landslides caused several pilgrims to be stranded for hours. The yatra has been temporarily suspended.

Police said a rescue operation was launched immediately after the incident.

The injured pilgrims were brought to Parwati Bag where first aid was provided to them.

About 60 pilgrims were rescued from the glacier point and were lifted towards Bhim Dwar.

The injured pilgrims are: Rajiv from Ludhiana, Vivek and Subhash Patel from Pune and another pilgrim from Maharashtra. Another pilgrim, Divyangni Vyas, was rescued after she suffered from suffocation.

Shrikhand Mahadev is revered by Hindus as one of the abodes of Lord Shiva. The Shivalingam is situated at a height of 18,750 feet above sea level in the lap of the Himalayas.

A base camp for registering pilgrims has been set up at Sinhgad. —with PTI
