Will fight for the people of Northeast — Sangma

Imphal, March 29 (PTI): Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K Sangma on Friday said the National People’s Party (NPP) would fight for the people of the Northeast to give them an effective voice.

Addressing a public meeting at Lamka town in Churanchandpur district, Sangma said since the states of the region have fewer Parliamentary seats as compared to bigger states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, “Sometimes, Delhi does not take us seriously.”

Sangma kick tarted campaign on behalf of Thangmimlen Kipgen, who is contesting on outer Manipur constituency.

The Meghalaya chief minister had recently drew praise for taking a strong stand against Citizenship Amendment Bill, which could not be tabled in Rajya Sabha and is destined to collapse with the end of the present term of the Lok Sabha on June 3.

In addition to Meghalaya, the NPP is contesting general election in other north-eastern states.
