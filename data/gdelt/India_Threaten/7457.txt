BJP warns Kamal Haasan of backlash, rebukes Congress

Chennai: BJP state unit president Tamilisai Soundararajan took a swipe apparently at the Congress for supporting Kamal Haasan in the controversy over remarks independent India's first terrorist was a Hindu and his name was Nathuram Vinayak Godse, who killed Mahatma Gandhi.

Those who lost their leader to extremism were now backing the actor on his controversial statement, she said, apparently referring to the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi by the LTTE.

BJP national secretary H Raja lashed out at Kamal for defending his Godse statement in his poll campaign speech on Wednesday.

“India became independence on 15 August, 1947 and Mahatma was assassinated on 30 January, 1948. What has Kamal Haasan to say about the rape and murder of thousands of Hindus during the partition? Is he (Kamal) aware of a place called Pallapatti in TN, where the Jamath had issued a diktat to the Hindu men they should not come out in the evening time when their (Muslim) women go out for shopping?" Raja asked.

He said, "Even now, there is no police station at Pallapatti and if someone has to make a complaint, he/she must approach the Jamath".

Meanwhile, a Vaishnavite saint warned Kamal that if he continued to make such remarks, the people would rise in anger.

"He is saying such things for his own benefit. He is a good actor, and is now acting in public. All Hindus are against him and if he repeats such statements, his free movement will be hindered. We will hold protests against him," Chendalankara Sampath Kumara Ramanuja Jeeyar of Mannargudi told reporters at Tiruchy.

He wondered if Kamal was hobnobbing with banned Islamist outfits and was therefore making such remarks against Hindus.
