Alok Nath To Play A Judge In A Movie On Sexual Harassment & Irony Got Crushed Under The Hammer

The #MeToo movement in India brought about a certain level of awareness and power, which was much needed in order to break the silence of the victims and declare to the world that silence is not a sign of weakness.

Actress Tanushree Dutta led the fight when she accused Nana Patekar of harassing her during a movie shoot. While Bollywood stayed quiet for a long time, it eventually opened a can of worms after many celebrities were called out in the light of the movement. One such name which surprised and shocked everyone in equal measure was that of Alok Nath's.

He was accused of harassment by director-producer Vinta Nanda which the actor clearly denied. However, in a bizarre incident of irony being lost somewhere, as per the latest report, Alok Nath will be essaying the role of a judge in a movie titled '#MainBhi' which is about fighting against sexual harassment. Yeah, weird right?

The movie is directed by Nasir Khan and in an interview, actor Khalid Siddiqui explained the concept. “The film deals with child molestation, a subject that hasn't been tapped on screen often, particularly with regard to boys. My character, along with the other, are affected by incidents that change our lives. We hope the film starts a debate on the subject.”

When Alok Nath was contacted by Mirror, he said, “I'm not doing any films at the moment. This was something I shot for a while ago. Is there a problem? You sound sad that I'm doing a film. It's a puny role for poor producers, let it release.”

Well, looks like irony will get crushed under his gavel in the movie for sure.
