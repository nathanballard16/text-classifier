Due to the well marked low-pressure area persisting over northeast Rajasthan and adjoining areas of northwest Madhya Pradesh and southwest Uttar Pradesh, the region is likely to receive heavy to very heavy rains in the next 24 hours. It is very likely to move gradually northwestwards along the monsoon trough, according to Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). As many as five people have been killed in rain-related incidents in the past 24 hours in Rajasthan creating a flood-like situation in Hadauti region, an official said told PTI.

The weather department Friday forecast very heavy rainfall in Idukki, Kannur and Kasargod districts of Karnataka. The toll in the second spell of the southwest monsoon rose to 104 with 36 missing across the state. The IMD has also issued a yellow warning in Himachal Pradesh today.

Incessant rains in various parts of Madhya Pradesh in the last three days left low-lying areas inundated as several rivers and streams were in spate. In some places, including Bhopal, the authorities had to open the sluice gates of reservoirs to release water after they were filled up to their maximum storage capacity, an official said.

Meanwhile, in Delhi, the department has forecast generally cloudy sky with moderate rain. The maximum and minimum temperatures is between 34 and 25 degrees Celsius, respectively, today.
