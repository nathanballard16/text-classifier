India Ready to Go Extra '35 Miles' for Single Hermit Voter in the Jungle

"We have a presiding officer overseeing the polling station. There are two polling officers on duty during polling time and they are accompanied by a booth-level officer," Prajapati added.

"We travel some 35 kilometres within the jungle to reach the spot where the polling is to take place. We do this under Supreme Court directives which say that a polling station ought to be within 2 kilometres' walking distance from where voters live," he added.

"We use rooms from the forest department as a ballot station," he informed.

The terrain is rough and it is not unusual for one to see wild animals roaming free in the vicinity, including a pride of lions.

"As the polling booth is in a thickly forested area, there is no mobile connection or internet connectivity. We use a wireless connection belonging to the forest department for all our communication needs," explained the election officer.
