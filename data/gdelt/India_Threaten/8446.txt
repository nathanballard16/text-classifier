JD(U) wonâ€™t be part of NDA outside Bihar, will fight upcoming polls in Delhi, Haryana alone

New Delhi:

The ongoing tiff between Nitish Kumar’s JD(U) and the BJP seems to be reaching its boiling point, with the earlier announcing not the be part of the ruling coalition outside the state. The JD(U), during its National Executive Meet on Sunday, also decided to fight the upcoming elections in Delhi, Haryana, Jharkhand and Jammu and Kashmir on its own.

The decision by the JD(U) comes days after its vice president and poll strategist Prashant Kishor's closed-door meeting with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to finalise the deal to manage Trinamool Congress' poll campaign for 2021 Assembly Elections in the state.

There have been reports of rift between the BJP and the JD(U) reportedly after no ministerial post was given to the party in the centeral government. Recently, the day when Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar extended his Cabinet by inducting eight new JDU MLAs, party general secretary KC Tyagi said that his party will never be part of NDA led Union Cabinet in future.

"The proposal that was given was unacceptable to the JDU, therefore, we have decided that in future also JDU will never be a part of the NDA led Union Cabinet, this is our final decision," Tyagi had said.
