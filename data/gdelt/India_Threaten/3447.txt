India on Thursday called Pakistan’s bluff and showed evidence of the use of F-16 fighter jets despite the US having banned Islamabad from using these in any offensive role.

“There is enough evidence to show F-16s were used in this mission and Pakistan is trying to hide this fact,” Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor said at a press briefing here late in the evening. He was talking about Pakistan Air Force (PAF) breaching the LoC on Wednesday.

“The fact remains one PAF F-16 was shot down by an IAF MiG-21 Bison aircraft,” he said. The IAF officer was countering Pakistan’s claim that F-16s were not used and no Pakistani plane was downed by Indian Air Force.

The IAF presented parts of AMRAAM missile, carried by the PAF only on F-16s, which was recovered from the east of Rajouri in Indian territory.

Flanked by Major General Surinder Mahal and Rear Admiral DS Gujral, Air Vice Marshal Kapoor said they had credible proof that target was destroyed in their strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Balakot, Pakistan. “It is premature to give the number of casualties,” he said.

Asked whether evidence would be released, the IAF officer said it was upto the government to decide. About Pakistan’s gesture to release IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, he said it was in consonance with the Geneva Convention.

The IAF officer went on to question Pakistan saying it had claimed to have intentionally dropped weapons in open space where there was no human presence or military posts. “The fact is that the PAF aircraft targeted military installations. However, they were intercepted by IAF fighter aircraft that thwarted their plans,” he said, adding that PAF bombs had fallen in Indian Army formation compounds.
