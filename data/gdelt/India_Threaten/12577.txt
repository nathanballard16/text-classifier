India will not tolerate interference in its internal affairs: Vice-President

‘This has to be understood by one and all, including the neighbour abetting terrorism’

India will not tolerate anybody interfering in its internal affairs was a message Vice-President M.Venkaiah Naidu sought to drive home on Saturday.

“India has never attacked any country [and] in future also we are not going to attack any country. But, at the same time if anybody interferes in our internal affairs we will give them a fitting reply which they will not be able to forget the rest of their life,” he said, addressing a conference on economic diplomacy in the age of disruptions at the Indian School of Business (ISB) here.

“This has to be understood by one and all, including the neighbour who is aiding, abetting, funding, training terrorism, it is bad for them and bad for the world community. We don’t want to interfere in the internal affairs of any country and don’t want any country to interfere in our internal affairs; that is our policy. We want to have friendly relations,” he said.

The Vice-President, who during the course of his speech dwelt on various aspects of India said, “We are not war mongers. Never went on a war against any country… [and] believed in the principle of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam.”
