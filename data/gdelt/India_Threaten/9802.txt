India's Anti-Terror Police Bust Al-Qaeda-Linked Module Planning to Hit Scientific Bodies

India's major strategic bodies such as Indian Space Research Organistion (ISRO) and several defence manufacturing units are located in Bengaluru.

The module was busted a few days ahead of ISRO's second moon mission for which a countdown had already started at the southern launch facility. Based on intelligence reports, Jamat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB)- an affiliate of al-Qaeda- has been planning to spread its network in South India, with an overarching motive to establish a caliphate.

"NIA recovered five fabricated hand grenades, one timer device, three electric circuits, suspected explosive substance, different components for making IEDs/rockets and several other incriminating materials", the agency said in a statement while adding that these hand grenades were made as a part of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts in different parts of the state.
