Tamil Nadu, Coimbatore on high terror alert

Tamil Nadu and adjacent Coimbatore have been put on high alert following intelligence inputs by India's federal security agencies that six Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists, including one from Pakistan, may have entered Coimbatore, Indian media reports today said.

The Tamil Nadu home department sounded the alert after they were tipped off by federal intelligence agencies that the terrorists had probably entered the state from neighbouring Sri Lanka for carrying out attacks in Tamil Nadu or Kerala, reports our New Delhi correspondent.

"While one terrorist is from Pakistan, five others are from Sri Lanka. They have come here through the sea route," the reports said quoting police sources.

The Pakistani national has been identified as Ilyas Anwar.

Authorities in Tamil Nadu and Coimbatore have beefed up security in hotels, airports, malls, railway stations and bus stands.

Meanwhile, the Indian National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested at least 10 men suspected to have links with ISIS after conducting raids at seven locations across Coimbatore and in Tamil Nadu in the past few months.

One of those arrested was identified as Mohammed Azarudeen, the alleged mastermind of ISIS' Tamil Nadu module, who allegedly had links to the April 22 Easter suicide blasts in Sri Lanka that claimed 250 lives.

The NIA had received information that the accused and their associates were allegedly propagating ISIS ideology on social media and recruiting young people.

Cases were registered against Azarudeen and five other men from Coimbatore for planning terror attacks in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
