TMC leader distributes cheques for votes, says what's wrong with it

A Panchayat pradhan of Trinamool Congress was caught on camera distributing cheques to farmers and demanding votes for the party ahead of the Lok Sabha polls. Modassur Hossain, the Trinamool pradhan, also threatened the farmers with dire consequences if they do not vote for his party.

Modassur Hossain, the pradhan of a Trinamool-ruled panchayat in South 24 Parganas district, distributed cheques ranging from Rs 2,000 to Rs 5,000 to the farmers. He categorically stated that these cheques are being given by Didi (Mamata Banerjee) and so, "you have to vote for us [Trinamool Congress] in the Lok Sabha election 2019."

The Trinamool pradhan gave out the cheques to around 100 families in the first round. He would reportedly distribute the cheques to 600 more families.

"You should keep in mind that the cheques have been given by Didi [Mamata Banerjee] and since we have given you the cheques, you have to give us your votes in the Lok Sabha polls. I am saying this clearly that if you all do not vote for us then we will take action against you. Don't forget that we have copies of original voter ID cards with us," he threatened the farmers.

Modassur Hossain further warned the farmers, saying they would not even receive the amount of Rs two lakh if they didn't vote for the Trinamool Congress.

"Our candidate is Mimi Chakraborty, you have to give your vote to the "Joraphool" [TMC symbol]. In the next slot, cheques of Rs 2,000 and Rs 4,000 would be distributed. Also, our candidate Mimi Chakraborty will come to the Mela ground on Thursday, you all have to come there also."

Speaking to India Today TV, Modassur Hossain admitted that he did distribute cheques to the villagers for votes. "We are giving cheques and hence, we will ask for votes as well. They will have to vote for us. What is wrong with it?"
