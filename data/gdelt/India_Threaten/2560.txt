The Technology 202: House Democrats want answers from Facebook on privacy of 'closed' health groups

— Cisco said in a report that U.S. policies have given the United States a strong position in the race to dominate 5G wireless networks, The Post's Brian Fung reported. The development of 5G is expected to make download speeds faster and help boost new technology including self-driving vehicles. “The U.S. has made a good start in changing policies to support the deployment of 5G, and as we look around the rest of the world, policy changes of the type we’ve seen here in the U.S. have not yet happened,” said Mary Brown, senior director of government affairs at Cisco, according to my colleague. “We do expect that’s going to be changing over the next 12 to 18 months, and so the race to 5G is very real.”
