Indian soldier who fell victim to 'honey-trap' arrested for passing on secrets to Pakistani intelligence

An Indian army soldier has been arrested for passing on sensitive military information to Pakistani intelligence after he was skillfully ‘honey trapped’ on social media.

The arrest comes days after India’s army chief, General Bipin Rawat, warned of an epidemic of ‘catfishing’ attempts against his forces.

Sombir Singh, 22, who was apprehended last week from Jaisalmer, adjoining the Pakistan border, had entered into a relationship via Facebook with a female claiming to be an officer with the Indian Army Nursing Cops posted at Jammu in northern India.

Calling herself Anika Chopra, she began sending Mr Singh intimate messages seven months ago.

Flattered at being wooed by a female officer, the soldier responded enthusiastically and within days the two were exchanging erotic posts and explicit photographs, officials from Rajasthan state police said.

After a few weeks of chatting online, the girl gradually began asking Mr Singh for details about military operations.

He responded by sending her classified pictures of Indian tanks, armoured personnel carriers, assorted weaponry in the area and the location of army formations, all of which was highly classified.

Police said preliminary investigations had revealed that Singh was paid the equivalent of around £56 for his information, which was initially transferred into his brother’s account to evade suspicion. He later transferred this money into his e-wallet, police said.
