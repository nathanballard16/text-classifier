Despite having avenged the killings of 49 CRPF Jawans, India is still in deep sorrow due to the loss of brave sons of soil. Meanwhile, amid tight security in the state of Jammu and Kashmir terrorists have struck again and killed an Indian Army soldier outside his home in Pingleena village of Pulwama on Wednesday.

The 25-year-old who was shot at was rushed to nearby by hospital where doctors declared him brought dead on arrival. There has been no immediate claim of responsibility of the act.

This is not the first time terror outfits in Kashmir have targeted Kashmiris who have been serving in the Indian security force and Jammu and Kashmir Police.

Last year another soldier from the JKLI was abducted and killed by terrorists.

Rifleman Aurangzeb was on way to his home in Poonch to celebrate Eid when he was abducted by terrorists.

Later his bullet-ridden body was recovered from Gusoo Pulwama, with fifteen bullet wounds.

The Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists who abducted Aurangzeb, released a video in which the army man was seen being questioned by his captors.

One of the terrorists was heard saying that they have abducted him to avenge the killing of their man Wasim Shah in October 2017.

On the occasion of 72nd Independence Day in 2018, India honored the salin rifleman with the prestigious Shaurya Chakra for gallantry.

In 2017, another young Kashmiri army officer, Lieutenant Ummer Fayaz was abducted and killed by Hizbul.

Terror outfits including Hizbul have in the past issued warnings to Kashmiris against siding with India and joining the India Army and Police.
