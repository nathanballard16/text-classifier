Srinagar: A module of around 8-10 terrorists belonging to the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) might carry out a suicide attack against the Indian Air Force in and around Jammu and Kashmir, intelligence agencies warned on Wednesday.

Air Force bases in Srinagar, Awantipora, Jammu (all in Jammu and Kashmir) Pathankot (in Punjab), Hindon (in Uttar Pradesh) have been put on a high alert at ‘orange level’. Government sources have said that senior officers are reviewing the security arrangements round the clock to tackle the threat. The alert was sent out after intelligence agencies monitored the movements of Jaish terrorists.

The development comes just a few days after the National Investigation Agency in a chargesheet said that the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit was plotting several other ‘fidayeen’ attacks across India, including Delhi and the National Capital Region, an attack of the intensity of the dastardly Pulwama attack on February 14 earlier this year. The February attack in Jammu and Kashmir had left 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel dead.

The NIA named Sajjad Ahmad Khan (27), Tanveer Ahmed Ganie (29), Bilal Ahmad Mir (23) and Muzaffar Ahmad Bhat (25), all Pulwama residents, in its chargesheet.

Meanwhile, a suspicious letter allegedly written by the JeM sent the Haryana Police into a frenzy last week and security was beefed up in and around all transit points, including railway stations. Rohtak Railway Superintendent Yashpal Meena had received the threat letter on September 14.
