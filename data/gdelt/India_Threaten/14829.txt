A storm warning has been issued for all southern provinces, with torrential rain forecast to pound the region until Saturday.

As other regions officially entered the cold season on Thursday, the southern part of the country was being battered by storms.

The Meteorological Department on Thursday issued a storm warning for all 14 southern provinces and Prachuap Khiri Khan in the south of the central region. Downpours could be followed by flash floods and runoff in some areas, it said.

Songkhla province was put on alert for flooding in all districts after gusting winds brought down trees in Na Mom district and heavy rain left some areas in Hat Yai municipality under water.

Surat Thani governor Witchawut Jinto gave approval for maritime officials to order boats to remain in port for the safety of passengers if the seas are too rough.

All passengers on ferry services between the mainland and islands are required to wear life jackets.
