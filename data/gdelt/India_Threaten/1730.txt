The political drama in Karnataka took another twist after 10 Congress MLAs skipped the joint session of state assembly. BJP's state unit president and opposition leader in the house, BS Yeddyurappa said that the JD-S led government has no right to continue as it is in minority. He, however, reiterated that BJP would not move a no-confidence motion against the coalition government. "We will neither move the no-confidence motion nor approach the Governor. The government will collapse on its own, given the bickering among the MLAs. I have learnt that 10-12 Congress MLAs did not attended the session," Yeddyurappa told reporters outside the house. The differences between Congress and the JD-S had emerged when some Congress lawmakers had said in media that former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah was their sole leader. Reacting to this, Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy warned Congress MLAs not to cross their limit. On the other hand, Siddaramaiah accused BJP of luring Congress MLAs for switching sides. In the 225-member Assembly, including one nominated from the Anglo-India community, the Congress has 80, including the Speaker, JD-S 37, BJP 104 and remaining are an Independent and one each from the BSP and the KPJP.
