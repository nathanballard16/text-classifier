AJK PM strongly condemns Indian unprovoked firing along LoC

Azad Jammu and Kashmir Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider Khan has strongly condemned frequent unprovoked firing by Indian troops at Line of Control and termed it a blatant violation of Cease Fire Line Agreement and international laws.

In a statement issued on Monday, he paid tributes to valiant Pak army for giving a befitting response silencing enemy’s guns and said our forces are rendering matchless sacrifices while protecting our frontiers.

Two army officers and a civilian were injured when Indian troops fired mortars rounds at Rakhchikri sector of Haveli district in AJK yesterday.

Raja Farooq Haider Khan prayed for early recoveries of the injured and said people of Kashmir particularly those living close to LoC are standing shoulder to shoulder with the valiant armed forces.

PM AJK said Indian troops are regularly targeting civilians at LoC resulting into casualties on daily basis.

India is subjecting Kashmiris to the worst kind of tyranny and barbarism on both sides of the LoC.

He further said India wanted to shift focus of international community from deteriorating human rights situation in Occupied Kashmir.

He said Indian troops are demoralized as they badly failed to suppress Kashmiris by use of brute force.

Kashmiris stood like iron wall for their internationally recognized right to self-determination form the day first and rendering sacrifices in this regard.

He said Indian aggressive posturing is a threat for peace of the entire region.

Farooq Haider appealed major world powers to fulfil their moral obligation and stop India not to play more with the lives of Kashmiris.
