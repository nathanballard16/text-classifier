Imran Khan warns India of war over Jammu and Kashmir special status removal

Islamabad : Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has issued a warning to India claiming that the move to strip Kashmir out of its special status could lead to a war and the "ethnic cleansing" of Muslims in the restive Himalayan region.

Addressing a joint session in the parliament, he said more Pulwama like incidents will happen in the coming days. "Such incidents are bound to happen again. I can already predict this will happen," Khan said.

Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed responsibility of the attack and Islamabad had denied it.

"They will attempt to place the blame on us again," Khan said. "They may strike us again, and we will strike back. ... Who will win that war? No one will win it and it will have grievous consequences for the entire world."

Khan also accused India's Hindu nationalist government of promoting a "racist ideology." He predicted India would intensify a crackdown on Kashmiris, saying, "I fear they may initiate ethnic cleansing in Kashmir to wipe out the local population."
