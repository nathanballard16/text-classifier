Eight doctors resign in protest after Mamata calls protesters 'outsiders'

Three assistant professors,1 professor, and 4 Resident Medical doctors of government-run Sagar Dutta Medical College and Hospital have resigned in protest after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata’s comment that the agitating doctors are not doctors but outsiders.

Mamata, who visited a state-run hospital earlier in the day had also said that if they don’t return to work by 2 pm, junior doctors will have to evacuate the hostel in hospitals.

Mamata Banerjee earlier in the day took stock of the situation in view of disruption of regular services amid doctors strike following the mob attack incident. The chief minister had issued a 4-hour ultimatum to junior doctors to call off their strike.

In a stern message, CM Mamata Banerjee asked junior doctors to return to duty by 2 pm on Thursday. Otherwise, the hostel where the junior doctors are staying will be evacuated. "Strike of junior doctors will not be entertained," Mamata said.

Ever since after the attack, junior doctors have been agitating across the state after a junior doctor was assaulted by patients family at NRS on Sunday night.

The doctors have been demanding full proof security and urged CM Banerjee to listen to their demands. Some junior doctors also raised slogans against the chief minister.

Reaching upon a state-run hospital Thursday, Mamata Banerjee said those who attacked doctors were outsiders. "I have given instructions to police to take the strongest action."

"Minister of State for Health, Bengal, Chandrima Bhattacharya have intervened to end this impasse. The police has also arrested some people," she added.

However, Banerjee said that doctors cannot go on a strike. "They have to serve the patients. This will not be entertained."
