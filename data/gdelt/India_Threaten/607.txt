DCW issues notice to Delhi Police over threat to kidnap Kejriwal's daughter, seeks probe

The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) has issued a notice to police over death threats to Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's daughter and has sought a probe over the incident.

Kejriwal, on his official email ID, received an anonymous email that threatened to "kidnap" his daughter Harshita.

The DCW also slammed the Delhi Police for "failing" to nab the accused. The commission has further asked police to ensure "complete protection and safety" to the chief minister and his family.

"The commission views this as an extremely serious matter where the family of the elected head of the state is being openly threatened and police has failed to nab the culprits. Mere posting of a PSO is not enough and immediate steps should be taken to nab the culprits as well as ensure complete protection and safety of the Honourable CM and his family," the notice stated.

The chief minister's office had earlier received an anonymous email that read: "We will kidnap your daughter. Save your daughter if you can."

The Delhi Police on Saturday assigned Harshita Kejriwal a Protective Service Officer (PSO). The cyber cell is now looking into the matter.

A Delhi Police official confirmed the development and told PTI that the mail has been handed over to the Cyber Cell for analysis and further identify the IP address from which it was sent.

Earlier on Saturday, DCW chief Swati Maliwal said dispatching a PSO by the Delhi Police is "not enough" and strict action should be taken to protect Kejriwal's daughter.

"Absolutely shocking. First several attacks on CM and now threat to kidnap his daughter. Really, is there no limit to which his political opponents stoop? Shameful. Mere deployment of PSO by Delhi Police is not enough, strictest steps should be taken to protect her," Maliwal posted on Twitter.
