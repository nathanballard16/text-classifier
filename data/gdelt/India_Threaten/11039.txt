Extremists in every country should be removed from society

Dr. Sarath Obeysekera

Last few days America is going thru difficult times after many people died due to the shooting by white supremacists Some blame Trump for the massacre.

In Sri Lanka also had similar situations where Some extremist elements massacred innocent people.

Who did people blame?

Obviously the current leadership.

A few years back we had skirmishes in Aluthgama and Kandy

Again people blamed the leaders for going soft on extremism

Irrespective of whether extremists are Buddhist, Muslims or Christians it is essential that tough laws are applied again any mushrooming extremists

Releasing any of them to society after incarceration is not advisable
