Threat from wicked & vile greatest to judiciary: CJI

NEW DELHI:Inaugurating the Supreme Court's sprawling additional building on Wednesday, President Ram Nath Kovind fondly remembered his "productive professional life" as a lawyer while CJI Ranjan Gogoi warned of grave threat to judiciary from "the wicked and the vile" and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad declared the Centre's firm commitment to set up All India Judicial Service .The three - President, CJI and law minister - outlined the myriad thoughts that crossed their minds during the inauguration of the state-of-the-art building. Incidentally, first President Rajendra Prasad had inaugurated the main SC building 60 years ago on August 4, 1958, and Kovind became the second President to inaugurate a building of the apex court.The CJI referred to adverse forces trying to decimate institutions. "History has witnessed how great institutions have been brought to their knees by the wicked and the vile. History has also seen how even great nations have been brought down in utterly deceptive manner. The threat from such people has always been the greatest to institutions like the judiciary which do not pander to any particular interest or bow to powerful coteries that breed in nooks and dark corners," the CJI said."It is, therefore, necessary for each stakeholder to remain on guard and introspect his/her respective role in the growth and glory of this great institution (judiciary)," he said, recalling instances when the SC stood like a sentinel to ward off threats to India's constitutional fabric."The commitment of this institution to the call for justice can and does have no compromise. Supreme Court of India has responded in a manner appropriate and shall continue to do so, round the clock, all through the year," the CJI said.
