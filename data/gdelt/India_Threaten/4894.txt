Take travel insurance seriously, expat warns after visiting dad falls ill

Whose responsibility is it to get a travel insurance?

According to Samuel E. Thakker, managing director, Earnest Insurance, visitors to the UAE may have obtained a visa upon landing, from a travel agency, or from relatives and companies sponsoring them for a visit.

He said Ministerial Decision No. 322/ 2008 makes visitor health insurance mandatory. However, the current practice does not require the party sponsoring the visitor to take out insurance, or to bear the costs.

“It remains the responsibility of the individual travelling. If their home-country health insurance covers them whilst travelling overseas, that’s ideal. If not, there does exist Inbound Travel Insurance, offered by few insurance companies within the UAE. However, this must be taken-out before departure from the home country. If not done before departure, there are only a handful of insurance companies that offer this after arrival within the UAE.”

He said these policies only cover immediate life threatening emergencies. “It must be sudden or accidental (as opposed to gradual). Thus, pre-existing and chronic conditions are not the intention and as such they are generally excluded. Coverage is in respect of medical, pharmaceutical and hospital expenses incurred on medical prescription, in urgent cases and arising out of medical conditions which have occurred during the trip. It includes ambulance transfer to the nearest medical centre, covers accidental death and repatriation. Cover is up to specific limits,” he said.

Offered up to 80 years age by some providers, premiums are nominal, non- refundable and non-transferable, and on single trip, or multi-trip six-month period, he said.

A one-month travel insurance can cost Dh40-Dh240, depending on plan and policy provider. It can provide cover for up to Dh150,000.
