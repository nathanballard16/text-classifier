Karnataka mulls 5-yr ban on housing construction in Bengaluru due to water crisis

Looking at other options as well: DyCM

BENGALURU: With drought-like conditions in vast parts of the state and the threat of drinking water shortage looming large, the Karnataka government is considering a five-year ban on construction of apartments in Bengaluru.“We will discuss the issue with builders and developers before taking a decision,” deputy chief minister G Parameshwara told reporters on Thursday.“We are planning to clamp a five-year ban (on approvals for construction) mainly because a large number of apartment buildings have been constructed in the city and sold to people without ensuring adequate drinking water supply.”Parameshwara, also minister for Bengaluru development, said this trend has resulted in a majority of apartment owners relying on water tankers for their drinking water requirements. Developers expressed shock at the statement, and called it a knee-jerk reaction.The deputy CM’s statement came amid severe resentment over the state government’s proposal to draw water from the Linganamakki dam built on the Sharavathi to tide over the imminent water crisis in Bengaluru. The government had commissioned a detailed project report (DPR) to examine the feasibility of drawing the river flowing into the sea after power generation from the Linganamakki dam. Following severe opposition, Parameshwara said the next steps would be taken only after receiving the DPR.Once apartments are banned, Parameshwara said, the government would look to improve the water supply situation by taking up new projects. “The fifth phase of Cauvery drinking water supply project presently under implementation is not sufficient to meet the growing demands for drinking water in Bengaluru. We are looking at other options as well. If things improve after five years, we can lift the ban,” he said.Currently, the minister said, several builders were selling apartments without amenities like sanitation, roads or drainage. BBBMP officials have been asked to verify if apartment buildings have installed sewage treatment plants after they were made mandatory.
