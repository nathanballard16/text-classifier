United Nations Refuses To Comment on India’s Controversial Citizenship Bill

The United Nations refused to comment on clearance of the Citizenship Amendment Bill in the Indian Parliament's lower house, the Lok Sabha, with Farhan Haq, the deputy spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, saying the bill is still under legislative process.

"As far as I am aware, this legislation will go through a legislative process. We do not have a comment while the domestic legislative process is being carried out," Guterres said.

The intergovernmental organisation remarked it is concerned about ensuring that "all governments peruse non-discriminatory laws".

Meanwhile, the US Commission on International Religious Freedom while stating that it is deeply troubled by the controversial bill, said on Tuesday the US government should consider imposing sanctions on Indian Home Minister Amit Shah if both houses of the Indian Parliament clear the proposed legislation.
