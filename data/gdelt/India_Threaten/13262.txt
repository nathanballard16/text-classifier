Saying Pakistanis are unhappy is politically motivated: Sharad Pawar

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar has said that in the number of times he has visited Pakistan, he has received a warm welcome as Pakistanis treat Indians as relatives.

Sharad Pawar also said that unlike the belief in India that Pakistanis are unhappy in their country, they are happy living in the Islamic nation.

Talking to ANI, Pawar said on Saturday, "People here say Pakistanis are facing injustice and are unhappy but it is not true. Such statements are being said only for political gains without understanding actual situation in Pakistan. Ruling class here is spreading false things for political benefits."

He added, "I have visited Pakistan and received hospitality there. Pakistanis believe that even if they can't go to India to meet their relatives, they treat an Indian as their relatives."

Tensions between India and Pakistan have been heightened ever since the Pulwama terror attack in February in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed. India retaliated to the attack with the Balakot airstrikes and incidents of ceasefire violations, attempted infiltration through the borders of Jammu and Kashmir have only added to the simmering tension.

With the abrogation of Article 370 and revocation of the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, the tension has only increased with Pakistan knocking on the doors of the global community, seeking action against the Modi government's decision.

Pakistan PM Imran Khan has even gone to the extent of threatening India with nuclear war over the situation in Kashmir.
