Government Assisted School Principal Mohammad Ismail told The Indian Express that, “During a visit to Balrampur in 1977, N D Tewari had donated the land to the school after he was impressed by the students’ performance. We have been using this land for more than 40 years. It is registered in the school’s name in Khasra Khatauni documents.”

He said that they have written a letter to the district administration in this regard. No notice was given to them regarding the construction of the Gaushala at the school grounds. About 1,500 students of different sections of the school are studying and there will be problems due to lack of playground, he added.

At the same time, Ramesh Chandra of the Panchpadwa area said, “The land belongs to the Gram Sabha and we have measured it. We will file a police complaint against the school if they refuse to vacate the land.”
