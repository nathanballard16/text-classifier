"BJP trying to create rift between allies," Mayawati responds to PM Modi's jibe on 'SP-Congress ties'

She said: “PM Modi is trying to create difference between SP and BSP by bringing Congress in between. Everybody knows that we do not have any alliance with Congress.”

Former UP CM Mayawati on Sunday responded to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s jibe at the SP-BSP alliance in Pratapgarh rally in Uttar Pradesh, and accused BJP of driving a wedge between the two allies, amid Lok Sabha elections. PM Modi had said on Saturday that Samajwadi Party was playing a “big game” against the BSP together with the Congress. He said that SP was going soft on Congress, at the time when BSP chief Mayawati was attacking grand old party. In a press conference in Lucknow on Sunday morning, Mayawati said that PM Modi was trying to follow a divide-and-rule strategy but the bond between the two parties would remain unbreakable.
