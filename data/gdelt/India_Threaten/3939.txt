Secret agencies sound alert as JeM terrorists plan Pulwama-like terror attack in J&K

As per sources, terrorists could target security institutions and camps of security forces. The attack is likely to take place in next three to four days. A high alert has been sounded after this information. Jaish behind Pulwama attack: Terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed the responsibility of Pulwama attack. They used a car filled with IED and rammed it into a vehicle full of CRPF personnel. The incident claimed the lives of 40 Indian soldiers and strained the relations between India and Pakistan further. India has been consistently pressing Pakistan to take an action against JeM Chief Masood Azhar ever since the terror group claimed the responsibility of the attack. Amid intense global pressure to act against the militant groups after the Pulwama attack, Pakistani authorities on Thursday seized 182 madrasas and took 121 people into preventive detention. The Interior Ministry of Pakistan said 121 people were taken into preventive detention in compliance with the National Action Plan (NAP)

Considering the reports of the secret agencies, an alert has been sounded in Jammu and Kashmir to protect the people from Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists. As per sources, the terrorists are planning to do an attack by using a Tata Sumo car which they stole recently. The terrorists could use IED and do a Pulwama like attack.
