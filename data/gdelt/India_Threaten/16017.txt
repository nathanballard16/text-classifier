PC’s judicial custody extended till Nov 27

New Delhi, November 13A Delhi court on Wednesday extended the judicial custody of former Finance MinisterP Chidambaram till November 27 in the INX Media money-laundering case filed by the Enforcement Directorate. Special judge Ajay Kumar Kuhar passed the order after the senior Congress leader was produced before the court through video conference. Chidambaram could not be brought to the Rouse Avenue Courts premises due to the lawyers’ strike in district courts in the national capital. The ED moved an application seeking extension of custody which was allowed by the court. Chidambaram, 74, was arrested by the CBI on August 21 in the INX Media corruption case and is currently in the ED custody in a related money-laundering matter.
