MNM committed to public welfare: Kamal

To strive for Vriddachalam as a district

Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) president Kamal Haasan has said that his party would fight for carving out Vriddachalam as a separate district.

Mr. Haasan, who was campaigning for the MNM candidate for Cuddalore Parliamentary constituency V. Annamalai at Uzhavar Sandhai, Cuddalore, said apart from this, the MNM would work for various development schemes such as preservation of major waterbodies and ensuring that fishermen were not frequently displaced and were given proper housing.

Urging voters to exercise their franchise keeping in mind the real needs of ordinary people, he said, “If you do that, the torch (the MNM symbol) will shine bright in your eyes” as you head to the polling booths on April 18.

On the criticism from some quarters that he was drawing crowds as he was a film personality, Mr. Haasan quipped that the votes garnered by the MNM would be a fitting response to critics.

“If you wanted to watch me as an artiste, you might as well have preferred the comfort of an air conditioned theatre...but I stand here on behalf of the masses and to work for your welfare.”

Appeal to voters

Calling upon voters to disprove the notion that they could be won over and silenced with money power, he said that if they did that, then “the future will belong to us”.

The MNM candidate, he said, would ensure that their voices are heard in Delhi.

Mr. Annaamalai said the MNM under the leadership of its president, was committed to do welfare for the people.
