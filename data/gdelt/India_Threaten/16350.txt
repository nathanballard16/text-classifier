Surat bus kills teenage biker, four lives lost in less than 24 hours

Police arrested bus driver Bahadursinh Rathod (24) who suffered injuries after angry locals threw stones at the vehicle

SURAT: In back-to-back accidents, Surat city buses have snuffed out four precious lives within 24 hours. In another fatal accident that took place in Pandesara area on Thursday morning, a bus knocked down an 18-year-old textile unit labourer who sustained severe injuries and succumbed later in the day.

Mujjamil Shaikh, a resident of Bhestan, was riding his motorcycle when the bus knocked him near Daksheshwar Mahadev Temple. He sustained injuries on his head and was shifted to New Civil Hospital (NCH). As the hospital didn’t have ventilator, the family decided to shift him to private hospital located a kilometre away near Kshetrapal Temple. However, here doctors declared him brought dead.

Police arrested bus driver Bahadursinh Rathod, 24. The driver too suffered injuries after angry locals pelted stone on the bus after the accident.

Preliminary police investigation revealed that Shaikh was taking a turn on Daksheshwar road junction when the bus hit him.

“It seems the victim was taking a turn when the BRTS bus too was crossing the junction. The bus hit the victim’s motorcycle and he fell suffering serious injuries. The motorcycle and the victim fell on BRTS track after the hit,” said a police officer at Pandesara police station.

Initially it was claimed that the deceased was driving on BRTS track, though later it was revealed that he wasn’t. “Detailed investigation will reveal more facts,” said the police.

Shaikh’s father Amjad, 45, a labourer at a scrap warehouse, lodged a complaint in Pandesara police station against the bus driver. Police booked the driver under various sections of Indian Penal Code including 304A (causing death by negligence), 279 (rash driving), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) and Motor Vehicle Act.
