Qureshi warns India to not misconstrue Pakistan’s desire for peace as weakness

ISLAMABAD: Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Sunday has warned India that it should not misconstrued Pakistan’s desire for peace as its weakness.

Addressing a press conference, he said that Pakistan is taking steps to ease tensions but India is trying to put pressure on Pakistan with its war mongering tactics.

The Foreign Minister clarified that Pakistan is a peaceful country. “I have a clear message for India: if you think we can be pressured, then stop thinking this,” he said, adding, “Pakistan’s military, political leadership, and the entire nation stands united with Kashmiris and their struggle.”

He disclosed that India is dispatching additional ten thousand troops to Jammu & Kashmir in anticipation of a bigger crackdown.

Shah Mehmood Qureshi said a wave of harassing and tormenting Kashmiris has set in and there are reports of Kashmiri people across the country being beaten, their properties set light and intimidated.

The Minister explained that Hurriyet leadership has been taken into custody and steps are being taken to deport them from Kashmir.

“Indian police and security forces are acting as silent spectators and do nothing to stop this harassment campaign against Kashmiris,” he added.

Qureshi further stated, “The Kashmiri youth will not be subdued or suppressed,” as he reminded India of the words said by former chief minister of Jammu & Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti, “you can put them in prison but you cannot imprison their thoughts.”

The Foreign Minister gave a clear message to India that Pakistan will not be cowed down by its threats and bullish attitude.

He said the whole nation is united to defend the motherland and our army, politicians, youth, and old stand shoulder to shoulder to counter any aggression by India.
