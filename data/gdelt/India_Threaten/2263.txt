AMN / WEB DESK

India and Iran have sent a strong message to Pakistan when External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj made a brief stopover in Tehran Saturday, days after both countries lost soldiers to attacks carried out by terrorists operating from Pakistani soil. Mrs Swaraj met Iran’s Deputy Foreign Minister Seyed Abbas Aragchchi while enroute to Bulgaria as part of her three-nation tour.

In a tweet, Mr Araghchi said, Iran and India suffered from two heinous terrorist attacks recently which resulted in big casualties. He said, both leaders agreed on close cooperation to combat terrorism in the region.

While India lost 40 CRPF jawans to a terror attack carried out by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama on Thursday, Iran’s Revolutionary Guards has accused Pakistan’s security forces of supporting the perpetrators of a suicide bombing that killed 27 of its troops on Wednesday.

Iran’s Revolutionary Guards Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari has blamed Pakistan’s army and Inter-Services Intelligence agency, saying that sheltering and silence amounts to supporting the perpetrators.

He warned if Pakistan government does not take action against these terrorists, Iran will retaliate and Islamabad will bear the consequences.
