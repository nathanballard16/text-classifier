Hundreds chant anti-India slogans in seething Kashmir on eve of Eid

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - Hundreds of people protested in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar on Sunday against India's decision to curb its autonomy, despite new restrictions on travel and a seventh straight day of communications blackout.

Restrictions that had been temporarily eased on Friday and Saturday – allowing some bakeries, pharmacies and fruit shops to open ahead of the Muslim holy festival of Eid al-Adha – were reinstated in major parts of the city on Sunday afternoon.
