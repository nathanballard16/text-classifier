There is a 'family pack' for bail and no prizes to guess who are the beneficiaries of this pack. https://t.co/o0kEnuyIOk — Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) 1549805441000

TIRUPUR: Launching a stinging attack on the Congress, Prime Minister Narendra Modi dubbed party leader P Chidambaram a ‘Mr Recounting Minister’ who thinks only he has the brains.Addressing a large crowd of BJP workers at a public meeting in Perumanallur near the textile town of Tirupur in Tamil Nadu, Modi accused Chidambaram of “never bothering about the middle class.”"The people have rejected him and his party and would continue to do so in the future,” he said.“Earlier, there used to be family packs for ice creams and mobile recharge. Now, it is being made available for bails,” he said, in an apparent reference to the Chidambaram family applying for anticipatory bail in back money case.In an apparent retaliation to the charges levelled against him in Rafale deal , Modi alleged that the Congress never allowed modernisation of Indian defence forces."Why is that every middleman is linked with some Congress leader," he asked. NDA’s approach towards national security is different, he said adding that the BJP was dreaming of an India which is self-sufficient and hence taken a path-breaking step of creating two defence corridors.“It was our government which fulfilled one rank one-pension scheme. On the other hand, the Congress belittled our Army during the surgical strike,” he alleged."The good work by NDA has made some people unhappy. Those who thought power was their right are disturbed because here is a government which is working. Their unhappiness has become desperation and abuse,' he said.Mentioning the name of Congress stalwart K Kamaraj, Modi said it was the BJP that gave a government which was zero tolerant towards corruption.Taking a dig at political parties that are joining hands to oppose the BJP, Modi questioned if they had any agenda for people’s welfare. " They say Modi government is a failure. But they are forming a big alliance to defeat Modi,” he said.Terming the opposition parties coming together as a maha milavat, an adulterated club of rich, joining hands to promote their dynasty, Modi said people of Tamil Nadu and India would reject them.He also hit out at DMK and Congress for doing away with reservation in promotion for SC and ST people.
