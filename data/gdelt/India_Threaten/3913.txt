Bomb threat to Salem Collectorate

A bomb threat to the Collectorate on Thursday morning turned out to be a hoax, according to the Salem City Police.

The police said a person from Chennai, allegedly overhearing a conversation at a tea shop, called the State police control room around 9.35 a.m. and alerted the police regarding a bomb explosion at the Salem Collectorate.

The bomb detection and disposal squad was alerted and the personnel rushed to the Collectorate.

They conducted thorough checks on the Collectorate premises and inside offices using metal detectors, and sniffer dogs.

After a detailed search, it was found to be a hoax. The police are on the lookout for the person who made the call.
