Commerce department plans to defer raising duty on 29 US goods

NEW DELHI: The department of commerce is likely to propose extending the deadline to impose higher duties on 29 goods imported from the US by another month. India had set the extant deadline of May 2 after extending it multiple times despite announcing it in June last year in the hope of resolving its trade issues with the US including the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP), agriculture and dairy to medical devices and telecom.“We will propose an extension of the deadline,” said an official in the know of the development.These levies had been proposed in response to the US raising duties on steel and aluminium imports from India and other countries last year.“The department had contemplated extending the deadline on a weekly basis but the suggestion did not find favour with the finance ministry,” said another official aware of the intense discussions that took place on Thursday. New Delhi had weighed the option of allowing the tariffs to kick in from April 1 after the US announced the withdrawal of special duty benefits available to $5.6 billion of Indian exports on March 5.By statute, these changes may not take effect until at least 60 days after the notifications to the US Congress and the government of India. GSP removal will be enacted by a Presidential Proclamation.As per the first official, India may consider imposing the tariffs earlier if the US withdraws the GSP benefits earlier.The two sides have had around eight rounds of talks to resolve their bilateral trade issues after talks failed in March.The Indian Chamber of Commerce on Thursday urged to the US government to take a long-term view on US-India business relationship especially when the global economy is likely to get into recession during 2019 and the ongoing elections in India.“ICC felt it would be a good idea to wait to discuss these issues with the new government during June or July,” the chamber said in a statement.
