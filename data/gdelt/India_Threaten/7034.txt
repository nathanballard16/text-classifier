Stays implementation of plan; more than 2,600owners say E-PUC will be a burden.Granting interim relief to more than 2,600 PUC centre owners across Maharashtra, the Bombay High Court has stayed the implementation of the EPUC policy pursued by the state transport department until June 20.A bench comprising Akil Kureshi and Sarang V Kotwal on Saturday directed that the deadline of April 1 be extended to June 20 when the matter would be heard again.The Association of PUC Centre Owners had filed a petition stating that the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) had issued a notification dated June 6, 2018, amending the Motor Vehicle Rules 1989 by which the data of Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate would be uploaded electronically. As per the notification, all PUC centres in Maharashtra had to upgrade and computerise by April 1.Advocate Shraddha Dubepatil Bathija, appearing for the petitioners, submitted that the Regional Transport Office authorities wrote to PUC centre owners providing the necessary details for online updation only on March 28, leaving them just two days to implement it.She also pointed out that that the RTO authorities had also threatened the PUC centre owners with derecognition of their licences for granting the PUC if the procedure for E-PUC was not followed. She said the authorities would not recognise the certificates issued by the PUC centres without upgradation.“Without PUC, a vehicle owner would not be in a position to obtain insurance if it expires in the meantime. This would lead to serious consequences,” the court noted in its order, extending the deadline.The June 2018 MoRTH notification had directed all states to implement E-PUC and put in place a system to ensure that the emission results obtained through the vehicle PUC testing should be electronically uploaded through online process to the State Register of Motor Vehicles or the Central Register of Motor Vehicles. This would effectively link the PUC certificates to theintroduced by the ministry in 2011 with the help of National Informatics Centre. The database is a computerised database of vehicle information including its registration details, fitness certification, taxation, permits and enforcement.The notification had set June 1, 2018, as the deadline for Delhi and, October 1, 2018, for Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab, and April 1, 2019, for all other states including Maharashtra.While centre owners are not opposed to E-PUC, the petition pointed out that the equipment manufactures of the PUC instruments had said it would take six months to one year for all 2,667 PUC centres to be upgraded. It also pointed out that loadshedding in rural areas and poor internet connectivity would pose additional impediments.“The income derived by the PUC centres is meagre owing to the price restriction imposed by the authority. By switching to the upgradation, the economic viability of the centres would be at stake,” the petition said.
