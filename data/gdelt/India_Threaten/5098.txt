India must be held accountable for its crimes in IHK: AJK president

ISLAMABAD: Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan on Saturday said it was time to hold India accountable for its crimes against humanity in Indian Held Kashmir (IHK).

Speaking at a function here at the Kashmir House, Masood contended that Kashmiris had mourned a lot on funerals of their youth for decades, and now it was time to hold India accountable for its crimes against people of Kashmir. “India will have to be held accountable for its crimes, for the world community just can’t shut its eyes on this issue,” he emphasised.

He noted that people of Kashmir had single-handedly and without arms, combated India’s war machine for 70 years and proved that no power on the earth could defeat them or distract them from their objective of freedom from Indian occupation.

Masood pointed out that new Kashmiri generation was now ready in Azad Kashmir and Indian Held Kashmir, which fully understood the Kashmir issue and its various aspects. “And this generation is blessed with courage and enthusiasm to do anything for the success of the freedom movement,” he emphasised.

The AJK president cautioned that law of the jungle would prevail in held Kashmir if India was not made answerable to its crimes against humanity.
