Hyderabad: All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi said that Muslims living in the country should not worry about the BJP's return to power as the Constitution ensures freedom of religion to every citizen.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) got a thumping mandate and won a total of 303 seats while the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has 353 MPs in the recently elected 17th Lok Sabha.

"India's law, Constitution gives us this permission that we follow our religion," the AIMIM chief said in his address to a gathering at the Makkah Masjid here.

He further said that when India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi can go to a temple, Muslims can proudly visit a mosque as well.

Attacking the people responsible for the Sri Lankan suicide bombing, Owaisi said that there is no place for violence in Islam and added that people responsible for this ghastly attack were following the teachings of the devil and not Islam.

"Carrying out bomb blasts at a place of worship of someone else and killing more than 200 people, including 40 innocent children... what Islam are you talking about," PTI quoted Owaisi as saying.

Muslims are shareholders and not tenants in India, said the Hyderabad MP and stressed that just because PM Modi got 303 seats doesn’t mean that he can do whatever he likes by snatching away the Constitutional rights of the minorities.

Owaisi, who has been re-elected from Hyderabad for a fourth consecutive term, further said that his party would continue to fight for Muslims, Dalits and other oppressed people from the society.

On Dalit-Muslim unity, Owaisi said that AIMIM won the Aurangabad Lok Sabha seat by joining hands with Prakash Ambedkar in Maharashtra.
