Chandrababu Naidu blasts Narendra Modi for bid to paint Opposition leaders traitors

Amaravati: In a strong rebuttal to the comments made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Vishakhapatnam, Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu said Modi who virtually tried to paint all Opposition leaders as traitors and made an attempt to project himself as the greatest patriot should answer why he skipped from being present at the Wagah border to receive the valiant Wing Commander Abhinandan.

Naidu said Modi should answer whether that was more important or coming to Andhra Pradesh for second time to try and hit him below the belt. He warned the Prime Minister that for narrow political gains, he should not link “Desh Bhakti” with politics. This is exactly what Modi is doing and that was what the Opposition had said. But the Prime Minister who is known for not giving straight replies tried to paint all others as those who hate India. This was most unfortunate act.

He said the Prime Minister claims that he had gifted the railway zone but does not speak of how he has robbed the state. He has only given the state a ‘Maya zone’. Naidu said the Prime Minister says he has no baggage but he himself is turning into a baggage for the country. He mentioned about Alluri Sitarama Raju and in the next elections he will see how people will exhibit the spirit of Alluri and will defeat the BJP.

He said if the Prime Minister had worked so hard and put the country on fast forward mode then why be scared of the opposition alliance. His decisions have not helped anyone, he added.
