Face recognition may be next step for cops in detecting criminals

Kolkata: Kolkata Police has come up with the idea of installing Face Recognition System (FRS) in the CCTV cameras around the city and Kolkata Police Directorate has already started installation work. Under the project, Kolkata Police will buy 100 FRS software licenses, which would be installed in 100 existing CCTV cameras. The software will be installed in the CCTV cameras of Kolkata Police which are installed in crowded places such as Metro stations, malls and theatres. "This system will help us to detect any antisocial element amidst huge gatherings, which would bring down the response time of police," said a senior Kolkata Police official. If the project is found successful, such systems will be installed in more CCTV cameras in future.
