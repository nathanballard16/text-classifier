Grave implications for national security: Rahul on Article 370 abrogation

: Breaking his silence over scrapping of Article 370, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi warned the government that its move will have grave implications for our national security.

"National integration isn't furthered by unilaterally tearing apart J&K, imprisoning elected representatives and violating our Constitution. This nation is made by its people, not plots of land. This abuse of executive power has grave implications for our national security," Gandhi said on Twitter.
