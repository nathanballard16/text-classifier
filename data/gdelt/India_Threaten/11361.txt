Gujarat: Dam water to be released, alert issued

The state government has issued a warning not to go in the downstream and riverbank areas in Navagam village in Narmada Taluka as it is likely to release water from the Narmada dam to maintain the water level in the same.

The state in a release said that control release of water from the dam will be carried out to ensure that water levels do not cross the 131 mt level. A warning has also been issued for 24 villages of Karjan and Shinot Taluka in Vadodara district as the release of water is likely to raise the water level in Vadodara. A team of the NDRF has also been deployed in Narmada, Chhota Udepur, Vadodara and Bharuch districts of the state to deal with any untoward incident.

It should be noted that Narmad and several other regions in South Gujarat have been getting heavy rains in the last many days. Chhota Udepur taluka alone received 10 inches of rainfall in the last 14 hours.

In fact, the top four talukas to receive the highest rainfall in the state on Thursday were all from Chhota Udepur, with all the four talukas receiving anywhere between 10 inches to 5 inches of rainfall in the last 14 hours.

The Met department has predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall in South Gujarat on Friday with Panchmahals and Chhota Udepur likely to bear most of the brunt.
