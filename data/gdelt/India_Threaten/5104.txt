Ninjas in Pyjamas are the third team to receive a direct invite to ESL One Birmingham 2019 in May.

Joining the ranks of big shots like ViCi Gaming and Virtus.pro, NiP has accepted the invitation to compete in Birmingham.

The Swedish based team is currently ranked as 7 in the DPC leaderboard. A commendable season has given them much attention and chances to compete on the big stages but has produced little results worthy of accolades. They just missed out on securing a spot at MDL Disneyland Major and will be looking to prove themselves at ESL One Mumbai 2019 getting ready to kick off in just two weeks.

Twelve teams will be on hand in Birmingham to fight for a slice of the prize pool of $300.000 between May 28th - June 2nd, 2019. Eight teams will be directly invited and four teams will qualify from NA, SEA, China, and EU.
