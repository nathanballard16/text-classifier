JKPM warns India against changing disputed status of Kashmir

Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Movement (JKPM) has warned India against changing the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir by striking down all the constitutional provisions granting special status to the territory.

APHC leader and the JKPM Chairman, Mir Shahid Saleem in a statement in Jammu said people of Kashmir, who have been fighting for their inalienable right to self-determination for the past seven decades, are ready to fight tooth and nail any move aimed at depriving Kashmiris of their political rights.

He said the Indian government, instead of addressing the Kashmir dispute politically, has been hatching one conspiracy after another during the last seventy years but would never succeeded in its nefarious designs.

Mir Shahid Saleem said it seems India is going to launch a final onslaught on Kashmir which would further lead to violence and bloodshed.
