Omar misinformed or fabricating facts: Rafi

SRINAGAR, Jan 29: PDP today said National Conference leader Omar Abdullah is either misinformed or he is fabricating the facts by saying that PDP demands deferring of assembly polls.

In a statement, Rafi Ahmad Mir, PDP’s chief spokesperson said, "We are ready for the electoral battle, it is up to Election Commission of India (ECI) now to take a call."

He added that PDP is ready to contest assembly polls and go to the people’s court for their verdict.

"PDP representative in the all-party meet with election authorities, advocated for early polls. It is a constitutional requirement also to conduct polls in a time bound manner, why would PDP object to that," Mir said.

He said that after threadbare discussions with party cadre, PDP's stand is clear.

PDP leader said that either Omar is misinformed or he is trying to mislead the people by fabricating the facts.
