In topsy-turvy politics, rivals may end up on same side

Hyderabad: If future political combinations work out as is being speculated now, there will be a peculiar political situation in the Telugu states after the Lok Sabha elections.

Arch-rivals TRS president K. Chandrasekhar Rao, Telugu Desam chief N. Chandrababu Naidu and YSR Congress supremo Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy will find themselves on the same side at the national level.

Mr Naidu is openly supporting the Congress and the UPA. He will not support the BJP or the NDA at any cost in the event of a hung Lok Sabha. After his break with the BJP, Mr Naidu has been frequently meeting Congress president Rahul Gandhi whenever goes to Delhi.

According to TRS insiders, Mr Rao is now in favour of the Congress. To form the Federal Front government at the Centre, the TRS requires the support of the Congress, Mr Rao feels.

TRS sources said Mr Rao would prefer the Congress to the BJP to take support to from the Federal Front government. If necessary, Mr Rao will support the UPA led by the Congress to form government at the Centre.

Mr Jagan Mohan Reddy has said he will support any party which will give special category status to Andhra Pradesh, the Congress has assured that it will grant the status. If Mr Reddy wants to support the BJP which has categorically refused special status to AP, he will face political trouble. He has to support the Federal Front or the UPA to form government.

Mr Rao has stated that Mr Reddy will support the Federal Front.

If the Congress finds it difficult to form government with the UPA, Mr Naidu will have to support the Federal Front to stall the BJP from coming to power.

In one form or the other, therefore, Mr Rao, Mr Naidu and Mr Jagan will either back the Federal Front or the UPA or join either formation. The TRS and the YSRC may not join as partners of the UPA may may extend support from outside.

Whichever way it pans out, as things stand now, they will all be on the same side.
