SRINAGAR: The Jammu and Kashmir high court (HC) on Wednesday issued a notice to the Centre and the J&K administration to urgently deploy central armed police force personnel to protect the HC and all district courts in the Union Territory (UT).A division bench of Chief Justice Gita Mittal and Justice Rajesh Bindal directed all relevant circulars and orders of the Centre/Union home ministry/J&K UT to declare the J&K HC and all J&K district courts as high-security zones of the UT.The HC also directed the Centre to provide security to both wings of the HC as well as the district courts, said an official spokesman, observing that a possible terror attack posed an imminent security threat to the judiciary. “On September 7, 2019, posters threatening suicide attacks (fidayeen attacks) on the judiciary (were) pasted with impunity in the Srinagar Wing of the High Court. In view of the threat contained therein, intimation thereof was immediately sent to Hon’ble the Chief Justice of India,” the HC said.
