‘Let Us Not Get Fooled,’ Says India on Pak Booking Hafiz Saeed

A day after Pakistani authorities booked Jamaat-ud-Dawa Chief Hafiz Saeed on charges of terror financing, India’s sharp reaction to the development implies that Pakistan needs to do more to show their ‘sincerity’ against terror.

The Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar, in a briefing on Thursday, 4 July, said, “Let us not get fooled by such cosmetic steps. Pakistan’s sincerity to take action against terrorists and terror groups will be judged on the basis of their ability to demonstrate verifiable, credible and irreversible action against terror groups operating from their soil and not on the basis of half-hearted measures which they undertake some times to hoodwink the international community.”

“We want a normal relationship in an environment free from terror,” he added.
