South Delhi residents fight against rise in property tax, circle rates, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

NEW DELHI: Residents of certain south Delhi areas are fighting the upgrading of their colonies by the Municipal Valuation Committee IV.The panel has classed Kailash Colony Hauz Khas , Green Park Extension, Greater Kailash IV, Defence Colony, Pamposh Enclave, Panchsheel Enclave, Anand Lok, Chirag Enclave, Gulmohar Park and Safdarjung Enclave as A-category residential colonies rather than B.For the residents, this means not only a 68% increase in property tax payable, but also a 300% jump in circle rates, a damper for sale or purchase of property.“The property market in many south Delhi areas will come to virtual standstill,” said Amit Gupta , the lawyer representing residents of New Friends Colony in a case over circle rates.Property transactions in this colony, categorised as A in 2007, have been hit after circles rates were upped in 2011 and even today while the market rate is around Rs 4.5 lakh per sq yard, the circle rate is higher at around Rs 5.4 lakh per sq.“Many residents have been running from pillar to post for 6-8 years now for permission to sell their properties at fair market value. They are unable to dispose of them due to the circle rate being much higher than the actual value of the property.”Gupta cautioned that this problem will be replicated in all the colonies newly put under the A category. “The law allows the sale and purchase of properties below the circle rates, but the problem is with authorities extracting tax on the deemed value of the property from both the seller and buyer,” explained Gupta.A case that he is dealing with involves a property with a sale value of Rs 15 crore, but the stamp duty and deemed value taxation has led to an effective tax on this of Rs 11.5 crore, hiking the transaction total to Rs 26.5 crore.The affected south Delhi residents have a petition running on Change.org. It has gathered 1,092 signatures so far.“If a colony is shifted from category B to A, the circle rate in that colony increases from Rs 2.4 lakh per sq metre to 7.7 lakh. The impact of this rate being higher than the actual market rate is lost on no one,” said Vivek Agarwal, who started the petition.Pankaj Agarwal, a member of Safdarjung Enclave RWA, argued similarly that the circle rate would prove to have an adverse impact on their properties, which, he said, became evident after some colonies were put in higher categories in the last revision.
