Cross-border twitterati forces South African comedian to apologize over Indo-Pak war remark

Srinagar

Last week amid the escalating tensions between the India and Pakistan, the South African comedian Trevor Noah said that if both the countries would fight with each other it would be “most entertaining” and “longest war of all time”. However, the stand-up comedian later cleared it by saying he doesn’t want to hurt anybody as it was a part of comedy.

Days after the comment, the comedian was trolled for his remark, forcing him to apologise for making a joke about the two neighbouring countries dispute over the Kashmir region.

In an episode of The Daily Show, the US television programme that Noah hosts, the comedian said that a war between the two countries would be “most entertaining” and “it would also be the longest war of all time – another dance number!” The comedian’s comments caused outrage, especially in India, where thousands took to Twitter to complain.

Commenting on the joke, Indian journalist Zainab Sikander said in a Tweet: “It’s sad when someone who’s had a violent past mocks war through a Bollywood stereotype. Trevor Noah’s mother was shot in the head by her husband (Trevor’s stepfather). Imagine someone making fun of it with a Xhosa stereotype – the tribe his mum belongs to.”

In response to the Tweet, Mr Noah replied: “As a comedian I use comedy to process pain and discomfort in my world but I am sorry that this hurt you and others, that’s not what I was trying to do.”

“Actually if you watch my stand up you’ll see that I did make jokes after my mother was shot in the head. As a comedian I use comedy to process pain and discomfort in my world but I am sorry that this hurt you and others, that’s not what I was trying to do,” Noah tweeted.

India and Pakistan have fought two wars and the conflict over Kashmir has lasted over 60 years, starting shortly after the partition of India in 1947.
