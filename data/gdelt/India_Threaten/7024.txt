Government: Penalty waiver for leak of secrets will threaten state

NEW DELHI: The Centre on Saturday warned that the Supreme Court's April 10 order waiving penal provisions against publication of state secrets can have grave repercussions for the very existence of the Indian state.Its arguments came in response to a plea seeking review of the Supreme Court's order where it had allowed the use of leaked documents in the petition seeking a review of the ruling clearing the deal for the purchase of Rafale jets. "The judgment would imply that any document marked secret, obtained by whatever means and placed in public domain, can be used without attracting penal action," its affidavit said.On April 10, the bench of CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices Sanjay K Kaul and KM Joseph had said, "There is no provision in OSA and no such provision in any other statute has been brought to our notice by which Parliament has vested any power in the executive arm of the government either to restrain publication of documents marked as secret or from placing such documents before a court of law which may have been called upon to adjudicate a legal issue..."Writing the main judgment, the Chief Justice of India adopted the US Supreme Court's logic in its 1971 judgment, which had refused to recognise the executive government's right to restrain publication of " Pentagon Papers ". The American SC had by 6-3 majority declined to pass prohibitory orders on publication of "Pentagon Papers" (by New York Times) on the ground that the legislature had vested no such power on the executive and hence the court could not introduce it.The CJI had said: "We do not see how the principle of law (in US SC judgment) will not apply to the facts of the present (Rafale) case."The Centre said: "This could lead to revelation of all closely guarded state secrets relating to space, nuclear installations, strategic defence capabilities, operational deployment of forces, intelligence resources in the country and outside, counter-terrorism and counterinsurgency measures, etc."It warned: "This could have implications in the financial sector also if say budget proposals are published before they are presented in Parliament. Such disclosures of secret government information will have grave repercussions on the very existence of the Indian state." The view in the Centre was that the SC order will have serious cross-government implications.The Centre said that on the basis of the apex court's April 10 order, the petitioners have asked for virtually the entire file relating to the Rafale deal "The judgment of the court opens the window for any person making the request not only to seek papers from the ministry of defence but from other ministries and departments dealing with subjects mentioned above, if they are stolen and placed in public domain by the press or a website," it said.
