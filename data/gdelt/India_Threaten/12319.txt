Pakistan-based JeM radicalising Rohingya to target India: Border Security Force

Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad is radicalising Rohingya Muslims to further Pakistan's anti-India activities, according to a report by the Border Security Force.



The report, accessed by DNA, talks of JeM commander Saber Ahmed, who is in Pakistan, targeting Rohingya members in Cox's Bazar of Bangladesh and brainwashing them to target areas in India.



Sources said a terrorist named Maulana Yunus, a member of JeM's Bangladesh unit, recently made four members of the Rohingya community undergo training at a terror camp in Harinmara hills in Bangladesh. The Cox's Bazar area, where the radicalisation is being carried out by the JeM, currently has thousands of Rohingya Muslims.



All this is happening with the help of Pakistan's spy agency ISI.



In another development, intelligence has suggested that the ISI is plotting to carry out major attacks on security forces in India with the help of Pakistan-based terror outfits. JeM operation commander Abdul Rauf Asgar has been given this job. Asgar and 30-40 terrorists are waiting at terror launch pads along the Line of Control in Pakistan-occupied-Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK).



Earlier this month, Indian intelligence agencies had issued a high alert across seven states, warning that JeM might carry out an operation on the scale of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack. Forty soldiers had been martyred then.
