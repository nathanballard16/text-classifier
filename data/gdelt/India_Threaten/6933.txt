New Delhi: The United States is threatening to halt ground operation of Indian airlines in the country in retaliation to India not allowing foregin carriers to do the same. The US has reportedly sought details of ground handling operations of all Indian carriers by July 1. The move will impact operations of national carrier Air India.

An ET report cited sources privy to the development saying that the US is threatening to prohibit Indian carriers from carrying out their ground handling operations there since India refuses foreign airlines to do the same. Both sides are reportedly negotiating the issue.

The report quoted a government official saying, "These are pressure tactics to intimidate India in the wake of failed trade talks. It may be noted that if the ban is implemented, operations of Air India will be impacted since it is the only India airline which operates direct flights to New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington.

The financial daily report quoted Air India official saying, "At the airports in the US, we outsource ground handling to companies that are mandated to carry out such operations."

Worth mentioning here is that this issue first came to light when New Delhi prohibited all international carrier from carrying out ground operations at Indian airports. The US authorities have been protesting saying that had signed an agreement in India earlier to allow US-based airlines to carry out grand handling operations on their own.

As of now, United is the only American airline which operates flights to India. However, Delta airline has already announced plans to launch a new flight to India this year in December. It is also worth mentioning that the US also criticized India's data localisation norms as well as the national e-commerce policy.
