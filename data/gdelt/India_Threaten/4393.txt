Kesari: Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra are two happy souls as they gear up for the release of the film

Today, when Akshay Kumar and Parineeti Chopra were snapped in the city, the two were beaming from ear to ear and rightly so because their film Kesari is going to hit the theatres in a week i.e. on March 21, 2019. Today, Akshay Kumar, Parineeti Chopra, and Karan Johar were present at the song launch of the film titled Teri Mitti and during the event, while Parineeti Chopra stunned in a yellow ethnic dress, Akshay looked every inch of a Khiladi in all-black attire.

Besides Kesari, Parineeti Chopra has dual reasons to be happy because today, it was being reported that Parineeti Chopra has replaced Shraddha Kapoor in the biopic based on the life of ace badminton player Saina Nehwal. Talking about Kesari, the film is one of the most anticipated historical films of 2019 and the film is based on one of the bravest battles fought in the history of the world, i.e. Battle of Saragarhi wherein 21 Sikhs fought valiantly against 10,000 Afghans.

In the film, we will see Akshay essaying the role of Havildar Ishar Singh, who is the leader of his battalion of Sikh soldiers and motivates them to fight against the massive army of the Afghans. While the makers of the film launched a song today, the cast is going all out to promote their film and a few days back, Akshay and Parineeti were snapped in Ahmedabad to promote the film and during the promotions, Akshay Kumar announced that he will be dedicating Kesari to Bharatke Veer, an initiative to help the soldiers and their families.

Kesari, produced by Hiroo Yash Johar, Aruna Bhatia, Karan Johar, Apoorva Mehta, Sunir Kheterpal and presented by Zee Studios releases on March 21, 2019.
