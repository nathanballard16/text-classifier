New Delhi: After months of on record denial and speculations, the Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) seem to have finally formed a pre-poll alliance in the national capital ahead of the 2019 general elections. According to reports, both the parties will fight on three seats each and will field an independent candidate on one seat, who is most likely to be Yashwant Sinha, the former BJP leader.

Interestingly, earlier in the month, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee (DPCC) president Sheila Dikshit, after more than a two-hour long meeting with Congress president Rahul Gandhi, had announced that there will be no alliance with the AAP. After Sheila Dikshit's public statement, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had accused the grand old party of splitting the anti-Bharatiya Janata Party votes and thereby helping the saffron party.

Reports suggest that final decision will be taken by the top leadership but the alliance has been approved by the Delhi unit and a formal announcement will be made on Sunday afternoon.

As per the seat-sharing formula, Congress will contest on New Delhi, Chandni Chowk and North West Delhi, while the AAP will fight on North East Delhi, South Delhi and East Delhi.

If the reports are to be believed then this is a major embarrassment for the AAP as the party has already named candidates for six of the seven Lok Sabha seats in Delhi. Now, if the alliance is formed then AAP will have to take back its names and announce new names for the selected seats.

Delhi will go to polls in the sixth phase of the elections on May 12, while the counting of votes will take place on May 23.
