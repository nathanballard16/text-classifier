India’s Supreme Court Sets 4-Week Deadline for Government to Regulate Cryptocurrency

Time is running out for the Indian government and the Reserve Bank of India to ignore/wholesale ban cryptocurrency, according to a local publication called Inc42.

Last April, as CCN reported, the RBI banned all financial institutions from working with cryptos. India has gone back and forth over the issue, but the Supreme Court seems to be losing patience.

Indians have petitioned the Supreme Court more than once to order a rescinding of the Reserve Bank’s order, to no avail. However, the court is hearing two other petitions demanding the court take action.

Court Gives a Deadline of Four Weeks

The court chose not to hear arguments in either case today. Instead, it issued a final warning to the government and Reserve Bank of India. They must come to some conclusion about crypto regulation soon. They only have four weeks to develop a set of regulations or the Court will rule on the cases in regards to the constitutional rights of cryptonaughts in India.
