Trump calls India-Pakistan standoff 'very dangerous'

India has been demanding action against militants from Pakistan.

WASHINGTON (Web Desk / AFP) - US President Donald Trump voiced alarm Friday at the "very dangerous situation" between India and Pakistan, warning that New Delhi was considering "very strong" action after an attack in Indian Occupied Kashmir.

"It’s very dangerous situation between the two countries. We would like to see it stop," Trump said, adding that the United States was seeking talks with Pakistan.

"Right now there is a lot of problems between India and Pakistan because of what happened," he told reporters as he met a senior Chinese official in the Oval Office.

Tensions have soared between the nuclear-armed rivals since a suicide attack last week killed over 40 Indian soldiers in occupied Kashmir, the deadliest attack in years.

"India is looking at something very strong. India just lost almost 50 people with an attack. So I can understand that also," Trump said.

The attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed although the suicide attacker came locally from occupied Kashmir.

Pakistan’s military on Friday warned India against any "misadventure," saying it was capable of responding.

"We hope you will not mess up with us," military spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor told a press briefing in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, the second such message Pakistan has sent to New Delhi in as many days.

There have been calls in India for retaliation, but Pakistan -- which denies aiding the militants -- has threatened to respond in kind.

"We don’t want to go into war with India but if India initiates any aggression, they will never be able to surprise us," Ghafoor said.

"Let me make it clear that we will defend every inch of our country till the last breath and last bullet".

The army’s reaction came a day after Prime Minister Imran Khan authorised the country’s armed forces to "respond decisively and comprehensively" to any Indian threat.
