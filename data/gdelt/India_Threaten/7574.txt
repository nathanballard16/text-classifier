As India’s Election Ends, Warring Parties Burn a Village

The next day, Mr. Molla returned with a gang of men and blocked the main road through the village. In front of a large crowd, Dinesh Mondal, a B.J.P. leader and former T.M.C. official who lived in the village, confronted Mr. Molla and the two men exchanged heated words, according to Ms. Mondal and other witnesses. (The two Mondals are related.)

Shortly thereafter, several shops were destroyed and attackers ransacked the homes of Hindus in the village, including Ms. Mondal’s.

On Monday morning, Mr. Molla’s men returned and burned seven of the homes, as well as an ambulance and a car parked in front of Mr. Mondal’s building supplies shop, according to Ms. Mondal and two other Hindus who witnessed the attacks.

Muslim villagers were also attacked on Monday morning, according to interviews with about a dozen people in the community. Masked men, armed with swords and guns, burned six Muslim homes, said Sabur Ali Shekh, whose house was among those targeted. The men lingered in the area, shouting “Jai Shri Ram” and warning Muslim voters that if they did not vote for the B.J.P., they would be deported to Pakistan.

At sunset, when the Muslims were preparing their evening meal to end the day’s fasting for Ramadan, the men threw flaming bottles into four homes, destroying the sewing machines and supplies of the cloth makers inside. Several witnesses, including Meher Ali Shekh and his brother, both of whose homes were destroyed, said they saw Mr. Mondal watching from not far away.
