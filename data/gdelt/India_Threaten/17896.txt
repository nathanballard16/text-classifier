LIP opposes hike in traffic violation fine

Ludhiana: Lok Insaf Party (LIP) sternly opposed hike in traffic violations fine revised by the transport department, on Friday.

Talking to mediapersons, LIP chief Simarjit Singh Bains said there had been 500% increase in the fine which should be rolled back or decreased. He said the government should improve the condition of roads before imposing such heavy fine for traffic violations.

LIP chief warned that if the government did not roll back the fine or decreases it substantially, they would protest at the Vidhan Sabha in the coming session.

In the meanwhile, a delegation of LIP, led by MLA South Balwinder Bains, left for Odisha to gather on the ground information about the alleged demolition of a part of gurdwara sahib there.

He demanded that the chief minister, Amarinder Singh, should take up the matter with his counterpart.
