New Delhi: The Calcutta High Court on Friday refused to intervene in the ongoing doctors' strike in West Bengal and advised the Mamata Banerjee-led Trinamool Congress government in the state to persuade the medical practitioners to re-join work.

A division bench comprising of Chief Justice TBN Radhakrishnan and Justice Suvra Ghosh directed the state government to apprise the bench of the steps taken by the government in the aftermath of the vicious attack at NRS hospital in Kolkata.
