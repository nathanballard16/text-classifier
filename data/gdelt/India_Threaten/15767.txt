Congress leaders praise Shivakumar on Siddaramaiah’s home turf

Beleaguered Congress leader D.K. Shivakumar, who is being investigated by the Enforcement Directorate on charges of money laundering, was heaped encomiums by his party colleagues during his visit to the city on Friday.

This was Mr. Shivakumar’s first visit to Mysuru after being released from jail on bail. He was mobbed by his supporters on arrival at the city railway station. The support extended to him on the home turf of Congress leader Siddaramaiah is being perceived in political circles as a challenge and a threat to the former Chief Minister.

Mr. Shivakumar travelled by Shatabdi Express from Bengaluru to Mysuru and was accompanied by a larger number of his supporters.

Tanveer Sait, MLA, described Mr. Shivakumar as a “Chief Ministerial candidate” and went on to state that the Congress would return to power again and the Kanakapura MLA would be the Chief Minister, to the applause of the supporters.

Yathindra, MLA and Mr. Siddaramaiah’s son, flayed the Modi government and said Central agencies were being misused to target the Opposition in general and the Congress in particular.

Later, addressing party workers, Mr. Shivakumar said he was indebted to the party workers for the concern they showed when he was jailed and prayed for his release.

Temples visits galore

Mr. Shivakumar visited Srikanteshwara temple at Nanjangud on Thursday. He is slated to visit a series of temples on Friday, including Chamundeshwari temple atop the Chamundi Hill, Sriranganathaswamy temple at Srirangapatna, Kalikamba temple at Mandya, and Madduramma temple at Maddur, before returning to Bengaluru.
