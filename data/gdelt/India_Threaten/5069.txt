Calling Shatrughan Sinha A ‘Problem For BJP’, FM Arun Jaitley Thanks Congress For Taking Him Over

Senior BJP leader and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley in his Facebook blog quipped on Friday (29 March 2019), "Some eminent former BJP men have been accepted by the Congress as a gift. We thank Congress. Our problem is now yours. Good luck."

The veiled attack on former BJP leader and incumbent Member of Parliament from Patna Sahib, Shatrughan Sinha, came on the backdrop of speculations that he is set to join Congress on 6 April 2019 and contest the upcoming elections from a Congress ticket.

On joining the Congress and fighting the polls against the BJP’s Ravi Shankar Prasad, Sinha said whatever be the situation, he will fight the polls from Patna Sahib. He added that the announcement would be made on the auspicious occasion of ‘Navratra’, reports Huffington Post .

He has often criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah in overt ways and was also present at the Opposition's unity rally, organised earlier this year in West Bengal under the supervision of TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee.

Meanwhile, Jaitley also said in his post that the political winds are not friendly to the Congress as the party led by Rahul Gandhi has failed to form any meaningful alliance in any state. Giving a state-wise analysis of the ‘grand alliance’, Jaitley said it has no leader, no programme, no meeting of minds and stability is a major casualty.

Jaitley is known to be very active on his Facebook page, where he often shares blogs articulating his views on day-to-day affairs in the economy and polity of the country.
