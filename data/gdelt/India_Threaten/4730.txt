A report in a news magazine accused formerChief Ministerof making “payoffs amounting to over Rs 1,800 crore” to “BJP’s national leaders, its central committee, and judges and advocates” even as the tax department cast doubts over the veracity of the documents allegedly cited in the report calling them ‘loose sheets’ whose ‘originals are yet to be found’.Yeddyurappa termed the accusations as “atrocious” and “malicious” and threatened to file a defamation case even as the Congress amped up its attack on Prime Ministerand the ruling party, demanding an investigation.The report, titled “The Yeddy Diaries” published by The Caravan, claims documents accessed by it show that diary entries - made in Yeddyurappa’s handwriting in 2009 - have been in the possession of the Income Tax department since 2017. The report also alleges that a senior minister, named as one of the alleged beneficiaries, “chose not to act” when he was alerted by an income tax official.Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala claimed that the diary noted payments allegedly made to the BJP’s Central Committee which includes Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, Home Ministerand Shipping Minister Nitin Gadkari, besides the Prime Minister.“The officials have even approached Finance Minister Arun Jaitley with it, seeking an inquiry by the(ED) and forensic examination but nothing happened,” said Surjewala.In response, Yeddyurappa said, “IT officials have already probed the issue and found that the documents and signature and handwritten notes are forged,” he said.Later in the day, the IT department issued a clarification saying that the ‘loose sheets’ of papers containing ‘numerical entries’ against ‘some individual names’ appear to be doubtful as the originals are not available, casting doubts over the veracity of the notes.The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) said that it had recovered the copies from Congress leader DK Shivakumar during a search on August 2, 2017, and he had told officials that these were ‘written by Yeddyurappa’.CBDT, which comes under Jaitley, said the papers were analysed in a lab which said it needed originals.“No originals were given by Shivakumar,” it said.
