Two of Sri Lanka's major cable TV operators, Dialogue and SLT, have removed controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's Peace TV from their channel list.

The move came after the deadly Easter Sunday bombings which killed at least 250 people. However, the Sri Lankan government hasn't banned the controversial Peace TV.

Previously, India and Bangladesh had banned the channel founded by Zakir Naik.

Bangladesh suspended the channel that featured Zakir Naik's preachings after media reported that militants who attacked a Dhaka cafe in 2016 were his admirers.

WHO IS ZAKIR NAIK

Zakir Naik is wanted by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) on charges of propagating terrorism. His Islamic Research Foundation (IRF) organisation was been banned for five years.

Meanwhile, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday arrested Riyas Aboobacker, alias Abu Dujana, who was believed to be planning to carry out suicide attacks in Kerala.

The 29-year-old man, a resident of Kerala, confessed that he was radicalised a few years ago. Riyas said he was closely following the speeches of key accused in the Sri Lanka suicide bombings, Zahran Hashim, for over a year.

Though the Islamic State (IS) group has claimed responsibility for Sri Lanka bomb blasts, the Sri Lankan government has blamed a local jihadi group National Thowheeth Jamaath (NTJ) for the April 21 bombings.
