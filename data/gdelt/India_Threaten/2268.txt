Lok Sabha elections: Congress focus on Hyderabad, Secunderabad

Hyderabad: The Congress will this time give a tough fight from the Hyderabad Lok Sabha seat, one that it never focused on earlier because of its alliance with the MIM.

Telangana state Pradesh Congress Committee president N. Uttam Kumar Reddy is confident the party would put up an impressive performance and win almost all seats in Telangana state in the forthcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Addressing party leaders from Chevella, Malkajgiri, Hyderabad, Secunderabad and Medak Lok Sabha constituencies, Mr Reddy on Sunday said that Secunderabad has been a Congress seat from the beginning. Except for Nampally Assembly segment, the Congress was strong in all other segments falling under Secunderabad seat. But this gap, too, had been bridged in the last Assembly elections and now the Congress was strong in Nampally too. Therefore, he said, Secunderabad would be in the list of seats destined to send the Congress to Lok Sabha.

Meanwhile, the TPCC election committee has received more than 200 applications for the 17 Lok Sabha constituencies. It has decided to hand them over to DCC presidents for background verification by Wednesday, so that it can forward the final list of two candidates for each constituency to the AICC by February 25 as the high command has mandated.
