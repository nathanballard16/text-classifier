Joint celebrations: CM Amarinder Singh moots new formula

CHANDIGARH: To break the deadlock on joint celebrations of the 550th birth celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev in Sultanpur Lodhi, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday proposed a new formula.“Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) should join the state government’s November 12 event, which is to be attended by the President of India. The main function on November 11, at which the Union home minister is expected, could be held under the purview of SGPC,” he suggested during his meeting with SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal.The chief minister had invited the SGPC president for the meeting at his official residence here.According to an official spokesperson, the CM expressed his concern, during the meeting, about the lack of unity on this historic occasion, especially in view of the participation of high-ranking dignitaries like the President and the Prime Minister in various events.Underlining the embarrassment this would cause to all concerned, Capt Amarinder noted the Sikh community had always remained united in such celebrations in the past. He warned that any deviation from the past practice would cause irreparable damage to the community.Longowal apprised the CM about the decision of the Union home minister and the President to visit Sultanpur Lodhi on November 11 and 12, respectively.In response, the chief minister suggested that the SGPC stage inside the gurdwara precincts at Sultanpur Lodhi may be used as the common stage on November 11, with the state government also participating in the celebration there.However, since November 12 would have the President participating in the programme, it was apt for the state government to host the head of the state, in keeping with his status, Capt Amarinder proposed. This, said the chief minister, would help clear the confusion prevailing among the people about the main events, and would also send a positive message of unity among the Sikh community.Longowal assured the chief minister that the SGPC would consider the proposal and revert shortly on the same, said the spokesperson.
