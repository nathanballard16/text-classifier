India cancels Samjhauta Express, days after Pakistan ended operations

New Delhi : The Indian Railways on Sunday announced cancellation of Samjhauta Express, a cross-border train between India and Pakistan, days after Pakistan suspended operations on its side.

The railways run the train on Sundays from Delhi to Attari and back, while Pakistan used to run the train between Lahore and Attari. Passengers used to change trains at the Attari station.

“In consequent to Pakistan’s decision to cancel samjhaouta exp 14607/14608 running between Lahore and Atari .......the link exp train number 14001/14002 running between Delhi and Atari also stands cancelled (sic),” said Deepak Kumar, Chief Public Relations Officer of Northern Railway.

On Sunday's train, two passengers were scheduled to travel from India.

A couple of days back, Pakistan cancelled Thar Express, Samjhauta Express and a 'Dosti' bus service to India. The move was announced as a retaliation to India's decision of aborting Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir.
