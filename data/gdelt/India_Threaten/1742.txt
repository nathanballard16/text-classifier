Will not tolerate bid to create communal tension: Assam govt

GUWAHATI: Assam government on Thursday informed the assembly that it would not tolerate efforts to create communal disturbance in the state and assured the members of maintaining peace at any cost.Parliamentary Affairs Minister Chandra Mohan Patowary said the Home department is keeping a strict vigil in this direction after AIUDF MLA Aminul Islam alleged that attempts are on to engineer a communal riot in the state."If anyone tries to disturb the peace of Assam, we will not tolerate it. We are taking all precautions to avoid any untoward incident," Patowary replied on behalf of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal who holds the Home portfolio.He said Assam did not witness any Hindu-Muslim clash even after the demolition of the Babri Masjid when communal riots took place in many states."It is our responsibility to maintain peace. We assure you that it (riots) will never take place. It is the land of Sankardeva and Aajan Fakir," Patowary said.Sankardeva was a 15th century Hindu socio-religious reformer while Aajan Fakir was a 17th century Sufi poet and Muslim preacher.The All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) member had alleged that 8-10 people of Dhing constituency have been trying to create communal tension by various means such as throwing meat inside a temple and abusing Muslims for this."Because of our initiative with the local police, nothing untoward has happened yet. People are also very sensitive and tolerant. But you never know when something wrong may take place. So, I request the government to take strict action against those people," Islam added.Patowary said Dhing police station has already registered a case and a probe is on to nab the culprits.
