But those who try to do so will have their heads broken, and as a special case, we will also make arrangements to treat them at the hospital," Sattar said."Poaching or buying out legislators was not legal in a democratic set up. It is not a retail shop from where you can buy MLAs," he added.The BJP and Shiv Sena contested the October 21 Assembly elections together and won 105 and 56 seats respectively. The two parties, however, fell out after the Shiv Sena persisted with its demand of sharing the chief ministerial post for two-and-half years on a rotational basis. The NCP and Congress won 54 and 44 seats respectively.However, after none of the parties could present a letter to governor claiming a majority and staking a claim for the government formation, Maharashtra was placed under the President's rule on November 12.
