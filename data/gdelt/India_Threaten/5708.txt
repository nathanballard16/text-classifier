Mehbooba warns Delhi against turning ties with Kashmir

Ban on civilian traffic on highway

SRINAGAR, Apr 10: PDP president Mehbooba Mufti today reiterated her call to defy the

ban on the movement of civilian traffic on Srinagar-Jammu highway on Sundays and Wednesday.

She also warned Delhi against turning relation with Kashmir into an Israel-Palestine type confrontation.

“Jammu and Kashmir’s relation with New Delhi is not like a Palestine-Israel relation. If New Delhi wants to convert our relation like the Palestine-Israel then they have to be ready for a Palestinian situation as well,” Mehbooba said while talking to reporters near Pantha Chowk during a protest.

Asking people to defy the highway ban, Mehbooba said this was another attempt to subjugate the people of Jammu and Kashmir, their economy and rights.

“I have earlier said this as well. People should drive their vehicles on the highway to defy the order. We will see who does what,” said Mehbooba.
