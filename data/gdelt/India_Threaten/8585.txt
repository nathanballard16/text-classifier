Seven people were killed by tree-fall in the city in 2018.

Mumbai: With the onset of the monsoon, the Bombay Municipal Corporation (BMC) has put up around 10,000 posters Mumbai warning resident of tree fall.

The BMC posters reading 'Tree may fall. Be Aware' is a move which has been taken in view the monsoon season, warning people during heavy rains and wind. Of these posters, 5,000 will be in English and the rest will be Marathi.

However, some concerned Mumbai residents have questioned whether the poster exercise is an attempt by BMC to wash its hand off any possible crisis during the monsoon.

According to a report in Times of India, the development comes after two tree-fall death before the monsoon season.

Activists say BMC could have done much more than just cautioning the residents. At least 7 people were killed by tree-fall in the city in 2018.

"People may not going to take these warning seriously as people are busy walking, going to their destination. And accidents could still be happened inspire such warnings," said a city resident.

Others say it's an exercise by BMC to insulate itself in case of accidents saying they had warned the people in advance.
