Farmers protesting power transmission tower project held

COIMBATORE: At least 11 farmers were arrested for protesting against the high-voltage power transmission tower project near Annur here on Saturday.According to police, the farmers obstructed Power Grid Corporation of India officials, who visited the spot for surveying the land, from carrying out their work. Fellow farmers and villagers, however, said they would continue the protest.The project implemented by the Power Grid corporation of India at a cost of around Rs24,000 crore envisages erection of about 4,500 transmission towers from Raigarh in Chattisgarh to Pugalur in Karur district for a distance of 1,800km and then to Thrissur via Tirupur and Coimbatore.Farmers from all the districts, where the transmission towers would be installed on farmlands, have been opposing the project. Farmers said the project would not only take away their land but also leave adjoining tracts of cultivable land unfit for agriculture.There was a lull in protests, but it seems to have gathered momentum with the officials resuming land survey for erection of the towers.On June 11, a team of Power Grid Corporation officials had visited Karumathampatti, Semmandampalayam, Vaickapalayam and nearby areas, where the farmers put up a stiff resistance and staged protest. The officials once again visited Semmandampalayam on Saturday, forcing farmers to stage another protest. The farmers were arrested, taken to a marriage hall and released later in the day.
