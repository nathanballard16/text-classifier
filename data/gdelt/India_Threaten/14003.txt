Pakistan warns of nuclear war over Indian Kashmir

PAKISTANI Prime Minister Imran Khan warned the United Nations yesterday that his country’s dispute with India over Kashmir could escalate into an all-out nuclear war that would have consequences for the world.

In a fiery speech lasting 50 minutes, Khan said India could unleash a “bloodbath” in the Muslim-majority territory, as the nuclear-armed rivals took centre stage at the UN General Assembly.
