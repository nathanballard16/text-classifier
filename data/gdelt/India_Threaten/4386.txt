Kharge again declines invitation to attend meeting of Lokpal Selection Committee

The Congress won only 44 seats in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections and, while it was the single largest party in the opposition, it did not have the required 10 per cent of the strength of the house (55) to qualify for the position of Leader of the Opposition. This, in turn, created a problem in the composition of committees which choose candidates for posts like the Lokpal or the Director of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
