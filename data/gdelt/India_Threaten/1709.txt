NCERT meet reduces science to a joke

BHOPAL: Forget an apple a day, it’s ‘Namaste’ that keeps disease away. This and other bizarre claims were made at a conference on ‘Emerging Trends and Innovation in School Sciences’ at the NCERT-run Regional Institute of Education (RIE) in Bhopal on Wednesday.Some speakers said that sindoor “helps in balancing blood pressure” and going around a Tulsi plant has a “cooling effect” as many in the audience stared in disbelief.The scientific fraternity is outraged and says papers that have no scientific basis should not be allowed at such a conference. Research scholars and scientists will protest at the conference venue at RIE on Thursday.Several scientists had cautioned RIE against allowing such papers. “We had sent e-mails to the principal of RIE, N Pradhan, saying that submission of such pseudoscientific papers should not be allowed. Shockingly, instead of stopping such papers, the organisers discussed several topics that have no scientific base,” professor Soumitro Banerjee of Indian Institute of Science Education & Research (Kolkata) told TOI.Dr Ankit Sule from Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education had also objected to several topics slated for discussion. “On the first day, the conference had two parallel sessions on ‘Ancient Scientific Knowledge in Recent Perspectives’. According to those present at these sessions and notes taken by persons in the audience, several speakers made a number of questionable claims,” said Dr Sule.When TOI contacted RIE principal N Pradhan, he said: “I am not a scientist and I can’t comment on the papers presented in the conference.”
