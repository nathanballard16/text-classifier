We Will Transform To Reach New Heights, Says Outgoing Wipro Chairman Azim Premji In His Last AGM

Rishad is BA in Economics from Wesleyan University in US and an MBA degree holder from Harvard Business School. Stating that leading Wipro from 1966 till now has been the "greatest privilege" of his life and it has been an "extraordinary journey", Premji in his speech to AGM thanked generations of Wiproites and their families for their contribution towards building our company to what it is today.

Wipro will continually transform to scale new heights as the world changes while remaining firmly committed to its values, the company's chairman and tech magnate Azim Premji, who will retire as the company's head this month-end, said. Also, he expressed confidence that the future of Wipro would far outshine "anything that we have done before." The IT major last month had announced that Premji, who turned a small maker of vegetable oil into a USD 8.5-billion software behemoth, will retire as the company head by July-end and hand over reins of the firm to his son Rishad. Premji, who turns 74 in July, would retire as Executive Chairman upon the completion of his current term on July 30 after having led the company for 53 years, it had said. Informing company's shareholders that Rishad Premji,chief strategy officer and member of the board, would take over as the executive chairman with effect from July 31 during the company's annual general meeting, he said Rishad brings to this role new ways of thinking, broad experience, and competence that would lead Wipro to greater heights. "He (Rishad) has been an integral part of the leadership team since 2007, and has a deep understanding of the company, its business strategy, its culture and its heritage. He is also completely committed to the values which form the bedrock of Wipro," he added.
