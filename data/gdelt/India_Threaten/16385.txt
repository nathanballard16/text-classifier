Woman, 42, injured in contract killing bid dies in Bengaluru hospital

KRISHNAGIRI: The 42-year-old woman , who was critically injured in a contract killing bid on her businessman husband, died in a private hospital in Bengaluru on Thursday night after 11 days of ordeal.Police identified the deceased as A Neelima, wife of Babu, 45, of Naickanapalli near Uthanapalli. The car that she was travelling in came under attack near Hosur here on November 11 when a truck rammed it and a gang hurled crude petrol bombs at the vehicle, setting it on fire.While car driver Murali, 25, of Chettipalli village near Denkanikottai, was charred to death in the incident, Neelima escaped with nearly 60% burns. She was initially treated at the government hospital in Hosur.The Uthanapalli police initially suspected it to be a road accident case. However, in her statement to police, Neelima said it was a pre-planned murder attack on her.Further investigation revealed that the gang’s target was Neelima’s husband, who was supposed to travel with her on the fateful day, but dropped out saying he had to meet his friends.Police found out that Babu, who owned a carton box manufacturing unit, was planning to start a new plant and that his business rival Ramamoorthy, who was also a relative of his, was opposed to the idea. “Ramamoorthy had warned Babu not to start the new plant. However, Anand was not ready to shed his plan,” said an investigation officer.Based on her dying declaration of Neelima, the Uthanapalli police had arrested truck driver Maharajan, 40, Anandhan, 40 of Perandapalli and Santhakumar, 22, in connection with the case. A search is on for nine other accused in the case.
