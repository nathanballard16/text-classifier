The Western Railway issued an alert and heightened the security arrangements at all stations in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Gujarat.

The intelligence input warned of a terrorist attack by Jaish-e-Mohammed.

The Railway Protection Force (RPF) has ordered the security agencies to keep a close eye on long-distance trains especially those from Jammu.

The Western Railway RPF on February 27 along with Mumbai Government Railway Police (GRP) held a meeting to discuss on the plans for security arrangements at trains and railway stations.
