HC warns Stalin on linking Palaniswami to murder case

The Madras High Court on Thursday warned DMK President M.K. Stalin against linking Chief Minister K. Palaniswami to the theft-cum-murder that happened in Kodanad Estate that belonged to late Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa.

The court said it would be constrained to remove the stay on hearing the defamation case filed by the government against Stalin for linking Palaniswami to the incidents that happened in Kodanad Estate in Nilgiri district.

The court heard the petition filed by the state government to remove the stay on hearing the defamation case.

The court also ordered the submission of videos of Stalin's public rallies where he had spoken linking Palaniswami to Kodanad incidents.
