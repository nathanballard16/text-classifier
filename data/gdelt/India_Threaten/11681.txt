Watch: Imran Khan admits Balakot strike took place, says India 'planning something bigger'

He said: “I have information, that India has planned to take action in Azad Kashmir. The way they took action in Balakot after Pulwama, they’ve planned something even more drastic in Azad Kashmir.”

On Pakistan’s Independence Day, Pak PM Imran Khan appeared to finally admit that the Balakot terror strike was successful.

He also warned that the Indian Army was carrying out a ‘bigger attack’ in Azad Kashmir.

He said: “I have information, that India has planned to take action in Azad Kashmir. The way they took action in Balakot after Pulwama, they’ve planned something even more drastic in Azad Kashmir.”

He added that this "hateful ideology" will not remain limited to Kashmir and eventually spill towards Pakistan.

India's historic move has rattled Pakistan, following which it has undertaken a series of decisions, including downgrading bilateral relations with India and suspending bilateral trade, halting Samjhauta and Thar Express trains from its side and banning Indian movies in Pakistani cinemas.

Pakistan had long been denied that any terrorists were hit during the Balakot air-strike.
