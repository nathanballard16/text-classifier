Gurugram: Citizens are being robbed in shared cab rides even after the Gurugram police had arrested a gang of four members on December 17 for allegedly robbing people in a similar way. At least four cases of robbery in shared cabs were reported in the first three weeks of January.

Assistant Commissioner of Police (ACP- crime), Shamsher Singh, while speaking to Hindustan Times, said that they had put up boards in five major areas of the city in December last year urging people to avoid shared cab rides due to the increasing number of cases being reported. The warning boards were put up at places like Rajiv Chowk, IFFCO Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk.

Reportedly, no warning boards were found at Rajiv Chowk. Police officials, traffic cops and auto rickshaw drivers refused to have seen such boards in the area. However, two boards were found at IFFCO Chowk. A policeman on duty at the spot said that the warning boards were put about 10 months ago. Funds from Sector 18 police station were used to place five such boards 10 months ago, he added.

The ACP said that two teams of crime investigation agency are investigating the matter to nab the miscreants behind the shared cab ride robberies. Singh further said that he would look into the disappearance of boards. According to the police, they had arrested a gang and about 15 such cases were solved in December. This seems to be the work of a new gang. The members of this new gang have not been identified yet.
