Seeking peaceful Kashmir resolution not terrorism: Mirwaiz

Srinagar: Chairman of moderate Hurriyat on Friday said that seeking a peaceful resolution of Kashmir was not terrorism. He said Hurriyat will continue to pursue resolution of Kashmir and that New Delhi couldn’t intimidate its leadership.

“Hurriyat stands for resolution of Kashmir. We will continue to fight for it,” Mirwaiz said in his weekly sermon at Srinagar’s grand mosque. “Since 1947 conspiracies have been hatched against the people, the leadership and the Grand Mosque. But struggle in Kashmir struggle has continued.”

Mirwaiz has already been issued summons by National Investigation Agency to visit its office in New Delhi for questioning. However, Mirwaiz has refused to go, with his counsel citing the prevailing “hostile atmosphere” in New Delhi for Mirwaiz’s inability to visit the national capital.

“We are not going to bow down and New Delhi can’t force us into submission by intimidating us,” Mirwaiz said without naming NIA.

The NIA has again issued summons to Mirwaiz to appear before it New Delhi on March 18. However, Mirwaiz is unlikely to go citing the security threat to him in New Delhi.
