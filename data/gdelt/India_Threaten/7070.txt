We stand united against terrorism and violence: Community leaders

We all should unite and raise voice against terrorism. Most of the terror attack happen because there are differences in ideologies. In order to be in solidarity with the victims of Sri Lanka terror attack, the community leaders from different communities across Mumbai held a meet together to give out a message of unity. The meet was held at St. Micheal’s Church Hall, Mahim and was orgnaised by Bishop Bosco Penha, auxiliary Bishop of Bombay who led the prayers. Wherever the attack, it is always an attack on humanity.
