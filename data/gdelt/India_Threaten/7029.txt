Union flays move to sack 1,500 teachers

Coimbatore: Representatives of school teachers associations said the state was biased against government-aided school teachers in its move to sack 1,500 of them for not clearing teacher eligibility test (TET) before March 31. They said that while teachers from government-aided minority schools were exempted from TET, government-aided school teachers were being forced to take the test and were also not given enough opportunities to clear it. They said they would stage protests against this move by the government.

K Meenakshisundaram, general secretary of Tamil Nadu Elementary School Teachers Mandram and organiser of Jactto-Geo said that while the rule that made the TET exam mandatory for teachers in government-aided schools came into effect in 2010, the exam was thereafter conducted only thrice-in 2012, 2013 and 2017-and because of this the teachers did not get enough attempts to write and clear the exam.

“The exam should have been conducted at least 8 times since the rule was announced. But it was conducted only thrice. Also, while teachers of minority schools are exempted from the mandatory TET rule, it is not fair to subject teachers of government-aided schools to it,” he said.
