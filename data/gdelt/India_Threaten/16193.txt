Six Rasta Peth trees smothered in concrete from footpath works

The concretisation of roads and footpaths has turned out to be a choking hazard for trees. Despite instructions being relayed to curb such occurrences, little has changed as even decades-old trees have not been able to spread their roots. At present, this bleak scenario has made its presence felt at Rasta Peth. A tree activist has demanded action against the officer who was supposed to be responsible the trees. The authorities have vowed action upon verification.



Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has been redeveloping footpaths in several areas. Pockets for trees are included in their new design. However, the existing ones are going unattended as cement parches them of nutrients, thus stunting their growth. This phenomenon had prompted the civic body to instruct the contractors to take extra care of the green cover while developing the walkways or roads. However, it was seemingly shunned.



At Rasta Peth, this apathy cost six trees their health. Not only their base has been lathered with concrete, but even their space to flourish has been snatched.



After activist Bharat Surana observed the circumstances, he filed a complaint. “PMC has failed to follow its own rules while constructing a footpath at Rasta Peth. Despite claims of instructions, the concrete has been poured on the roots. They have even failed to provide sufficient space for growth. Considering these violations, the authorities should immediately take action against the contractor and plough the cement,” he said.



This issue was brought to the notice of Aniruddha Pawaskar, the head of road department. He reiterated of the standing instructions to the contractors that warns them against harm to the green cover. “I have asked them to ensure that no tree is covered in concrete. In this case, I have asked my officers to check what has gone wrong. In case there is a violation, action will be taken,” he said.
