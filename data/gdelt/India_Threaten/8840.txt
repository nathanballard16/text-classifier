Govt, private doctors in Kerala taking part in nation-wide strike

Thiruvananthapuram: As part of the nation-wide strike declared by the Indian Medical Association (IMA), the doctors in Kerala also are striking on Monday. The doctors in government hospitals will boycott OP (Out Patient) service from 8 to 10 in the morning. The doctors of private hospitals will strike for 24 hours.

Only essential health services will be available during the strike. The patients who arrive in government hospitals will have to wait for a long time.

The doctors will boycott OP between 8 am - 10 am in general hospitals, 9 am - 10 am in primary health centres and 10 am - 11 am in medical college hospitals. Doctors and professors will withdraw from teaching for one hour in medical colleges.

In private hospitals, only emergency services such as casualty, ICU, labour room and operation theatre are exempted from the 24-hour long strike. As there are more cases of fever being reported, patients are affected with the doctors’ strike.

All private clinics including dental clinics have also been asked to down their shutters for the day, a medical official said.



The protests are against the brutal attack on two junior doctors in Kolkata by the family members of a dead patient in the NRS Medical College and Hospital that took place late on June 10, doctors across the West Bengal and later across India had stopped work.
