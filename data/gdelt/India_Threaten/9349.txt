Mumbaikars wake up to Monsoon showers, heavy rains warning issued for next 24-hours

New Delhi:

At least a couple of day after the monsoon had officially been declared in Mumbai, the city has started receiving rains. Yes, you read it right. Mumbaikars woke up to monsoon showers on Friday morning with parts of the city receiving moderate to heavy rain. It is to be noted that heavy rainfall has been recorded in Virar, Juhu, Mulund and other areas.

In the meantime, large parts of India including the national capital remain parched as people desperately await overdue monsoon rains.

According to Skymet, Mumbai, Thane, Ratnagiri and adjoining areas will witness heavy to very heavy rains in the next 24 to 36 hours. Though the visibility at the Mumbai airport has been recorded as low, flight operations havenâ€™t been affected, reported ANI. Mumbai International Airport spokesperson, however, told news agency ANI that there was one diversion around 9 am.

While the monsoon helped bring down the temperature, it exposed Mumbaiâ€™s weak drainage system as waterlogging was reported from various parts of the city.Â

Mumbaikars across the city took to social media platforms to share images and videos of the Mumbai rains. Take a look:

Earlier on Thursday, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has cautioned people against opening manholes to avoid mishaps. Issuing an advisory, assistant commissioner of G North ward said that civic administration has taken several precautionary measures.

"The BMC has fixed protective grills in flooding-prone areas per Bombay High Court directives....Banners are also displayed at various flooding locations to appeal the citizens not to open manholes and inform BMC office if any manhole cover is found missing," the advisory noted.
