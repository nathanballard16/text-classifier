Congress has surprises in store: Rahul Gandhi

Says the party has much to offer in U.P.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi said in Dubai on Saturday that the party would contest the elections in UP on the basis of Congress ideology.

At a press conference, Mr. Gandhi took a cautious line by stating that he respected Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav.

“The BSP and the SP have every right to have an alliance, but I think the Congress has a tremendous lot to offer to the people of Uttar Pradesh and we will do our best. On the basis of Congress ideology, we will fight the elections,” he said. “We may spring one or two surprises and show what the Congress is capable of in terms of mobilising support in U.P.”

Back home, the Congress, however, adopted a tactical silence over the issue.

Ghulam Nabi Azad, Congress general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, said the party would not react immediately.

‘Meeting leaders’

“We heard some bits of the press conference between the BSP and SP leader that took place in Lucknow today [Saturday]. For the past two days, we have been busy meeting leaders from west U.P. in preparation of the forthcoming elections. We will offer response tomorrow [Sunday] in Lucknow,” Mr. Azad said, adding that if any leader makes a comment, it should be considered “an individual view and not a party view”.

Mr. Azad had earlier met Uttar Pradesh Congress chief Raj Babbar, Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader and Rajya Sabha member Sanjay Singh, and former MP Pramod Tiwari.

Congress’ U.P. in-charge said he, along with other leaders, would be meeting party leaders and workers of central and eastern U.P. on Sunday. He also refused to comment if the SP-BSP tie-up without the Congress is a setback.

Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath, who was in Delhi for a function, told reporters on the sidelines that there is a need for Opposition unity to defeat the BJP.
