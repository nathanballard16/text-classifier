To prevent drowning deaths near dams, authorities urge more caution, restraint

What can be done“There is no point in denying that more warning boards can be put up at dam reservoirs. Police, rescue agencies and government bodies in charge of these water bodies say that it’s also the tourists’ prerogative to exercise restraint and caution. We advice people to carry ropes when they go to water bodies for outings. There are at least 22 dams in Pune district, all of which have reservoirs that attract tourists during summers and monsoon. Most of the drowning deaths are reported from two of Maharashtra’s most popular tourist destinations: Lonavala and Khandala.
