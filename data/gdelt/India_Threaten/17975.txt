CAA-NRC: Dakshina Kannada Muslim committee plans protest on January 4

MANGALURU: The Muslim Central Committee of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi will hold a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) and proposed National Register of Ctizen (NRC) exercise at Nehru Maidan on January 4.In fact, the organisation had decided to hold a protest on December 28, however, considering the recent untoward incidents and police firing that led to the death of two people, the protest has been postponed, said KS Mohammed Masood, the president of the committee.At a press conference held in Mangaluru on Sunday, Masood said nearly 10 states have already declared they will not implement CAA and NRC. People are apprehensive about its consequences because the intention and necessity of the law are still not clear, he said.On the recent police firing incident in Mangaluru, Masood said the committee condemns the incident that led to the death of two people in the city on Thursday.“We demand the government to take action against the officers who are responsible for the incident. Police have booked cases against the two people who were killed in police firing. They are trying to hush up the allegations against them by doing so. A judicial probe will bring the facts to the light. We do not agree for any other type of inquiry into the incident,” Masood said.He said police should not treat citizens as their enemies.“Treat people as human beings. It is highly condemnable that police caned citizens, including students, mercilessly,” he added.“We demand adequate compensation to the kin of those who died in the police firing. Further, the government also should take care of the education of the children of Jaleel Bengre, who died in the police firing. Similarly, government should provide a job for the family members of Jaleel and Nauseen Kudroli, who also died in police firing," they added.
