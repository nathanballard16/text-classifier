SINGAPORE: Singapore Airlines (SIA) said it is assisting authorities with investigations after a bomb threat on Tuesday (Mar 26) on board flight SQ423 from Mumbai to Singapore.

Two fighter jets from the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF) were scrambled to intercept the flight and escort it back to Changi Airport.

The plane carrying 263 passengers and 18 crew members landed at Changi Airport at 7.54am, SIA said in response to queries from Channel NewsAsia.

"We are assisting the authorities with their investigations and regret that we are unable to provide further details," an SIA spokesperson said.

"There was no impact to other SIA operations."

The plane, a Boeing 777-300ER, had departed Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport at 11.36pm local time on Monday, according to website FlightAware.
