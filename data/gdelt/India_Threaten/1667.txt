No threat to state govt: Dinesh Gundu Rao

HUBBALLI: There is no threat to the state government as all the 80 Congress MLAs are in touch with top leaders and rumours of some of them joining BJP are baseless, said KPCC chief Dinesh Gundu Rao.He spoke to reporters at the airport here on Tuesday before proceeding to Belagavi. He said Congress was also gearing up for the upcoming Lok Sabha election. “The KPCC general body will be held on Wednesday in which many programmes are likely to be announced. Discussion regarding the election and strengthening the party will be held. After the budget, both JD(S) and Congress will discuss seat sharing and the candidates are likely to be announced by the end of this month,” he said.“The Congress will fight the elections highlighting the failures of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . Under his rule, employment generation touched new lows. He did nothing for the welfare of people. He promised Acche Din, but even after four and a half years, Acche Din has not come,” he added.Dinesh said the Union government had adopted a step-motherly attitude towards Karnataka. “The state government has sought Rs 2,500 crore towards drought relief but it has sanctioned only Rs 900 crore while neighbouring Maharashtra got Rs 4,000 crore,” he said.He also said that BJP’s Operation Lotus would fail this time too, adding that no Congress MLA would join to BJP. The budget session will run smoothly, he said.Calling Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s bluff over his claim on fighting corruption, Dinesh accused BJP of spending Rs 200-300 crore to lure MLAs of other parties. “Is it not corruption? Why can’t he take action? Modi has become infamous for destroying institutions such as CBI, Enforcement Directorate and Income Tax Department. He is using these departments to silence the opposition,” he charged.
