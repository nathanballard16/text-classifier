New Delhi: Punjab seems to be one of the few states which have resisted the Modi wave. Voting trends indicate Congress will win majority seats out the 13 Lok Sabha seats in the state as the party is leading in eight constituencies by good margins. Congress and Shiromani Akali Dal are leading in two constituencies each.

Aam Aadmi Party which looked promising in 2017 Assembly elections is seeing only Bhagwant Mann winning from Sangrur. Earlier today, Punjab CM Capt. Amarinder Singh attacked Navjot Singh Sidhu saying he is not able to handle is own portfolio. In a press briefing earlier today he said on Sidhu, "Indian servicemen will not tolerate hugging the Pakistani Army Chief."

The CM also praised Congress president Rahul Gandhi saying that he has matured as a leader. He added that the party will introspect on what happened. Talking about Congress's Sunil Jakhar trailing from Gurdaspur behind BJP's Sunny Deol, he said, "Sunil ji is a fine candidate, he had done a lot of work there. This is one thing I didn't understand that people gave preference to an actor than to experience."

As the counting proceeds, chances of Congress reaching even three-digit mark are looking grim. The party is struggling to win majority states in many states. As per exit poll projections, Congress is slated to win 10 Lok Sabha seats in Punjab as against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies which may win three seats.

To recap, in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP- Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) alliance had won six out of 13 seats in the state, while the AAP had bagged four seats and the Congress party had secured three seats.
