Try refreshing your browser, or 'Shock and awe': How Narendra Modi's move on Kashmir is taking India into uncharted territory Back to video Modi, who recently won reelection in a landslide, has always cast himself as a bold leader willing to break with the past. But his latest moves in Indian-controlled Kashmir mark one of the biggest gambles of his tenure and cast the future of India’s most restive region into doubt. For Modi, the decision to revoke the special status of Kashmir represents the fulfillment of a long-held demand of Hindu nationalists, who view India as a fundamentally Hindu nation rather than the secular republic envisioned by its founders.

Article content Modi hailed the changes as a “momentous occasion” that promises a “new dawn” for the people living in the Indian portion of Kashmir, a disputed region divided between India and Pakistan. Members of the ruling party say that nullifying the special status of Kashmir will promote economic development and undermine a 30-year insurgency against Indian rule. Some opposition parties have also supported the step. Critics say that Modi’s move to end a degree of autonomy for Kashmir could be unconstitutional and was carried out in autocratic fashion, with no warning and no input from Kashmiris or local political leadership. They warn that the unprecedented changes could deepen the sense among Kashmiris that India acts as an occupying power and could incite violent protests and radicalization.

Article content Finding out what Kashmiris themselves feel has been complicated by a near-complete communications shutdown. For four days, Kashmiris have been unable to access the Internet or make telephone calls. Movement from place to place is severely restricted, public meetings are banned, and mainstream political leaders have been taken from their homes, detained and held incommunicado. Still, reports have emerged of protesters throwing stones at security forces, as well as several gunshot injuries and one death. The Washington Post was unable to confirm such reports due to the communications shutdown. Photo by REUTERS/Anushree Fadnavis Manzoor Ahmed Butt, a prominent businessman, said that the air in central Srinagar, the Kashmiri capital, was thick with the pungent smell of tear gas Wednesday night. On Thursday morning, before he left for New Delhi, he saw a major city road littered with stones from protests, he said.

Article content Abolishing the powers of the clause is “one of the cornerstones of their ideology,” said Saba Naqvi, author of a book on the recent history of the BJP. The party has long opposed the notion of a “Muslim-majority state with special privileges.” Ram Madhav, general secretary of the BJP, wrote recently that Article 370 was a “discriminatory” anachronism used to “perpetuate sentiments of separatism.” Abrogating it was necessary for “the complete emotional integration” of Kashmiris with India. Analysts say that with the end of Article 370 – which allowed Kashmir to restrict nonresidents from buying land, among other things – the BJP could turn to two other fundamental ideological priorities. They include constructing a Hindu temple on a disputed site in the town of Ayodhya and eliminating the ability of religious communities to institute their own laws in matters such as marriage and divorce.

Article content While the BJP has long opposed Article 370, this week’s moves went still further. The government lopped off Ladakh, a mountainous and predominantly Buddhist area of Jammu and Kashmir, into a separate territory. Then it stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its statehood, turning it instead into a “union territory” – a second-class status that gives Kashmir less power to run its own affairs. Experts said they could not recall any precedent for demoting an Indian state to a union territory. “In some ways, this is shock and awe,” said Amitabh Mattoo, a professor of international relations at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi and a longtime observer of the Kashmir conflict. Few believed that the BJP would follow through on its promise to remove Kashmir’s autonomy, let alone end its status as a state, he said. “This is totally out of the box.” Modi has made dramatic moves shrouded in secrecy before: In 2016, he abruptly announced a decision to invalidate most of India’s currency.

Article content What happens next in Kashmir is a major question mark. “I don’t even think the authors of the move know where it will end up,” said Manoj Joshi, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation and the author of a recent book on the insurgency in Kashmir. Once the restrictions on movement and communications are lifted, significant protests are likely in Kashmir, Joshi said. Pakistan, which has long seen itself as the defender of Kashmiri Muslims, could also extend support to militants, he said, leading to further violence. Mainstream politicians in Kashmir, meanwhile, face an existential crisis. Such leaders have advocated dialogue with New Delhi to resolve the region’s future, guided by the protections enshrined in the constitution. “Once that arrangement is gone, the argument is gone,” said Faesal. “Effectively the entire political mainstream is dead.” — The Washington Post’s Niha Masih contributed to this report
