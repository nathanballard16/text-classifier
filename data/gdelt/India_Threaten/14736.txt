Defamatory posts against Gupta taken down, FB tells HC

NEW DELHI: Facebook told the Delhi HC on Monday that it had taken down the anonymous posts containing sexual harassment claims against artist Subodh Gupta from a handle on the social media platform Instagram , which it owns.The social media giant assured Justice R S Endlaw that it had complied with the court’s directive in response to a defamation suit filed by the artist, saying his reputation had been damaged by the anonymous posts.After Facebook said it had complied with the court’s orders, Justice Endlaw directed it to reveal in a sealed cover the identity of the person operating the Instagram handle “Herdsceneand”, which carried the allegations.But Google, which had been directed to remove from its search engine all URLs leading to news reports on the allegations, contested the order. In a plea for modification of the September 2019 directive, Google argued it was only an “intermediary” and, therefore, couldn’t be held responsible for the content of links thrown up by its search engine. The tech giant said Gupta should have gone after the news publications that carried the reports rather than target it.Gupta had filed for damages last month, saying the “unfounded, baseless allegations” had affected his right to livelihood.The next hearing is on November 18.
