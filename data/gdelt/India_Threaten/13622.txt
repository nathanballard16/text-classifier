Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis defends Mumbai Metro project at India Today Conclave 2019

Devendra Fadnavis also made it clear that the BJP will fight the upcoming polls with Shiv Sena.

Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday defended the Mumbai Metro project that has run into controversy over trees that must be felled for a car depot. Plans for one of the upcoming Metro line propose to construct a car depot in Mumbai's Aarey Forest. The proposal has been opposed by activists and has led to a huge controversy.

Speaking at the India Today Conclave Mumbai 2019, Fadnavis defended the project. "We have a rehabilitation plan in place. The Metro will mitigate the carbon footprint. All environment assessments are done," Fadnavis said.

Fadnavis also said that the area where the car depot has been proposed does not fall under any protected or restricted zone. "It is open government land."

The chief minister also said the government plans to plant a large number of trees to mitigate the impact of felling trees for the Metro project.

Fadnavis also spoke about his relationship with ally Shiv Sena. Fadnavis said he does not read Saamna, the mouthpiece of the BJP's ally Shiv Sena. Saamna is known for its sharp criticism of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led governments at both the Centre and in Maharashtra.

Speaking at the India Today Conclave Mumbai 2019, Fadnavis also said that he is not deterred by ally Shiv Sena's criticism of his government or his party. "Aisa hai ki dost agar pathar bhi phainke toh to usse phool samjahna chahiye [Stones hurled by friends are like flowers]," Fadnavis said.

Fadnavis also made it clear that the BJP will fight the upcoming polls with Shiv Sena.
