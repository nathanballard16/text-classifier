Pakistan Lacks Ability to Fight Full-Fledged War With India - Indian Defence Minister

Addressing the parliament, the minister assured the nation on behalf of the armed forces that the Indian border is secure and adversaries will never succeed in their plan.

“Pakistan does not have the ability to run a full-fledged war against India, nor even a limited one. Hence, it tries to run a proxy war”, Singh said while speaking on the occasion of the Kargil anniversary in parliament.

Indian Army Chief General Bipin Rawat has echoed a similar sentiment, saying Pakistan has been making desperate attempts to ensure the Kashmir issue remains alive. “Pakistan has been singled out. They are providing moral and financial support [to militants]”, Rawat said on Friday.
