Meanwhile, Sarabjit told the police that some assailants while attempting to snatch his pistol in a park at Phase VII at around 11 pm on Friday, opened fire at him.

The police doubted his version of the story as the weapon was seized from his car and if someone had attacked him and tried to to snatch his weapon, the attackers would not have left it behind.

Kuldeep Singh Chahal, Senior superintendent of police (SSP), said that the accused has been booked for endangering life or personal safety of other, possessing illegal arms and misleading the police.

Sarabjit would be arrested after he gets a fitness certificate from the doctors. He is currently undergoing treatment.
