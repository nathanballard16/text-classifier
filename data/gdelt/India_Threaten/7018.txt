Terrorists stayed in India before Easter Day blast; planning in Kerala

KOCHI: According to the indication from the Indian Military Intelligence, The Easter day blast in Sri Lanka was plotted by the terrorists during their stay in Kerala. Sri Lankan Army Chief had revealed that the terrorist had been in Kashmir, Kerala and Bengaluru. A team of Military Intelligence, RAW, NIA and IB is currently staying at Kochi to prep for the probe. The investigation is unified by Alok Mittal, the NIA IG.

In an interview to BBC, Sri Lankan Army Chief Lt. Col. General Mahesh Senanayake revealed that the terrorists were in places including Kerala. There were reports that the mastermind behind the attack and the head of NTJ, Shahran Hashim had stayed at Panayikulam and Malappuram. The police believe that the stay in India might have been for training or to contact terror organizations. The attack might have directed by foreign terror outfits, Senanayake said.

Sri Lanka was warned about a terror attack by NIA. So, it must be believed that the Indian agencies were aware of the presence of terrorists in India. A top official told Keralakaumudi that it has not been confirmed yet and the probe is for proofs.

So far, India’s headache was to tackle terrorists from Pakistan. But now the suicide bombing in Sri Lanka has created a southern headache for the Indian agencies.
