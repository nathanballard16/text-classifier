Thailand seeks custody of Chambal turtle smuggler

BHOPAL: The Thailand government has initiated legal process to extradite Manivannan Murugesan , who is locked up in Sagar jail for the past year for smuggling critically endangered turtles from Chambal.The accused has approached Supreme Court for bail after Madhya Pradesh high court refused to entertain his plea.During the last SC hearing, the Madhya Pradesh special task force-wildlife was asked to confirm if Murugesan was 'wanted' by Thai police . STF has got a letter from Thailand, which says the case against him is still open in that country and they have initiated process of extradition. Thailand airport police had earlier issued an international arrest warrant against Murugesan.STF objects to his bail plea, alleging that he was behind smuggling of hundreds of endangered turtles from the state. Murugesan was arrested by MPSTF-wildlife from Chennai on January 31, 2018, for smuggling endangered red crowned roofed turtles from Morena and has been in Sagar jail ever since. His bail pleas has been rejected by several courts.MPSTF has approached Enforcement Directorate (ED) headquarters in Mumbai to initiate a money laundering case against Murugesan and three others - Ajay Singh, who was arrested from Agra, and Kolkatans Mohammad Irfan and Sameem Ansari. Interpol had organised a coordination meeting with MPSTF and officers from Thailand and Dhaka during an investigation support meeting against illegal turtle poaching in July.Murugesan hails from Singapore and his illegal trade is spread across Thailand, Malaysia, Macau, Hong Kong, China and Madagascar, says STF. In fact, Interpol was looking for Murugesan for a long time.He was arrested by Thailand police in 2012, but escaped during trial and was on the run until MPSTF nabbed him in January 2018. STF has arrested more than 20 people in this case so far. Murugesan's alleged role in the smuggling surfaced after the arrest of a businessman for stealing red-crowned roofed turtle from a breeding centre in Morena district.
