Intelligence agencies warn of another attack by JeM

Intelligence sources have warned of another Pulwama-style attack by Pakistan-backed terrorist outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Jammu and Kashmir in coming 3-4 days.

As per the inputs, the banned terror outfit is planning to strike “very soon”.

In view of the specific inputs by the intelligence agencies, security has been beefed up across the state and security agencies have been directed to remain on high alert.

The Masood Azhar-led JeM has planned to carry out an IED attack in Qazigund and Anantnag of South Kashmir, say intelligence inputs.

This time the vehicle to be used to execute the plan is a “Tata Sumo SUV”.

The warning came a few hours after a grenade attack was carried out at a bus stop in Jammu that injured 32 people and killed 1.
