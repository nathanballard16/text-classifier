L&T's Power Business wins orders from DVC

The Power business of Larsen & Toubro (L&T) has bagged significant engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) orders from Damodar Valley Corporation (DVC) to set up Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) systems in three power plants of DVC - Durgapur Steel Thermal Power Station (2x500 MW), Mejia Thermal Power Station (2x500 MW) and Raghunathpur Thermal Power Station (2x600 MW) - in West Bengal.



This is in continuation to the orders L&T had received earlier from NTPC for setting up FGD systems.



Installation of FGD systems in existing and upcoming thermal power plants has been made mandatory by Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Government of India, to curtail SO2 emissions.



Commenting on the FGD orders, Mr Shailendra Roy, CEO & Managing Director, L&T Power and Whole-Time Director, L&T, said, "We are delighted to have secured orders from a prestigious client like DVC. L&T is fully equipped to provide solutions for SOx and NOx control to its clients. Considering the deadline endorsed by the apex court, other power plants will have to hasten the process of FGD award to meet the scheduled time frame. L&T will continue to play a significant role in this market of SOx and NOx reduction."



Ministry of Power, Government of India, has set December 2022 as the deadline for existing thermal power plants to comply with revised emission norms.
