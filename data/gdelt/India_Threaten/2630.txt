India to stop share of river water flowing into Pakistan, tweets Gadkari

The Indian government has blamed Pakistan for the attack. Islamabad has denied any hand in it.

The mention of stopping water to Pakistan has come exactly a week after a Jaish-e-Mohammad car-bomb suicide attack killed 40 CRPF jawans in Pulwama.

On the other side, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned that if India attacks Pakistan, it will retaliate.

Under the leadership of Hon'ble PM Sri @narendramodi ji, Our Govt. has decided to stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan. We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab.

Minister Nitin Gadkari, in a series of tweets, has said that India will 'stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan'.

The tweet said: 'Under the leadership of Hon'ble PM Sri @narendramodi ji, Our Govt. has decided to stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan. We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab.'



Gadkari, who is in charge of road transport and highways, shipping and water resources and river development & Ganga Rejuvenation, in a second tweet tried to explain details of some projects. 'The construction of dam has started at Shahpur- Kandi on Ravi river. Moreover, UJH project will store our share of water for use in J&K and the balance water will flow from 2nd Ravi-BEAS Link to provide water to other basin states.'
