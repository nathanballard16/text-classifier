INS Kolkata, INS Shakti to participate in Chinese International fleet review

Two Indian Navy warships, namely the destroyer INS Kolkata and tanker INS Shakti, would be a part of the Chinese international fleet review scheduled to be held on April 23 at Qingdao.

Chinese President Xi Jinping will be reviewing the warships.

Marking the 70th Anniversary of the People’s Liberation Army’s Navy there, the celebrations are being held and major navies are likely to participate in it.

“Indian Navy Ships Kolkata and Shakti are scheduled to arrive Qingdao, China on 21 Apr 19 to participate in the International Fleet Review as part of 70th Anniversary celebrations of PLA (Navy),” Indian Navy said.

International Fleet Review (IFR) is a parade of naval ships, aircraft, and submarines, organised by nations to order to promote goodwill, strengthen cooperation and showcase their organisational capabilities.

Equipped with state-of-the-art weapons INS Kolkata has sensors to address threats in all dimensions of naval warfare while the INS Shakti, a replenishment ship, is one of the largest tankers displacing over 27,000 tonnes and capable of carrying 15,000 tonnes of liquid cargo and over 500 tonnes of solid cargo including victuals and ammunition.

“The visit of Indian Navy’s most potent destroyer and versatile fleet support ship showcases India’s prowess, reach and sustainability in addition to indigenous shipbuilding capability,” the Navy said.
