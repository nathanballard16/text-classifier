BJP has alleged that the Congress is weakening the morale of the armed forces. Briefing media in New Delhi today, senior Party leader and Union Minister, Ravi Shankar Prasad said, the whole country is united and standing firmly with the forces after the Pulwama attack, but the Congress is indulging in low level of politics.

Earlier in the day, Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had alleged that while everyone was mournig for slain soldiers, BJP played politics on their martyrdom.

Surjewala said it is sad that when the mortal remains of soldiers returned to Delhi Airport, Prime Minister Narendra Modi returned one hour late from Jhansi because he was busy in political campaigns.

Reacting to the remarks, Ravi Shankar Prasad alleged the expressions may vary but the tone of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and Congress spokesperson is same. He asked the Congress party not to work to break the morale of the army.

Mr Prasad said, there is a fundamental difference between the thinking of BJP and the Congress. He said, all the Union Ministers attended the funeral of the brave martyrs, but the party believes that the country should not stop and the development works should be continued.

Mr Prasad said, in the last four years 728 terrorist were neutralized and India will continue its fight against terrorism under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
