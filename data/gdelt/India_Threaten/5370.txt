Former CMs of Occupied Kashmir strongly criticize BJP to abrogate article-370

Kashmiri political parties and former chief ministers of the occupied Kashmir have strongly criticized the announcement by BJP to abrogate article-370 after winning election.

Commenting on the announcement, former Chief Minister of occupied Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti said, every son the Kashmiri soil will fight till his last for rights and such measures cannot suppress their struggle.

Farooq Abdullah in his reaction said, those saying articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution were supposed to be temporary are affirming that Kashmir's accession to India too was temporary.

Omer Abdullah said, the Article provides special status to Kashmir, and its abrogation would further accelerate the freedom struggle further.
