Water woes raise a stink ahead of ward bypoll

Residents protesting against contaminated water supply

VADODARA: After the opposition party in the Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC), citizens themselves have taken up the issue of supply of contaminated drinking water in the city. The residents of a high-rise apartment on the R V Desai Road in Navapura have threatened to boycott the civic bypolls scheduled on October 22 over the issue.

The Krishna Tower has been getting contaminated drinking water since about a fortnight now. The residents of the apartments have been complaining this since quite some time, but the VMC is yet to find a solution to their woes. Frustrated with the state of affairs, the residents have threatened that they will not vote for the ensuing byelections to the ward 13.

Secretary of the society Suhas Bhatt said that the water being supplied to the apartment was not fit even for cleaning purposes. “We cannot even mop the floor with it. We have been forced to use a borewell for water, but supply from it is also erratic as it is old,” Bhatt said.

The residents have been purchasing drinking water jugs. Bhatt said that believing that the problem was temporary, the society got the overhead and underground tanks cleaned repeatedly. The drainage and water lines of the society were also checked. “We have spent Rs 30,00 to Rs 40,000 on this so far,” Bhatt said.

Sources said that the situation is similar in other apartments and residential localities around the Krishna Tower. After protests by Krishna Tower residents, VMC as well as senior functionaries of the BJP have swung into action. Attempts are being made to resolve the issue at the earliest.
