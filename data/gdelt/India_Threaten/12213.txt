BJP warns two councillors who misbehaved with public servants

Surat: Two BJP councillors , who recently misbehaved with public servants in the city, were reprimanded for embarrassing the party by a Gujarat BJP leader.Bharat Vaghasiya and Amit Rajput were summoned to party office on Saturday by a senior state unit leader and told in the presence of Surat unit chief Nitin Bhajiyawala that such behaviour would not be tolerated.The BJP state unit is contemplating action against them because employees of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC) had protested against the incidents, which showed the party in poor light, sources said.Nitin Bhajiyawala said, “Both the councillors were summoned to BJP city unit office and warned in the presence of BJP Gujarat general secretary Bharatsinh Parmar, who is in -charge of Surat, that such behaviour will not be tolerated.Party will take action against them in some time. I have no power to take action against the two elected representatives.” Amit Rajput, councillor from Godadara-Dindoli ward, had used foul language for a staffer of SMC on August 6 when he went to remove shutters of a renovated structure.The BJP councillor didn’t allow removal of the shutters and abused Aswin Rajput. Bharat Vaghasiya, councillor from Karanj-Magob ward, allegedly slapped sanitary sub-inspector Jagdish Prajapati for closing a tea stall in the area and imposing a fine of Rs50,000 on its owner.He wanted the amount of the fine to be reduced and the shop allowed to be reopened despite it using banned plastic bags.
