Speaking to the BBC, Imran Khan called on his Indian counterpart to come to a peaceful dialogue over the "oppression of Kashmir" and claimed the number one priority for the two nations should be tackling poverty. He said: “Surely the number one task of the two governments should be: how are we going to reduce poverty? And the way we reduce poverty is by settling our differences through dialogue.

India vs Pakistan: Is India planning another attack on Pakistan?

“And there is only one difference, which is Kashmir. It has to be settled.

“The Kashmir issue cannot keep on boiling like it is because anything happening in Kashmir - through a reaction to the oppression which is taking place in Kashmir - it would be palmed off n Pakistan.

“We would be blamed and tensions would rise as they have risen in the past.

“So if we can settle Kashmir, the benefits of peace are tremendous in the subcontinent.”

But speaking about the dangers of confrontation escalating between the two countries, Mr Khan warned: "Once you respond, no-one can predict where it can go from there.”
