"We are looking forward to develop a whole new generation of local users into loyalists": Amarjit Singh Batra

He believes the growth of music streaming will be driven by youth in the age group of 18 and even younger, to 35 years as almost 85 per cent of these users would access the music through connected mobile devices. "This would be driven by the preference of consuming the music services anytime, anywhere. Through the growing access of the internet and global culture influence, we were excited to know that we already have a passionate audience base in India that truly understands the unparalleled music streaming experience Spotify has to offer. We believe in the power of our service as we are looking forward to engaging with our fans and develop a whole new generation of local users into loyalists," concludes Batra.
