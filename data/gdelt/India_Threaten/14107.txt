On being asked if IAF is better prepared to carry out another Balakot like strike in future, Bhadauria said that India was prepared then and will be prepared next time. “We will be ready to face any challenge, any threat,” he added.

The Air Chief Marshal also said that he is aware of reports of Pakistan reactivating Balakot terror camps and will take the necessary action as and when required.

Responding to Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s warning of nuclear war with India, he said, “That is their understanding of nuclear aspects. We have our own understanding, our own analysis. We will be ready to face any challenge.”

Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria succeeds Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, who retired after 41 years of service in the IAF. Air Marshal Bhadauria was commissioned in the fighter stream of the Indian Air Force in June 1980 and has held various command, staff and instructional positions.

An alumnus of the National Defence Academy, Bhadauria was commissioned into the fighter stream of the IAF in June 1980. He won the coveted ‘Sword of Honour’ for standing first in the overall order of merit. During his nearly four-decade career, Bhadauria commanded a Jaguar squadron and a premier Air Force Station.
