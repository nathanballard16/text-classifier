Sena’s word of caution over exodus to BJP

Former Maharashtra minister and Congress leader Harshavardhan Patil too joined BJP on Wednesday. Shiv Sena reacted to the continued exodus with its MP Sanjay Raut advising such leaders to not join the BJP-Sena alliance only to become MPs or MLAs.The latest setback for NCP came at a time when its leadership is in talks with Congress to finalise seat-sharing for the 288-member assembly.Naik, his son, former MP Sanjeev, and the 50-odd corporators of the Navi Municipal Corporation (NMMC) formally joined BJP in the presence of Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis . Naik’s entry into BJP now paves the way for the ruling party to control the NMMC.Patil, a four-time MLA from Indapur in Pune district lost the 2014 assembly polls by a slim margin to NCP’s Dattatrey Bharne too joined BJP at an event attended by Fadnavis.The steady stream of new joinees drew a word from Raut who said leaders joining the NDA bandwagon should first endorse the Hindutva ideology. “The leaders who are planning to join us should come up with the full acceptance of the ideology of Hindutva. This is because our doors are not open for people who only want to become an MP, MLA or minister.” said leaders shouldn’t join the just for the sake of acquiring any ministerial status.
