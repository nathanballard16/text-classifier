The rift betweenChief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu and Chief Secretary LV Subrahmanyam widened on Friday with the bureaucrat skipping a crucial review meet called by the CM to discuss Cyclone Fani. According to sources, ever since Subrahmanyam took over the post on April 6, he has been completely disregarding the chief minister’s authority.Annoyed by his defiant attitude, Naidu vowed to take disciplinary action against any bureaucrat who failed to attend the meets. “In every state, chief secretary reports to the CM. But, here (AP), do I need to beg him to report to me?”, an angry Naidu said at a media conference.As soon as the Election Commission gave Naidu a go-ahead to review cyclone-related works by relaxing the election code of conduct in four districts of Srikakulam,and East Godavari, Naidu had called for a review.Naidu and Subrahmanyam have been engaged in a tussle ever since his appointment. Naidu has accused Subrahmanyam of being an accomplice in a disproportionate assets case againstpresident YS Jaganmohan Reddy.
