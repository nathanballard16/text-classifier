MEERUT: Two women, both in their early 20s, have approached police citing threats from their parents who they say are “hell-bent” against their "relationship" and also against their living together in Shamli , a dusty town in western Uttar Pradesh known for its rigid social structure.After being coerced by their families and “shamed” by society for months, the women, who work in a factory in Ghaziabad, decided to file a case against their own family members.In a written complaint given to superintendent of police of Shamli, Ajay Kumar, they have accused their families of “threating them of dire consequences if they didn’t part ways”.“We are adults and independent. We have jobs and we want to live together out of our own will. But, our families are against it and we fear for lives,” the women wrote in their complaint.Rinki, 21, and Komal, 24, (names changed) are from separate villages in Kandhla area of Shamli district According to additional superintendent of police of Shamli, Rajesh Srivastava, the women came to his office on Wednesday seeking protection from their families. “The women have sought police protection citing threat from their families. I have instructed station officer at Mahila Thana to look into the case and take appropriate action,” ASP Srivastava said.According to sources, the two women came in contact during their school days in Shamli and later moved to Ghaziabad where they have been working at a private firm and sharing a room. Fearing for their safety, they refused to comment when TOI tried contacting them.
