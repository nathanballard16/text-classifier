New Delhi, May 3

A woman, who allegedly conspired to kill her husband in northeast Delhi’s New Usmanpur area, had been arrested along with her paramour and another accomplice, police said on Friday.

Subodh Jain (42) was found unconscious in his house on May 1. An almirah was found open and some articles lying around. He was rushed to Jag Pravesh Chandra Hospital where he was declared brought dead, Deputy Commissioner of Police (northeast) Atul Kumar Thakur said.

His wife, Preeti Jain, told the police that her husband would earlier also become repeatedly unconscious, the police officer said.

The post-mortem revealed that asphyxia as a result of strangulation was the cause of death, following which a case was registered and investigation initiated, the DCP said.

During interrogation, it was revealed that Preeti used to “speak frequently” with one Rahul Jain (30), a resident of Sonepat, following which the latter was apprehended, Thakur said.

Disclosing about his relationship with Preeti, Rahul said she was not happy with her marriage and hence they planned to eliminate Subodh. Rahul also roped in his friend Vijay Hooda and offered him Rs 1.5 lakh to kill Preeti’s husband, the police officer said.

According to their plan, Preeti handed over a set of keys of the house to Rahul on April 29 and left the house along with her child after giving her husband some sleeping pills, the DCP said.

Rahul informed Hooda about Preeti leaving the house. Hooda entered the house, strangled Subodh to death, took away a laptop and a mobile, scattered the contents of the almirah on the floor and left for Sonepat, the police officer said.

All three have been arrested and the laptop, mobile, the string used to strangle the victim and the car used by them had been seized, the police said. PTI
