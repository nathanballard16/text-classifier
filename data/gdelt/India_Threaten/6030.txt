AAP-Congress talks stall over Haryana alliance

Congress okay with tie-up in Delhi

Alliance talks between the Aam Aadmi Party and the Congress failed on Wednesday, with the Congress agreeing to a tie-up in Delhi but refusing to include a seat-share in Haryana.

AAP leader Sanjay Singh, who was heading the alliance talks for the Aam Aadmi Party, told the media on Wednesday that the Congress was not in a mood for an alliance. “It’s very sad that after all the efforts, the Congress is not ready to come to any understanding.”

He said he had told Gulab Nabi Azad also during Tuesday’s meeting that with 6:3:1 (six congress, three JJP and one AAP) in 10 seats in Haryana, the BJP could be defeated in all the seats.

“After today’s statement from Gulab Nabi Azad and Bupender Hooda, I don’t feel the Congress is ready any for understanding, so we are going forward. We will fight in all seven seats in Delhi and win. And in Haryana, AAP and JJP will fight together,” he said.

Minutes later, however, party sources said the alliance talks were still on.

A senior Congress leader said as far as the party was concerned, the ball was in the AAP’s court. The AAP could contest in four seats in Delhi and the Congress in the other three.

“The Congress will not agree to a tie-up in Haryana as there are very strong regional leaders within the State. The offer stands for Delhi alone, with no package deals,” the leader said.
