Delhi and the national capital region woke up to a clear sky on Wednesday with the rain bringing a respite from the unrelenting cold. The minimum temperature settled at five notches above normal.

For the first time this season, the air quality also improved from the usual "very poor and severe" to "moderate" category as rains caused the pollution to settle while strong winds dissipated the particulate matters.

The fog and persistent showers, however, affected train and flight services in North India. As many as 21 trains to Delhi were running late on Wednesday morning.

Light to heavy rainfall is expected in the region over the next two to three days with the skies remaining partly cloudy with the maximum temperature remaining around 19 degrees and the minimum temperature expected to touch about 8 degrees with wind speed touching 20-25 kmph on Wednesday and Thursday.

The India Meterological Department (IMD) said, "Another Western Disturbance would affect Northwest India January 24 onwards."

The IMD has further warned that dense to very dense fog would persist over regions in Punjab, Haryana, north Rajasthan and pockets of Delhi on Wednesday.

Air quality will remain 'poor' to 'very poor’ across major cities in India.
