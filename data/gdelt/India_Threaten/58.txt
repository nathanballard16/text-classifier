SAD backs protesters who defaced Rajiv Gandhi’s statue & board

The Shiromani Akali Dal has justified defacing of an MCD signboard bearing the name of former Prime Minister of India Rajiv Gandhi at Rajiv Chowk metro station in Connaught Place in New Delhi by the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims who protested against the Congress for not getting justice and continuing membership of Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler in the party.

“Action and reactions of the victims are justified. We support them. They are just expressing their anger by brushing the sign board for not getting justice in 34 years and Congress is supporting the accused,” Manjinder Singh Sirsa, national spokesperson for SAD and general secretary of the DSGMC.

Sajjan Kumar has been convicted by the Delhi High Court in the riot case but Tytler has not yet been convicted. Sajjan has challenged the HC order in SC. Sirsa said after conviction Sajjan had resigned but Congress did not announce sacking him from the party.

“The victims are just defacing a signboard and not resorting to arms to avenge the killing of innocent Sikhs,” Sirsa added.

Earlier a statue of Rajiv Gandhi was vendalised at Ludhiana and Chief minister of Punjab Capt. Amarinder Singh issued a stern warning to the protestors. The Chief Minister asked Sukhbir Badal to immediately apologise for the obnoxious act of his party workers, who were clearly acting on an agenda to garner votes in the ensuing polls. “Indulgence in such petty and condemnable actions will not absolve you or your family of the many sins of omission and commission against the Guru Granth Sahib and the Sikh community,” the Chief Minister told Sukhbir.
