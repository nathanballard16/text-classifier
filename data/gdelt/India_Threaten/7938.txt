Criminal Shot Dead by Rival Gang Members in Patna

Patna: Motorcycle-borne criminals in Patna on Monday morning shot and killed a man and escaped before police could arrive at the crime-scene.

The incident occurred near Kidwaipuri Park barely 500 meters from the Kotwali police station on Buddha Marg.

The victim was identified as Ravi Rai of Mandiri area in Patna.

As reported, three men on motorcycles accosted Rai as he was returning to his home after his morning walk. Sensing some threat, Rai tried to lose the criminals but was surrounded by them who fired at least three shots hitting him in his head and stomach.

He died on the spot. Police have recovered two spent cartridges from the crime scene.

Police said the victim had a long criminal history that included murders and robberies and was recently released on bail from the Beur Jail.

Patna Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Garima Malik said that an FIR was filed by the victim's family and police were in the process of collecting surveillance video footages from the area to identify the killers of Rai.

"The crime appears to be the result of a personal enmity. While in prison, he was reportedly threatened by other gang members who swore to kill him once he was out of the jail," the SSP said.
