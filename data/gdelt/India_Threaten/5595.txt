TDP Plotting Violence: Vijayasai Reddy

YSR Congress Party National Secretary and Rajya Sabha member V Vijayasai Reddy cautioned the people of Andhra Pradesh about the Telugu Desam Party's nefarious ways to try and defame the YSRCP. Taking to Social Media, Vijayasai Reddy said that the TDP was trying to instigate the peoples' mind against the YSRCP.

He forewarned that the TDP was planning a conspiracy to create an anti-YSRCP feeling. He said that 25-30 goondas (anti- social elements) from Rayalseema region were going to be sent to different constituencies in Andhra Pradesh. These people, in the garb of YSRCP workers, will go amongst the people and threaten them to vote for the YSRCP and that if they don't vote for YS Jagan they would be killed .

These acts were meant to create an impression in the minds of the people that the YSRCP was threatening them .

This would be featured in the TDPs Yellow media that the Rayalaseema factionists were resorting to threaten the AP voters, and this would carried as news in bold headlines. The news would insinuate the public mind that YS Jagan was carrying out these acts.

Vijayasai Reddy in an earnest request said that a person like YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who requested the people of Andhra not resort to any kind of violence after the murder attempt on him at the Visakhapatnam Airport.

YS Jagan had also urged the people to maintain restraint and stay calm after the horrific murder of his beloved uncle YS Vivekananda Reddy in Kadapa.

When he himself had urged people to maintain peace, why would he encourage such violent acts, he questioned. He asked the people to use their discretion and not fall for Chandrababu's vicious plots and his Yellow media writings.
