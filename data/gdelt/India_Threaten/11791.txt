Fascist Hindutva tactics of Modi govt will fail miserably in IoK: PM Imran

The fascist, Hindu Supremacist Modi Govt should know that while armies, militants & terrorists can be defeated by superior forces; history tells us that when a nation unites in a freedom struggle & does not fear death, no force can stop it from achieving its goal. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) August 16, 2019

That is why the Hindutva exclusivist creed of the Modi-led Govt with its fascist tactics in IOK will fail miserably in its attempt to smother the Kashmiri liberation struggle. — Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) August 16, 2019

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday said that the fascist Hindutva tactics being employed by the Narendra Modi-led government in occupied Kashmir will fail miserably as the valley seethes in anger following New Delhi’s revocation of the region’s autonomous status.The premier, in a series of tweets, warned the Indian government that "no force can stop" a nation from achieving its goals when unity is achieved in a freedom struggle and death is not feared."The fascist, Hindu Supremacist Modi Govt should know that while armies, militants & terrorists can be defeated by superior forces; history tells us that when a nation unites in a freedom struggle & does not fear death, no force can stop it from achieving its goal."Criticising New Delhi further, the prime minister said the tactics being employed in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) will fail to smother the Kashmiri liberation struggle.The statement by the prime minister comes on a day when the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) will hold a meeting on Kashmir after decades.The Pakistan Army had also warned India that the armed forces are prepared and shall go to any extent to fulfill its obligations to the Kashmiri people.Earlier this week, PM Imran had expressed concern that after brutalising occipied Kashmir, the Hindu supremacist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) would turn on Muslims in India and eventually target Pakistan.The premier had also drawn parallels between the doctrine of the Modi-led government and the Nazi ideology.In his speech at the parliament on August 6, PM Imran had vowed to take on the “racist” ideology of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the wake of its government stripping occupied Kashmir of its special status and also promised to raise the issue on every international forum including the UN Security Council.
