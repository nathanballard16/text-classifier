Amid prevalent tensions with West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday issued a fresh warning to the Trinamool Congress over Saradha scam. Addressing a public gathering in West Bengal's Jalpaiguri, PM Modi said the no one linked with the scam will be spared.

"This 'chowkidar' will spare neither the perpetrators of chit fund scams nor those protecting them," PM Modi said while criticising Mamata Banerjee for staging a dharna in Kolkata last Sunday in support of Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar who is facing the heat in connection with the Saradha chit fund scam.

"It is for the first time that a chief minister sat on dharna to protect those who looted lakhs of people," PM Modi said.

Speaking at the rally after inaugurating the circuit bench of Calcutta High Court at Jalpaiguri, PM Modi said Mamata Banerjee was more concerned about grabbing the (PM's) chair in New Delhi. "Didi is worried about going to Delhi and has left poor and middle class people of Bengal to be looted by the syndicate," the PM said.

" The TMC government has defamed the soil of West Bengal and rendered people helpless. Those who got power in Bengal in the name of Maa, Maati, Manush have adopted culture of violence," PM Modi said attacking the Mamata regime for political violence in the state.
