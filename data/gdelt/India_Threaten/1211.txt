Jaipur: The Gujjar community has warned of an agitation if the government doesn’t give reservation in another 11 days. A 'mahapanchayat' was called by the Gujjar community in Sawai Madhopur demanding 5 per cent reservation. Talking to ANI, a member of the mahapanchayat said, "Either the government gives us 5% reservation in another 11 days, or there will be agitation."

Thousands of members from the Gujjar community participated in the mahapanchayat, which was led by veteran Gujjar leader Colonel (retired) Kirori Singh Bainsla.

A similar ‘mahapanchayat’ was held last year in March in which Bainsla had threatened to launch an agitation after 25 days and demanded 4% reservation. Later, the agitation was postponed.

The Vasundhara Raje-led BJP government issued a notification providing 1% reservation to Gujjar and four other backward communities in December 2017.

Rajasthan witnessed violent protests in 2008 after cops fired on Gujjar protesters who were demanding a scheduled tribe status. The protesters retaliated by lynching a policeman in the Bharatpur district.

The protesters also blocked a Delhi-Mumbai rail route and also blocked all the major highways due to which many state transport buses were cancelled by the government. A similar protest was also carried out in 2010 but no violence was reported.

The Gujjar community has many factions and one such faction had demanded reservation under ST category in 2018 and accused the Kirori Singh Bainsla-led Gujjar Aarakshan Sangarsh Samiti and the state government of cheating the community.
