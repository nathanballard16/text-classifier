The project had faced stiff local opposition in Ratnagiri.on Wednesday announced in the assembly that the $44 billion oil refinery, which was to come up in and around Nanar village in the costal district of Ratnagiri, will now be moved northwards and set up inThe project had become a flash point between the BJP and Shiv Sena and as a pre-condition for an alliance before the, the latter had wanted the state government to scrap the project.In March this year, Fadnavis gave approval for the proposal seeking de-notification of the land for the project.However, earlier this month, the three promoters of the project — the state-run oil marketing companies Indian Oil, BPCL and HPCL — had issued an ultimatum that if no decision is taken on the allotment of land by August, the project will be shifted to neighbouring Gujarat.In response to a written question by Congress MLA Nasim Khan and others, Fadnavis said, “The project will come up in 40 villages of four talukas, namely Roha, Shrivardhan, Alibaug and Murud, of Raigad district as there is no opposition from local farmers for land acquisition.”The farmers inopposed the project claiming that the pollution caused by the refinery will cause damage to the world-famous Alphonso mango orchards and cashew plantations in the area and effluent discharge from the refinery will wipe out fishing.Mirror in March reported that the project will come up in Raigad and more than 19,000 hectares of land have been identified by the state government for an integrated industrial township. However, land acquisition in Raigad is not going to be easy either. Earlier, the government had to scrap the plan to acquire 14,000 hectares for Mahamumbai SEZ in Pen, Panvel and Khalapur talukas of Raigad district due to stiff resistance from villagers.Similarly, there has hardly been any progress on plans to acquire 22,000 hectares of land in the district for the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor (DMIC).Ulka Mahajan, convenor of Sarvhara Jan Andolan, said, “The project was opposed by the people of Ratnagiri on the issue of pollution. How can the state government allow the same project in Raigad? We would like to know what is Sena’s position now?”
