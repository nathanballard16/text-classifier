Siddhant Chaturvedi also revealed that it was not a typical love at first sight for him. He further added, “We met and we took our time. We were friends first and then we started dating.” The actor said that the relationship is in a serious phase and he hopes that it lasts forever. Siddhant Chaturvedi further revealed about the fun story of how he grabbed his role in the film and his meeting with director Zoya Akhtar. He said, “It was at a party. I was dancing to a Govinda song - Tujhko Mirchi Lagi Toh Main Kya Karoon. I was full-on and she saw me. Then the DJ played Gallan Goodiyaan from Dil Dhadakne Do and I went up to her and danced with her. She was like, 'Hey, who are you?' And I said I was an actor on Inside Edge. She asked me to come and audition for Gully Boy.”

Siddhant Chaturvedi further added that how his spontaneity and his passion for poetry also helped him to grab the part. He added, “She asked if I was from Mumbai and I said, 'Haan, apun idhar se hi hai', because I knew all about Gully Boy. That was very spontaneous. When I came home, I was like, 'Yaar, maine bol toh diya ki rapping karta hoon par aata nahi hai mujhe.' I have grown up on Kishore da, Mohammed Rafi, Kumar Sanu, Udit Narayan and Sonu. I said, 'Theek hai, main poetry likhta hoon. Let's club that with rhythm.' Rhythm mein aaja, mere raja.”
