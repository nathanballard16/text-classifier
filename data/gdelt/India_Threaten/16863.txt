First Vaigai flood warning issued after copious inflows

CHENNAI: Nearly 14 reservoirs across Tamil Nadu are fast filling up and are almost brimming with water, owing to copious inflows in the catchment areas.

The Northeast monsoon which is in full vigour has caused the Vaigai river in Madurai to swell, thus forcing the authorities to issue the first flood warning to the people living near the banks of the river.

The people in the five southern districts of Madurai, Theni, Dindigul, Sivaganga and Ramanathapuram, living near the river banks, have been cautioned to shift to safer locations. The level of water in Vaigai dam crossed 66 feet mark on Tuesday against its full level capacity of 71 feet. The second warning is issued when the water level touches the 68 feet mark and third at 69 feet. The dam has been receiving a steady inflow of 3,180 cusecs while the discharge has been 360 cusecs. The people have been asked not to cross the river or bathe in it. The district administration also warned the people against taking selfies on river banks.

The water level in Mullaiperiyar reservoir stood at 128 feet and the dam is receiving an inflow of 3,100 cusecs. The Sothuparai and Shanmuganathi in the Theni

district are nearly full and the Manjalaru dam has a water level of 52.80 feet against its maximum level of 57 feet.

The Mettur dam in Salem is steadily receiving heavy inflows of 7,400 cusecs and an equal quantum is being discharged. The reservoir is the chief source for drinking water for Salem and 12 other districts in the State and it also provides the much needed water to irrigate about 16.4 lakh acres land.

The water released from the Krishnaraja Sagar and Kabini dams in neighbouring Karnataka is impounded in the Stanley reservoir. Its maximum storage capacity is 120 feet and the level of water in the dam stood at 93.47 feet.
