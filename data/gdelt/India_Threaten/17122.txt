‘I’ll Be Muslim’: Mander, Others Pick Civil Disobedience Over CAB

S Sashikanth Senthil, former IAS officer who had resigned in September citing the clampdown in Jammu and Kashmir over Article 370, wrote a strongly worded letter to Home Minister Amit Shah, saying the passage of the CAB in Lok Sabha “marked the darkest day in the history of modern India.”

He wrote, “I refuse to accept the process of enumeration in NRC by not submitting the requisite documents to prove my citizenship and I’m willing to accept the action taken by the India state against my disobedience.

“If the state chooses to declare me as a non-citizen, I would also be happy to fill up the many detention centers that you are building all over the country. I would accept the incarceration with all humbleness than to wait at the sidelines as a mute spectator to the communal profiling and disenfranchising of my fellow humans.”
