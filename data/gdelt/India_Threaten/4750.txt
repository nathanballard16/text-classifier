Every citizen of India is a Chowkidar, says Piyush Goyal

Union Minister for Railway Piyush Goyal on Saturday said that all the citizens of India are 'Chowkidars.' He was addressing the 'Main Bhi Chowkidar' programme here.

"All the citizens of our country are Chowkidars--from students and housewives to all professionals. Every person should be true to his work to secure the future of our country" said Goyal.

Goyal claimed that 130 crore people of the country feel secure because of the NDA government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has become the 'Chowkidar' for the security and development of the country.

"We are not like the previous government who remains silent after attacks in India. BJP government gives a reply to these attacks. Modi is the only Prime minister who has worked 365 days without taking leave to make our country secure."

Attacking the opposition, Goyal said: "Congress Manifesto Committee chief on Friday while talking about the terrorist attack in Mumbai said 'some things happen.' This shows the mindset of the opposition. They are just rooting for votes."

The Union Minister alleged the Congress failed to reach their schemes in all villages, but the BJP brought the online system to ensure the benefit of schemes directly reach people's account."

"During the Congress rule rates of products increased a lot and people were confused to pay taxes. But the BJP government has brought in GST. BJP exempted 30 cr people, with income below 5 lakh, from taxpaying by the new income tax policies" Goyal said.

Talking about great freedom fighter Bhagat Singh, he said: "We can only secure our country if every citizen shows patriotism towards the nation."

He urged the people to participate in the ensuing elections as 'Chowkidars' in order to make the country a superpower and make Modi the PM again.
