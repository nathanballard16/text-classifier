Key Highlights Intelligence note warns that terrorists can use car bombs to target security forces LeT, JeM, HM given responsibilities to carry out attacks in Kashmir valley

Srinagar: Security forces in Jammu & Kashmir have been extra vigilant in light of an alert issued by intelligence agencies with respect to the movement of government vehicles at Jammu-Srinagar National Highway. Intel agencies warned the security forces and the local police about a terrorist ploy to target government vehicles plying on the highway which is one of two roads which connect the Kashmir valley to the rest of India.

The intelligence note warns that terrorists can use car bombs to target security forces.

"It appears that the latest strategy of the terrorists to target the security forces is by way of car bombs and IED. There is local expertise to carry out attacks on the lines of Pulwama terror attack," said the intel input, accessed by the news agency ANI.

The input states that the National Highway, which runs from Srinagar in the Kashmir Valley southward to the city of Jammu, continues to remain vulnerable in light of information being accessed regarding detailed planning of the attack.

Yet another input claims that Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) has been tasked with carrying out the attack on the crucial National Highway.

Operatives of LeT, Hizbul Mujahideen (HM), and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) with the support of Pakistan Army and spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) reportedly held a meeting in Jammu & Kashmir’s Pulwama and distributed responsibilities for carrying out attacks on Indian politicians and police personnel.

As per intelligence input, JeM was tasked with carrying out the attack on National Highway while LeT will be responsible for carrying out attacks on security installations and HM will be responsible for carrying out political and police killings.
