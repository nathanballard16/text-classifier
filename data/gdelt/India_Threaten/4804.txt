Bihar Lok Sabha elections: Ex-JNUSU president Kanhaiya Kumar is CPI nominee from Begusarai

PATNA: Former JNU students’ union president Kanhaiya Kumar would contest from the Begusarai seat. The CPI central secretariat endorsed his candidature backed by its Bihar secretariat and executive committee at their emergency meetings held on Sunday.Begusarai, in effect, is set to have a triangular fight between Kanhaiya, firebrand BJP leader Giriraj Singh and RJD’s possible candidate Tanveer Hasaan, who had unsuccessfully contested the seat in 2014 garnering 3.9 lakh votes against Bhola Singh of BJP. Begusarai would go to the polls in the fourth phase on April 29.Giriraj is known for his acerbic remarks that they who oppose PM Modi are ‘Pakistan parasht (pro-Pakistan)’ and anti-national and, therefore, should better go to that country while Kanhaiya has been (mis)presented as a member of the ‘Bharat ke tukde tukde gang’.“Begusarai is all set to have fight between Kanhaiya and Giriraj. Tanveer is not in contest,” Kanhaiya said at the press conference on Sunday. He insisted that the rejection of the CPI (Left) overtures for amicable seat-sharing with the Grand Alliance by RJD chief Lalu Prasad and leader of opposition in state assembly Tejashwi Prasad Yadav was not an overriding factor.“They (read Lalu and Tejashwi) should be asked as to why they rejected the Left’s offer. They might have had many things, including social equations and poll arithmetic regarding Begusarai, in their mind,” Kanhaiya said.Earlier, the RJD-led Grand Alliance had kept CPI out of the seat-sharing arrangement. RJD had announced “one seat” to the CPI(ML) from its own quota to contest, though it did not mention the constituency.CPI state secretary Satya Narayan Singh said the party has also decided to contest from Khagaria and the central secretariat would decide the candidate for it on Monday. Further, the party’s apex body would also decide if CPI should contest East Champaran (Motihari) and Madhubani where BJP has fielded its candidates.Singh also reiterated the party’s support to CPI(ML) and CPM in Ara and Ujiarpur, respectively. “We will fight for the victory of Kanhaiya in Begusarai, because he has been fighting against atrocities under PM Narendra Modi’s government at the Centre for the last three years,” Singh said.He said CPI would also work to prevent dispersal of the anti-BJP votes in the state to ensure defeat of the BJP-led NDA candidates, no matter if the Grand Alliance did not include the Left parties in the seat-sharing arrangement.
