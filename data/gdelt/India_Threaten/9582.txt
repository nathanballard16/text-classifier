Power ministry’s directive on payment security mechanism could lead to load shedding, cautions ICRA

Kolkata: The centre’s direction of putting in place a security mechanism before wheeling power to utilities would be a positive for power generation companies and is expected to improve payment pattern of utilities. However, it may be difficult for utilities to secure large quantum of letter of credits given their poor financials in many states and hence its implementation may be an issue, following this supply curtailment may follow leading to load shedding , saidin a recent note.The ministry of power has recently issued directions to the National Load Dispatch Centre (NLDC) and Regional Load Dispatch Centres (RLDC) to schedule and dispatch power from generation companies to distribution utilities (discoms) only after implementation of payment security mechanism. This should be in the form of letter of credit (LC) by the discoms to the generation companies for the scheduled quantum of power, with effect from August 1, 2019.The decision follows continued delays in making payments by discoms to generation companies, leading to liquidity constraints for the power generators. While power purchase agreements and power sale agreements between generators and utilities have the provision of payment security in the form of LCs, the provision was not implemented by discoms in most of the states.Striking a note of caution, Sabyasachi Majumdar , group head - corporate ratings, at ICRA said: “Though this auger well for power generation companies, the implementation of these provisions remains to be seen, given the challenges in securing the large quantum of letter of credits by discoms, in view of their loss-making operations in majority of the states. More importantly, cash flow improvement in a sustainable manner is critical for discoms, which requires adequate tariff revision, operating efficiency improvement and timely subsidy support from respective state governments.”The directive issued by the power ministry mentions that power dispatch to the discoms shall be curtailed in case of non-availability of LCs or its exhaustion in relation to the quantum of power supplied.Further, the load dispatch centres are required to ensure that the discoms are not allowed to procure power from the power exchanges or through short-term open access because of curtailment in supply due to inadequate LCs. Moreover, the discoms would continue to be liable for making payment of fixed charges under the long-term PPAs. However, clarity is required on compensation payable to renewable energy projects having single-part tariffs under the PPAs with discoms.While the strict directive issued by the power ministry is a positive step for the sector, its implementation of these provisions remains dependent on the support extended by the state governments to the discoms. This measure may face resistance from states, given that the non-provision of LCs would lead to supply curtailment and in turn load shedding in the distribution license area, ICRA said in a statement.
