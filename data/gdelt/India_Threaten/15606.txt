The ceasefire in Nagaland continues to hold, though the Centre had set October 31 as the deadline to conclude the peace deal with the NSCN-IM. The deadline has passed and there is no clarity yet on an accord. However, it is a welcome sign that all parties involved in the talks seem willing to wait and iron out the differences that appear to be holding them back from concluding a peace agreement. The talks between the Centre and Naga rebels, primarily the NSCN-IM, have been held for 22 years and the parties have covered much ground over these years. The Naga civil society, too, has invested heavily in the peace process and prepared the ground for a negotiated settlement to what has often been described as India’s longest-running insurgency. The rebels need to respect this sentiment for peace and the Centre must provide the negotiating space for the former to satisfy its constituency.
