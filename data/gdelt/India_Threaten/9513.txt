SC threatens to jail Kerala top officials over church case

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday blasted the Kerala government and threatened to send its officials, including the chief secretary, to jail for contempt for not implementing its verdict on centuryold dispute between Orthodox and Patriarchal factions of the state’s Malankara Church A bench of Arun Mishra and M R Shah expressed anguish over state government dragging its feet in enforcing the order which was passed in 2017 after which multiple petitions were being filed in Kerala HC and SC to re-agitate the issue. The court’s 2017 order gave the Orthodox group control over more than 1,100 parishes and their churches but it was not being enforced and the state government said it is exploring amicable solution to prevent a law and order problem.“You (state government) are not above law and we will summon all your officials including chief secretary to the court and send them directly to jail from here. Do not make mockery of the court’s order. We have the power to send people to jail for contempt,” an agitated bench said.The court was hearing a plea filed by St Marys Orthodox Church seeking direction to state police chief to provide adequate police protection to the church, its properties, including chapel, cemetery , and priests. The state government has repeatedly sought time to implement the SC’s order and submitted that it was trying to broker a peace between the two rival factions to find out amicable solution.The bench was livid and noted that instead of implementing its order, the state government and chief secretary are passing directions to the contrary. “If the Kerala government is going to act in this manner, we will not tolerate it. You are making mockery of our order. We have tolerated too much and now time has come to act against you. The law on the controversy is well settled and the court had passed the order but fresh petitions are being filed in HC and this court to waste time,” the bench said.
