Game of Thrones' Sophie Turner aka Sansa Stark REVEALS why she tried to sneak a kiss with Maisie Williams

Game of Thrones stars Sophie Turner aka Sansa Stark and Maisie Williams aka Arya Stark turned up the heat as they posed together on the magazine cover of Rolling Stone. Sporting their blonde and pink hair respectively, the girls opened up about what it was like to grow up on set and how there are moments when they truly relate to their characters Sansa Stark and Arya Stark. As per E!News report, the girls were best friends from the moment they met. Sophie, 23, and Maisie, 21, have been featuring on the show since season 1 of the fantasy drama.

Sophie Turner tells Rolling Stone, "We were pretty much best friends from that second on." In an earlier interview with Glamour UK, Turner joked she "has an addiction to Maisie" and that they would try "to sneak a kiss into every scene we did together to freak everyone out a bit."

Turner, who is currently engaged to Joe Jonas since October 2017, also spoke about her character's track in Game of Thrones. Turner explained she was initially "jealous" of Williams and her character of Arya "because she got to do all these sword fights and be the badass" but her own slow ascent into power has made it "all the more satisfying", reported E! "I'm happy she's only just coming into her power now", she added.

The brand new magazine cover also saw Maisie Williams discussing Game of Thrones. Speaking about the final and eighth season of the show, Arya Stark warned fans that they should be ready to witness a "lot of deaths". The finale season of Game of Thrones will air on April 14.
