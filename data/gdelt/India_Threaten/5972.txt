VH threatens fast for reinstallation of Ambedkar statue

Hyderabad: Congress senior leader V Hanumantha Rao on Tuesday demanded that the State government reveal the reasons behind vandalising Dr Ambedkar statue and dumping it at Jawaharnagar dump yard. He also asked the State government as to why it demolished the statue of Ambedkar when a similar statue of former CM YS Rajasekhara Reddy was installed at Punjagutta circle without obtaining any legal permission.

Hanumantha Rao said it was unfortunate that the GHMC demolition squad uprooted the Ambedkar statue and dumped it in the Jawahar Nagar dump yard. He said although he sat on Deeksha on Ambedkar Jayanti Day demanding stern action against the vandals, Rao said none of the party leaders from his Congress party visited and extended their moral support to him.

He also alleged that CM KCR removed portrait of Ambedkar from Ambedkar Bhavan and replaced it with his own portrait. He said CM KCR didn’t even bother to garland the statue of Amedkar in the State. He demanded that the State government set up one Amedkar Statue Protection Committee in the State.

He urged the PCC to give a call for holding State-wide agitation on the issue. He also warned the State government that he would go on fast-unto-death as 125 feet statue of Ambedkar was not installed in the city. He urged the party president Rahul Gandhi to raise the issue across the country. He said that he would set up an Ambedkar statue at Gandhi Bhavan with his own money.
