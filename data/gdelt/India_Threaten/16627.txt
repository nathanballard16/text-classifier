Maa-Beta To Skip Swearing-In Ceremony Of Maha Vikas Aghadi, Express Regret To CM-Elect Uddhav Thackeray

The Shiv Sena chief's son and newly-won MLA Aaditya Thackeray flew to Delhi and met her and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on Wednesday night to seek their "blessings" and invite them for the swearing in ceremony.

Sonia Gandhi also said that the Shiv Sena, the Nationalist Congress Party and the Congress have come together under quiet extraordinary circumstances at a time when the country faces unprecedented threats from the BJP. "The political atmosphere has become poisonous and the economy has collapsed. Farmers are facing great distress," she said, adding that the three parties have agreed to a common minimum programme and she was confident that all three parties will strive their utmost to implement that programme in letter and spirit.



Stressing unity of the alliance, she said: "The people of Maharashtra expect the alliance to provide cohesive, purposeful, responsible, responsive and transparent administration and our collective effort will undoubtedly be to ensure that these expectations are fulfilled."

According to Congress sources, the party chief is skipping the swearing-in ceremony due to her health issues.

Expressing regret about not being able to attend the swearing-in ceremony at Shivaji Park, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi expressed confidence that the Aghadi alliance will be able to give Maharashtra a "stable, secure and pro-poor government".
