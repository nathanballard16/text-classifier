New Delhi: Pakistan’s anti-terror sham continued on Thursday after the country blocked a UN team from interviewing 26/11 Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed.

Pakistan's consulate in New York rejected the visa request of the UN officials who were supposed to interview Saeed who is residing in Pakistan, news agency ANI reported.

Saeed had recently moved a fresh proposal to de-list his name from the UNSC 1267 sanctions list. Proposal to de-list an individual from UN sanctions list mandates an in-person interview, however, UN officials were refused to conduct a face-to-face interview by Pakistan government. UN ombudsman Daniel Kipfer Fasciati will now conduct a video interview of Saeed, also a co-founder of terror group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT).

Pakistan, which has been claiming of adopting a tough stand against terrorism, has been exposed by this move. The country blocked Saeed’s interview, fearing revelation of incriminating evidence against it.

Earlier in the day, the UN rejected Saeed’s plea to remove his name from its list of banned terrorists. India along with US, UK and France opposed Saeed’s request, however, Pakistan did not object to the appeal despite Imran Khan-led government's claim that they are taking strict action against terrorists and their organisations.

The UNSC banned Saeed, chief of UN-designated terrorist organisation Jammat-ud-Dawa (JuD), on December 10, 2008 after the ghastly Mumbai attacks that claimed lives of 166 people.
