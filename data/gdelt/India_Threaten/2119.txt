Rajnath Singh arrives in Srinagar

Srinagar, Feb 15 : Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh arrived here Friday to pay tributes to the CRPF troopers killed in Thursday's terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district and to discuss the security situation.

Rajnath Singh will take part in the wreath laying ceremony on the bodies of the troopers at the Humhama Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) camp in Badgam district.

He will review the overall security in the state in the aftermath of the suicide attack -- the worst terror strike in Jammu and Kashmir since militancy erupted in 1989.

Informed sources said the Minister will be briefed on the security situation by senior officers of the state and central intelligence agencies, state police, Army and paramilitary forces.

Earlier, the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) met in New Delhi, chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

A total of 45 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed when a suicide bomber of the Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) outfit rammed an explosive-filled SUV into a CRPF bus in Lethpora area on the Srinagar-Jammu highway.
