‘I have never felt so insecure’: Kashmiris face backlash after unprecedented attack

The mob was not targeting only students. Aabid Majeed Kuchay, a Kashmiri who is dean of academic affairs at a management institute in Dehradun, said an angry group of 500 people came to his college two days in a row. They demanded that Kashmiri students no longer be admitted and that Kuchay be suspended. To prevent violence, he told the administration to succumb to their demand. With the help of the college and local police, Kuchay fled to the city of Jammu.
