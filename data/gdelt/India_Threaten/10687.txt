NEW DELHI: A woman of many firsts in India, Google Doodle on Tuesday celebrated 133rd birth anniversary of Muthulakshmi Reddi , who is known to be India's first woman legislator.In its note, Google introduced Reddi as a woman who constantly broke down barriers throughout her life."Reddi was a trailblazer who devoted herself to public health and the battle against gender inequality, transforming the lives of countless people—especially young girls," said the note.Reddi was born in 1883 in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and became the first female student admitted to prestigious Indian institutions, the first woman to work as a surgeon in a government hospital, and the first female legislator in the history of British India.As a young girl, Reddi resisted her parents’ plan for an early arranged marriage, convincing them she deserved an education. After passing her exams, she attended Maharaja College, formerly an all-boys school. Despite threats of students pulling out from the school, she won a scholarship, graduated with honors, and went on to be the first female student at Madras Medical College.Reddi later gave up her medical practice to join the Madras Legislative Council, where she worked to raise the legal age of marriage and combatted exploitation of girls.In 1914, she married a doctor named Sundara Reddi on the understanding that he treat her as an equal. Working for the upliftment of women and battling gender inequality, she supported Gandhi’s efforts for Indian independence.After losing a sister to cancer, she launched the Adayar Cancer Institute in 1954. One of the most respected oncology centers in the world, it treats some 80,000 patients each year. In recognition of her service to her country, in 1956, Reddi was awarded the Padma Bhushan by the Government of India.Visible only to Indian Google users, the Google doodle commemorating Reddi is illustrated by Bangalore-based guest artist Archana Sreenivasan.Explaining the message she wanted to give through her doodle, Sreenivasan said, "To me, this Doodle is a celebration of the spirit of belief in oneself and in others. Maybe this spirit is something we need now more than ever."
