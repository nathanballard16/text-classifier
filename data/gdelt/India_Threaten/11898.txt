In blow to Congress, Haryana ex-CM backs BJP on Article 370

‘Congress has lost its way’, says Congress leader and former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda

ROHTAK: Congress stalwart and former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda on Sunday came out in support of the Narendra Modi government on Article 370 , saying his party may have "lost its way on the issue" but he wasn't one to be shy of backing even a political rival if it did "something right" in national interest.“I come from a family of freedom fighters. Though my party and colleagues spoke against it (revocation of special status to J&K), I supported the Union government’s decision because there are soldiers belonging to Haryana who are serving in J&K. Congress seems to have lost its way on this issue,” the 72-year-old party leader said during his "Maha Parivartan Rally" .Hooda said he would form a 25-member committee, including 12 MLAs, to decide his “future course of action”. However, the Congress veteran did not spell out if that meant breaking away from Congress.Addressing a huge crowd that included the 12 Congress MLAs and several former legislators, Hooda said he was being circumspect because any decision taken by him would have an impact on the people of Haryana. The Congress flag was conspicuous by its absence at the rally.Hooda said he would announce the committee’s decision within a week, which sources said could be a signal for the Congress high command to replace state party chief Ashok Tanwar and give him the reins of the party in Haryana.Hooda said that if he became chief minister again, he would have four deputies — one each representing the Dalit, backward classes, Brahmins and other communities. He also promised to waive farmers’ loans, restore the old pension scheme and provide free electricity up to 300 units to below-poverty-line families.
