Another fake promise like Garibi Hatao? Mayawati on Rahul Gandhi's 'minimum income for poor' poll plank

A day after Rahul Gandhi announced ‘Minimum Income Guarantee’ for poor if voted to power at the Centre, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) chief Mayawati took a dig at the promise. Taking a swipe at the Congress president, Mayawati questioned if "this promise was also a fake one like "Garibi Hatao". It was a promise first made by Indira Gandhi, Rahul's grandmother, to eradicate poverty during the 1971 election campaign. Mayawati and also compared it with Narendra Modi’s promise of 'achhe din' and bringing black money before 2014 elections.

The Congress president on Monday had announced at a rally in Chhattisgarh that his party would ensure a minimum basic income for the country's poor if voted to power at the Centre during the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Mayawati's remarks assume significance in the light of Congress president Rahul Gandhi's comment that he has due regard and respect for both Mayawati and Akhilesh and there was no animosity against them. However, Rahul had also said his party won't play on the backfoot and added, "We will play on the front foot, be it Gujarat or Uttar Pradesh".
