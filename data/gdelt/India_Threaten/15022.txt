Will go in deep and destroy PoK terror camps, J&K governor warns

SRINAGAR/LEH: Jammu and Kashmir governor Satya Pal Malik warned Pakistan on Monday that if didn’t end terror activities against India, the Indian Army would “go deep inside” and wipe out the terror camps in PoK.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, speaking in Leh, also warned Pakistan, saying the armed forces would keep giving Pakistan befitting replies until it stopped infiltration. “Our armed forces have never been offensive on the Pakistani side. We have never done the first firing,” Singh was quoted as saying by news agencies.The governor’s warning, delivered during his address at the Police Commemoration Day event at Zewan, came a day after Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had disclosed that three terror camps across the LoC in Tangdhar sector were destroyed by an Indian artillery barrage.“Pakistan must behave and stop these terror camps. If it does not behave, we will go deep inside and destroy these camps,” the governor said. He, however, said India abhorred war and that it was no solution to the issues.Governor Malik also said local youth must join the peace process. “The youth who are going around should stop it. I want to ask them what they have achieved so far. They are not going to get anything… there is going to be a new Kashmir from November 1 and people should contribute in the development of their state,” he was quoted as saying by news agencies.He said all the demands put forth by Jammu and Kashmir would be met in a time-bound manner. “The Centre has already accepted the demand of the police that their ex gratia will be at par with the Central forces, which is Rs 1 crore. So, if a J&K policeman dies in the line of duty, an ex gratia of Rs 1 crore will be paid to the next of kin of the slain,” Malik said.
