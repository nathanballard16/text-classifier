Acting under the Uttar Pradesh government’s direction, the state police have provided Y+ security to two BJP Lok Sabha candidates actor-turned-politicians Jaya Prada and Dinesh Lal Yadav, known as ‘Nirahua’, who are contesting from Rampur and Azamgarh seats.

The BJP Wednesday declared Yadav’s candidature, a week after he joined the party. He is up against Samajwadi Party (SP) president Akhilesh Yadav.

Former SP MP from Rampur Jaya Prada will fight against SP MLA Azam Khan.

The Superintendent of Police, Rampur, Shiv Hari Meena, said, “Under Y+ security, 17 policemen will be deployed for Jaya Prada. Five of them will be at her residence and the rest will escort her on a rotational basis.”

Security is provided after studying threat assessment, said Arvind Kumar, Principal Secretary, Home. On the basis of the level of threat, security cover is divided into four categories: X, Y, Z and Z+. Z+ is the highest security level.
