Chennai: Following the draft of the National Education Policy (NEP) released by the Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) on May 31 that suggested Hindi be made a mandatory third language in non-Hindi speaking states, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu on Wednesday demanded that Tamil should be made mandatory in central government offices in the state.

The DMK is not only against the imposition of Hindi and party chief MK Stalin said that Tamil should be made the official language in central government offices in the state as well. He had earlier said that the centre’s attempt to push for Hindi in offices was aimed at deceiving the Tamil language.

“With the Centre trying to impose Hindi in the state, everyone should take a vow to make Tamil the official language in central government offices in Tamil Nadu,” Stalin was quoted as saying at an event.

The leader said that the DMK will continue to raise its voice against the imposition of Hindi and will not allow the three-language policy to be implemented in the country at any cost.

The development comes on a day Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edapaddi K Palanswami appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to include Tamil as an optional language for study in other states.

Taking to Twitter, Palaniswami, who belongs to the NDA ally AIADMK, said that including Tamil as an optional language in schools in other states would be a “great service to one of the most ancient languages of the world”.

Prepared by a committee led by former ISRO chief K Kasturirangan, the draft policy drew flak from several quarters, especially politicians from South Indian states.
