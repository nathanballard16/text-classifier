Amid Border Tension, Pakistan, India Now Take to Missile Hegemony

A Navy official said that the missile hit its target accurately, which was witnessed by Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi. “Naval Chief appreciated the efforts of relevant units, scientists and engineers to make this missile testing a success”.

Pakistan did not reveal the missile type tested on Tuesday, but it could be a naval version of the Babur, which is based on the Babur 1B (also designated as Hatf VII). The missile was last test-fired in April 2019.

The test was conducted a day after Pakistan Army Chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa expressed firm resolve to defend the country from a full-spectrum threat.

Indian defence scientists have also planned a series of tests of its nuclear-capable missiles, such as the K4 submarine-launched missile, as well as the Agni 2, Prithvi, and Brahmos supersonic cruise missile in the coming days.
