Bizmen expect no SOPs from cash strapped Punjab govt, warn against imposing new taxes

LUDHIANA: With state finance minister Manpreet Badal all set to announce his second budget on Monday, city businessmen are anxious, as they fear the FM may impose new taxes on the industry, considering the severe financial crunch being faced by the state government. Businessmen have warned government that any such move would derail the progress of industry in the state, which is already taking a hit due to overall recession. City Inc is also of the view that it is high time the government — along with giving them concessions — should live up to its poll promises made to the industry.According to Upkar Singh Ahuja, president of Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertakings (CICU): “With nothing for us in the interim budget of the union government, all businessmen are counting on the state budget for some relaxations. But at the same time, there is a high risk of new taxes or duties being imposed on us in the state budget, as Punjab’s financial health is not good at present. If something like this happens, industry will be highly affected, and therefore Manpreet and the government should be cautious and avoid putting any load on trade and industry, which is already passing through a tough time due to recession.”According to Jagbeer Singh Sokhi, president of Sewing Machine Development Club: “We have no hope from this cash-strapped government for announcing anything for the benefit of the industry, but it is our warning and advice as well, that any load or new tax on the industry will be dealt with strongly by the state’s business community, which is already sick of false promises by the state government. Till now, we have been only fooled by Congress leaders, by propagating lies about power rates slashed to Rs 5 for industry, and even claims of many benefits given by the state in its industrial policy. If they are really serious about the industry’s progress, they should show some heart, and first of all slash rates of state tax on diesel and reduce power rates on the ground.”Speaking to TOI, Narinder Bhamra, president of Fasteners Manufacturers Association of India, said: “The Punjab government should avoid putting any burden on the industry in the budget, as already professional tax has been imposed on us, and apart from this, we are paying very high rates of electricity rates, property tax , and other allied duties, as compared to other states. In fact, the finance minister should remember the poll promise made by his party and chief minister regarding slashing the rate of power to Rs5 per unit for industry. It is already two years and the promise has still not been fulfilled. Now, there can’t be a better time than the budget to fulfil it.”According to Rajkumar Singla, president of Fasteners Suppliers Association, Ludhiana: “The state’s budget is a good opportunity for the Punjab government to win back the trust of businessmen feeling cheated due to the government not being able to live up to its promises. I think, along with removing items put in the negative list of e-way bill exemption enhancement, the finance minister should also scrap professional tax for businessmen, as already we are paying huge taxes.”According to Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparel Manufacturers Association, Ludhiana: “I think it is high time corrective measures were announced for the state’s industry which has suffered a big blow by a fall in demand, particularly after GST. Along with giving concession in the state GST, the government should also prohibit assessment of cases by the state GST department, which are older than three years, as it is causing us a lot of harassment.”
