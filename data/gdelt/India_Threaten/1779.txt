Will react if anyone interferes in temple administration: BJP

Thiruvananthapuram: State BJP on Friday warned that they would react if anyone interferes in the temple administration. The party also demanded answers to two questions from state government, firstly, who entrusted devaswom commissioner and recruitment board president to interfere in the Sabarimala case in the Supreme court for devaswom board and secondly, why was devaswom board president kept away from the case.

BJP spokesperson M S Kumar further said in the press conference that if the state government interferes in the daily activities of temples and temple administration, it would have to face severe repercussions. The government should reveal who spent the expenses of journeys to Delhi. Devaswom board president should show the decency to resign from the post if he was man of pride. The government has no right to remove him from power and control the board keeping him as a puppet president.

As only one week is left before the opening of Sabarimala nada for poojas for the Malayalam month of 'Kumbham', the state government is trying to intensify the issue at Sabarimala. People will discern the move of Pinarayi Vijayan to implement the agenda of CPM to violate the temple customs, he added.

The party has not taken any decision on candidacy, added M S Kumar.
