Stronlgy rejecting India's claims of targetting terrorist camp near Balakot and causing heavy casualties, Pakistan on Tuesday vowed to respond "at the time and place of its choosing" to what it called India's "uncalled for aggression". At a special meeting of the National Security Committee hours after Indian air strikes in Balakot inside Pakistan, Prime Minister Imran Khan asked the armed forces and the people of Pakistan to remain prepared for all eventualities.

Jaish-e-Mohammed's biggest training camp in Pakistan was bombed and destroyed by India early on Tuesday, officials said in New Delhi, adding the strike killed a "very large number" of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders.

A statement issued after the NSC meeting in Islamabad said, "Forum (NSC) strongly rejected Indian claim of targeting an alleged terrorist camp near Balakot and the claim of heavy casualties. Once again Indian government has resorted to a self serving, reckless and fictitious claim."

Inviting the world media to see the facts on ground and proposing a visit to the site, it claimed that the "action has been done for domestic consumption being in election environment, putting regional peace and stability at grave risk."

"Forum concluded that India has committed uncalled for aggression to which Pakistan shall respond at the time and place of its choosing," it added.

To take the nation on board, the government has decided to requisition a joint session of the Parliament, the statement said.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan will also engage with global leadership to "expose irresponsible" Indian policy in the region.
