A special team of Delhi Police has arrested two Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorists who were planning to carry out a series of attacks across the national capital on Republic Day.

The police team led by inspector Shiv Kumar and supervised by ACP Attar Singh arrested two Jammu and Kashmir-based terrorists, Abdul Latif Ganai and Hilal Ahmad.

Ganai has been identified as the mastermind behind the recent series of grenade attacks in Srinagar.

He was arrested from Central Delhi after a special cell of the police team received a tip-off. Police officers said Ganai was planning a similar terror attack in crowded areas across the national capital on Republic Day.

Soon after receiving the tip-off, police rushed to Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday and seized two hand grenades, one semi-automatic pistol along with 26 live cartridges from the terrorists. Three rubber stamps of Commanders of Jaish-e-Mohammad have also been seized from them.

The police officers are now interrogating Ganai to find out whether more terrorists are involved in the plot.

Delhi Police's special investigation cell has ramped up its efforts to identify terrorists and terror-mongers ahead of Republic Day on Sunday.

In this case, the special cell received a tip-off from military intelligence, which helped them track down a particular house in Laxmi Nagar that was frequently visited by suspicious persons.

The duo revealed to police that a Pakistan-based handler Abu Bakar was their handler and another terrorist named Abu Mauz gave them seven hand grenades through another conduit in November last year.
