NewsX Exclusive: Arun Jaitley says Rahul Gandhi looking for a seat where Hindu majority is a minority

Arun Jaitley said choosing a constituency where the majority is in minority is a political gamble. He also said Congress targetted the majority for years saying Hindu terrorism has been born, defamed it and now he was contesting against Hindu majority in Wayanad where the segment had a limited presence

Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in an exclusive interview to NewsX National Affairs Editor Sheela Bhatt, criticised Congress President Rahul Gandhi’s candidature from Wayanad and said the Congress President could have gone to Karnataka or anywhere else in the country, but choosing Kerala’s Wayanad has political relevance. Jaitley said Rahul criticised the majority for years and now he was looking for a seat in a region where the majority is in minority.

The Union Minister said Rahul had criticised the majority community (referring to Hindus) for years, and now, he is looking for a seat where the majority is in minority. Choosing a constituency where the majority is in a minority is a political gamble, added Jaitley. He said Congress targetted the majority for years saying Hindu terrorism has been born, defamed it and now it was contesting against Hindu majority in Wayanad where the segment had a limited presence.

Rubbishing Rahul Gandhi’s claims on less work done by PM Narendra Modi in his constituency Varanasi, Jaitley said the Congress President should compare the work done by PM Modi in Varanasi to his work in Amethi. He added the work done by Modi in Varanasi, and work done by Gandhis in Amethi stand no comparison

Besides Jaitley, Smriti Irani on Thursday, criticising Congress President’s move to contest from a second constituency said Rahul enjoyed a position of power for 15 years because of the support from Amethi, however, his nomination from elsewhere besides Amethi was an insult of the constituency and people here will not tolerate this, reported ANI.
