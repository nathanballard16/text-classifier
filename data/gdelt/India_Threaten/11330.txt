Procurement Of New BrahMos Coastal Batteries Worth Rs 1,400 Crore Cleared By Rajnath Singh In His First DAC Meet

In the first Defence Acquisition Council (DAC) meeting chaired by Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, the proposal to acquire new mobile BrahMos coastal batteries has received a green light, according to journalist Manu Pubby.

The plan is to deploy these BrahMos batteries as replacements for older systems which are out of date.

“The two mobile missile coastal batteries have to be acquired for the Navy. The Navy would deploy the Rs 1400 crore BrahMos supersonic cruise missile batteries on the Tatra trucks close to major cities from where it can destroy any incoming enemy warship in case it is posing any threat," a government source was quoted as saying.

The missiles are produced by BrahMos Aerospace which was was formed in 1998 to build supersonic cruise missiles through a tie-up between India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Russia's NPO Mashinostroyeniya.
