Diamond workers’ union demands job security

SURAT: Gujarat Diamond Workers’ Union has written an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking his intervention to resolve the issues facing thousands of diamond workers in the diamond factories of Gujarat.The union has alleged that recession and impact of Goods and Services Tax, demonetization and rupee depreciation have cast a dark shadow on the diamond industry and rendered over one lakh workers jobless across the state.The union office-bearers have stated that labour laws and Factory Act, 1948 were applicable in a diamond unit, employing 20 or more workers. But the diamond unit owners are not following these laws and the workers are deprived of provident fund, employee state insurance (ESI), bonus, gratuity and other benefits.During global economic slowdown in 2008-09, over two lakh diamond workers were rendered jobless and that around 300 workers committed suicide due to financial crunch. In 2009, the state government had announced Rs1,200 crore scheme under Ratnadip Kaushalya Vardhak for the workers but it was shelved after a couple of years.Gujarat Diamond Workers’ Union president Ranmal Jilariya told TOI, “Two of our office-bearers have been fired by their owners for uniting the workers to fight for their own cause. The company owners threatened them with dire consequences and asked them to stay away from union bazzi.”
