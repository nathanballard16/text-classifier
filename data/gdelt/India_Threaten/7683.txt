New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate has issued a gag order, warning its own officials against interacting with media.

The ED is also mulling punitive action against officers if they were found talking to the press.

In a circular, the probe agency has asked its officials to refrain from speaking to the media as it was "jeopardising the investigation process".

The ED has of late come under fire with Opposition parties alleging that it was acting at the behest of the BJP-led Central Government.
