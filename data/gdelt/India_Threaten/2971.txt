Modi-Shah duo has done to the country what Pakistan couldn’t in 70 years: Kejriwal

New Delhi: Referring to the rise in hate crimes, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal alleged that the duo _ Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah _ has done to the country what Pakistan could not do during the past 70 years. He told this while speaking at a function organised by Indian Muslim Intellectual Forum.

Delhi CM said, Pakistan wanted this only, that there should be hate among people of India, people should fight among themselves. Since the BJP government came to power at the centre, the poison that the BJP and Modi government have administered among the people is very dangerous, he said.

Delhi chief minister declared 2019 elections as do or die situation and said if the people of the country do not show prudence, democracy will no longer prevail in the country. He warned that if Modi-Shah duo wins the elections in 2019 it will be dangerous for the country. He cited the claim of Amit shah in which he had said that BJP will rule for 50 years.

On the question of alliance with Congress, AAP chief said we tried to make an alliance with Congress, but Congress is not ready to do so.

It must be noted that Aam Aadmi Party chief Arvind Kejriwal in an interview to NDTV has also reiterated his claim, saying “Modi-Amit Shah duo have destroyed the economy. Demonetisation, GST have made people lose their employment. However, the biggest thing is the environment of hate. What Pakistan couldn’t do in 70 years, they did in 5 years: Arvind Kejriwal.”
