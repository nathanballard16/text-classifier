The Karnataka Forest Department has set a 15-day deadline for BGS Trust, which maintains a hostel and a hospital, to ensure that no sewage is let into the Mylasandra Lake in southwest Bengaluru. The deadline comes after a campaign by residents of Rajarajeshwari Nagar and Mylasanra to protect the lake.

In January, during a clean-up of the lake organised by the residents, they found that a sewage line extending from a hostel was allowing sewage water to enter the lake. They blocked the sewage line but weeks later another sewage line coming from a hospital run by BGS Trust is now allowing sewage water to enter the lake.

“A few months ago, residents had blocked the sewage line extending from the hostel that was feeding the lake with pollutants. Now, we have learnt that sewage is coming from the hospital. If the problem continues, we will take strict action against the people concerned,” Punati Sridhar, Principal Chief Conservator of Forests told the Times of India.

The official also confirmed that BSG authorities have been given 15 days to fix the problem of sewage entering the lake.

A police complaint had been registered against BGS trust in July 2017 to stop sewage from being let into the lake. But residents claim that in spite of the complaint, the situation was not rectified.

The residents recently reported the issue to Nirmalanda Swamiji, seer of Adichunchanagiri Mutt, which runs the trust. He promised to examine the matter.

However, after no action was taken by the seer or the trust, residents approached the media and filed a formal complaint with the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB).
