India strike: Trade unions claim success in two-day all-India strike

NEW DELHI: Trade unions claimed their two-day nationwide strike call was a success with 20 crore workers, from both the organised and the unorganised sectors across banking insurance , roads, railways , postal and medical services participated in the ‘Bharat Band.’Ten central trade unions had called for a 2-day national strike, starting Tuesday, against what they call the anti-national and anti-worker policies of the BJP-led NDA government.Unions have threatened to follow this up with an indefinite strike if government does not heed to their demands.The strike was called by INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, LPF and UTUC. However, the RSS-affiliated Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh stayed away.Unions have alleged the government failed to create jobs and grossly ignored unions' 12-point charter of demands besides aggressively pushing for fixed-term employment and amendment to the Trade Union Act, all of which is against the interest of the workers.They also said the group of ministers headed by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley on labour issues has not called unions for any discussion since the September 2, 2015, strike which left them with no other option but to go on another strike.Addressing the media after the 2-day strike, Amarjeet Kaur of AITUC said around eight states witnessed a complete shutdown, largely in the northeast, Kerala, Bihar and Goa. There were over 20 crore workers who had joined the strike.According to Kaur, these are preliminary reports based on which we can say the strike has been a success on both days across refineries, coal, non-coal sectors and municipalities. “We will not let the government sit in peace. We will soon finalise follow-up actions to ensure it considers our demands or goes out of power,” Kaur said.HMS general secretary HS Sidhu said the unions have collectively decided to go on indefinite strike if the government does not respond to the “historic” strike this time.
