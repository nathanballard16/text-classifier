We must not enter theological arena and interpret religious texts: SC

New Delhi: In the momentus Ayodhya land dispute judgment, the Supreme Court has cautioned the courts against entering the theological arena and assume the role of interpreting religious texts while ruling that the true test is belief and faith of believers.In the Ayodhya case, the Hindu sides had attempted through senior advocate P N Mishra to interpret Islamic religious texts to prove that Babri Masjid could not be called a mosque as it did not have a place for ablution for worshippers nor did the Koranic mandate allow prayers in the vicinity where temple bells toll. But, Muslim sides through advocate Mohd Nizam Pasha countered Mishra saying half-baked interpretation of religious texts could be dangerous as the theology and its mandate could be interpreted in many ways.The bench of then CJI Ranjan Gogoi and Justices S A Bobde (now CJI), D Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer said, “in the given set of facts and circumstances, it is inappropriate for this court to enter upon an area of theology and to assume the role of an interpreter of the Hadees. The true test is whether those who believe and worship have faith in the religious efficacy of the place where they pray.”“The belief and faith of the worshipper in offering namaz at a place which is for the worshipper of a mosque cannot be challenged. It would be preposterous for this court to question it on the ground that a true Muslim would not offer prayer in a place which does not meet an extreme interpretation of doctrine selectively advanced by Mishra,” it said.“This court, as a secular institution, set up under a constitutional regime must steer clear from choosing one among many possible interpretations of theological doctrine and must defer to the safer course of the faith and belief of the worshipper,” it said.Rejecting Mishra’s submissions, the bench had said, “Our court is founded on and owed its existence to a constitutional order. We must firmly reject any attempt to lead the court to interpret religious doctrine in an absolute and extreme form and question the faith of worshippers. Nothing could be as destructive of the values underlying Article 25 of the Constitution,” the SC had said.
