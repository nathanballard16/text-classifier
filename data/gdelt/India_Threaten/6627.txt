JDU may not release manifesto to avoid differences with BJP on Ram Mandir, Article 370: sources

The reason behind not releasing manifesto could be that the party is apprehensive of setting off internal rivalries with alliance partner BJP during elections.

JDU may not release its manifesto this time, sources said.

While almost all the key parties have released their electoral manifestos, JDU has put it on hold so far even when three phases of polling has concluded and the fourth phase polling is scheduled for tomorrow (Monday).

As per sources, there are chances that the party may not release its manifesto after all.

BJP and JDU have conflicts on Ram Mandir issue and scrapping Article 370.
