Fayyaz Chohan warns India of any offensive against Pakistan

He reemphasized on PM's stance and offered India to investigate into the Pulwama attack fairly.

LAHORE (Dunya News) – Punjab Provincial Information Minister Fayyaz-ul-Hassan Chohan on Tuesday reemphasized Prime Minister (PM) Imran Khan’s standpoint regarding the threats being given to Pakistan from India after the Pulwama attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IOK).

“The PM has conveyed his message to India in an appropriate manner,” he said, adding that Pakistan was not linked to the attack.

He offered India to investigate into the matter and warned that any offensive move against Pakistan would be detrimental to India.

“It is usual for India to blame Pakistan for such attacks,” he said while calling it a ‘drama’ of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian right-wing Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).

He further said that the attack has exposed Indian tactics of conducting such attacks themselves and holding Pakistan responsible.

He praised the PM’s address to the nation, in this regard, and said such capability and mental attitude could only be possessed by a leader without ego.
