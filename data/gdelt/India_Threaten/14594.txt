BJP working President J P Nadda accorded with ‘Z’ category security cover

The officials on Thursday said, J P Nadda, the working President of the Bharatiya Janata Party, has been given ‘Z’ category security cover, as per which, the Commandos of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) will be guarding him round the clock.

In addition to this, CRPF personnel will also be guarding Nadda’s residence. Also, the personnel would be guarding him wherever he travels within the country.

The Union Home Ministry, citing the increased threat perception on Nadda, decided to accord him with the ‘Z’ category security, nearly after four months of taking charge of the ruling party’s crucial post.

“A total of 35 Commandos of the CRPF will guard Nadda on a rotational basis and at any given time, eight to nine commandos will give him proximate security,” said an official of the Home Ministry.
