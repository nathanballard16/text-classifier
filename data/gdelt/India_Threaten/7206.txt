Fearing threat to life, Bains seeks security for campaign

Ludhiana: Punjab Democratic Alliance (PDA) candidate and the Lok Insaaf Party (LIP) chief Simarjeet Singh Bains on Wednesday alleged threat to his life from a gangster, who he claimed is an aide of notorious gangster Sukhpreet Singh alias Buddha Khosa. MLA South Balwinder Singh Bains, who is brother of LIP chief, filed a police complaint on his behalf at the office of Ludhiana police commissioner on Wednesday.

In the complaint he alleged that one Manjot Singh Gill messaged a local journalist on Facebook that he was an aide of Buddha Khosa and that their gang would kill Simarjeet Bains within two days. The complainant has submitted screenshots of the chat and Gill's Facebook profile along with the complaint.

Balwinder Singh Bains claimed Simarjit had started getting good response during his campaign and the opponents have started issuing threats so that he could not campaign. Seeking action against Manjot Singh Gill, he also demanded adequate security for Simarjeet Bains and his family so that they could campaign without any fear. “If anything happens to my brother and his family, Chief Minister and police will be responsible. Apart from Police commissioner, we have also complained to District Election officer about the matter. Ludhiana police commissioner Sukhchain Singh Gill said that he has marked an enquiry to the DCP who is looking into the complaint.
