Ludhiana: With the elections of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) slated to be held on September 5, presiding officer D M Singh has cautioned the candidates against any kind of mudslinging against each other while contesting elections. No nomination has, however, been filed for the eight posts of UCPMA even as 22 nomination forms have been sold.

In a statement, Singh said, “It is a warning for warring groups and individuals contesting the elections not to promote casteism & indulge in mudslinging or character assassination. I also appeal to all members and industry leaders not to hold any congregation at the place of industrial activity. However, the contesting parties are free to organize gatherings or to canvas and explain about their motives to the members to garner votes. No liquor and hard drinks should be used in any such gathering. No banners or canvassing is allowed in the UCPMA premises. The members shall be allowed to vote by biometric card or special ID card issued by the presiding officer.”

A sum of Rs. 5,52,000 was to be deposited by the members as pending subscription.
