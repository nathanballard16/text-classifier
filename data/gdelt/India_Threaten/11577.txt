Hoax bomb scare at Delhi’s IGI Airport

Security agencies were on high alert after they received a hoax call about a bomb at the Indira Gandhi International Airport Monday evening, which affected operations for around 70 minutes. Police have detained a man, but he has denied making any call.

DCP (Airport) Sanjay Bhatia said, “A call was received at 8.05 pm about a bomb at Terminal 2. A search was conducted, but nothing suspicious was found.” Bhatia said they have identified the caller but he has denied making the call.

A DIAL spokesperson said: “The departure area was evacuated… while arriving passengers were on hold inside aircraft. After a search operation by Bomb Disposal Squad and CISF, it was found to be a hoax. Normalcy was restored at 10 pm.”
