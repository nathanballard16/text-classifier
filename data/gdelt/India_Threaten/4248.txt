Nobel winner Satyarthi warns of media ‘war-mongering’ in India

PARIS: Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi warned Monday about "war mongering" by Indian journalists during the latest confrontation with Pakistan.

The Indian activist, who won the Nobel in 2014 with Pakistan´s Malala Yousafzai, has organised a joint statement signed by 71 other laureates calling for nuclear-armed India and Pakistan to defuse tensions after skirmishes at their border.

Discussing the crisis, Satyarthi expressed relief that the worst confrontation between the countries since they went to war in 1999 had "calmed down", but he warned about the dangers of ultra-nationalism.
