Kolkata court issues arrest warrant against Shashi Tharoor for Hindu Pakistan remark

Kolkata, Aug 13 (IBNS): A Kolkata High Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor for his "Hindu Pakistan" remark in July last year.

Based on a case filed by Advocate Sumeet Chowdhary, a Metropolitan Magistrate court in Kolkata issued the arrest warrant against Tharoor, who is a lawmaker from Thiruvananthapuram.

In July last year, Tharoor had made the comment while giving his lecture on the "Threats faced by Indian Democracy and Secularism" on Wednesday.

The Congress leader allegedly said: ".......if they (BJP) are able to win a repeat of their current strength in the Lok Sabha, then frankly our democratic constitution as we understand will not survive because they will have all the three elements they need to tear up the Constitution of India and write a new one."

"That will be a new one which will enshrine the principle of Hindu Rashtra, will remove equality for minorities, that will create a Hindu Pakistan and that isn't what Mahatma Gandhi, Nehru, Sardar Patel, Maulana Azad and great heroes of freedom struggle fought for," he added.

The comment had drawn anger from the ruling BJP which had then demanded an apology from Congress president Rahul Gandhi.
