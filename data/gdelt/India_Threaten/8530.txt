Mumbai: Shiv Sena and BJP will fight the upcoming Maharashtra Assembly elections together and share the Chief Minister's post for 2.5 years each, claimed Shiv Sena youth leader and Aditya Thackeray's cousin Varun Sardesai.

"Shivsena Prez Uddhavsaheb and BJP Prez Amit ji have decided that Maha CM post will be 2.5 years each. People who weren’t present for negotiation, shouldn’t spoil the alliance for their personal gains," Sardesai tweeted.

While no other senior leader has supported claim, this has come after reports emerged about BJP president Amit Shah being adamant on the fact that the Chief Minister will be from the saffron party. According to reports, Shah told this to BJP core committee from the state that took place in New Delhi on Sunday.

Reports suggest that Shiv Sena and BJP had agreed to have a rotational system for the chief ministerial post prior to the Lok Sabha elections. According to this deal, the post was to be shared between the two parties for 2.5 years each.

However, now the BJP is proposing a different arrangement in which the two parties will contest on 135 seats each. The rest of the seats are supposed to be distributed among other regional allies.

This 135-135 formula is not acceptable to Shiv Sena, Times Now has learnt. Several Sena leaders have said that party wants to contest on 144 seats, half of the total Assembly seats.
