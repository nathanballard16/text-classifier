Cyclone Fani Live Updates: Cyclone Fani To Make Landfall In Odisha's Puri Today

The India Meteorological Department, or IMD, has cautioned people to not lower guard after the first arm of Cyclone Fani hits the east coast and moves forward, bringing the eye of the storm into the focus which is very calm.





As the eye inches forward, the very calmness brings further destruction as the second arm of the cyclone is equally violent.





An eye is the centre of a cyclone, which is calm, while the strong winds that circle it are known as the arms of the storm.
