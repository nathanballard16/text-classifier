Heavy rain warning triggers alarm bells

BHUBANESWAR: With several southern districts facing flood threat due to heavy rain continuing for the last couple of days, fresh warning of heavy rain has kept the government on its toes.Under the influence of a low pressure area over Odisha, four western districts are likely to get heavy to very heavy rainfall in the next 48 hours, warned India Meteorological Department (IMD) here on Saturday.“Heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur at a few places with extremely heavy rainfall likely at isolated places in the districts of Sonepur, Bargarh, Sambalpur and Jharsuguda. Under its impact, localised flood situation in low-lying areas, damage to kutcha roads and temporary disruption of road communication are likely to occur,” the IMD bulletin said. It has also issued red warning (take action) for the above four districts.The IMD also issued orange warning (be prepared) for heavy rainfall very likely to occur at isolated places over the districts of Sundargarh, Keonjhar, Deogarh, Angul, Boudh, Balangir, Nuapada and Nabarangpur. Besides, six districts — Koraput, Kalahandi, Kandhamal, Dhenkanal, Cuttack and Mayurbhanj — have been issued with yellow warning (be updated) for heavy rainfall.The Baitarani river was in spate at Akhuapada and was flowing above danger mark by evening, an official report said. Similarly the Vansadhara river at Gunupur and Kashinagar was flowing above warning level.In the last 24 hours ending 8.30am of Saturday, Paradip recorded highest rainfall of 170 mm followed by 117.4 mm at Puri, 111.4 mm at Phulbani, 88 mm at Daringbadi, 81.1 mm at Sonepur and 58 mm at Angul. Sambalpur recorded the highest rainfall of 99.4 mm between 8.30am and 5.30pm on Saturday, causing severe waterlogging in several parts of the city.Following the warning, Special Relief Commissioner (SRC) has asked the collectors of the districts under red and orange warning to keep the administrative machinery fully prepared to meet any possible flood, waterlogging and landslide.“Advance arrangements may be made to evacuate people from vulnerable locations to safe shelters, if required, and to provide adequate food, safe drinking water, lights, health and sanitation facilities at the shelter and relief camps,” said an order issued by revenue secretary Nikunja Bihari Dhal.The rainfall is likely to continue till Sunday and its intensity will reduce gradually. “Since there are chances of extremely heavy rainfall in some parts, district administrations have been asked to be prepared for any eventualities,” said deputy SRC, P K Mohapatra.Fishermen have been asked not to venture into the sea in the next 48 hours.Menwhile, Koraput district administration heaved a sigh of relief as a possible flash flood situation was averted with a decrease in downpour on Friday night and Saturday.“At present, there is no flood threat in the district. However, we can’t be complacent and all district and field level officials have been put on high alert as a sudden heavy downpour may worsen the situation,” said collector (Koraput) Madhusudan Mishra.
