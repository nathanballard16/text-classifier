The late summer weather will get interesting on Thursday as a system containing moisture and instability spreads north from California. Clouds will thicken overnight, and Thursday will start with a 20% chance of rain and chances for thunderstorms across the metro area. Mix that with some of the warmest temperatures of the week with a high expected of 87. Odd.

There are more chances for thunderstorms into the evening Thursday. But most of the storms should be confined to the Cascades and central Oregon. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for central Oregon including the cities of Madras, Redmond and Bend. The warning in effect between 5 a.m.-11 p.m. Thursday. Expected scattered thunderstorms with possible lightning that could lead to fires. Gusty winds will help any new fires to spread quickly. Anyone outdoors in these areas should have a plan for shelter during thunderstorms.

A more settled weather pattern of marine clouds, then mostly sunny skies returns for Friday. Temperatures will also cool back to seasonal averages with a high of 80 expected Friday. Forecasters are currently watching a system that may bring rain for the weekend. We’ll keep an eye on that.
