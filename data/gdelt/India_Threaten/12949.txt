New Delhi: Amid heightened tensions with India over the abrogation of Article 370 move, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) has warned the government against Pakistan’s move of releasing Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar.

IB has asked the government to deploy more soldiers on the Indo-Pak border near Rajasthan as they suspect Pakistan of planning a terrorist attack. Pakistan is said to have released Azhar to plan terrorist operations, the Hindustan Times reported.

The report says that Pakistan is planning “big action” in Sialkot-Jammu and Rajasthan sectors in the coming days. Pakistan’s latest move comes in the backdrop of India’s decision to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and divide it into two Union Territories – J&K and Ladakh. This irked the neighbour, which scaled with diplomatic ties with India and also suspended bilateral trade.

The officials said that the Border Security Force and army field formations in Jammu and Rajasthan sectors have been alerted about the same.

Recently, India declared Azhar the first individual terrorist under the amended Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA).
