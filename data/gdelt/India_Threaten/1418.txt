bjp rathore: BJP leader, son held for party neta’s murder

BARWANI: BJP state working committee member Tara Chand Rathore, his son and five others were arrested on Thursday for the murder of party’s Balwadi mandal president Manoj Thackeray. Political rivalry that began in the run-up to assembly election was the trigger for the murder, say police.Thackeray’s murder had sparked protests by BJP, with Rathore leading the demonstrations in Barwani and accusing Congress of hatching the murder plot. Former CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said he would lead a protest in Barwani if police failed to nab the killers by February 1. Cops cracked the case in 11 days. It was Rathore who planned the murder and gave a supari of Rs 5 lakh, say police.Thackeray had been hacked to death, but police had no suspect. “We got a breakthrough when we analysed an audio clip that had gone viral before assembly elections. It indicated a spat between Thackeray and Rathore’s son Digvijay Singh, who is also a panchayat secretary,” said Barwani SP Yangchen Dolkar Bhutia
