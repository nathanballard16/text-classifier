Operation Kashmiri Almonds: NIA vows action

Operation Kashmiri Almonds uncovered how illegal cash was being sneaked in Jammu and Kashmir by hawala operatives.

The National Investigation Agency swung into action on Tuesday, a day after India Today's Operation Kashmiri Almonds exposed hawala conduits funnelling illicit cash into Srinagar.

Highly-placed officials in the NIA commended the undercover investigation as they vowed to bring the money-laundering operatives to book.

According to officials, the NIA would examine the raw footage of Operation Kashmiri Almonds.

Strict action will be taken against people routing illegal cash into the restive region, NIA sources said.

In 2017, India Today's scathing expose of anti-India elements bankrolling troublemakers in Jammu and Kashmir led to at least a dozen arrests.

Back then, Hurriyat leader Naeem Khan, now in jail, confessed that funds from across the border were channelled through Old Delhi's notorious hawala agents to instigate disturbance in the valley. The NIA is set to file its chargesheet next week in connection with that case, official sources said.

India Today's latest investigation came amid tight restrictions in Jammu and Kashmir which followed the August 5 revocation of its special status.

Operation Kashmiri Almonds showed a number of merchants in Old Delhi doubling up as hawala operatives for remittances bound to Srinagar.

For this syndicate, low commissions from high volumes of cash trading seem to outweigh security concerns that illicit funds could be used in fomenting trouble.

Among those found transferring money illegally to Jammu and Kashmir were dried-fruit and footwear merchants in Old Delhi's Chandni Chowk neighbourhood.
