The Supreme Court (SC) on Monday said it will hear all pleas related to the Jamia Milia Islamia clashes on Tuesday while issuing a stern warning to students to stop riots.

Citing destruction of property amid anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) protests in the national capital, Chief justice of India SA Bobde said, If violence and destruction of public property continues, we will not hear it.

"Just because they happen to be students, it doesn't mean they can take law and order in their hands, this has to be decided when things cool down. This is not the frame of mind when we can decide anything. Let the rioting stop," he added.

Senior advocate Indira Jaising mentioned the Jamia Milia Islamia and Aligarh Muslim University incidents before a bench headed by CJI Bobde and appealed the top court to take suo motu congnizance of the issue.

She said, It is a very serious human rights violation all over the country.

Another senior advocate Colin Gonsalves then suggested that a retired Supreme Court judge should look into the Jamia matter.

However, CJI Bobde said the case will be determined and all the pleas in the case will be heard, but only after the rioting stops.

We will determine the rights but not in the atmosphere of riots, let all of this stop and then we will take suo motu cognizance. We are not against rights and peaceful demonstrations, he said.

When an advocate asked the bench to look at the videos shot yesterday inside the Jamia campus, CJI Bobde said, We don’t want to see videos. If the violence and destruction of public property continue, we will not hear it.

Delhi Police has also registered two FIRs against Jamia students for arson and rioting during anti-CAA protests.
