Earlier he was barred from campaigning for 72 hours for his \'khaki underwear\' jibe at BJP candidate Jaya Prada.

Using its constitutional powers, the Commission barred him from holding rallies, campaigning, giving statements to media for the next 48 hours beginning 6.00 AM Wednesday.

The poll panel said he has violated the provisions of the model code dealing with making communal remarks and \"intimidation\" of voters.
