Sohrabuddin Sheikh case: Congress framed Amit Shah, says Smriti Irani

Evidence was manufactured, the Union Minister says.

The BJP on Tuesday accused the Congress, especially UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Congress president Rahul Gandhi, of having tried to “frame” BJP president Amit Shah in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case when the party was in power at the Centre.

Union Minister Smriti Irani said the case was an example of the “lengths to which the Congress will go to destroy its political opponents”. She said Mr. Shah, a Minister in the Gujarat government of Narendra Modi in 2010, was harassed by the CBI at the behest of the Congress leadership that identified him and Mr. Modi as its main rivals. “Evidence was manufactured in an attempt to destroy Mr. Shah politically,” she said.

She accused Mr. Gandhi of supporting a terrorist, in a reference to his tweet on the Sohrabuddin Sheikh case verdict that “nobody killed” him and he “just died”. “The court admitted that these cases were imposed on Mr. Shah for political reasons. Not just in the Mumbai High Court but also in the Supreme Court, the Congress’s conspiracy got defeated,” Ms. Irani said.

All 22 accused in the 2005-06 fake encounter killings of Sohrabuddin Shaikh, his wife Kausar Bi and aide Tulsiram Prajapati were acquitted on December 21 by a special CBI court in Mumbai because of insufficient evidence.
