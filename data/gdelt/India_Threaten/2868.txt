Pak-India situation very dangerous: Trump

WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump voiced alarm Friday at the “very dangerous situation” between India and Pakistan, warning that New Delhi was considering “very strong” action after an attack in the Indian Held Kashmir.

“It’s very dangerous situation between the two countries. We would like to see it stop,” Trump said, adding that the United States was seeking talks with Pakistan.

“Right now there is a lot of problems between India and Pakistan because of what happened,” he told reporters as he met a senior Chinese official in the Oval Office.

Tensions have soared between the two countries since a suicide attack last week killed 41 soldiers in the Pulwama district of Indian Held Kashmir.

“India is looking at something very strong. India just lost almost 50 people with an attack. So I can und erstand that also,” Trump said.

India has been demanding action against militants from Pakistan, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi under pressure from his Hindu nationalist base to show firmness weeks before he is set to call elections. Pakistan’s military Friday warned India against any “misadventure,” saying it was capable of responding.
