Ahmedabad: Slamming West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee over the violence at BJP chief Amit Shah’s Kolkata road-show, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani Friday said she had lost her mental balance and was indulging in ‘didigiri’ (bullying).

Talking to media in Vadodara, also said people of West Bengal would give a fitting reply to Mamata and her party, All India Trinamool Congress.

“It seems that Didi (Mamata) has completely lost her mental balance. She is losing her ground. She tarnished the democracy and indulged in ‘didigiri’ (similar to Hindi word ‘dadagiri’, meaning bullying),” Rupani told reporters.

“People of India and West Bengal will not tolerate such behaviour. People of West Bengal will give a befitting reply to her in the polls,” he said.

During the last phase of campaigning, there was a pitched battle between BJP and TMC in West Bengal. Clashes broke our during Shah’s roadshow on Wednesday.

A statue of social reformer Ishwarchandra Vidhyasagar was vandalised, for which both the parties are blaming each other.
