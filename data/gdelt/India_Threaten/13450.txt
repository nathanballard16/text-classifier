Debt-ridden Coffee Day Enterprises raises Rs 2,700 crore via investments in Bangalore IT park

Coffee Day Enterprises, which had admitted to being under a debt of Rs 4,970 crore soon after the death of its founder VG Siddhartha, on Wednesday revealed that it has managed to raise Rs 2,700 crore via investments in its Bangalore IT park.

In a regulatory filing to the exchanges, the Coffee Day Enterprises said that it had signed definitive agreements with Blackstone Group and Bengaluru-based real estate developer Salarpuria Sattva Group for investment in GV Techparks Private Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tanglin Development Limited (TDL). The investment will help the company bring down its debt.

The transaction is at an enterprise value of Rs 2,700 crore subject to certain closing adjustments, the filing said.

SHARE PRICES FLUCTUATE

The market filing sent the company's shares in a tizzy. In the day's trade, Coffee Day Enterprises shares saw a jump of over 5 per cent on BSE before closing at Rs 73, marginally higher than the previous day's close at Rs 72.75. The intraday high was 75.75, touched shortly after the market opening.

Coffee Day Enterprises has been facing a downward spiral since March this year. On March 18, the company's shares were priced at Rs 309.80. After a steady decline over five months, the Coffee Day shares dropped significantly since July 29 to reach rs 62.70 on August 16 - two days after the company admitted its Rs 4,970 crore debt.
