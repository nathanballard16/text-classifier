TSRTC JAC Union Withdraws Strike

HYDERABAD: After 51 days of strike, the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation employees have called off their strike on Monday. Joint Action Committee (JAC) leader Aswathama Reddy said that the decision to call it off was taken to halt alleged attempts to 'privatise' the corporation.

More than 48,000 employees of TSRTC have been on strike since October 5 to press for their demands, which includes the merger of the TSRTC with the government so that they are treated at par with the government employees.

However, the state government has not responded to the demand of the workers who took to various means of protest.
