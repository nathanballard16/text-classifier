Bomb Threat at Patna Airport Probably a Hoax

Patna: Authorities are investigating a bomb threat at the Jaya Prakash Narayan International Airport in Patna on Friday that created a panic among the travelers during afternoon peak hours with hundreds of passengers waiting in the lounge.

As reported, someone called the airport and told an official that there was a bomb at the terminal. A bomb squad and the special branch of the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) rushed to the airport and combed the entire facility but did not find anything.

An airport official said the call came around 2:40 pm. It was received by the secretary of the airport director. The caller, in an attempt to hide his real voice, spoke like a child and told the officials that there was a bomb at the airport.

On its face, it appears it was a prank call though the police are investigating it from a number of angles. An FIR was lodged with the Airport police station.

Police said the caller's number was traced to someone named Indrajeet Kumar from Jharkhand. An investigative team has left for Jharkhand to locate and arrest the person., Airport police station in-charge Ram Kumar said.
