Karnataka: Older crop of primary school teachers threaten to boycott classes on July 9

MYSURU: Tweaking in the rules for appointment, and assigning of teachers to specific classes in the Cadre and Recruitment Rules 2017, which the department of public instruction (DPI) recently brought into force has turned into a major bone of contention among teachers in Karnataka. None too pleased with the DPI ’s decision to enforce the new rules, which the teachers argue is biased against many experienced hands, the Karnataka State Primary School Teachers’ Association has asked all its members to boycott classes on July 9 , threatening a near complete shutdown of operations in all state-run primary educational institutions for an entire day.The Cadre and Recruitment Rules 2017 stipulate that those teachers appointed to primary schools prior to 2014, who did not have a graduate degree before – designated ‘Primary School Teachers’ — they started their careers and subsequently earned them via correspondence while working, will be able to teach students only up till class V. Only those employees designated ‘Graduate Primary Teachers’, those who held degrees at the time of their appointment, will be permitted to teach students of classes between class VI and VIII. However, the former group crying itself hoarse over the sudden change in the rules, pointing out that they have been teaching students in higher primary classes for years together.Director of the Mysuru Taluk Teachers’ Association T Satish Javaregowda alleged that the new rules were extremely unfair to the older crop of teachers. “Many of us have earned BSc, BA, MA and even PhDs after having started our careers as teachers. But the DPI is not willing to consider these lateral qualifications. Many teachers who joined later are being promoted, whereas many of us will be confined to teaching just five classes,” said Javaregowda, adding that the boycott on July 9 was an expression of their opposition to the move.He argued that, given the many years of experience that they had having taught students of higher primary classes, the teachers now barred from continuing to do so were more than qualified to continue to teach these classes in the future. “Today, we did not take classes for students in classes from VI to VIII,” he added.The problem of the ‘Primary School Teachers’ is further compounded by the fact that admission to lower primary classes, wherein the medium of instruction is predominantly Kannada, is on a downward spiral, making teachers extremely apprehensive about their future. They fear that declining admissions to lower primary classes might, coupled with the change in the rules, put an end to their teaching careers.DPI commissioner PC Jaffer, however, said that demands of the ‘Primary School Teachers’ had been taken under consideration and an order would soon be issued, allaying their concerns.
