Modi govt plans to demolish Delhi’s unauthorised colonies, hand them over to big builders: Kejriwal

AAP Chief Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said that Modi government now plans to demolish unauthorised colonies in Delhi in a large scale.

Addressing a press conference, the AAP chief said that a few central government officials told him about this plan. “Modi government now plans to demolish unauthorised colonies in Delhi in a large scale,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

“We were laying sewer lanes in kachhi colonies... in sabhas in these unauthorised colonies, about four-five months before, I’d told that I came to know from a few central government officers that Modi government plans to demolish all unauthorised colonies in Delhi,” he said.

“They want to demolish the colonies and give it to big builders and rich people and take all land. Delhi’s 60-70 per cent population lives in unauthorised colonies and what big corruption can happen, you can think about it,” he added.

“If you want to save Delhi, fail BJP this time. Make our hand stronger... If we get seven seats in Parliament, we won’t allow central government to destroy Delhi,” Mr. Kejriwal said.

He also posed three questions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi ahead of his rally in Delhi later in the day.

“Give answer to three questions. One, why sealing happened in Delhi? Why was factories closed? Why lakhs were left unemployed? Why didn’t you bring an ordinance to stop sealing? How much truth is there in the news there’s a deal struck with MNCs to seal the shops?” Mr. Kejriwal asked.

He also asked why Mr. Modi had promised full statehood statehood for Delhi during last election and not keep it. “What relation Modi ji has with Imran Khan?” Mr. Kejriwal posed the third question.
