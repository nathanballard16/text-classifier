The agitation launched by the Gurjar Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti (GASS) demanding 5 per cent reservation in jobs and educational institutions turned violent in Dholpur district today as shots were fired, five cops sustained injuries and three police vehicles were torched.

Agitators resorted to stone-pelting and firing while holding a protest on the Agra-Morena highway at Dholpur district headquarters.

SP Ajay Singh said the police used teargas shells to disperse the protesters. Gurjars have been holding a sit-in on railway tracks in Malarna Dungar of Sawai Madhopur district since Friday evening. The agitation spread as Gurjar leader Kirori Singh Bainsla refused to call it off.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, who returned after a two-day visit to Delhi, said Bainsla had said the protest would be peaceful. There might be some miscreants involved in the Dholpur incident, but a Gurjar delegation should come for talks with a ministerial panel, he added.

Roadways buses remained off the Sawai Madhopur-Dholpur highway. Bus services have been suspended on the Hindon-Karauli sections of the highway covering Alwar, Bharatpur and Mathura since yesterday.

Bainsla said, “Congress minister Vishwendra Singh and IAS officer Neeraj Pawan had come for talks yesterday. They wanted us to send a delegation to Jaipur. Everything on quota would have to be solved in writing at this very spot. The Congress government is not serious.”
