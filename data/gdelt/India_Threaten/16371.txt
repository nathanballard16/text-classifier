NC President Deuba lashes out at PM Oli over Kalapani issue

POKHARA, Nov 22: Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Friday said that Prime Minister KP Oli’s nationalism has turned lampasarbad (inertia).

Deuba said so while addressing a program in Pokhara. "Now, Oli's nationalism has turned lampasarbad in Kalapani issue. He is raising the issue of Kalapani only to succeed in winning elections in the name of nationalism and populism," he said while lambasting the government for failing to make concrete efforts to retrieve Nepali territory Kalapani which has been encroached by India.

Deuba, who is also the former prime minister, accused the government of attempting to impose restrictions on the press and the judiciary. He also warned of launching a movement against the government both in the parliament and street if it continued to act against democracy.

"The government is trying to make the Constitutional Council its puppet while it is making attempt to turn Commission for Investigation of Authority (CIAA) to the former Corruption Control Royal Commission," he said.

On the occasion, Nepali Congress General Secretary Shashanka Koirala said that the upcoming by-election is going to be a real test for his party. "This by-election is going to be a real test for our party. None can defeat NC if the party is unified," he said.
