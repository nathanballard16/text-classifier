South Asian citizens caution Delhi

South Asian citizens caution Delhi 'The Act is discriminatory at the first instance because it targets Muslims beyond the stated intent of the law'

Fourteen independent South Asian citizens on Thursday expressed distress over India’s “decisive majoritarian turn” and warned that the Citizenship (Amendment) Act had the potential to deepen geopolitical divides in the region and weaken New Delhi’s ability to take a stand on urgent matters confronting humanity. “The Act is discriminatory at the first instance because it targets Muslims beyond the stated intent of the law. It is unacceptable for any country including one with a secular Constitution to distinguish between citizens, foreign or domestic, on the basis of religion. Further, the Act has the potential to deepen geopolitical divides among the countries of South Asia at a time when they should be striving for peace and mutual understanding,” their joint statement said.
