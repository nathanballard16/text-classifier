NGT fines Volkswagen 500cr over ‘cheat devices’

NEW DELHI: The National Green Tribunal ( NGT ) on Thursday fined Volkswagen Rs 500 crore for “damaging the environment” through the use of a “cheat device” in its diesel cars in India.A bench headed by NGT chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed the German automobile major to deposit the amount within two months while increasing the compensation amount from Rs 171.34 crore, which had been recommended by an NGT-appointed committee, as a means of “creating deterrence”.Volkswagen, however, claimed it did not violate BS-IV norms and that results were based on ‘on-road tests’ for which there were no prescribed standards.Volkswagen said it would challenge Thursday’s order before the Supreme Court, reiterating that its cars were compliant with the emission norms as defined in India.A “cheat” or “defeat device” is a software in diesel engines to manipulate emission tests by changing the performance of the cars.“Sustainable development is the main guiding factor... We are unable to accept the manufacturer’s objections to the report,” the NGT said, adding the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) might consider utilising VW’s monetary penalty towards improving air quality in NCR and other highly polluted areas.On November 16, 2018, the green court had said that use of the “cheat device” in Volkswagen diesel cars in India led to environmental damage. It had subsequently directed the auto maker to deposit an interim amount of Rs 100 crore with the CPCB.It had also constituted a joint team of representatives of the CPCB, Ministry of Heavy Industries, Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) and National Environmental Engineering Research Institute, which had recommended R171.34-crore fine on Volkswagen as “health damages” for causing air pollution in Delhi due to excess nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.The expert committee in its report has estimated that Volkswagen cars released approximately 48.678 tonnes of NOx in 2016 in the national capital.“Estimated cost of heath damage due to additional NOx emissions from the Volkswagen group vehicles is approximately R171.34 crore using a metro city i.e. Delhi as base. The value may be considered conservative due to lack of methodologies for calculating the overall impact of nitrogen oxide on the environment in India and hence only health damages are valued.“Further, the valuation is for Delhi considering that the value of NOx is 435 tonnes released in the city. This is assumed because lack of data on the geographical locations and plying regions of Volkswagen vehicles which have caused the damage and for all the years which have been considered for damage,” the committee has said in its report.The panel was formed by the NGT on November 16 last year to give its opinion whether the manufacturer has exceeded the prescribed environmental norms and fair estimate of the damage caused to the environment.The committee has told the NGT that automobiles are a major source of nitrogen oxide. The green panel had said the use of “cheat device” by Volkswagen in diesel cars in India leads to inference of environmental damage and asked the German carmaker to deposit an interim amount of R100 crore with the Central Pollution Control Board.Volkswagen India had in December 2015 announced the recall of 3,23,700 lakh vehicles in India to fix the emission software after ARAI conducted tests on some models and found that their on-road emissions were 1.1 times to 2.6 times higher than the applicable BS-IV norms.The automobile giant had admitted to the use of 'defeat device' in 11 million diesel engine cars sold in the US, Europe and other global markets to manipulate emission test results.After the tests by ARAI, Volkswagen India had undertaken to rejig the software by recalling around 3.23 lakh vehicles fitted with EA 189 diesel engines which were in alleged violation of emission norms.The company, however, had said that the recall in India was purely voluntary in nature as it did not face any charges regarding violating emission norms in India, unlike in the US
