This is undeclared emergency, not BJP rule: Congress's Abhishek Singhvi

Congress leader Abhishek Manu Singhvi said on Thursday that the situation in Delhi is nothing but an undeclared emergency. As Section 144 was imposed in many parts of Delhi-NCR and 18 Metro stations were shut in view of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Abhishek Manu Singhvi said it is not the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rule in the country but an undeclared emergency.

Addressing a press conference in Delhi, Abhishek Manu Singhvi said, "Delhi is the capital. Section 144 has been put around the Red Fort, obstructions on roads, 18 Delhi Metro stations shut and the internet has been shut as per the directions. Section 144 imposed in Karnataka, arrests in Uttar Pradesh and Assam has similar clampdown."

"D Raja, Sitaram Yechuri, Ajay Maken, Sandeep Dikshit have been picked under Section 144 [during the protest against the Citizenship Amendment Act]. This is an undeclared emergency, not the BJP rule. BJP rule has become man-eater it seems," Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.

Hundreds of students, activists and opposition leaders were detained on Thursday when they defied prohibitory orders to protest against the new citizenship law as large parts of Delhi reeled under restrictions on mobile internet services and traffic movement.

Opposition leaders including D Raja, Sitaram Yechury, Nilotpal Basu, Brinda Karat, Ajay Maken Sandeep Dikshit and activists Yogendra Yadav, Umar Khalid, were among those detained near the Red Fort and Mandi House -- the sites of the two planned demonstrations against the Citizenship Act.

Since Section 144 was also imposed around the Red Fort area, scores of protesters were dragged into buses by police in a bid to clear the area. Entry and exit gates of a total of 18 metro stations in Delhi were also closed. Barricades were erected in various parts of Delhi-NCR, resulting in massive traffic snarls.
