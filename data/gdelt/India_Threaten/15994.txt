TSRTC Strike Day 40: Telangana Govt Says ‘No’ For Judicial Committee

HYDERABAD: In the wake of the High Court's decision to form a high-level committee with former judges of the Supreme Court to look into the issue of the Telangana RTC workers' strike, the State Government was said to be reluctant for this. The High Court has asked the state government to submit its counter on the issue of a judicial committee to be set up to address the strike issue. The state government filed an affidavit on this issue on Wednesday and is to be reluctant for the constitution of a High Power Judicial Committee.

In its affidavit, the government stated that under the Industrial Dispute Act of 1947, all workers must comply with company regulations, but RTC workers do not obey any laws. The government has asked the court to issue directions to the Labour Commission under Section 10 of the Industrial Deputy Act. The court also noted that the RTC workers' strike was under the Labor Court.

The court earlier asked the advocate general to reply by Wednesday afternoon about setting up the judicial committee to find an amicable solution to the crisis

RTC JAC Convenor E Aashwathma Reddy said they will heed the court's directive and that both the RTC JAC and employees are eagerly awaiting the orders.

The High Court on Tuesday said that a committee would be constituted with three former Supreme Court justices to resolve the RTC strike. The leaders of the RTC JAC also welcomed the formation of the committee. However, as the government was reluctant to do so, it would be interesting to see how the High Court would make its ruling on the issue.
