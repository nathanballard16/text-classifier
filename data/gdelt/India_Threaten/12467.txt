A day after Uttar Pradesh police released posters of the missing student whose father has alleged she was sexually harassed by BJP leader Swami Chinmayanand, the cops have located her in Rajasthan. UP Police on Friday took to Twitter and informed, "In Shahjahanpur episode the girl has been located by Shahjahanpur police in Rajasthan along with her friend. Necessary legal action is being taken." The girl was found on Friday morning and she is fine, state police chief O P Singh said. She is being brought to Shahjahanpur, the director-general of police said, adding that police teams had been working in this regard since the past few days.The Uttar Pradesh government informed the Supreme Court that they have found the woman. The apex court has asked the counsel appearing for the state to apprise it of the exact location of the woman and also that by when she can be produced before it. The state government told a bench of justices R Banumathi and A S Bopanna that the woman has been found in Rajasthan and she is being taken to Shahjahanpur in Uttar Pradesh. The top court had taken cognisance on its own in the matter after a group of lawyers had written a letter to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi requesting him to take cognisance over the issue.
