ALLAHABAD: Having identified as many as 67 accident-prone areas, police have come up with a three-tier safety plan to minimize road mishaps Speed limit/caution boards would be installed, indicating standard speed limits for both heavy and light vehicles.Police have also decided to construct speed breakers with the help of NHAI, PWD, municipal corporation and zila panchayat.A total of 67 black spots on national highway (NH), state highway (SH) and major district street (MDS) across the range comprising Allahabad, Pratapgarh, Kaushambi and Fatehpur districts, have been identified.While Pratapgarh has 20 (maximum) black spots, 10 each on NH and SH, Allahabad has 13 (minimum) black spots including 10 on NH, one on SH and two on MDS.Similarly, Fatehpur has a total of 18 black spots including nine on NH, three on SH and six on MDS, and Kaushambi has 16 black spots including nine on NH, five on SH and two on MDS.Police data shows 1,114 persons had died in separate cases of road mishaps in the past eight months including Allahabad (416), Kaushambi (145), Fatehpur (348) and Pratapgarh (205).Statistics from 2018 show that 1,625 people lost their lives in over 1,800 cases of road mishaps in Allahabad (614), Fatehpur (496), Pratapgarh (319) and Kaushambi (196).Despite the lowest number of black spots in Allahabad, the city has accounted for the maximum (416) number of accident-related deaths in the past eight months.DIG (Prayagraj Range) KP Singh said, “Police have taken steps to minimize the graph of road mishaps. We are also consulting the authorities concerned to improve the road infrastructure. Violation of speed limits and rash driving were two major factors behind the rising number of accidents, both in terms of fatal and non-fatal accidents.”He added,“Traffic police authorities of all four districts of the range have been asked to put “accident prone areas” boards on identified spots and look into cases of rash driving.”
