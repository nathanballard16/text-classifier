US wants end of Pakistan-India tensions

"It's very dangerous situation between the two countries. We would like to see it stop," Trump said.

WASHINGTON (AFP) - US President Donald Trump voiced alarm Friday at the "very dangerous situation" between India and Pakistan.



"It’s very dangerous situation between the two countries. We would like to see it stop," Trump said, adding that the United States was seeking talks with Pakistan.

"Right now there is a lot of problems between India and Pakistan because of what happened," he told reporters as he met a senior Chinese official in the Oval Office.

Tensions have soared between the nuclear-armed rivals since a suicide attack last week killed 44 soldiers in occupied Kashmir, the deadliest attack in years.

India has been demanding action against freedom fighters from Pakistan, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi under pressure from his Hindu nationalist base to show firmness weeks before he is set to call elections.



Pakistan Army on Friday warned India against any "misadventure," saying it was capable of responding.

India and Pakistan have fought two of their three full-fledged wars over Kashmir since their partition at independence from Britain in 1947.
