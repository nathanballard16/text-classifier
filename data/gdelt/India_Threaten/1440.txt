Fugitive underworld don Ravi Pujari was working with national, international gangs – First pic out

Underworld don Ravi Pujari.

New Delhi: Indian agencies are claiming that underworld don Ravi Pujari started working with various gangs internationally and in India after the downfall of his mentor Chhota Rajan, who is currently serving a life sentence in a jail in Navi Mumbai. Pujari was a small-time criminal in the Mumbai underworld but everything changed after he killed his rival Bala Zalte. Chhota Rajan, who had by then made a name for himself in the Mumbai underworld by working for Dawood Ibrahim, was impressed by Pujari and admitted him in his gang. The two parted ways in 2001.

Pujari was earlier believed to be hiding in Australia and had made several threats to Bollywood actors. Student activists Umar Khalid, Shehla Rashid and Gujarat MLA Jignesh Mewani had claimed that they had received death threats from the gangster.

Indian security agencies said yesterday that Pujari was apprehended in Senegal, a country in West Africa. They are now planning to bring the don back to Mumbai.

The gangster was hard to trace and after acting on various leads it was found that he was in hiding in Australia. Pujari is wanted in India for a number of cases ranging from extortion, kidnapping, murder, blackmail and cheating. Many Bollywood stars have registered complaints against the dreaded criminal for extortion calls he made to them over the years.

Interpol had issued Red Corner Notice issued against him.

Pujari had also demanded Rs 1 crore from Pratapgarh MLA Sangam Lal and several prominent builders in Gujarat were also on his radar.
