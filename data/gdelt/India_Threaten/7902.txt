Special Status for AP is Difficult Says YS Jagan:- YSRCP Chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy has been to New Delhi yesterday and met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He personally invited Modi for the swearing-in ceremony that would take place on May 30th. YS Jagan arranged a press meet to reveal about the developments that took place during the meeting. He said that special status for Andhra Pradesh will be difficult but he would fight for it in the coming days.

"I always prayed to God that no alliance should get more than 250 seats so that they would require our support. But unfortunately, BJP registered record majority. We would have then supported BJP only after they signed the Special Category Status document. As of now, Special Status for AP is difficult, but I requested Modi to look into it" said YS Jagan. He also spoke about Polavaram project and about the land scams in Amaravati. Jagan said that he would stage an investigation on all the scams that took place during TDP's regime.
