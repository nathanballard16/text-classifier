World recognises strength, not weak leadership: Piyush Goyal at India Today Conclave 2019

Union minister Piyush Goyal sent out the message that the Modi government has dealt with terror in very strong terms. Speaking at India Today Conclave 2019 in New Delhi, the Union minister for railways and coal said that the world recognises a strong leadership.

He rubbished the claim that India’s economic interests will be hit by the looming threat of a war with Pakistan. This is the kind of weak narrative that some opposition leaders have tried to project in the last few days. It is deplorable, Piyush Goyal said.

Piyush Goyal said he was glad the country was finally under a strong leadership which has responded to terrorism and cross border aggression. I think this is the time for the nation to be proud. I am glad we have a leader who is willing to bite the bullet. We finally have a situation where the country is in safe hands.

He said that the country is finally under a leadership that has given the defence forces freedom to retaliate as they deem fit. We finally have a leadership that does not buckle to threats domestic or international.

Piyush Goyal said that the world recognises the strength and that because of India’s economy and leadership, the world now sees India as a world power. This is why we have gotten the world to rally behind us at this stage, he said.

The Union minister also condemned those who questioned the credibility of the Indian forces at present time.
