Kerala's ruling Left and Congress-led Opposition stage joint protest against CAA

The amended Citizenship Act has united the ruling Left Democratic Front and Congress-led United Democratic Front in Kerala. LDF and UDF leaders staged joined hunger strike in Thiruvananthapuram Martyr's Square against, what they said as the Modi government's anti-constitutional attempt to divide the country on a religious basis.

While leading the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said that Kerala will stand together to fight against the evil designs of the Modi government undermining the secular credentials of India. He termed the Citizens Amendment Act as "anti-constitutional and anti-people".

"Through the Citizens Amendment Act, the Modi government butchered the secular fabric of our country to execute the agenda of the Sangh Parivar. The union government is trying to cover up its failures by imposing draconian laws that would divide the nation on communal lines. The act that aims to reduce minorities in our country will have far-reaching consequences and terrorise the minorities. We need to raise voice against such fascist forces usurping our constitution in one voice," the Chief Minister said.

Leader of Opposition Ramesh Chennithala observed that another struggle for Independence is required to save the constitution from 'fascist forces'.

"When Constitution is in danger, democratic forces should have the will to fight against them," Chennithala told India Today TV.
