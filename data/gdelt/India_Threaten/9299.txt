The aircraft had made a precautionary landing at London Stansted Airport, London due to a bomb threat, the airline had said in a tweet. However, the tweet was removed from Air India’s official twitter account moments later.

The BBC had quoted UK’s Ministry of Defence as saying that Royal Air Force (RAF) Typhoon fighter jets escorted the aircraft as it made its landing. More details are awaited.

Later, the state-run airline official told Reuters the bomb threat on an Air India passenger aircraft flying was a hoax and that the plane is back in the air.
