Two-day bank strike called off

New Delhi: Officers’ unions of public sector banks have deferred the proposed two-day strike September 26 and 27 following an assurance from Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar to look into their concerns. The unions had threatened the strike to protest against the consolidation of 10 state-run lenders into four.

“Finance Secretary Rajiv Kumar was positive in formation of a committee consisting of all concerned to address the issues arising out of the proposed merger of 10 banks including preserving the identity of all the banks. An appeal was made to us to revisit our strike call in view of the discussions,” a joint statement said issued Monday. “In view of the consideration of the positive and workable solution by the Finance Secretary, the 48 hours strike stands deferred,” the statement added.

As a result, normal banking activity would not be affected.

The Indian Banks’ Association (IBA) had informed SBI that the All India Bank Officers’ Confederation (AIBOC), All India Bank Officers’ Association (AIBOA), Indian National Bank Officers’ Congress (INBOC) and National Organisation of Bank Officers (NOBO) had given a call for a pan-India strike by bank employees, September 26 and 27, 2019.

The government on August 30 announced its mega consolidation plan to bring the down the total number of PSBs to 12 from 19 in 2017 in a bid to make them global-sized banks.
