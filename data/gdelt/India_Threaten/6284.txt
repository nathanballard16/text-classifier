M Nagaraj, a lawyer, is said to have been a alcohol-addict and used to beat up his wife and children regularly.This is said to be what pushed the woman to go to the police after 20 years of marriage.The couple used to fight all the time over the man’s alcohol addiction and their families have tried to intervene and fix the issue. But Nagaraj’s drinking habit is said to have increased by the day and this used to lead to domestic abuse. Nagaraj would also allegedly demand money from his wife and would spend half of her salary on his drinking habit.The complaint filed by the woman states, “During the time of marriage, my family gave Rs 1.5 lakh in cash and 50 gm of gold to my husband. We have two daughters -- one is 19 years old and the other 13. My husband would create a ruckus at home every night, and he would torture the children too. On April 11, when I came home after work, my elder daughter had fallen unconscious on the ground, and when I asked her what happened, she told me that her father had assaulted her badly. When I questioned my husband over this, he threatened to kill me.Later I took my daughter to hospital. On that day, I too was assaulted badly.”
