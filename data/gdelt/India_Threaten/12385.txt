Not scared of Pakistan’s nuclear bogey, says Lt Gen MM Naravane

The Head of the Eastern Army Command Lieutenant General MM Naravane has said that Pakistan could keep raising the ‘nuclear bogey’ but ‘we are not scared’. Naravane’s comments come in the wake of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan cautioning India that both the countries are nuclear powers and in case of war, it could have an impact on the entire world.

Speaking at an event, Naravane said, “We are ready to face any challenges. Whatever we do it is keeping long-term goals in mind.” Asked about 1962 conflict, he said, “We are no longer the Army of 1962. It was not a military debacle. It was a political debacle.”
