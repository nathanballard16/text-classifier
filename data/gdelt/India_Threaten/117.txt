India: one protester dies in temple demonstration

(MENAFN) Police declared that aggressive demonstrations in India's southern state of Kerala have left 1 protester dead after 2 women rejected age-old traditions to access an ancient temple in the region.



Gunfights broke out in the state after two women activists, companied by the police, accessed the hill-top Sabarimala temple before dawn on Wednesday.



The Supreme Court in September removed a temple ban on women of menstruating age provided that their presence would endanger the celibacy of temple deity Lord Ayappa.



In the next days, female devotees and activists tried to reach the temple, however, were blocked by groups of demonstrators and members of hardline Hindu groups.
