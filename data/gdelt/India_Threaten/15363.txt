Rahul Gandhi Flies Abroad Days Ahead Of Congress Agitation, â€˜Meditational Visit', Says Party

New Delhi:

Days ahead of Congress party’s country-wide protests, its leader Rahul Gandhi has left for an unknown location out of India. The absence of Rahul Gandhi days ahead of the Congress party’s planned protest against the Narendra Modi government has given critics yet another chance to question his seriousness.

Reacting to the criticism, the Congress, however, said that its former president is on a “meditational visit” abroad and will be back soon. Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said the Gandhi has time to time gone on such visits.

“Shri Rahul Gandhi has gone from time to time in the past on meditational visits. He is currently on one such visit,” Surjewala said without revealing the location he has gone. Sources in the party siad that Gandhi is possibly in Indonesia for a meditation session and will be back home soon.

Surjewala said the party’s 10-day agitation was formalised at a meeting in which Rahul Gandhi participated in, but neither he nor Sonia Gandhi would be participating in the state and district level programmes.

The Congress has planned a country-wide agitation from November 5 to 15 to highlight the issues of economic slowdown, farm distress, rising unemployment and job losses and the consequences of the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) trade agreement.

“This entire programme was drafted as per his direction and in consultation with him. He guided the party on to the various steps and issues that were to be taken. Shri Rahul Gandhi was present and participated in the meeting where this programme was taken up. Neither Sonia ji nor Rahul ji are going for state agitation or district agitational programme, he said.
