CM Kumaraswamy to expand Karnataka cabinet on June 12, Ramalinga Reddy to be in

Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy will expand his year old JD-S - Congress coalition ministry on June 12, Wednesday.He met Governor VR Vala in the morning and requested time for the cabinet expansion. The swearing in ceremony will be held at 11.30 am, Wednesday.The CM will only fill the vacant posts, and will not go for a recast.The Congress has one vacancy in the ministry caused by the death of minister CS Shivalli, while the JD(S) has two vacancies. It is not clear whether the CM will accommodate the two independents from the JD-S quota.The JD(S)-Congress coalition regime is tottering under the weight of the BJP’s massive win in the Lok Sabha polls. The Congress had assured one or two senior leaders of accommodation in the Cabinet after the election.It is certain that senior Congress leader Ramalinga Reddy will be inducted into the ministry, and JDS - Congress coordination committee chairman Siddaramaiah has already made an announcement to this effect.Reddy, a former home minister and an old school Congressman, had warned his party bosses last week that if seniors like him continued to be neglected, it would become difficult for seniors to continue in the party. He represents Bengaluru’s BTM Layout in the assembly and began his association with the Congress in 1973.Reddy holds considerable clout among municipal corporators of Bengaluru, and his supporters staged a demonstration in front of the Congress office in the city demanding a berth for himin the ministry.
