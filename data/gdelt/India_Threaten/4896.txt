Two gangsters were arrested on Tuesday after a shootout with Punjab Police at Dehlon near Ludhiana.

Amanbir Singh, alias Lalli Cheema, of Bussowal village in Kapurthala, but presently residing in Jalandhar, and his accomplice Kuldeep Singh, alias Kaka, of Talwandi Bhai village in Kapurthala, were arrested.

The operation was led by Sub-Inspector Kirpal Singh and Sub-Inspector Hardeep Singh.

They got inputs about the movement of the gangsters who were travelling in a car. The gangsters were stopped at Dehlon and on seeing the police, they fired shots. The police also retaliated and detained both of them.

The police personnel did not suffer any injury while Cheema was injured in the leg in the firing and admitted to a private hospital.

Lalli Cheema is brother of gangster Harry Cheema, who died in Chandigarh recently when he jumped from a hotel window.

He is wanted in more than 10 cases registered against him in Punjab and neighbouring states.

He had also threatened to kill Congress MLA Navtej Singh Cheema, IG Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh told The Tribune.

Two weapons, one of .30 bore, has been recovered from them.

Last year in May, Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Cheema had alleged that he had received threats from two gangsters of his native Bussowal village.

Cheema had then said the two brothers, Lalli Cheema and Harry Cheema, were B-category gangsters associated with Sukha Kahlwan gang.

They were reportedly booked by the Meerut police on February 1 last year in a case of recovery of a huge cache of ammunition but they evaded arrest.
