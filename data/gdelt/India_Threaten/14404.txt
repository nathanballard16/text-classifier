‘Don’t cross LoC’: Imran Khan warns PoK residents from helping Kashmiris

Islamabad (Pakistan) | Jagran News Desk: Amid the rising tensions with India, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Saturday warned the residents of PoK not to cross the Line of Control (LoC) in order to help the Kashmiris.

“I understand the anguish of the Kashmiris seeing their fellow Kashmiris in Jammu and Kashmir.... Anyone crossing the LoC to provide humanitarian aid or support for Kashmiri struggle will play into the hands of the Indian narrative,” Khan said in a tweet on Saturday.

His advice comes a day after hundreds of people from PoK set out in vehicular and motorcycle rallies to Muzaffarabad on the call of Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front, reported Dawn news.

The tensions between India and Pakistan are on all time high after New Delhi abrogated the special status of Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcated the state into two union territories.

After India’s move on Kashmir, Pakistan downgraded diplomatic ties with New Delhi and expelled the Indian High Commissioner.

Pakistan has also tried to internationalise the Jammu and Kashmir issue but has failed so far. Khan also raised the issue at his address in the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) in New York.

In his 50 minutes speech at the UNGA, Khan devoted half of his address to the Kashmir issue, warning that if there's face-off between two nuclear-armed neighbours, the consequences would be far beyond their borders.

However, Khan was given a befitting reply by India. India in its right to reply said that its citizens do not need anyone else to speak on their behalf and "least of all those who have built an industry of terrorism from the ideology of hate."

Pakistan, so far, has failed to gather support on the Kashmir issue while India has stressed that the abrogation of the special status of Kashmir is an internal matter and Pakistan has no ‘locus standi’ on it.
