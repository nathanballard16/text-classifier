Bollywood actor Vivek Oberoi, who last played Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a film, will now produce a movie on the botched Balakot strike by the Indian Air Force (IAF), reported The Guardian Titled Balakot, the film will be based on the airstrikes as well as the capture and subsequent release of IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman in the aftermath of an attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pulwama district on February 14.The movie is being touted as a 'true story' of the event and appears to be another cheap gimmick to cash in on the ultra-nationalist right-wing agenda sweeping India since Narendra Modi's ascent to power.The film will be shot in Hindi and the regional languages of Tamil and Telegu. Actors from the respective movie industries are also reportedly playing pivotal roles in the propaganda movie.“I am delighted to receive the requisite permission from the IAF a day before Independence Day. Hollywood film-makers applaud their armed forces, intelligence agencies, industries and leaders. Why should Indian film-makers shy away from doing that for India?" Vivek shared in a statement to the Indian media.The film will go on floor this year and is expected to release in 2020. It will be shot in the backdrop of Indian occupied Kashmir, Delhi and Agra.Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.
