CM urged to step in as crippling BEST stir enters 2nd week

MUMBAI: There will be no red bus on city roads for the seventh consecutive day on Monday as the BEST workers’ strike enters its second week, with no talks being held on Sunday. Besides, the government-appointed committee has only heard our demands and not made any offer,” union leader Shashank Rao said. The panel headed by chief secretary D K Jain was appointed as per directions of the Bombay high court. “As we were not called for any discussion on Sunday, the strike will continue. Sources said the management has been gathering evidence against Rao and other union activists in a bid to get them arrested if the strike goes on.
