Tie-up with AAP on the cards, Cong’s Delhi unit learns

AdvertisingSources said the message has been conveyed to the Delhi unit that a tie-up is on the cards, though seat sharing details are yet to be chalked out. Talks of a possible alliance between Congress and AAP in Delhi appeared to regain momentum Saturday, with senior Congress leaders saying its Delhi unit is warming up to the idea “for the larger national interest”. Sources said the New Delhi seat remains contentious since both parties want to contest from there. The Congress last week conducted a survey of 52,000 Delhi party workers to seek their opinion on an alliance. After a meeting with Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Congress chief Sheila Dikshit had announced on March 4 that the party will fight alone.
