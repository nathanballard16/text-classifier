From the Archives (June 20, 1969): Priority for housing(From an Editorial)

The backlog in housing goes on mounting, because the building effort has lagged far behind need. Mr. K. K. Shah, Union Minister, is not the first of Government spokesmen to admit this gap, but his warning against the socially explosive consequences of any further neglect of this prime need of millions living in substandard conditions should stir the State Housing Ministers in conference at Bangalore to some dynamic action at least now. The difficulty in financing other sectors of the Plans has led the Government to relegate allocations for housing to a minor place. Even so, the tempo of new construction could be stepped up if the urge of most citizens to possess their own homes is capitalised by intelligent official policies. Mr. Shah has done well to emphasise this means of getting thousands of new houses built on a hire-purchase basis, and there is no doubt that many middle class people will tighten their belts to save some money to meet the instalment commitment.
