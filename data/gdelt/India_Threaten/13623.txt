Devendra Fadnavis says he does not read Shiv Sena mouthpiece Saamna

Fadnavis also made it clear that the BJP will fight the upcoming polls with Shiv Sena.

Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said he does not read Saamna, the mouthpiece of the BJP's ally Shiv Sena. Saamna is known for its sharp criticism of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led governments at both the Centre and in Maharashtra.

Speaking at the India Today Conclave Mumbai 2019, Fadnavis also said that he is not deterred by ally Shiv Sena's criticism of his government or his party. "Aisa hai ki dost agar pathar bhi pfainke toh to usse phool samjahna chahiye [Stones hurled by friends are like flowers]," Fadnavis said.

Fadnavis also made it clear that the BJP will fight the upcoming polls with Shiv Sena.

Speaking about the Opposition, Devendra Fadnavis said the Congress-NCP camp was in disarray and no leader wants to be associated with the party. And that, he explained, is why leaders from the Opposition are joining the BJP.
