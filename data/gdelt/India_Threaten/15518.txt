Jamnagar judge, family get death threat

RAJKOT: For the last few months Jamnagar additional session judge P C Raval and his family have been on the edge after they have been receiving letters issuing them death threats.The matter came to light after his son, Monil Raval, lodged an FIR with Jamnagar city A division police station on Saturday. The police suspect a suspended constable who was earlier serving in Raval’s house six months ago to be the author of these letters.Judge Raval served as special judge in the 2008 Ahmedabad serial blasts case and is currently serving as a special judge hearing the TADA cases in Jamnagar. He lives in the judges bungalow in government colony near Pardarshan ground in Jamnagar.According to the FIR, an anonymous letter was first found in the premises of the bungalow on August 10. Written in English, the letter issued death threats to Monil, his father and mother. The letter also mentions that “ copy of this letter is sent to Ajay Thakre, Paresh Bhatt, Aarshi Aahir and Brijesh Gosai,” all of whom are Raval’s colleagues.The complainant states that the author seems to know the family very well as well as about thier daily activities. “We also received another letter on Friday in which not only my name was mentioned, but also the names of all the security personnel deputed to our bungalow, as well as about the attendance register,” Monil alleged.The letter, police said, threatened to send all the security personnel on leave by bribing them before killing the Ravals.The complainant raised suspicion against police constable Hitesh Sheth who had been serving as security staff at judge’s bungalow and had been replaced because of his behaviour.When contacted Jamnagar SP Sharad Singhal said, “We have sent the letter writing for verification and if we find the handwriting of the constable we will take action against him. We have provided additional security to judge and his family.”
