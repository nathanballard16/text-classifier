Lucknow/patna, February 25

The Bahujan Samaj Party and the Samajwadi Party on Monday announced they will fight the upcoming Lok Sabha elections together in Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. The two parties ignored the Congress as they did in UP while forging the alliance for the General Election.

However in Bihar, the BSP has decided to go it alone and contest all 40 seats. A statement signed jointly by SP chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP chief Mayawati here said, “Both have together decided to contest the LS elections in alliance in MP and Uttarakhand.”

Under this alliance, the SP will contest three seats in Madhya Pradesh and one in Uttarakhand, while the BSP will contest on all the remaining seats. While MP sends 29 members to the LS, Uttarakhand accounts for 5 seats.

Both parties have joined hands for the upcoming LS elections in UP where the BSP will contest 38 seats while the SP will be vying for 37 seats. UP accounts for 80 LS seats.

Meanwhile, BSP Bihar in-charge Lalji Medhkar said Mayawati would meet all candidates and office-bearers this week. “Behenji has instructed us to start preparations for all seats in Bihar. Detailed instructions are expected at the meeting in New Delhi on February 28,” Medhkar said. — PTI
