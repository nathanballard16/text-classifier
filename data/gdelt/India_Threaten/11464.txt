Congress-CPI (M) decide on seat adjustment for bypolls in West Bengal

In an attempt to bag the most, the grand old party, Congress and CPI (M) have decided on a seat adjustment formula for the upcoming bypolls in West Bengal in three Assembly segments.

The decision regarding the seat sharing deal was made in a meeting late on Friday. While the CPI (M)-led Left Front will fight Nadia district’s Karimpur seat, Congress will be contesting on North Dinajpur district’s Kaliaganj seat and West Midnapore district’s Kharagpur seat.

Confirming the same, West Bengal Congress President Somen Mitra said, “The Congress will contest two seats and the CPI (M) will fight on one. Our alliance will bring a new dawn in Bengal politics.”

After the demise of sitting Congress MLA Parmathanath Roy, the Kaliaganj seat has remained vacant while Kharagpur’s BJP MLA Dilip Ghosh won the Medinipur Lok Sabha constituency.
