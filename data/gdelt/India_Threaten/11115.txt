High court extends deadline for appointment of OHRC chairman

CUTTACK: Taking into consideration the recent amendment of the Protection of Human Rights Act, the Orissa high court on Monday extended the deadline for the state government to fill up the post of chairman of the Odisha Human Rights Commission OHRC ) to September 23 from August 5.On July 22, the court had set August 5 as the deadline for the state government to fill up the post that has been lying vacant for more than six years now.Expressing concern over the inordinate delay, the court also warned that it would pass an order appointing a chairman if the state government failed to fill up the post by the given deadline.The division bench comprising chief justice K S Jhaveri and justice K R Mohapatra adjourned the case taking note of an affidavit filed by the state government and the state counsel's oral submission about the recent amendment in the Protection of Human Rights Act.Prior to the amendment, a person who had been a chief justice of a high court was only eligible to be chairman of the State Human Rights Commission (SHRC). Now, a former judge of a high court is also eligible for the post.The court had taken up analogous hearing of two PIL petitions filed by two lawyers - Prabir Das and Shivshankar Mohanty.The state government filed an affidavit on Monday, stating that 'necessary process has been initiated for filing up the post of chairperson on a regular basis in the Odisha Human Rights Commission and the matter is under active consideration of the government'.In the affidavit, the law department's deputy secretary, Dileswar Majhi, urged the court 'to allow another one month time to comply with the direction of the court'.The two PIL petitions had pointed out that the post of chairman has remained vacant since November 23, 2012.The OHRC functioned for over four years with only one member officiating as the acting chairman till he retired on August 15, 2018.The commission had no members till Justice Raghubir Dash took over charge as a member on December 24, 2018, following intervention of the high court.As things stand today, Justice Dash has been officiating as the acting chairman since May 16, 2019, as the state government had authorized him to do so without appointing a chairman.
