Karnataka mantri refers to Godhra, gets BSY warning

BENGALURU: Karnataka tourism minister C T Ravi, responding to Congress MLA U T Khader’s statement that the state would burn if the CAA was implemented, warned the minority community not to perceive the “restraint” of the majority as “weakness” and reminded them of the riots of 2002.Both Khader and Ravi had made the statements on Wednesday. On Thursday, two people were killed in police firing in Mangaluru when the protests turned violent. “I’m warning the CM that if you implement it (CAA) here then I swear Karnataka will be blown to cinders,” Khader said.“Our (majority) community restraint should not be perceived as weakness by them (minorities). This mindset was the reason for the burning of kar sevaks in Godhra. Let them (minorities) not forget the incidents which of 2002. They should remember what happens when the majority community becomes violent. If you breach the patience of the majority community, then history is evidence of what will happen,” Ravi had said.The comments led CM B S Yediyurappa to warn party colleagues to “exercise restraint” while commenting on CAA protests
