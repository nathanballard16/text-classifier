Scandal-rocked M S University to discuss back-to-back scams

VADODARA: Interim reports of two probe panels including the acid attack threat and the theft of answer books scandal will be placed before M S University ’s syndicate members on Wednesday. The two back-to-back episodes had kept the varsity in news for the wrong reasons since April end. The agenda for Wednesday’s meeting states that the two reports will be submitted before the syndicate members.While an interim report on the recent answer book scandal has been submitted, that of the acid attack threat is pending. Last month, MSU Students Union (MSUSU) vice-president (VP) had alleged that members of the Pathan Group had threatened her with acid attack. Based on her allegations, members of the group had been arrested. But sources suggest that the committee has not been able to finalize the interim report as neither the MSUSU VP nor the Pathan Group have been able to produce substantial evidence in connection with the allegations. Sources said that some of the Pathan Group members have even claimed that they are even ready to face narco analysis test to prove their innocence and are wrongly framed. Also, the accused student leaders have filed RTIs demanding the university to provide them CCTV footage.The university has decided to withheld results of all students including those involved in the answer books scandal and the acid attack threat till the submission of both interim reports.The meeting will also discuss on the chief guest for the 68th annual convocation for academic year 2019-2020, creating two posts of temporary programme officers at H M Library and appointment of temporary data entry operator or accounts clerks.Report of the committee that carried out inspection of academic, infrastructure and staff facilities at GMERS Gotri Medical College for introducing post-graduate medical programmes in MD anaesthesia, MD pathology and M S ophthalmology and MD psychiatry will also be placed before the syndicate members.
