Modi, KCR exposing each other, says Khuntia

Hyderabad: AICC general secretary in-charge of the State unit of the Congress party R C Khuntia on Saturday said Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have been exposing each other.

Addressing the media, he referred to the Prime Minister stating that astrologers were ruling the state, and the Chief Minister describing surgical strikes as bogus.

They were exposing each other during the campaign, he said. He said that this proved that both were "cheats" and country should be protected from them.

He wondered as to why the Chief Minister has been opposing the Prime Minister while he supported the Centre for five years.

Khuntia said it was clear that the Congress would score a victory in Lok Sabha elections and Rahul Gandhi would become Prime Minister. The Congress government, he said, would launch a surgical strike on poverty.
