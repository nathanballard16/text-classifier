Spotify India: Spotify launches in India amid dispute

Mumbai: Music streaming major Spotify has started rolling out its service in India in a phased manner after a court injunction, filed by Warner Music Company, was denied, the company said. Bombay HC asked Spotify to deposit Rs 6.5 crore while allowing it to launch services in India, according to a report in Times of India. Warner Music had filed an injunction to prevent the Swedish firm from offering songs from its roster of songwriters in the country.On Tuesday, the service was made available in India through Spotify’s web and mobile apps for new and existing users, although new users cannot sign up for premium services as yet.“We’re pleased with the outcome. We’re hopeful for a negotiated solution with Warner,” a Spotify spokesperson said. A Warner Music Group spokesperson, however, told Music Business Worldwide: “For Spotify to claim that the court denied our injunction is a lie”.Warner Music has said that Bombay High Court’s decision is something of a tie for now and that Spotify has not been granted a statutory licence yet. Spotify would compete with Reliance-backed Saavn Gaana , which is owned by Times Internet , a part of the Times Group which publishes this paper, as well as Apple Music and Amazon Music.
