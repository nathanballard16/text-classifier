Reduce fee or we’ll launch a stir from April 1: Parents

Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad wing of All India Parents’ Association (AIPA) has issued an ultimatum of March 31 demanding that schools should comply with the Uttar Pradesh Fee Regulation Act (UPFRA), 2018. But five schools in Ghaziabad have challenged the act in the Allahabad high court and a hearing is pending. With the academic session having drawn to a school, most schools have started distributing booklists for the next class along with report cards. We, however, do not encourage road shows and demonstrations.”Meanwhile, the All Noida School Parents Association (ANSPA) declared on Friday that parents are free to buy books from shops outside schools and the institutions should not ask them to buy books from particular shops. But all schools increased the fee.
