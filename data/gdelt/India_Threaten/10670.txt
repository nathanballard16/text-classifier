Kartik Aaryan says Sara Ali Khan has a heart of gold

Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan are the latest lovebirds in B-town and all eyes are on them. After playing the hide-and-seek game with the media for the longest time, off late, the actors are throwing caution to the wind, with their frequent rendezvous. Few days back Kartik Aaryan was in Lucknow shooting for Pati Patni Aur Woh and his ladylove Sara Ali Khan was by his side in the city. Later the two went to the actress’ Patuadi palace and then the two headed off to the capital for a fashion show. Today the actor has given an interview to a leading daily and has something really sweet to say about Sara.After working with Sara in Imtiaz Ali’s Aaj Kal, the actor said that he thoroughly enjoyed working with her. He said, “Sara is a star and a person with a heart of gold. I thoroughly enjoyed working with her.” The Luka Chuppi actor had something more to talk about the alleged love lady and her great attitude, “She has a certain positive energy that she brings to the screen and I would love to work with her again and again.” Now that’s really heart-warming to read.It was late last year when Sara had confessed her love and crush for Kartik Aaryan on Karan Johar’s chat show Koffee With Karan and later the two were teamed for a film by Imtiaz. The two from not knowing each other to working together and now even allegedly being in love… is stuff Mills & Boons romance is made of. Sara will soon begin shooting with Varun Dhawan in Coolie No. 1 while Kartik will resume shooting for Pati Patni Aur Woh and then start prepping for Dostana 2 and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 2.
