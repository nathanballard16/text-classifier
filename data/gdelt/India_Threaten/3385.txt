Pakistan pledges to release captive Indian fighter pilot

Pakistan's prime minister has pledged his country will release a captured Indian jetfighter pilot, a move that could help defuse the most-serious confrontation in two decades between the nuclear- armed neighbours over the disputed region of Kashmir.

Prime Minister Imran Khan made the announcement in an address to both houses of Parliament on Thursday, saying he tried to reach his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi on Wednesday with a message that he wants to de-escalate tension.

There was no immediate reaction from India, though Modi earlier in the day warned that "India's enemies are conspiring to create instability in the country through terror attacks".

"We are releasing the Indian pilot as a goodwill gesture tomorrow," Khan told lawmakers. He did not say whether the release was conditional.
