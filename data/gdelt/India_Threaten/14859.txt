Manmohan Singh cautions government on economic slowdown

AMN / Mumbai

Former Prime Minister and senior Congress leader Dr Manmohan Singh today alleged that the economy is in a vicious slowdown and asked the Government at Centre to find a credible solution to it.

Speaking during a talk on the current scenario of the Indian economy organized by the Mumbai Regional Congress Committee (MRCC) in Mumbai, Dr. Singh admitted that there were some weaknesses with the United Progressive Alliance Government, adding that the present regime, which is in power for more than five years now, should have learnt from those mistakes and provided credible solutions.

Cautioning the government, Dr Singh said that in order to reverse the slowdown, the government should see to it that import-export policy do not affect the farmers, adding that care should be taken to see that imports from abroad do not eat into the country’s economy.

Reacting to a question on abrogation of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu & Kashmir, Dr Singh said, Congress believes that article 370 was a temporary measure. The party did not oppose enactment of the law to abrogate Article 370, but the way in which it was implemented. He also appealed the government to address the grievances of the beleaguered Punjab and Maharashtra Cooperative bank.
