Rajasthan to shunt babus with 'Sangh affinity'

The Ashok Gehlot-led Congress government in Rajasthan may soon crack the whip on its employees who are 'wedded to RSS-BJP ideology'. The government, sources say, is in the process of identifying such employees with an intention to transfer them to locations or posts that are not that significant. The move comes in the wake of the crushing defeat the ruling party suffered at the hands of BJP in the recent Lok Sabha polls.



According to the proponents of the move, the Gehlot government has not been able to function effectively after the setback in LS polls. MLAs and members of the Pradesh Congress Committee (PCC) too have requested the CM to transfer top officers appointed by the previous government, "as they are attached to the RSS ideology".



"Keeping in mind the panchayat, municipal elections in Jaipur, many MLAs have requested the CM to keep 'RSS-minded' officers away from high positions," said Rupesh Kant Vyas, state Congress general secretary. Vyas also said this has been done to "maintain the integrity of the party and keep the party strong".



Meanwhile, CM Gehlot has devised a new strategy in dealing with the transfers and has directed the officials concerned accordingly. "The demand by the MLAs and PCC members is important," the CM said, warning strict action against officers who are not working according to the Congress manifesto.



The BJP has come down heavily on the government's plan to "segregate" its officials. "An officer should be judged not on the basis of his/her ideologym but on the basis of his/her performance," said BJP MLA Ramlal Sharma.
