RIL’s movie plan may spoil the show for malls, food joints

NEW DELHI: Malls and restaurant owners have said they are wary of diversified conglomerate’ “first-day first-show” movies plan announced on Monday by chairman Mukesh Ambani, which they said could have a spiralling impact on the mall economy and may jeopardise revenue streams.“We expect the first-day firstshow movies plan would impact business at food courts by about 10%,” said Sameer Lamba, director at Kwal’s Group, which operates the food court in Gurgaon’s DLF Mega Mall.RIL announced at its 42nd annual general meeting on Monday that its first-day first-show movies service will be launched mid-2020 for its premium Jio Gigafiber customers.“This (Reliance’s plan) will have some impact on the shelf life of the movie as well as the number of people coming to multiplexes and malls,” said Rajneesh Mahajan, CEO of InOrbits Malls, which operates malls in Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Vadodara.“As a mall developer, we cannot control the external environment. The impact will depend on what pricing Reliance offers, and the kind of movies they get rights to show first day,” Mahajan said.Restaurant companies, which are engaged in a battle of sorts with food aggregators over steep discounting and cloud kitchens, too expressed caution.“With almost half of our restaurants located inside malls, we have witnessed a spike in sales around big releases. With multiple shows a day across hundreds of multiplexes, malls are reaping the benefits of high footfall,” said Samir Menon, MD of KFC India, which has a national restaurant footprint of 400 outlets across hundred plus cities.
