Water supply in 3 key river basins dips

NEW DELHI: In the last 26 years, there has been a marginal increase in India’s average annual water resource from 1,869 billion cubic metres (BCM) in 1993 to 1,999 BCM in 2019, but there is a worrying decline in water availability in three key river basins of Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra.A new scientific study by the central water commission (CWC) concludes that India is not a water-deficit country but several regions face scarcity due to “severe neglect” of water resources and their storage and conservation.The small increase in annual water resources is more due to use of advanced methodology in slightly bigger catchment areas. While the three major river basins show a decline, the other 17 saw an increase. Unlike other river basins that depend on rainfall for annual water resources, the three big systems — located in north India — are fed by Himalayan glaciers as well, raising the concern that their decline may be linked to climate change-induced conditions in the Himalayas Figures in the study, ‘Reassessment of Water Availability in India Using Space Inputs’, show that the Indus river basin (the part lying in India) reported the highest fall. The average water potential of this northernmost basin fell almost 40% from 73 BCM in 1993 to 45 BCM.The river basins that reported increase in water availability include Narmada, Godavari, Krishna, Cauvery, Mahanadi, Pennar, Sabarmati, Mahi and Subarnarekha among others. This is reassuring news for southern states that often face severe water scarcities but highlight the need for better conservation and use.The study released by the government on Wednesday was conducted by CWC in collaboration with ISRO’s National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad. It used various input datasets like hydro-meteorological (rainfall) data for a 30-year period (1985-2015), soil texture and land use data from 2004-05 to 2014-15.The study also shows how a rising population and mismanagement of water resources has reduced the annual per capita availability of water substantially from 5,178 cubic metre in 1951 to 1,651 cubic metre in 2011, pushing the country into a water-stressed situation despite increase in annual average water potential.Though another study done by the National Commission for Integrated Water Resource Development also shows increase in average water availability (1,953 BCM in 1999), the latest research is considered the most reliable.The CWC study in its conclusion warns that business as usual way of water utilisation would push the country towards a critical phase.
