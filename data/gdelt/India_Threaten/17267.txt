In pictures: Assam erupts in protest against Citizenship Bill

Rajya Sabha approved Citizenship (Amendment) Bill on Wednesday granting citizenship to non-Muslims who migrated illegally from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Critics of the government said the legislation undermines the country's secular constitution, as protests against the law intensified in some parts of the country. Protesters say they oppose the legislation out of concern that migrants who came to the country illegally will move to the border region in the northeast and dilute the culture and political sway of indigenous tribal people.
