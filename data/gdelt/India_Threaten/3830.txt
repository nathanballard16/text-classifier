Maratha Kranti Morcha warns BJP-Shiv Sena of negative campaign over quota issue

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Mar 6 (ANI): Some sections of Maratha Kranti Morcha (MKM) on Wednesday warned the BJP-Shiv Sena government of negative campaigning over the issue of Maratha reservation during the coming polls.

MKM had called a meeting here to discuss strategies over the Maratha reservation, during which a few leaders of the outfit accused the government of doing nothing on the ground in this regard.

Mahesh Dongre, convenor, MKM, said: “We have been cheated. The government has not done anything on the ground till now. They had announced a mega teacher's recruitment but in that too there was no reservation s for us.”

“Moreover, the government jobs must be given to us under the Socially and Educationally Backward Class Category (SEBC),” he said.

Nana Saheb Jawale Patil, another member of MKM, said the government is using the community for elections. He said that they will put up five lakh hoardings and distribute five crore pamphlets all over the state through which they will request the Marathas not to vote for BJP-Shiv Sena government.

“The government is using us. A delegation had met Uddhav Thackeray after the hunger strike. He insulted us, saying that if you are warning me, then you won't be able to do anything. You decide if you want to vote for me or not. So, we have decided at the time of elections we will show our strength,” said Patil. (ANI)
