Veiled nuclear war threat reminder of India's thirst for violence, says FM Qureshi

Another damning reminder of India’s unbridled thirst for violence. Contrast to Pakistan’s aggressive efforts to galvanise diplomacy as UNSC met for 1st time formally since ‘65 on IOK validating International dispute status.History reminds fascist warmongering state can never win. pic.twitter.com/YY9vFdjtCp

Pokhran is the area which witnessed Atal Ji’s firm resolve to make India a nuclear power and yet remain firmly committed to the doctrine of ‘No First Use’. India has strictly adhered to this doctrine. What happens in future depends on the circumstances.

Foreign Minister (FM) Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Saturday said that New Delhi's threat of a nuclear war in the region is another damning reminder of its ‘unbridled thirst for violence.’On Friday, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh made an indirect threat of nuclear conflict, which showed Narendra Modi’s growing frustration at his ill-conceived move to strip Occupied Kashmir of its autonomy on August 5.Though Singh didn’t name any country, it is understood the threat was directed at Pakistan.“Pokhran is the area which witnessed Atal Ji’s firm resolve to make India a nuclear power and yet remain firmly committed to the doctrine of ‘No First Use’,” Singh tweeted.In response, Qureshi termed Indian defence minister’s statement on the possible change in “No First Use” policy of nuclear weapons “highly irresponsible.”“The substance and timing of the Indian defence minister’s statement is highly unfortunate and reflective of India’s irresponsible and belligerent behavior,” said Qureshi , “It further exposes the pretense of their no first-use policy to which we have never accorded any credence,” he read out Pakistan’s official statement on the issue.”He further said that, no first use pledge is non-verifiable and cannot be taken at face value, especially when the development of offensive capabilities and force postures belie such claims.“Pakistan has always proposed measures relating to nuclear restraint in South Asia and has eschewed measures that are offensive in nature. Pakistan will continue to maintain a credible minimum deterrence posture,” he added.Prime Minister Imran Khan has also warned the international community of “severe repercussions and reactions” if they “silently witness another Srebrenica-type massacre & ethnic cleansing of Muslims in IOK”.“If war breaks out in the region, the world powers and international bodies will be responsible as they have failed to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir,” the premier wrote on Twitter on Thursday.Pakistan has told the international community umpteen times that the festering Kashmir dispute between Islamabad and New Delhi remains a nuclear flashpoint in the South Asian region.Premier Imran has repeatedly said that Pakistan doesn’t want war in the region as military confrontation between the two nuclear-tipped hostile neighbours would spiral out of control and the result would be apocalyptic not just for the region but the whole world.
