Second haul of pangolin scales seized

Yet another massive haul of pangolin scales worth more than $50 million was confiscated by local authorities on Monday, the second in less than a week.

The sheer size of these unprecedented seizures points to industrial-scale sourcing, processing and distribution by criminal syndicates, say experts, who are calling for international investigations to nab the culprits. About 12.7 tonnes of the animal parts were seized from a 40ft container that was en route from Nigeria to Vietnam.

This came a mere five days after a record 12.9 tonnes of pangolin scales were seized by the authorities here last Wednesday.

The seizure of pangolin scales last week was likely the largest single seizure of its kind the world has seen - surpassing the 11.9 tonnes seized in Shenzhen, China, in 2017.

The haul on Monday came from two species, the white-bellied tree pangolin (Phataginus tricuspis) and the giant ground pangolin (Smutsia gigantea), and is likely to have come from 21,000 pangolins.

The container was declared to contain "cassia seeds" but was found to be holding the animal parts estimated to be worth about $51.6 million, in 474 bags, at the Pasir Panjang Scanning Station.

The combined 25.6 tonnes seized in the two hauls this month were about 58 times the combined weight of the first two pangolin scale shipments intercepted in Singapore in 2015 and 2016, which amounted to about 0.44 tonnes, or 440kg.

The scales of the pangolin are in high demand in Asia for use in traditional Chinese medicine, despite there being no proven medicinal benefit from their use.
