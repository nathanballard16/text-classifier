'Kashmir: The Story' -- After 1971 defeat, Pakistan started propping up Islamist movements in Kashmir

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi

The 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War was Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s finest hour. Not only did India’s military inflict a humiliating defeat on Pakistan, but it split Pakistan into two. There was a new dawn in the East – Bangladesh was born. The theatre of war extended to both sides of India’s border with the then West and East Pakistan.

The Simla Agreement that followed gave hope to Indian officials that a chastened Pakistan would now work towards normalising relations with India.

Unfortunately, that was not the case. The Pakistani military leadership vowed revenge on India through unconventional means. By the end of the 1970s, unrest in India's Punjab increased and the ISI started propping up Islamist parties in Kashmir, which would eventually trigger the full-blown militancy that exploded in the Valley in 1989-90.

The 1971 war and its aftermath were covered in this episode of Times Now's docu-series 'Kashmir: The Story':
