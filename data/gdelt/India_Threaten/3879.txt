Siraj critical of NGOs’ role in society

LAHORE : Jamaat-e-Islami Ameer Senator Sirajul Haq has lamented that western-funded NGOs are carrying out a heinous conspiracy to destroy the Islamic family values by luring Muslim women to give up veil and scarf.

For guarding geographical boundaries of the country, its ideological boundaries must be guarded first since Pakistan is an ideological state, he said while addressing a women’s conference organised by JI Women Wing on Wednesday in connection with International Women’s Day.

He warned that the mental slaves of East India Company were out to deprive Pakistan of its ideological identity, and during their rule over the last 71 years they did not implement Islam for a single day in the country which led to its dismemberment in 1971.

Sirajul Haq warned the elements working against Islamic family values to enforce secular values, and said such kind of people were not the well wishers of the country but working against its very foundations. He said for that the last seven decades, only faces changed but the same class of western slaves representing the capitalist and feudal class had ruled the country. He lamented the present government was also the continuity of the previous regimes. He said the present rulers made glittering slogans for seeking votes but never implemented even a single one, and only multiplied the price hike in seven months’ rule. He said Islam is the biggest protector of woman rights while the western secular system had only exploited the women under attractive slogans of freedom, equality and democracy, using them as cheap industrial workers by forcing them out of the security of homes into the market places. Mentioning the veteran leader Aasia Andrabi whose husband has been jailed for 31 years in India, the JI chief praised the women of Indian-Occupied Kashmir for sacrificing in freedom struggle.
