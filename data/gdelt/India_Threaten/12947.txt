Pakistan Surreptitiously Releases Masood Azhar From Custody Amid Tensions With India Over Kashmir: Sources

Ties between India and Pakistan nose-dived after abrogation of Article 370 which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan has violated the ceasefire multiple times since then and has attempted several infiltration bids in India. The country’s Prime Minister had also issued nuclear threat to India after PM Modi rejected third party mediation, in a meeting with US President Donald Trump.

: Amid tensions with India over its decision to abrogate Article 370 in the Kashmir Valley, Pakistan has secretly released the UN-designated terrorist and Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar from protective custody for terror operations, sources said on Monday. Soon after his clandestine release, Azhar issued guidelines for the JeM terrorists asking them to steer clear of stone-pelting and demonstrations. The terrorists have been asked to target security personnel and snatch their weapons. They have been asked be very cautious about their identities and have been advised to keep it hidden. They have also been asked to avoid contacting each other through messages or phone calls, in case the internet is closed. Azhar has asked them for man-to-man contact in case of emergence and has advised them to keep changing their locations. Also, an alert has been issued about the deployment of large number of troops by Pakistan along the Sialkot border. Pakistan is planning a “major action” in Sialkot-Jammu and Rajasthan sectors in the coming days, which is why the term of Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa has been extended by three years, sources said.
