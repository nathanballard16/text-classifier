CJI Ranjan Gogoi will visit J&K if judiciary is affected by restrictions

New Delhi: Supreme Court Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi said Monday he would personally visit Jammu and Kashmir, if required, after a petitioner said people there were not able to access courts for legal redressal of their grievances.

The top court also wanted the Jammu and Kashmir High Court to give a status report on the legal situation in J&K, where restrictions continue since August 4.

“If required, I will go and personally check. I will speak to the Chief Justice (of J&K High Court) today,” Ranjan Gogoi said. He was responding when senior advocate Huzefa Ahmadi claimed that there are extreme difficulties in accessing the High Court in the Valley.

The advocate was arguing for child rights activists Enakshi Ganguly and Shanta Sinha, who moved the apex court through a petition challenging the alleged ‘illegal detention’ of children in Jammu and Kashmir following abolition of its special status.

The top court observed that it is a serious concern if people are facing issues to access justice.

“You have made a statement that you cannot move the Jammu and Kashmir High Court. Is anybody coming in the way… Not being allowed to access the High Court is a serious concern,” said the Chief Justice.

Ranjan Gogoi also warned the lawyer that if the information placed before the apex court was found to be incorrect, then he would face consequences.

Meanwhile, the Central government told the top court that restrictions have been eased in most parts of Jammu and Kashmir and Jammu and Kashmir High Court and lower courts are operating normally.

Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Jammu and Kashmir Code of Criminal Procedure have been relaxed in 88.57 per cent police stations of the Kashmir Division and 100 per cent in the Jammu and Ladakh divisions.
