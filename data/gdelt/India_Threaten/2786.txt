Finally, Cong acknowledges surgical strikes, says Jaitley

NEW DELHI: A day after Congress asked Lt Gen D S Hooda, who was northern army chief during the surgical strikes , to head a national security task force, finance minister Aun Jaitley said the decision reflects a belated and grudging acknowledgement of the action against terror launch-pads across the Line of Control.Jaitley reminded Congress of its statements doubting veracity of the strikes and claims that these were not much more than actions carried out during the UPA tenure. He said queries over the Army action complemented Rahul Gandhi ’s show of solidarity in JNU in the wake of the secessionist sloganeering praising Parliament attack convict Afzal Guru.The minister took a dig at Congress acknowledging Gen Hooda as an experienced and distinguished former officer, and said he could certainly deliver some overdue lessons to the main opposition. “I have not the least doubt that he would give a very valuable advice to the grand old Party... However, it is intriguing that the party which ruled India for half a decade needs to be educated on national security issues.”In a blog, the minister said, “I am sure the head of the advisory panel would educate the party leaders that the surgical strikes were no routine step which had been taken several times in the past, but a significant first for India.”
