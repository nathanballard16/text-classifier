DNA Exclusive: Congress- AAP reach deal in Delhi, may extend to other states

Putting lid to all speculations about whether Congress and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) will fight together in Delhi, sources have told DNA that both parties will contest on three seats each. One seat will be given to former Union Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha, who in the last few years have become a vocal critic of the Narendra Modi government. He is likely to contest as an independent candidate.

Sources said AAP will contest on South, East and North East constituencies. The party has also finalised the candidates— Dilip Pandey, Atishi Marlena and Raghav Chadha. Congress will fight it out in West, North West and Chandni Chowk, sources added.

Both parties, said sources, are also finalising a seat-sharing deal in three other states for Lok Sabha polls – Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab.
