Six men convicted of the rape and murder of an 8-year-old girl in India

Pathankot, India: An Indian court has convicted six men of involvement in the rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in India's Jammu and Kashmir state last year, a prosecution lawyer has said.

The case sparked outrage and criticism of the country's ruling BJP party after some of its members opposed charges being laid.

The girl, from a nomadic Muslim community that roams the forests of Kashmir, was grazing her family's ponies in the forests of the Himalayan foothills when she was drugged, held captive in a temple and sexually assaulted for a week before being strangled and battered to death with a stone in January 2018.

The abduction, rape and killing of the child was part of a plan to remove the minority nomadic community from the area, the 15-page charge sheet said.
