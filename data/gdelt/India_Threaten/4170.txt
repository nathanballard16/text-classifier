Can’t use Sabarimala to seek votes: SEC

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The SEC on Monday warned political parties in Kerala not to use the Sabarimala temple matter as a campaign issue, drawing a sharp reaction from BJP, which termed the directive “illogical”.Kerala chief electoral officer Teeka Ram Meena said “citing or invoking” religious propaganda on the “Sabarimala issue” would be a clear violation of the model code. He, however, said that a meeting of all political parties to discuss various issues connected with elections will be convened on Tuesday before a formal stand is taken on the Sabarimala issue.Saying that political parties “need to draw a line to what extent they have to use it (the Sabarimala issue)”, Meena added that, “I will be requesting them not to unnecessarily use this religious feeling or religious traditions to solicit votes as this may create religious tensions among people. If that happens, action will be taken against those responsible.”“Inviting religious feelings, using any kind of Supreme Court judgment, invoking or soliciting the votes in the name of religion or by inciting religious feelings is a clear violation of the model code of conduct,” he said.Reacting to the directive, BJP state general secretary K Surendran said the stand taken by the state government on Sabarimala issue would be an election issue. “It is 100% that the stand taken by the (state) government on the Sabarimala issue will be discussed in elections. No one can interfere in it... It is illogical to say that the Sabarimala issue should not be discussed in the election,” he said.
