The creation of CDS, which will be single-point military adviser, was suggested by Kargil Review Committee in 1999. Along with CDS, Department of Military Affairs under Ministry of Defence will also be created.

The CCS also approved the report of a high-level committee, headed by National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, which finalised responsibilities and the enabling framework for the CDS, they said.

In a landmark military reform, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on August 15 announced that India will have a CDS as head of the tri-services.

Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi during his speech from the ramparts of Red Fort had announced that the government was mulling over the landmark military reform. Days after the prime minister’s announcement, an Implementation Committee headed by Doval was appointed to finalise an enabling framework and determine the exact responsibilities for the CDS.
