GHMC Swindled Crores In Road Projects?

Hyderabad: There have been reports of GHMC’s transport and tariff (T&T) wing, swindling over Rs 20 crores in purchase of cat's eye and road studs that have never been used, according to a report in a local daily.

Over 20 lakh pavement blinkers costing about Rs 245 each have been purchased by the civic body. Fake bills for replacing over 8 lakh blinkers annually were produced. Not many blinkers have been replaced and many previous laid blinkers are being buried under surfaces of unscientific road laying.

The Indian Road Congress (IRC) states that Blinkers have to be laid on both sides of the roads to caution drivers and riders of the width of the roads. There need to be blinkered every 17 meters each on both sides. Due to the negligence of the authorities, blinkers have been placed every 2 metres on both sides of the road and through the centre, for a stretch of over 600km of road length.

A source of high authority has said that not many blinkers have been replaced since 2006, but official records show that 8 lakh road studs were replaced. The road studs have stopped working on most parts of the roads.

A GHMC official commented saying that an internal inquiry will be constructed and the officials found guilty will be charged with a criminal case.
