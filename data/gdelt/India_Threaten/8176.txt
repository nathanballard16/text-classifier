Jaipur, June 2

A letter threatening to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi was received by the BJP office here a few days before the swearing-in ceremony of the new government in New Delhi on May 30, which the police say may be an act of "mischief".

The letter was written to Rajasthan BJP president Madan Lal Saini.

“The handwritten letter in Hindi by one Rajesh and his four colleagues landed in an envelope by post at the BJP office here before May 30,” Saini told The Tribune on Sunday.

“We will shoot him in his chest on the day of oath ceremony on May 30...,” Saini, quoting the letter, said.

“The party has handed over this letter to the Ashok Nagar thana in-charge for investigation, after the day of ceremony”, he said.

When contacted, DCP South Yogesh Dadhich said the letter was posted from GPO Jaipur, and all the signatories of Jaipur were traced and interrogated but it was found that none of them had written such a letter.

“It appears to be a case of mischief,” the DCP added.

Central IB has taken up the matter for further investigation, the DCP added.

The Rajasthan Police Headquarters and IB officials were not divulging any further information on this matter.
