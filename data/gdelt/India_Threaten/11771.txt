Modi praises India's actions in Kashmir on independence day

New Delhi (CNN) Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi defended his government's decision to revoke the special status given to Jammu and Kashmir state, saying he was proud that "'one nation, one constitution' has become a reality."

Speaking Thursday morning from the ramparts of the historic Red Fort in the capital New Delhi to mark India's independence from British colonial rule, Modi lauded the controversial decision to reorganize the disputed Kashmir region and strip the state of its semi-autonomous status.

"The old arrangement in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh encouraged corruption, nepotism but there was injustice when it came to rights of women, children, Dalits, tribal communities," said Modi.

"The rights and responsibilities of every citizen in the country have become equal," he added.

Modi's comments come as Kashmir remains under a tight security lockdown and total communications blackout. The repressive measures, in place since August 5, were introduced just days before the Indian government announced that it was withdrawing Article 370 of the country's constitution, reclassifying Jammu and Kashmir's administrative status from a state to a union territory.
