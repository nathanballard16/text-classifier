Temples on alert after bomb scare

The Swaminarayan temple in Dhule district of Maharashtra received a letter threatening a bomb blast late on Saturday. Intelligence agencies, on alert after the recent Naxal attack in Gadchiroli and the Sri Lankan church attacks during Easter, received similar inputs about religious sites in Dhule, Nashik and Pune and have intensified monitoring.



The Swaminarayan temple at Deopur, Dhule, received a letter written in Hindi stating that the temple will be blown to pieces. The letter had been dropped inside the post box on the temple premises. Temple authorities alerted Dhule police who collected the letters and are now investigating about the sender of the letters.



An Intelligence Bureau (IB) officer said, “The threat letter was sent to the Swaminarayan temple in Dhule and there is terror threat for religious sites in Pune and Nashik too. There are some temples in Pune that are on the radar for terror strikes and as per our information the Pune police have already intensified their security. The temples in busy and crowded areas are more susceptible to terror strikes and this has been conveyed.”



The IB also stated that last week the Bengaluru police arrested one for allegedly spreading terror by sending letters warning of bomb blasts at Bengaluru and Pune railway station. The accused who is in custody of Bengaluru police is being interrogated by various agencies whether he had sent the letter to threaten authorities or has links with any groups.



Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham said, “I need to discuss about the input with officers and look at the security set-up.”



Pune police said that they are on the alert. The security at the religious places in Pune; Dagdusheth Ganapati temple, Sarasbaug temple, Kasba peth Ganapti, Parvati temple have been intensified while other temples are on close watch of police and intel agencies.
