We will fight, will go to court: Farooq Abdullah on Art370 - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI: Comparing the revocation of Article 370 by the Centre as “body being carved”, National Conference chief Farooq Abdullah on Tuesday said they will fight and go to court against the Modi government’s decision.

In his first remarks since the Union Government on Monday revoked provisions of Article 370 to take away State’s special status, and proposed its bifurcation into the Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh, Abdullah said a “dictatorial” authority has been invoked and not a “democratic” one.
