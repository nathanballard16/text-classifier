Seven Airunions have written a fresh letter to Prime Ministerto save the national carrier and urged him to consider running it with a professional management which can make it a profitable carrier.Referring to Civil Aviation Minister's statement thatwill be divested 100 per cent and hinting at its closure if privatisation fails, the unions pointed out that 21 airlines have shut down since 1992 and the government should ensure that Air India does not meet this fate."We urge the Government of India to consider waving off the credits and have the airline run by professional management. We have immense faith, that taking these actions will indeed find Air India in the league of profit making carriers, once again," the letter said.The unions pointed out that Air India has been turning in operational profits in last three financial years but servicing loans which have an outgo of Rs 4000 crore annually is proving to be challenging for the carrier."Air India can be turned around and run successfully in the hands of professionals if the government intends for it to. It is up to you, Honorable Prime Minister, to decide the fate of Air India, and consequently the course of its history. We hope that you will protect the honor of our national carrier and grant Air India many more years of making history," said the letter signed by Indian Commercial Pilots Association, All India Cabin Crew Association, Indian Pilot:s Guild, Indian Aircraft Technicians' Asssociation, Air India Employees' Union and Air Corporation Employees' Union.The NDA government has set a March 31, 2020 deadline for privatising Air India and a four member Group of Ministers led by Home Minister Amit Shah has been spearheading the panel which will finalise the terms and conditions for the sale.
