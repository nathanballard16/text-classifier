BJP has been trying to destabilise the government. Their agenda has been that there should not be a stable government."Rao said he would speak to Singh and try to convince him but in the event nothing works out, he would leave it to him.He alleged that the Centre had been misusing its authority by letting loose central agencies on opposition leaders."BJP leaders are blackmailing and threatening some people to create chaos.
