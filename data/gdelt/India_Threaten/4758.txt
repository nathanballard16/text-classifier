Delhi Police acting as Modi Police, decision to cancel venue for CM rally politically biased: AAP

Aam Aadmi Party has rejected the claims of Delhi Police that it merely changed the venue of Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's public meeting at Shakur Basti on Saturday.

"It's completely false. First, police cancelled the original public meeting venue for no reason. Our team kept pleading with the District Magistrate till late Sunday evening, but when nothing happened the party was forced to cancel this meeting," AAP said in a statement.

Terming the decision of Delhi Police as politically biased, the party has warned of registering a 'strong protest' before the Election Commission of India against the decision of "Modi Police."

"It is only after the CM's tweet today that as a face-saver the Delhi Police said it has allowed an alternate venue today afternoon. It is a farce and the Delhi Police are only trying to cover-up its politically biased decision after the AAP exposed it," the statement said.

Earlier in the day, Chief Minister Kejriwal tweeted: "BJP gets my public rally cancelled today through police. Police denies permission. How many BJP rallies were denied permission by police in Delhi in last 5 yrs?"

The Chief Minister further asked the BJP to concede that they were losing all the seven seats in New Delhi.

"Accept that you (BJP) are losing all the seven seats in New Delhi. Modi did not fulfill the promise to grant full statehood to Delhi. Now, people will teach a lesson," Kejriwal said in the tweet.

The Lok Sabha for all seven seats in Delhi is scheduled to be held in a single phase on May 12. The results of the election will be declared on May 23.
