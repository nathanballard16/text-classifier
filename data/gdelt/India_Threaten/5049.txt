While nation lauding our forces, oppn busy undermining them: PM

KORAPUT: Chowkidar Sajag Aachi (chowkidar is alert), Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the crowd in Odia, while launching the BJP ’s election campaign from Jeypore, in tribal-dominated Koraput district of Odisha, on Friday. Slamming his critics for belittling the achievements of the Indian Air Force, the the Prime Minister added, “While Pakistan is still counting bodies even after a month since the Balakot air strike, the opposition is busy questioning the forces.”“The entire nation is proud of our forces and scientists, but our opposition is reluctant to acknowledge their achievements. Day and night they are engaged in undermining the achievements of our forces,” he said.Stating that this is a new and confident India where the right decision is taken at the right time, the Prime Minister asked the crowd whether they want a majboot (strong) government or a majboor (crippled) government.“You should vote for a majboot government who can kill enemies at their homes and not a majboor government, who takes 10 minutes to walk 10 steps. The present India has the ability to protect its water, land and even space,” Modi said to a thunderous applause.Citing the example of the anti-satellite missile, dubbed Mission Shakti, which was launched from a defence base off the Odisha coast on Wednesday, Modi said it has demonstrated India’s power to the world and what we are capable of. “But such achievements are appearing to be very difficult to digest for the oppositions,” he quipped.Modi was also critical of the Naveen Patnaik government in Odisha. “Even after ruling the state for 19 years, the BJD government has neither managed to tackle the Maoist problem nor been able to effectively pull out the state from poverty.”Urging the people to vote for the BJP’s candidates in both the assembly and Lok Sabha elections , the Prime Minister said Odisha development will come to Odisha only when there are BJP governments at the Centre and state.“A double engine government is required for Odisha’s development. We want the BJP government at the Centre and state to strengthen Odisha,” said Modi who was greeted by Padma Shri Kamala Pujari on the dais.Trying to woo the tribal voters, Modi said it is his government which increased the Centre’s budget for tribal welfare by 30 percent and has increased the minimum support price (MSP) of forest produce at least three times in the past five years.While only 10 forest products were enjoying the benefits of MSP, it was enhanced to 50 items to boost the tribal economy, Modi said.“My government also created the district mineral fund (DMF) under which one percent from mining revenue will be spent on the development of tribals of the concerned region. In the past five years the state government received Rs 6,500 crore under the DMF, but owing to its inefficiency it has spent only Rs 1,000 crore till date,” Modi said, while accusing the BJD government of doing little for the development of the tribals.He was also critical of the state government for not allowing the Centre’s Ayushman Bharat healthcare scheme. “I want to ask you, should you not punish this government?” Modi asked, adding, “People involved in chit fund scam and protecting the mining mafias will never strengthen Odisha.”Listing out the work done by his government for Odisha, the Prime Minister said in the past five years eight lakh families have been provided houses under the PM Awas Yojana, 40 lakh families with LPG connections under Ujjawala scheme, 3,000 villages have been electrified and 24 lakh families are getting free power supply. Earlier, the Prime Minister paid floral tribute to tribal freedom fighter Laxman Nayak.
