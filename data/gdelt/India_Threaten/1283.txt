Fear of defeat has made BJP jittery

New Delhi: Following its defeat in 5 states and keeping in view the rising popularity of Rahul Gandhi and recent survey results, BJP has indulged in polarisation. Priyanka’s entry into active politics has made BJP more jittery. Now it has no way left but the play Hindutva card. This is exposed by the statements of Amit Shah, Anant Hegde, Giri Raj Singh, Sadhvi Rithambara etc. who have indulged into hate politics.

Union minister Ananth Kumar Hegde, known for his inflammatory statements, made yet another controversial remark saying “the hand that touches a Hindu woman must not exist”. Saying that history had been distorted to claim that the Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his wife Mumtaz Mahal, Hegde claimed that Taj Mahal was actually a Shiva temple called Tejo Mahalaya.

Hegde warned that if Hindus continued to sleep then even their houses would be renamed as “Manzil”. He added, “If this continues in the coming days, Lord Ram will become Jahanpanah and Sita will become bibi.”
