New Delhi: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday asked party members to fight for the Constitution besides people of the country irrespective of the “color of their skin or belief”.

Addressing the Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) meeting, he thanked the voters and Congress workers.

“Every Congress member must remember that each one of you is fighting for the Constitution, for every person in India irrespective of the color of his skin or belief,” he said while calling for introspection.

Meanwhile, Sonia Gandhi was elected as the chairperson of Congress Parliamentary Party (CPP) at Parliament Annexe on Saturday morning after former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recommended her name.

The meeting was presided over by United Progressive Alliance chairperson Sonia Gandhi and attended by all 52 newly-elected MPs.

After being elected as the leader of the CPP, Sonia said, "We thank the 12.13 crore voters for reposing faith in the Congress Party."

Rahul also extended his good wished to his mother and tweeted: "Congratulations to Smt Sonia Gandhi on being elected Leader of the Congress Parliamentary Party. Under her leadership, the Congress will prove to be a strong & effective opposition party, that will fight to defend the Constitution of India."

This was Rahul’s first official meeting with Congress leaders since the Congress Working Committee meeting on May 25, when he announced that he would not continue as president in the lieu of humiliating debacle in the Lok Sabha elections. However, the decision-making body of the party rejected his decision and asked him not to quit as Congress chief.
