KCR Resorting To Politics of Murder, Alleges Bandi Sanjay

Hyderabad: Accusing Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao of resorting to politics of murder, newly elected BJP MP from Karimnagar Bandi Sanjay observed that TRS was unable to come to terms with the fact that BJP was becoming an alternative political force in the State to take on the ruling party.

Sanjay's comments come close on the heels of BJP worker Prem Kumar who was murdered in Devarakadra village in Narayanapet district on Tuesday. He alleged that TRS top leadership was involved in Prem Kumar's murder, besides plotting to kill three others.

The Karimnagar MP alleged that KCR was bringing in a political culture of violence like his counterparts Mamata Banaerjee in West Bengal and Pinarayi Vijayan in Kerala and Uttar Pradesh former chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. He warned BJP workers in the State to be vigiliant as there would be more such attacks against them.

Sanjay demanded the investigation agencies to carryout a thorough probe into Prem Kumar's murder and bring the killers to book. He said KCR would also meet the same fate as Mamata Banerjee and Akhilesh Yadav in the days to come. He appealed to BJP workers not to be demoralised and exhorted them to build people's movement against the excesses of the ruling TRS.
