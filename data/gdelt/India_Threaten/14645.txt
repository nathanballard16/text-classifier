CHENNAI: A couple of hours before Xi Jinping landed in Chennai on Friday for the informal summit with PM Narendra Modi, police detained 12 Tibetans for trying to stage protests at the airport and near the Chinese president’s hotel.

A group of 250 Chinese nationals had also gathered outside the hotel to greet their leader. Six Tibetans were picked up after they mingled with the media and the public crowding outside Grand Chola, where Xi is staying, and raised slogans around noon.

An hour later, police at the airport detained a group of six Tibetans who had just flown in from Bangalore on suspicion that they were planning to stage a protest. Earlier, on Thursday night, Pema Ngodup, a Tibetan journalist with the Washington-based Radio Free Asia — who said he had come to cover the summit — was detained by police for not carrying valid ID.

Earlier this week, Chennai police arrested Tenzin Tsundue, a Tibetan activist and writer, as well as nine other activists. The arrests came after central intelligence agencies alerted Chennai police about possible protests by the outfits Tibetan Youth Congress and Students for Free Tibet-India.

Among those travelling to Chennai are also some 250 Chinese nationals living in different parts of the country who wanted to catch a glimpse of Xi. Hu Shu, a banker in Bengaluru, sought to stress the positives such summits can achieve. “The need of the hour is to resolve conflict between the two countries. There are several Chinese working here and vice versa. We hope the outcome is in everybody’s best interests. It would make us all happy,” he said.
