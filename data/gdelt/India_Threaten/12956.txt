Pakistan secretly releases JeM chief Masood Azhar to plan action against India says IB

New Delhi: The Pakistan government’s promises about tackling terror and arresting terrorists have gone up in smoke, after it secretly released Masood Azhar from prison, Sunday. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) has warned the government against this new development in the neighbouring country.

It has said that the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief has been released only to plan something big against India. Masood Azhar has already been designated a ‘terrorist’ by India as he is the mastermind of the Pulwama terror attack.

The IB has asked the government to deploy more soldiers on the Indo-Pak border near Rajasthan as they suspect Pakistan of planning a terrorist attack. The report has also claimed that Pakistan is deploying addition troops near the Rajasthan border as part of the plan.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had Friday threatened India against revoking of Article 370 that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir and bifurcating it into Union Territories. The threat by the Pakistan Prime Minister, who had last week made a statement on the risk of India-Pakistan war, came on a day Pakistani army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa said they were prepared to ‘go till any extent’ on the Kashmir issue.

According to the input provided by the IB, Pakistan is planning ‘big action’ in Sialkot-Jammu and Rajasthan sectors. Masood Azhar is not the only person who has been asked to plan ‘some action’, other terrorist groups have also been asked to ‘disturb’ India.

An IB official has been quoted as saying by a website that Pakistan’s intelligence agency ISI was under pressure to act as. It is being considered the ‘ISI’s biggest intelligence failure in history’ that they had no inkling of abrogation of special status of Kashmir.
