At present, Jammu and Kashmir is the only state with rainfall surplus with 74 percent. Rest all regions of the country are rain deficient. The reason for this surplus can be attributed to the successive Western Disturbances that affected the region and gave widespread rain and thundershower activities in this state.

However, since the last two to three days, weather conditions over the hills of North India are pleasant and only isolated rains are being observed over the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir and one or two places of Himachal Pradesh.

Now, a fresh Western Disturbance is approaching the hills of North India, which is currently over the northern parts of Pakistan and adjoining Jammu and Kashmir. It has induced a cyclonic circulation over Central Pakistan and adjoining parts of West Rajasthan.

In the wake of these weather systems, today, we expect isolated rainfall activity to commence over parts of Jammu and Kashmir. Further by tomorrow, weather activities will pick up pace over the northern hills and then light to moderate rain and thundershowers will occur over many parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and few parts of Uttarakhand.

In fact, snowfall activity over the higher reaches of Jammu and Kashmir cannot be ruled out. Incidents of landslides and mudslides will be ruled out as these weather activities will not be widespread or intense in nature.

These rain and thundershowers will continue over the hilly states for another 48 hours i.e. June 12. Thereafter, rains will start reducing and slowly weather conditions will start clearing from the Western Himalayas.
