Bharat bandh in West Bengal

On Day 1 of the strike in West Bengal, normal life was largely unaffected apart from small clashes in some parts of the state. A school bus was pelted with stones in Champadali area of North 24 Parganas. According to the police, hundreds of bandh supporters were arrested yesterday for blocking roads, railway and Metro lines, pelting stones and vandalising government vehicles.

In West Bengal, the CPM’s call for strike can be seen as an attempt to find its voice at a time when the Trinamool Congress and BJP have emerged as the two main forces for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections. While the bandh has failed to elicit a response from the general public, a political observer said the party’s display of manpower on the streets may boost its image and rejuvenate its workers at the grassroots level ahead of its planned brigade rally in February.
