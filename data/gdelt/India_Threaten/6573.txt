Pb women panel seeks status report, to hear case on May 1

Ludhiana: Taking suo motu note of a private developer abusing and slapping a woman building inspector on April 24, the Punjab State Commission for Women has sought the case status report from the police. The panel has also directed the cops to produce the developer — Gurnam Singh — when it hears the matter on May 1.

On April 24, building inspector Kashish Garg, along with a team of municipal corporation Zone B officials, had gone to Tibba Road to demolish structures in an illegal colony.

After razing the illegal structures, the team was returning to MC office when the developer drove there and hit their vehicle twice. When Garg alighted from the car, he allegedly slapped and abused her.

Garg said, “The developer held me from my arm and slapped and abused me. Even as I requested him to listen to me once, he used abusive language and misbehaved with me.” On her complaint, the police had booked the developer on attempt to murder and other charges.

On the basis of the news report carried in The Times of India, the commission has written to the deputy commissioner, the Ludhiana range DIG, the police commissioner and the MC commissioner to ensure the developer’s presence during the May 1 hearing. Garg has also been asked to attend it.

Meanwhile, after getting assurance from the police commissioner and the mayor, the MC employees have put their protest on hold for 72 hours. They have threatened to again go on strike if the developer was not arrested.

Mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “The employees have put their protest on hold as it was causing inconvenience to the public. The police have been given a 72-hour ultimatum to arrest the accused.”

Municipal Employees Sangharsh Committee chairman Ashwani Sahota said, “The employees have returned to work. We will wait till Monday. If the police fail to arrest the accused, we will again go on strike on April 30.”
