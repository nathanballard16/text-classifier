Chandrababu faults EC, to move SC, plan protests in Delhi

Hyderabad: Telugu Desam party national president and Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu today alleged that the Election Commission failed to conduct the polls in proper manner as 31 per cent EVMs failed to function during the polls.

He told media persons in Amaravathi that he will move Supreme Court on this and seek clarification from EC on its failure. The EC is hand in glove with the BJP and YCP and non-availability of perfect EVMs caused a serious inconvenience to the voters. He demanded that the EC should allow counting of 50 per cent of VVPATs. A review petition will be filed in SC for justice.

He said the YCP has ruined the entire poll process using rowdies and the EC could not take steps for fair polls. He said he would involve other 22 parties in the protests he planned to hold against the EC and the Centre. The Centre has been using the institutions against the rivals, he said. He also challenged the EC to ensure counting of VVPATs which will take less than six hours and not six days or more.

Naidu questioned as to why CS LV Subramanyam went to the DGP Office. The Chief Minister also said he will hold protest dharnas at national level against the EC and the Centre. He also said the BJP Government has tarnished the image of the TD government and used IT raids only to threaten our leaders. The TD chief said he was not afraid of anyone and work for State’s development. The YCP used its workers and rowdies against the TD during the polls, he charged.
