India discusses terror with 4 countries

India on Monday held crucial discussions with Saudi Arabia, United States, Turkey and the UAE on countering Pakistan-based terror groups, the Ministry of External Affairs said.

In a telephone conversation with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reiterated India’s position that terrorism “remains one of the gravest threats to global peace and security”.

Mr Modi also held telephone talks with Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed bin Zayed Al-Nahyan and thanked him for the support from his side for India’s appearance as a “Guest of Honour” at the recent ministerial of the OIC where India asked for a united front against terrorism. It was the second such communication in two weeks as the Crown Prince had earlier called for de-escalation of tension between India and Pakistan.

Prime Minister Modi also had a personal meeting with the visiting Minister of State for Foreign Affairs of Saudi Arabia Adel bin Ahmed Al Jubeir on Monday evening. “Prime Minister thanked the leadership of Saudi Arabia for expressing full solidarity with India in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. It was agreed that Saudi Arabia and India should work together for irreversible, verifiable and credible steps against all terrorists without any discrimination,” a press statement from the Ministry of External Affairs said after the deputy minister completed his hours-long visit here.
