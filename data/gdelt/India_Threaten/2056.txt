Suburban Diagnostics encourages you to #LoveWithPride this Valentine

Suburban Diagnostics, one of India’s leading diagnostics centres, has launched their #LoveWithPride campaign this valentine’s week. This opportune campaign aims to celebrate relationships that have been shunned by the modern world and emphasize the importance of a happy and healthy lifestyle.

Curated and executed by Jack in The box Worldwide, a part of The 120 Media Collective, the campaign focuses on breaking away from the shackles of the society and imbibing #LoveWithPride

The first video of the series has been appreciated for the crucial message it conveys.
