The Bombay High Court will decide if the iconic Esplanade Mansion atcan be restored, and, if yes, who would bear the cost of restoration.A division bench of Justices SC Dhamadhikari and Gautam Patel has asked theand the state government to make submissions on restoration of the building on August 21. The bench was hearing a PIL filed by Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) which wants the155-year-old cast iron structure to be restored. During the hearing on Thursday, INTACH submitted a letter written by the Urban Development Department to MHADA to have experts conduct a study of the building and restore it. The letter reportedly refers to several pleas sent by heritage conservationists from various organisations who have written to the government, advocating restoration of the structure.The grade II-A heritage structure, which once served as Bombay’s first luxury hotel – the Watson’s Hotel – is listed among the top 100 endangered monuments in the world and is part of the UNESCO-declared Victorian andEnsembles inscription.While the Heritage Committee submitted that they do not have an expert qualified to assess if the building can be restored or not and that the court could appoint an architect to do so, MHADA, represented by advocate PG Lad, said they had only an IIT structural audit report on record, which states that the building should be demolished.After perusing the letter the bench said four important points needed to be decided – if the building can or cannot be restored, what needs to done since the building is privately owned, where will material for restoration of the building come from and who will bear the cost of restoration. The court then asked BMC, MHADA and the State to file replies if any, and said that submissions on these four aspects will have to be made by the bodies on the next date.
