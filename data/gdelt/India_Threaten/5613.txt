Citing threat from woman’s kin, inter-faith couple approach Delhi HC

An inter-faith couple Tuesday approached the Delhi High Court seeking police protection, alleging that the woman’s family was threatening them. The plea stated that the couple performed nikaah last month and the woman changed her name after conversion. The plea alleged that the woman’s uncle, who she claimed is associated with the BJP and Hindu Sena, has threatened to “kill” her. Advertising“The petitioner (woman) met with severe mental torture — that she will be a victim of ‘love-jihad’ and she will be left by (the man) after two years,” the plea stated. It also highlighted the manner in which the woman was pressured by her parents after she disclosed her relationship with the man.
