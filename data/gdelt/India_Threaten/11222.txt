Centre moots 'corporatising' ordnance factories, a la PSUs

OFB In The Dark

Efficiency & Pvt Participation

BENGALURU: The Ministry of Defence (MoD), as part of the new government’s ‘Transformative Ideas’ for implementation in its first 100 days, is actively considering “corporatisation of ordnance factories” which is envisaged to infuse accountability and enhance efficiency.While no new structure has been decided upon as yet, if implemented, the initiative will see the 41 ordnance factories function as a corporate on the lines of public sector units (PSUs). “One should not confuse the word corporatisation with privatisation,” a source said.The TOI has learnt that Ajay Kumar , secretary-defence production, on July 11, wrote to three joint secretaries in MoD directing them for follow-up action. Kumar’s directions included preparation of a “draft cabinet note” on the matter, besides seeking weekly progress reports about developments.Kumar’s directions came a day after MK Bansal, under secretary in the Cabinet Secretariat, wrote to him about the implementation of these ‘Transformative Ideas’, also requesting a weekly progress report on the matter.“Everything is being done at the cabinet and MoD secretariat level,” another source said without elaborating on when the Centre plans to officially announce the new initiative. Experts TOI spoke with—both from the industry and the armed forces—opined that the move is positive and one that would infuse the much needed accountability in the running of ordnance factories. Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) chairman Saurabh Kumar, told TOI: “There has been no communication to the OFB on this.” On what the OFB’s position on this would be, he said: “The decisions are to be taken by the government and I have no observations on this matter.”Ordnance factories’ employees, however, are already protesting the move, and the All India Defence Employees Federation (AIDEF), the Indian National Defence Workers Federation (INDWF) and the Bharatiya Pratiraksha Mazdoor Sangh (BPMS) are preparing for a hunger strike on August 20.AIDEF general secretary C Srikumar, said: “We are all being kept in the dark. All we hear are rumours, we don’t want the government to one day just make an announcement without consulting us. In the past, at least two defence ministers have assured us that they won’t corporatise our factories, and it was also told to Parliament.”He said that the employees will go on an indefinite strike if the government went ahead with the move. “Why is there no transparency in any of the decisions this government takes,” he asked.The MoD, with an iron resolve to enhance efficiency of defence production and to increase private participation, has had OFB under its scanner even in the previous government’s tenure. In fact, TOI had first reported that the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) had, in February 16, 2017, sought all details regarding ordnance factories, and following this, the MoD had begun scrutinising the functioning of the factories under OFB.In the past two-and-a-half years, more than 250 defence items have been declared “non-core” by the MoD, allowing private firms to manufacture them for the armed forces.
