I regard Mayawati as a symbol of nation: Rahul Gandhi

New Delhi: A day before voting for 59 seats in the penultimate phase of general election, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Saturday alleged that the BJP, RSS and Prime Minister Narendra Modi have hatred towards his family, but he does not harbour the same feelings for the Prime Minister. He also took a dig at Mr Modi’s style of governance, saying the Prime Minister has taught him how not to run a country.

With post-poll talks on his mind, the Congress president reached out to Bahujan Samaj Party’s critical chief, Mayawati, and praised her saying, “I love and respect her contribution to the nation.”

While acknowledging that there is a political divide between the Congress and the BSP, Mr Gandhi said he regards Ms Mayawati as a “symbol” of the nation.

“She has sent a message to the country. I respect her, I love her. For political fight, the Congress party will have to fight for ideology,” Mr Gandhi said in an interview to a TV channel on the sidelines of a rally in Shujalpur in Madhya Pradesh.

Claiming that he “always learns” from people and his political rivals, Mr Gandhi said, “I have learnt from Modiji, how not to run a country. If you govern the country without listening to anybody then the country cannot function properly.”

Commenting on Mr Modi’s remarks on him and his family, Mr Gandhi said that the Prime Minister has personal hatred towards him.
