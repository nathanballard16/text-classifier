23-year-old woman gives birth to quadruplets at Vadodara's SSG Hospital

VADODARA: A 23-year-old woman gave birth to quadruplets (four babies ) at state-run SSG Hospital in Vadodara on wee hours of Tuesday.Rukshar Gufran, a resident of Vadi area in the old city, delivered the four babies, who were born premature at 32 weeks.Doctors said that it is a rare case as quadruplets are born once in every five lakh births. What makes the case medically more interesting is the fact that it was the first pregnancy of the mother and it was a case of a normal delivery with non-IVF multiple pregnancies.Birth of twins, triplets and quadruplets is common in cases of in vitro fertilization. “It was a spontaneous quadruplet delivery. She was first time pregnant,” said Dr Sheila Aiyer from the Department of Paediatrics.The four babies, who were born between 1am and 1.55am, include one female and three male. “They are very low birth weight babies with their weight ranging from 1 kg to 1.2kg,” said Aiyer.The babies have been kept at the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which is an intensive care unit specializing in the care of ill or premature newborn infants.“The journey of premature and with very low birth weight babies has its own share of complications. But, one can offer them good care and survival is not non-achievable,” she said, adding that the babies will require four to six weeks of hospitalisation.
