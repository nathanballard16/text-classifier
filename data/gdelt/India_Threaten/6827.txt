Mamata Banerjee extends her support to those who wants to divide the country: Amit Shah

Guwahati: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) President Amit Shah today attacked West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee saying that she has extended her support to those who wish to divide the country by separating Kashmir from India.

Shah while addressing a rally in Bongaon Lok Sabha constituency said that his party will continue its fight to ensure that Kashmir remains an integral part of India, no matter who is in power at the centre.

The BJP President said that whether the BJP is in power or not in the future, its workers will still fight to ensure that Kashmir remains an integral part of India.

Shah further reiterated that the BJP, if voted to power again, will scrap Article 370 of the constitution in Kashmir which grants special status to the northernmost state.

Amit Shah further claimed, "Give us 30 seats from Bengal and we will scrap Article 370 from Kashmir after forming the next BJP government in the centre."

He also reiterated that the TMC Supremo should make a clear stand on National Conference chief Omar Abdullah's demand for a separate Prime Minister for Kashmir claiming that Banerjee is supporting those who wish to divide the country.

Shah while referring to infiltrators as termites says that his party will throw them out after coming to power at the Centre for a second term. He asserted that it is their commitment to implement National Register of Citizens (NRC) across the country to weed out the infiltrators. He said that first they will bring the citizenship bill to ensure that eligible refugees get citizenship and then they will introduce NRC to throw out the infiltrators.

Shah further stated that in West Bengal, no factory has been set up in the state under the Mamata Banerjee government other than bomb manufacturing units adding that the sound of bomb explosions has silenced Rabindra sangeet in Bengal.
