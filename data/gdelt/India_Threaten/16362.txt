Kashmir: Publish names of lawyers and civilians detained, UK Bar Council and BHRC write to PM Narendra Modi

The Indian government’s move to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution and place restrictions in the erstwhile State of Jammu & Kashmir has been met with opprobrium from lawyers abroad. The Bar Council of England and Wales and the Bar Human Rights Committee of England and Wales (BHRC) have written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, expressing serious concern about the detention of lawyers and civilians in the region.
