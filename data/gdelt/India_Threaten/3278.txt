Islamabad, Feb 27: Prime Minister Imran Khan has once again offered PM Narendra Modi for a dialogue and said better sense should prevail between both the countries.

"We offered that we are ready for any kind of investigation after Pulwama attack in India. We didn't take action on Tuesday morning because we weren't aware of the damage caused by air strike by India. We did not want to cause much collateral damage in India when there was not much damage on our side. The only motive of Pakistan's strike today was to demonstrate that we have the capability to hit back.

"No sovereign country can allow another country to become judge, jury and executioners. Therefore I prompted India in case of aggression, we would have no option but to respond," he said.

If it escalates from here, situation won't be in mine or Modi's control says Imran Khan

"If you can enter our country, we can also enter your territory. Two Indian MiGs who entered Pakistani airspace today after our retaliation were shot down. But where do we go from here?" he asked.

"We should sit down and talk about differences," he said.

"All the wars have happened due to miscalculation. With all the weapons that Pakistan and India have, can we afford to miscalculate. If we take to war neither I nor Mr Narendra Modi would be in a position to control its course. This is why I suggest that better sense should prevail," said Imran Khan.
