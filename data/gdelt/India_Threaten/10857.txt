Lives, Businesses In Jeopardy As Amaravati Looks Into An Uncertain Future

It is tough to miss the worry lines on the faces of S.N. Subrahmanyan, MD and CEO of L&T, Venkateswara, a farmer from Thullur village near Vijayawada, and a group of const­ruction workers from West Bengal. The balance sheet of the construction major, the promised housing plot of the farmer and the livelihood of the migrant workers hang in balance as the Amaravati capital project of And­hra Pradesh has gone into a limbo.

Already slowed down by political ­hostility between its original promoter, former CM Chandrababu Naidu, and his successor Jaganmohan Reddy, Amara­vati’s completion in the near future looked bleaker after the World Bank and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank pulled out their loan components totalling $500 million.
