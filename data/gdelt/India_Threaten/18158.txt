India’s Terror Combat Agency Raids Assam Anti-Citizenship Activist’s House

Sleuths of the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Thursday conducted several raids at the residence and office of prominent leader Akhil Gogoi, who was spearheading the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) movement in the north-eastern state of Assam.

The NIA booked Gogoi on 14 December, two days after placing him under preventive custody for protesting against the Citizenship Amendment Act for his alleged role in the recent protests in Assam.

Five people succumbed to bullet injuries in Assam when police reportedly opened fire on protesters who had taken to the streets defying prohibitory orders in the state, after India enacted the Citizenship Amendment Act on 11 December.
