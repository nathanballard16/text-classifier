Since the beginning of June, the interior parts of Karnataka have been receiving good rain and thundershower activities due to which South Interior Karnataka is rain surplus by 29%, while rain in North Interior Karnataka is surplus by 40%.

Coastal Karnataka is, however, observing rainfall deficiency of 89% due to fewer weather activities. During the last 24 hours, heavy rain was observed in Coastal Karnataka. These rains will certainly bring down the ongoing rain deficiency of Coastal Karnataka.

In the last 24 hours from 08:30 am on Wednesday, Madikeri recorded 43 mm of rain, followed by Honnavar 41 mm, Bengaluru 33 mm and Karwar 26 mm.

An offshore trough is extending from Karnataka to Kerala. And a cyclonic circulation is also persisting over Lakshadweep area, which has enhanced the rainfall activities over Coastal Karnataka.

Now in the coming two to three days, we expect rain and thundershower activities accompanied with strong winds to increase over Coastal Karnataka and South Interior Karnataka including Bengaluru.

After June 8, rains will decrease over entire Karnataka as a low-pressure area is expected to develop over Lakshadweep and adjoining Southeast Arabian Sea which will gradually intensify into a depression. Due to this, moisture concentration will be around that weather system, leaving Karnataka almost dry.

So, we can say that after a few days, signficant decrease will occur in rainfall activities over most parts of Karnataka including the capital city Bengaluru.
