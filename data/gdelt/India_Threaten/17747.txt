Vatal Nagaraj detained at his residence

Kannada Chaluvali Vatal Paksha (KCVP) leader Vatal Nagaraj was detained at his residence in Dollars Colony minutes before he planned to take out a protest.

As many as 40 platoons of reserve police force have been deployed along with the city police at sensitive points across the city to maintain law and order after Section 144 was imposed across the state last evening. “Police personnel have been instructed not to use force, keeping in mind what happened in Delhi,” said a senior police official referring to the violence of the police response to student protests at Jamia Islamia Millia, and the ensuing nationwide unrest.
