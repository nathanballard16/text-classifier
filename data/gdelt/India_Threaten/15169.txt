The Dakshina Kannada district administration has declared Friday a holiday for schools and colleges in the coastal district.

The decision was taken after a red warning was issued till Saturday in the three coastal districts of Karnataka - Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada - amid continous rainfall over the past week.

"Due to depression in Arabian Sea, a red warning was issued by the IMD for Dakshina Kannada district. There is possibility of cyclone in Arabian Sea and if this intensifies, there could be more rains", read a notification issued by Dakshina Kannada Deputy Commissioner Sindhu Rupesh.

District officials have been asked to be on high alert in the next few days. Earlier in the day, the district administration in Dakshina Kannada warned fishermen not to venture out in the sea. Tourists have also been asked to refrain from visiting the beaches in the district.

Heavy to very heavy rainfall was reported in coastal Karnataka over the last 24 hours. Widespread rainfall has been forecast for Friday and Saturday, dampening preparations for Deepavali celebrations in the region.

The Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) predicted high waves in the range of 3 to 3.2 metres between Thursday and Saturday along the coast of Karnataka from Mangaluru to Karwar.

The fresh spell of rains since October 18 has partially damaged 33 houses while no loss of life has been reported so far in the district, the DC Sindhu Rupesh said.

Residents of the district can contact the district administration on the toll-free number 1077 in the event of an emergency.
