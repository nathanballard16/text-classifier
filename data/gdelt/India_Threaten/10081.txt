Srinagar

Doctors Association Kashmir on Tuesday congratulates the administration for introducing ROTAVIRUS vaccine in routine universal immunization programme and making further progress in securing children’s health.

Dr Suhail Naik president DAK and paediatrician said that Rotavirus kills approximately 453 000 children under five years of age globally every year and is a major threat to the health of children across the South-East Asia Region.

“Every year, approximately 127 000 children aged less than five years die of the disease in the SEA Region, around 98 000 of whom are in India. The vaccines without any iota of doubt are proven to be safe and very effective. Introduction of such vaccines have resulted in a dramatic decline in rates of diarrhoea-related hospitalization and death of children. They are also shown to be cost-effective,” Dr Naik added.

Dr Owais H Dar General Secretary DAK said that since 2009 WHO has strongly recommended all countries to introduce rotavirus vaccines into their routine immunization programs as part of a comprehensive strategy to control diarrheal diseases and deaths.

“Rotavirus is a highly contagious gut infection and there are no specific drugs to treat the disease,” Dr Dar added.

Doctors Association Kashmir requested governor led administration to introduce Hepatitis A, Typhoid and MMRV vaccines into state immunization program as these infections are endemic in state of Jammu and Kashmir.
