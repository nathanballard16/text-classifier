India, Argentina reiterate commitment to fight terrorism

New Delhi: Condemning the Pulwama terror attack of February 14, India and Argentina on Monday reiterated their commitment to fight terrorism in all its forms and underscored the need to ensure that terror outfits do not get access to any weapon of mass destruction (WMD), technologies or finances. Argentine President Mauricio Macri is on an official visit to India from February 17 to 19. In a separate joint statement on terrorism, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Macri noted the need for concerted action by the global community against terrorism.

They stressed that there could be no justification for acts of terror on any ground whatsoever, particularly emphasising the scourge of cross-border terrorism. They reiterated their commitment to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and asserted that “strong measures” should be taken against terrorists, terror organisations, their networks and all those who “encourage, support, finance and provide safe haven to terrorists and terror groups”. The two leaders stressed that terrorism is a global scourge that must be fought and terrorist safe havens rooted out from every part of the world. They resolved that India and Argentina will fight together against this grave challenge to humanity. They committed to strengthen cooperation against terrorist threats from groups listed in relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions. (IANS)
