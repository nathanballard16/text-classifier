Mehbooba on Art-370: ‘Na samjho gay tou mit jaouge aye Hindustan walo’

Former Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, Mehbooba Mufti warned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), again, against the hampering with Article 370, which grants special status to JK, saying, “Na samjho gay tou mit jaouge aye Hindustan walo. Tumhari dastaan tak bhi na hogi dastaano main.” (If you won’t understand, you will be finished. Your story will not be in the history)

Taking to Twitter, president of Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP), Ms. Mufti replied to a news report stating that a Public Interest Litigation has been moved to Delhi’s High Court seeking ban on National Conference’s Farooq Abdullah and Ms. Mufti from contesting Lok Sabha elections, saying “Why to waste time in court. Wait for BJP to scrap Article 370. It will automatically debar us from fighting elections since the Indian constitution won’t be applicable to J&K anymore.”

Notably, India is going to polls from 11 April, and results will be declared on 23 May.
