Alert sounded after sensitive documents found at Pune airport

Military installations across the country have been put on alert following the recovery of some sensitive documents, including maps and sketches, related to the Indian Army at the Pune airport, two officials familiar with the matter said Friday.

The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), which provides security at major airports, including the one in Pune, had alerted the local police and Intelligence Bureau (IB) after the documents were seized on May 6.

“The security in-charge of a private airline had found these documents and deposited them with the airport director. The documents were found lying near the baggage makeup area and probably fell off from a bag. A written report along with the documents has been sent to the local police and they are investigating the matter along with Military Intelligence and IB,” an official, who is with the CISF, said.

Ajay Kumar Bhardwaj, director of the Pune airport, also confirmed that the documents were handed over to the local police.

“We have provided CCTV footage of the area to the local police along with details of suspected passengers. We are not interfering with the probe,” said an official of Airports Authority of India (AAI) that owns and manages around 100 airports in the country.

Meanwhile, Kashmir has been put on a three-day alert after intelligence agencies warned of a possible terror attack on defence installations in the Valley during Ramzan.

Similar alerts were issued in the past as militants had planned their attacks during the holy month.
