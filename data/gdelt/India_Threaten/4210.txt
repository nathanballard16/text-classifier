NEW DELHI: The US State Department has updated a travel advisory for its citizens travelling to India due to "crime and terrorism".

Exercise increased caution in India due to crime and terrorism. Some areas have increased risk, the travel advisory read.

"Do not travel to: The state of Jammu and Kashmir (except the eastern Ladakh region and its capital, Leh) due to terrorism and civil unrest. Within 10 km of the India-Pakistan border due to the potential for armed conflict," it added.

The State Department warned that Indian authorities report rape is one of the fastest growing crimes in India. Violent crime, such as sexual assault, has occurred at tourist sites and in other locations, it said.



"Terrorists may attack with little or no warning, targeting tourist locations, transportation hubs, markets/shopping malls, and government facilities," it continued.

"If you decide to travel to India... Do not travel alone, particularly if you are a woman," the statement read linking to a guide for women travelers.
