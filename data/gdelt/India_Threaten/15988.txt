India Calls for Global Efforts to Prevent Cyber Attacks on Critical Facilities by Terrorists

New Delhi has warned the international community about the threat by actors, both state and non-state, whose actions present a clear threat to national, regional, and global security.

Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar told the Paris Peace Forum on Tuesday that coordinated actions by nations, bilaterally and multilaterally, were required to prevent terrorists and extremists from building their presence in the digital domain.

“For the specific security threats, including cyber attacks on critical infrastructures, countries should consider entering into arrangements for speedy action and mitigation", Jaishankar said.

The minister called for a global understanding if not a global regulation to keep cyberspace open, safe, and secure and for that “multilateralism is more essential than ever before".
