How hugging went from being the manifestation of affection to becoming a salutation for an intimate age

In the 1860s when Sir Charles Tilston Bright, a pioneer of international telegraphy, was laying the first lines to connect India with Europe, he faced threats from Arab tribesmen near in Oman.But, according to a report from a Times of India (ToI) correspondent, he was saved because he was a Freemason.Bright found that the tribesmen also knew some allegedly ancient Masonic rites. When he demonstrated them they “at once became warm friends though this demonstration of paternal affection involved some slightly unpleasant hugging with not over-fragrant ‘brothers.’”This report sounds like it could be the inspiration for Kipling’s story (later made into a film) The Man Who Would Be King, which also involves being saved by Masonic symbols. But it may have been the only mention in ToI’s 19th century archives, which start back in 1838, of men hugging each other in a fraternal embrace.When hugging is mentioned in the 19th century it is considered very personal. In 1847, ToI reported on a lady declining to do the daringly intimate waltz: “I have hugging enough at home,” she said firmly. It was a rather suspect action, as was shown in a ToI report from 1878 on an aristocratic divorce scandal in the UK: “Lord Aylesford – to use the expression of the witness – was seen ‘hugging and loving’ one of the ladies of the party.”Hugging was used as an image: ships hugged the shore, boxers hugged the ropes of the ring and complacent people hugged themselves with the knowledge of their own virtue. Women could hug each other affectionately and sick patients could be hugged with compassion. But hugging was too intimate for men, except in an exotic situation.But today we have embraced complete change. Hugging is everywhere these days, most notably, of course, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi , whose recent hug with Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman was the latest in his series of close encounters with leaders across the world.While interesting for the Prince’s slightly bemused patting of the PM’s back, it was far from being his most noteworthy hug. His hug of a startled President Donald Trump probably ranks first, not least for how it left the President with no idea what to do with his hands. Next would come a strange side by side hug with Malaysia’s ex-PM Najib Razak and an almost-hug-from-behind with France’s ex-President Francois Hollande.It is some indication of the impact of the PM’s hugging – much chronicled in the Western media –that his counterparts seem more ready for him these days. As leaders like Japan’s Shinzo Abe or Russia’s Vladimir Putin have shown, the best reaction is happily hugging back. Canada’s Justin Trudeau is an enthusiastic hugger himself (though his height complicates matters). And then, of course, there is Rahul Gandhi’s use of hugging to score a political point.In this, as in so many other matters relating to presentation, the PM seems to be well on trend. Hugging is the salutation for a more intimate age. When we easily use first names and end emails with xoxo – literally, hugs and kisses – then sticking to hand-shakes seems unnecessarily formal.Openly displaying emotion is seen as a virtue, a sign of being real, and hugging is the physical manifestation of this. When Michael Bloomberg was mayor of New York he was criticised for not hugging enough. The New York Times scolded: “he remains deeply uncomfortable with his role of consoling and soothing his city.” It was a sign of his roots in cold corporate culture, and perhaps it’s no surprise that Bloomberg recently ruled out running for President.Hugging is now seen as therapeutic. Parents are criticised for not hugging their children enough and the spiritual leader Mata Amritanandamayi Devi has built an international following on the basis of hugging. In 2003 she told ToI that hugging was “simple, straightforward and the least complex way to tell everyone, Amma loves you as her own self.” People can wear special jackets that will contract to give a virtual hug sent from far away.And yet, hugging is also a problem. This week Ray Kelvin, the founder and chief executive of the Ted Baker fashion chain resigned following allegations from employees that he had created a culture of “forced hugging.” Many #MeToo allegations involve social hugs that went on for a bit too long – research has shown that three seconds seems to be the optimal length for a hug, while 20 seconds or more is getting into alarm bell territory.Judith Martin, the American etiquette expert who writes as Miss Manners deplores “the bizarre notion that hugging should inspire affectionate goodwill, rather than express it.” Hugging has become a quick fix – instead of working to achieve intimacy and understanding, which might in time result in a really meaningful hug, the hope is now that one just hugs, and everything else will follow. This is as unrealistic as most quick fixes are.As with many trends the acceptability of hugging might be semi-cyclical, a practice that recurs, but with modifications each time. Perhaps the PM’s fondness of hugging could reflect his established desire to discard the habits imposed by the British and go back to earlier Indian norms.In 1910 ToI published a long article entirely on the different types of salutations followed in India. In Kathiwar, close to where the PM comes from, it noted how Kathis and Rajputs “exchange their ram ram either with both hands uplifted but not touching the forearm, or they embrace each other, or they join forearms, the hand of one reaching right up to the elbow of the other.”This was an example of a fraternal embrace, but it came with a qualification – it could only happen between men of the same caste levels. As a rather jarring contrast the article describes a low-caste Mahar not greeting a Brahmin, but humbly calling out from far to ask if he could pass his house. The Brahmin gave permission, but told him to bend low so that even his shadow would not pollute his house.Caste was clearly a problem with hugging in India the past, but not any longer – or at least not ostensibly so. In the British era the handshake was projected as the modernising gesture. It involved contact, so forced the participants to break caste rules, but it wasn’t uncomfortably intimate and the Western connotation helped overcome the Indian traditions.After Independence though a debate soon broke out on whether the new nation deserved a gesture of its own. An article in ToI in 1956 explained that the question came up after Jawaharlal Nehru encountered a Congress worker who “tried to greet the Prime Minister by stooping and touching the feet, a form of greeting the Prime Minister dislikes.” Nehru instead offered a democratic handshake ‘but the veteran Congressman refused.”It was to avoid this awkwardness that the writer argued Indians should fix on the Namaste as a salutation that was suitably Indian, yet practical: “The Namaste enables you to greet a host of people with your hands clean, fresh and strong.” It might lack the warm touch of a handshake, but it “saves you from having your hand propelled up and down like some hand-pump.”And it could be varied: “You can make it with a bow or with a head held coldly rigid. You can make it with a smile or with a grim countenance. You can fold your hands at your breast or rest them comfortably on your nose.” People wrote in to express their views on the issue, most of them agreeing that the Namaste should be the salutation for India.It’s interesting to note that hugging didn’t feature at all in this discussion. By 1986 the possibility had come up, though the ToI writer at that time suggested there was a geographical divide here: “I have rarely seen two friends or relatives hugging each other in the South. But the friendly hug is very common in the North.” This didn’t mean, he hastened to add, that south Indians weren’t friendly, but that they used a more subtle range of touching to express their feelings, rather than the simple, gregarious hug.When this sort of contrast between community attitudes to hugging comes up, it usually ends with the huggers overcoming the non-huggers with their affection. In the film Vicky Donor, for example, the formal Bengali family on the bride’s side is swept into the warm Punjabi embrace of the groom’s side, and all barriers are crushed. It is a heart-warming narrative, of divisions coming down through direct contact and perhaps this is why hugging always triumphs in stories.In reality though, dissolving distances bring as many problems as opportunities, and one of the most basic ones often halts the hugging. Fear of picking up a virus can usually stop the happiest of huggers, and every time a new viral panic circles the world – HIV, ebola, swine flu – it is usually accompanied by a sharp decrease in hugging. And this, Miss Manners suggested, might be used as a final defence against forced hugging.The first step, of course, would be to approach the encounter with hand firmly held out, in the hope that the other person would take the hint and stop at a handshake. But really determined huggers charge past the hand, leaving the non-hugger with the prospect of surrendering or having their hand hit the hugger’s stomach.But a third option Miss Manners suggested was “performing a slight wave in front of your face, accompanied by a regretful smile. The assumption will be that you have something catching…” The notoriously germ phobic President Trump might have wanted to do this when hugged by our PM, but diplomatic protocol prevented it. For regular non-huggers Miss Manners’ advice might be the answer for survival in an all-embracing world.
