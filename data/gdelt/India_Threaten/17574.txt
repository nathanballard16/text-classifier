CAA protests updates: Muslim population hasn't reduced in India like Pakistan, says Amit Shah

Jamia student with alleged gunshot wounds shifted out of ICU

Aijaz Ahmad, who is being treated for alleged gunshot wound at Safdarjung Hospital, has been shifted out of the ICU.

Speaking to India Today TV, Aijaz's mother said that her son is out of danger now. "He has suffered injury on his chest. Doctors are not telling us anything clearly."

Aijaz Ahmad was injured during the Jamia protest. However, it is yet to be proven that he was hit by a bullet.

Three cases of alleged gunshot wounds were reported after the violence at the Jamia university - one person had been admitted to Holy Family Hospital and two were at AIIMS.

While, the one admitted at Holy Family Hospital did not have any bullet injury and was discharged, separate police and medical probes were on into the nature of injury of the two admitted at Safdarjung.

Among the two admitted at AIIMS, one was Sohaib Khan - a 23-year-old student of Jamia Hamdard who, his family claimed, was just passing by the area of protest.
