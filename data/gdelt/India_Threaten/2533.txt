PM Imran Khan: ‘If India attacks Pakistan will retaliate’

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday said Pakistan will retaliate if India attacks in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack.

Khan said India had blamed the attack on Pakistan “without any proof”.

“If Indian govt thinks that they will attack us and we will not think of retaliating, we will retaliate. We all know starting a war is in the hands of humans, where it will lead us only God knows. This issue should be solved through dialogue. I want to tell Indian govt that we will take action if evidence is found against anyone from Pakistan,” said Khan.

This is Imran Khan’s first statement on the Pulwama attack.

At least 40 CRPF personnel were killed in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district on February 14. The attack was the worst in the history of militancy in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad has claimed the responsibility of the terror attack.
