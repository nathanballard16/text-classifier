Kolkata: Asansol mayor Kumar Jitendra Tiwary, who is also the Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLA from Pandaveswar, waded into a controversy on Monday, may 27, after he allegedly threatened police officers in New Town area of Durgapur. The incident was caught on camera.

Tiwari had reportedly reached the spot after he was informed that the TMC office in the area had been allegedly vandalised. As soon as he reached the area, he started threatening the police officers to arrest the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers in connection with the case.

Tiwary accused the cops of not taking timely action in the case and threatened that if they did not take any immediate action in connection with the case, he would vandalise the BJP office in the area.

"BJP is doing tandav in Bengal. If the BJP doesn't stop its workers, we'll retaliate, we won't sit silently. You may have won but you can't break a TMC office. You don't have that right," Tiwary was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

Emboldened by the TMC leader's warning, agitated TMC cadres allegedly vandalised two BJP offices under Tiwary's leadership. As per ANI, the cadres also ended up damaging several bikes parked near the two offices.

Anticipating that the situation could get out of hand, ACP (East) Abhishek Modi reached the spot with additional forces to control the situation.

Meanwhile, in a major setback to the Mamata Banerjee government, two TMC MLAs and more than 50 TMC councillors quit the party and joined the BJP on Tuesday in the presence of senior BJP leader Kailash Vijayvargiya.

Speaking on this, Vijayavargiya said, "Like the elections were held in seven phases in West Bengal, joining in BJP will also happen in seven phases. Today was just the first phase... Such joinings will continue in future also."
