High Commission of India warns to be aware of malicious sites for E-visas to India

The High Commission of India in Wellington has warned people to be aware of malicious websites that are duping people applying different visas to India.

The websites under the guise of nearly similar names of the actual and authorised website of the government of India are charging two to three times the actual E-visa fee from the public.

“Despite our regular efforts to increase awareness, applicants for Indian E-visa keep falling prey to fake and unauthorised websites,” the press release from the High Commission of India read.

“Such websites operate in the guise of names which appear similar to the authorised websites are misguiding visa applicants and sometimes duping them of their money by charging two to three times the actual E-visa fee,” the PR said.

The list of FAKE or UNAUTHORISED websites are:

https://www.evisatoindia.org.in

https://www.evisaindia.com

https://www.indianvisaservice.org

https://www.indiaimmigration.org

https://www.evisaindia.org.in

https://www.indianonlineevisas.org.in

https://www.indiaevisa.org

The statement further says that although continuous efforts are being made to curb this practice, some of these websites operate from outside India and are outside the purview of the government of India.

The only authorised website for applying and granting E-visas for India from the government of India is https://www.indianvisaonline.gov.in .

The High Commission also adds that E-visas are not processed by the High Commission of India in Wellington but directly by Ministry of Home Affairs in India. Any queries and requests related to E-visa can be directly sent to indiatvoa@gov.in.
