CMO has marked inquiry in NPA cases, claims advocate

Ludhiana: A day after a city-based advocate Gaganpreet Singh levelled allegations of misusing of power by ADC Iqbal Singh Sandhu in settling cases of NPAs, the advocate has now claimed that the chief minister office (CMO) has marked a probe into the complaint filed by him against ADC Sandhu.

Gaganpreet has also forwarded the copy of an email to mediapersons which he received from the CMO regarding his complaint.

Giving more information about the development, he said: “Following my complaint against the additional deputy commissioner (general) Iqbal Singh Sandhu of misusing his powers in settling NPA account cases involving amount worth crores, the Punjab government has taken prompt action and directed the officers concerned to look into the matter and take required action. I have also raised the issue which is hampering the growth of our economy as crores of rupees of banks are in the hand of defaulters. Officials of the district administration department, who are handling the NPA accounts cases, are hand in gloves with these defaulters and misusing their powers and the ADC has already been warned by the high court.”

Notably, on Monday, the advocate organised a press conference outside the deputy commissioner office and alleged that ADC Sandhu was misusing his powers and was deliberately delaying and dismissing cases involving big NPAs which are filed by banks for taking possession of properties of the NPAs in lieu of the defaults worth crores.

The advocate had also claimed that in the cases involving small NPAs, the ADC was deciding cases immediately on the spot and not following the same criteria as being adopted by him in the cases of big NPAs.

The district administration, Ludhiana, in the meanwhile came in support of the ADC and issued a statement claiming that the allegations levelled against the ADC were baseless and the advocate was only doing this to secure a particular case, related to possession of a disputed property, in his favour.
