Tortoise species new to India discovered in Arunachal jungle

GUWAHATI: India’s total tortoise species count has increased to 29 after a group of researchers have discovered a forest-dwelling, medium-sized tortoise species which is a new record in the country.The finding was made in the hilly jungles of Yazali in Arunachal Pradesh ’s Lower Subansiri district this month. Known as Manouria impressa because of the “impressive” orange-brown to dark brown patches on the carapace, the researchers said that the tortoise species is the first record from India.Manouria impressa is one of the only fourth species of forest-dwelling tortoise occurring in Southeast Asia. This is the smaller of two species of the genus Manouria, the other being the larger Asian Giant Tortoise (Manouria emys).Genus is a taxonomic ranking used in biological classification that is below a family and above a species level.The habitat of the tortoise is humid, moist hill and montane forest up to elevations of at least 1300 metres. However, the species in its home range is threatened by poaching primarily for traditional medicine and pet trade.The research team comprised Bunty Tao andBhatt of Arunachal Pradesh forest department, Jayaditya Purkayastha of Help Earth and Shailendra Singh and Arpita Dutta of Turtle Survival Alliance.Purkayastha said that Tao actually sent a photograph of the tortoise for identification on June 19. “But looking at the picture of the tortoise intrigued us so we went for an extensive field survey on herpetofauna (reptiles and amphibians) of the area. During the survey this month we could establish that the tortoise species is indeed a new record in India,” herpetologist and Help Earth general secretary Jayaditya Purkayastha said.Purkayastha said that the last reported range of the species was from Gwa in Myanmar, where Turtle Survival Alliance is carrying out a conservation breeding of this endangered tortoise for reintroduction in the wild.“The discovery is significant because since 2005 there were no record of new tortoise species in India. Also the finding has brought to the fore the richness of herpetofauna in Arunachal Pradesh in particular and Northeast in general. There is a need for extensive survey for herpetofauna for Northeast,” Purkayastha said.
