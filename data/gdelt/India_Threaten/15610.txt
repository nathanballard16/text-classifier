Police: Man threatened to shoot up shop where his children work

A Delhi Township man who threatened to open fire at the business his children own was previously convicted on telecommunications harassment, according to court records.

Gregory Lester, 75, was the previous owner of Gregory Forrest Lester, Inc. Tree Health Professionals. Now his children own and operate the shop.

Lester called his son multiple times in a "harassing and threatening nature," court documents state. The son blocked Lester's number but Lester was still able to leave voicemails.

In the voicemails, documents state Lester threatened to call the police on his son and have his vehicles taken. He threatened to take legal action against his son if the business equipment was not returned to Lester.

Lester also called the business's line and told an employee at Gregory Forrest Lester, Inc. that he would shoot up the shop.

Lester was arrested on Oct. 25 and posted bond a day later.

In 2016 Lester was convicted on telecommunication harassment in connection to his son and sentenced to 18 months probation, according to court records.

Documents state similar voicemails were left on his son's phone during that offense, including threatening to burn business equipment and the building owned by Gregory Forrest Lester, Inc.
