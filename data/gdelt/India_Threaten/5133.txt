From Urmila Matondkar to Shatrughan Sinha: B-Town and the ballot-box battle in Lok Sabha elections

1/5

URMILA MATONDKAR

Urmila stepped into showbiz as a child actor with the Marathi film Zaakol (1980) at the age of seven, before starring in Kalyug (1981). However, it was Shekhar Kapur’s Masoom (1983) that brought her immense recognition. A few years later, she returned as a heroine in Narsimha (1991). But it was Ram Gopal Varma who truly discovered the sultry siren in the Marathi mulgi with Rangeela (1995). Their association continued for many years. Now, it’s politics that’s beckoned her. The actress has joined the Congress and will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections from the Mumbai North parliamentary constituency.

DINESH LAL YADAV AKA NIRAHUA

While the Bhojpuri actor was a name to reckon with in regional cinema, his stint as a Bigg Boss contestant introduced him to the audiences all over India. Nirahua made news when he decided to join the BJP. Rumours of a ticket in the election from the UP constituency have been around. It remains to be seen if his future in the political arena matches that of his colleague Ravi Kishan.

PRAKASH RAJ

There has been no doubt about the immense talent of this multiple National-award winner. He will fight as an independent candidate from Bangalore Central constituency.
