Attempts being made to trigger riots in Kerala by some political parties, minorities panel writes to home minister

NEW DELHI: In the backdrop of the clashes and protests over the entry of women in the Sabarimala temple, the national commission for minorities has written to home minister Rajnath Singh calling for action in the wake of "deliberate attempts" to trigger communal riots in Kerala by "some political parties."The letter written on Tuesday, coincidentally, came on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was in Kerala. Modi attacked the CPI-M-led LDF government in Kerala over the handling of the Sabarimala issue.NCM vice-chairman George Kurian has called for extreme caution on the part of the "three pillars of democracy " while taking any decision on the prevailing situation in the state as "even a minor issue can have knock-on consequences on the minority communities."Kurian cites a memorandum received from noted film director Ali Akbar where the latter has referred to the recent attack on Perambra Town Juma Masjid during a strike called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi to protest against the state government for facilitating entry of activists in Sabarimala temple. "In this case a local leader of a political party was arrested for allegedly trying to instigate communal disturbance, though the Sabarimala issue has no minority connection. Akbar Ali has listed out some past cases where similar modus operandi was used to widen communal faultlines and create tension. However, the enlightened citizenry of the state was not swayed by such acts," Kurian has said in his letter.He has sought that concerns raised by Ali in his representation be examined by the home ministry for appropriate action. He has also sought a report on the matter from chief secretary of Kerala.In his letter to the home minister, Kurain warns that "Kerala is sitting on a communal tinderbox." He has further stated that "there have been clear attempts by political parties to vitiate the body polity of the state by using religion to polarise the society on communal lines over the last three decades.""Of, late it (Kerala) has turned into a fertile recruitment ground for global terror organisations like Islamic State and A-Qaeda. Many educated and professionally qualified youth were attracted to such ideologies and migrated to other countries to join jihad," he states in the letter. He said that "political parties who co-opt organisations with extremist ideologies are also responsible for the growth of such a mindset.
