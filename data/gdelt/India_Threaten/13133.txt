Mizoram’s apex and the most influential student body, Mizo Zirlai Pawl (MZP) has pledged to take up measures to resolve the long pending Mizoram-Assam border dispute.

MZP president, L Ramdinliana Renthlei on Wednesday said that the student body, in its federal council held on Tuesday, resolved to take up steps so that the border dispute is resolved at the earliest. He also said that the student body would take measures to ensure that the ongoing construction of the mosque by Assam at Zophai area on the "disputed" land is stopped at the earliest.

Renthlei then warned that the MZP will construct a resting shed at Zophai along the Mizoram-Assam border if Assam continues with the construction of the mosque.

It can be noted here that the meeting of Core Committee on border issue held last week had decided to take up measures to ensure that the construction of the mosque on the disputed land is halted.

At the district official level talks held recently, both the Mizoram and Assam governments agreed to maintain status quo at the disputed lands along the Mizoram-Assam border.

Meanwhile, in its federal council held on Tuesday, the MZP agreed to organise "Zo unity" festival known as ZOFEST to strengthen brotherhood and cultural ties among various "Mizo tribes".

The student body also agreed to take massive efforts to ensure that the Inner Line Permit (ILP) is enforced in a stricter manner in the state, and that, as many as educated Mizo youths are employed under "all India civil services and other Central services".
