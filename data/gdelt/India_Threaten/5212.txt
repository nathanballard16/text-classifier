Just last week, IndiGo's Delhi-Istanbul flight had to be diverted to Kuwait due to an engine snag. According to the airline, the snag hit its A320 NEO aircraft which was en-route from Delhi to Istanbul.

In a statement, the airline said that the flight landed safely in Kuwait and the reason was being found out.
