The long night was indeed very dark (so much that I literally had to adjust the screen a lot of times in order to see clearly as to what was happening) and of course, it was also full of terrors.

But still, the Battle of Winterfell, the longest and the best episode of Game of Thrones till date, defied every expectation of greatness – in a good way, of course.

The Night King, the most terrifying villain in any of the shows ever, is dead and shattered into piece. And you know, the hero who killed him was the someone whose name starts with A, is a four letter word and isn’t Aegon.

The hero was none other than Arya Stark or should we say Azor Ahai?

Arya had a long list of people who she wanted to kill. The Night King was never on the list, but in the end, she saved everyone by just killing one character – The Night King.

And we’re sure, Syrio Forel, the master sword-fighter and instructor hired by Eddard Stark to train Arya Stark, would be so proud of her.

“What do we tell death?,” Melisandre asks Arya as they look at Beric Dondarrion who is now dead again, perhaps for the last time, and she says, “Not today”.

But then, she wasn’t born under a bleeding star or anywhere near salt and smoke, and she didn’t even hatch a dragon out of a stone. But these conditions aren’t fulfilled by any of the other characters too. So, is Arya Stark the Azor Ahai? Or could it be Jaime Lannister?
