What’s on TV Friday: ‘Jett’ and ‘Aggretsuko’

What’s on TV

JETT (2019) 10 p.m. on Cinemax. A criminal decides to take one final job, and chaos ensues. This plotline features in many crime dramas, and the pulp noir “Jett” can be added to the list. But the darkly fun action thriller has a few unique ingredients, namely its star-studded cast that includes Carla Gugino (“The Haunting of Hill House”) and Giancarlo Esposito of “Breaking Bad” fame, as well as writer, director and executive producer Sebastian Gutierrez, who frequently collaborates with Gugino, his partner. The show centers on Daisy (“Jett”) Kowalski, a retired professional thief who is living a simple life following her release from prison, until the gangster Charlie Baudelaire (Esposito) enlists her to perform one last job in Havana that puts her in serious danger.
