Two killed in first gun battle sine Kashmir lockdown began

Two people, including an armed militant and a policeman, were killed in India’s disputed Kashmir region on Wednesday in the first clash after the federal government scrapped the territory’s autonomy.

Police said the gun battle in Baramulla, a town 33 miles west of Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar, erupted on Tuesday evening after an armed militant fired on a police cordon-and-search party.

In the ensuing fire fight, which lasted over eight hours, the militant was shot dead and two policemen were wounded, with one of them dying later in hospital, officials said.

Police also claimed to have recovered ‘incriminating material’ including arms and ammunition from the militants hideout.

Armed insurgents fighting Indian-rule in the Muslim-majority region since 1989 have pledged to continue their fight for independence, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist BJP government annulled Kashmir’s autonomy and right to make its own laws on 5 August.

The government also revoked the seventy-year-old restrictions on property purchases and government jobs in Kashmir, opening them up to people from outside the region.

In anticipation of a backlash, the authorities imposed a lockdown across Kashmir by suspending telephone, Internet, television and radio services, some of which were partially restored earlier this week.
