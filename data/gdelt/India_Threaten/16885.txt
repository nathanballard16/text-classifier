The weather of Gujarat is running dry for the last many days although, isolated light rains were observed in many places during the first few days of December. Isolated light rains were also witnessed in the Southern coastal parts of the state during the start of December month. In a span of 24 hours, Keshode has received 1 mm of rain. Adjoining areas also witnessed isolated light rains.

This year unexpectedly five cyclones have developed in the Arabian Sea, out of which two recurved towards Gujarat but failed to reach the coast. Luckily these Cyclones fizzled out before reaching the coast. The latest Deep Depression which developed in the Arabian Sea has also weakened now. The system was anticipated to become a Cyclone.

At present, the system is undergoing rapid weakening. The Deep Depression might soon turn into a Depression, which will then become a Well Marked Low Pressure Area and subsequently a Low pressure Area.

So, the threat to the Gujarat coast is almost over now. But the system may still give light scattered rains over Southern districts of Gujarat during the next 24 hours. However, the weather of Central and North Gujarat including Kutch will be dry. This comes as a good news for farmers as rains during this period would have been disastrous for crops.

As a matter of fact, the period between November and May is the driest for Gujarat. However, this time, Gujarat has seen unseasonal rains in November and October as well. Light unseasonal rains have occurred in the month of December also. Now, the weather is expected to go dry in Gujarat.
