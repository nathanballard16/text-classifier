Pulwama attack: Dean of Diplomatic Corps extends support to fight terrorism

Pulwama (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], Feb 15 (ANI): The Dean of Diplomatic Corps Hans Dannenberg Castellanos, on Friday condoled the death of CRPF personnel in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kasmir’s Pulwama, and extended support to the Indian government in their “fight against terrorism”.

Around 40 CRPF personnel were killed after a suicide bomber rammed a car laden with explosives into a bus carrying them on Thursday. The bus was extensively damaged in the blast, which was followed by firing on the vehicle.

The Dean of Diplomatic Corps Hans Dannenberg Castellanos in a statement said, “On behalf of Diplomatic Corps in India, we would like to express our deep sympathy to Indian government and families of victims of this horrendous act.”

The statement further added that firm support will be given to the Indian government in its “fight against terrorism”.

Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which is based in Pakistan and backed by the Pakistani administration, claimed responsibility for the attack and said it was carried out by its suicide bomber.

After the dastardly act, India demanded that the UN ban JeM and its chief Masood Azhar who roams freely in Pakistan.

In a statement, India's External Affairs Ministry said all UN member countries should support a proposal for proscribing Azhar as an international terrorist. (ANI)
