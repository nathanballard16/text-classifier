Weatherman Predicts Heavy Rain in Coastal Regions till August 29

Mangaluru : The weatherman could be RIGHT or could be WRONG with the prediction of heavy rain until 29 August, in coastal Karnataka and Malnad regions. This is in the wake of the coastal region continuing to receive heavy rain since three days. As per sources, while Kota in Udupi district received 120 mm rainfall during 24 hours ending 8 a.m. on Saturday, Panambur received 90 mm, Mangaluru City and airport received 70 mm rainfall each during the period.

On Saturday, it rained almost throughout the day in Mangaluru and other parts of coastal Karnataka that disrupted life as well as the Vitla Pindi celebrations in the region. Raising yellow alert, the India Meteorological Department has cautioned heavy rain in Dakshina Kannada, Udupi, Uttara Kannada, Shivamogga, Chikkamagaluru, and Kodagu districts.

There would be squally weather in the sea with wind speed reaching 45-55 kmph likely in Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka coasts. IMD has asked fishermen not to venture into these sea areas during the period. So if you have planned any outdoor activities in the next few days, you could be out of luck- either you’ll have to cancel or postpone the events or take a risk in sticking to the schedule.
