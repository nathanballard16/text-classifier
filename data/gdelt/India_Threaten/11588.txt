Man-made or natural tragedy? Civic body, locals at loggerheads

The residents of Bopal claimed that they had cautioned the authorities about the health of the water tank before it crashed down on Monday. However, the authorities turned a deaf ear. They, thus, hold the authorities responsible for the tragedy that claimed three lives and injured six others.

Locals alleged that despite several intimations and applications to Bopal Nagarpalika regarding the dilapidated condition of the 25-year-old water tank and the risk it posed, no step was taken. They also claimed that the overhead tank was never maintained by the authorities, making it debilitate.

Refuting the allegations, Bopal Nagarpalika authorities blamed heavy rains which made the soil beneath the tank sink, for the incident.

"When we had inspected the water tank a couple of weeks ago, we found no issue. Primary investigation revealed that due to heavy rain, the surface beneath the water tank sank. It couldn't take the load of the water tank, thus, leading to the collapse. Construction of the water tank has nothing to do with its collapse. It was not weak, "said Jigisha Shah, president of Bopal Nagarpalika.

When DNA contacted Vikrant Pandey, Collector of Ahmedabad, said, "When I visited the spot, a few residents alleged that they had submitted complaints to Nagarpalika authorities regarding the condition of the water tank and had asked them to demolish it; however, they were paid no heed."

"We have set up a technical committee under the supervision of Deputy Collector to investigate the incident. It will become clear why was the demolishing process was put on hold and why no action was taken by authorities in the matter," he added.

Pandey said Chief Minister Vijay Rupani and Union Home Minister Amit Shah had called and asked him to set up an inquiry to probe into the case and take necessary action.
