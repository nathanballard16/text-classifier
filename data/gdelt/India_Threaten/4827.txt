Jaivardhan Singh confident about his father Digvijaya Singh's victory from Bhopal

Bhopal (Madhya Pradesh) [India], Mar 25 (ANI): Whomsoever the BJP fields from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat in the ensuing polls, Digvijaya Sing will win, said Cabinet Minister Jaivardhan Singh on Monday.

Jaivardhan is the son of former MP Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh.

Speaking to ANI about his father’s candidature from Bhopal, he said: “Even though the constituency is challenging, we are up for it. Every leader and worker of the region will work and fight with complete unity to defeat the opponent.”

He also criticised BJP leader Ram Madhav’s remark in which he said the Congress leaders would probably win elections in Pakistan if they contest in the neighbouring country.

“Only during the elections, BJP remembers Pakistan. If they are so fascinated by Pakistan, they must go there,” said Singh.

When asked to comment on the possibility of BJP fielding Shivraj Singh Chouhan from Bhopal, Singh said: “The BJP is tense. That is why it is looking for the best bet to fight the polls.”

He said that the Congress will fight the polls on the basis of works done by Chief Minister Kamal Nath led government in the state.

Criticising BJP’s ‘Mein Bhi Chowkidar’ campaign, Singh said that the people of the country are very reasonable and they will ask about the poll promises fulfilled by the BJP government in the last five years.

On Saturday, Digvijaya had expressed his wish to contest the ensuing Lok Sabha poll from Raigarh.

“My Rajya Sabha term is till 2020. But if the party wants me to contest the Lok Sabha elections, my first preference will be Rajgarh. However, I have told the party high command that I will contest from wherever the party asks me,” Singh had told media persons in Indore. (ANI)
