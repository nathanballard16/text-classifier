Ludhiana: The meteorological department of Punjab Agricultural University has warned of heat wave across North India, including Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Delhi in the coming days.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature in Ludhiana was 33.3 degree Celsius, which is two degrees above normal and the minimum temperature was 13.6 degree Celsius which is a degree below normal.Kulwinder Kaur Gill, assistant agro-meteorologist at PAU said, “Due to equinox— when the centre of the sun is directly above the equator— temperatures are rising abruptly which rarely happens in early April. With this unseasonal temperature rise, this may lead to heat wave condition.”Intense heat wave conditions will prevail in central India and the temperature may rise to 40 degree. In North India, including Punjab, the temperature will rise three to four degrees above normal. Consequently, heat waves will continue for next 72 hours following which residents can expect slight relief due to dust storms or thundershowers.People have been advised to stay indoors due to the rising temperature and heat wave. If they want to step out, they should be carrying an umbrella and make all possible efforts to stay hydrated.
