Mumbai: Maharashtra state minister and Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis' close aide Girish Mahajan on Tuesday expressed confidence that the BJP would win 160 seats out of 288 in the state if it goes solo in the upcoming Assembly elections.

Mahajan, however, said that party’s first preference is to keep the alliance with Shiv Sena intact.

“BJP will win 160 seats (majority) out of 288 seats, if we contest alone in Maharashtra. However, our first option will be to keep the alliance with Sena intact.

In July, the Maharashtra Chief Minister said that BJP and Shiv Sena will contest the upcoming Assembly polls together, putting to rest the speculations that the saffron party might fight the state elections alone.

"The BJP, the Shiv Sena and allied parties will contest the assembly elections jointly. We want to break the record of winning the maximum number of seats in Maharashtra," the chief minister was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

However, he had dropped a hint that Sena could get lesser share in alliance and the BJP would play a major role in the tie-up.

The BJP and the Shiv Sena had fought the 2014 Assembly elections separately, but joined hands later to form a BJP-led government.

In the last state elections, the BJP had won 122 out of total 288 seats and the Shiv Sena bagged only 63. The Congress and the NCP had won 42 and 41 seats, respectively.
