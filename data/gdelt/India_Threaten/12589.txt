Mob attacks in UP over child-lifting rumours

Lucknow: Mobs thrashed six people, including a Delhi resident and a woman beggar, over rumours of child-lifting in three fresh incidents in Uttar Pradesh, despite the police warning to invoke the National Security Act against those spreading such canard.

Attacks over rumours of child-lifting have increased over the past week in the state. On Thursday, Director General of Police O P Singh said 82 people have been arrested for spreading rumours about child theft, but incidents of public thrashing have continued.

Singh had warned authorities will invoke NSA against rumour mongers. Under the Act, a person can be detained for as long as required and authorities need not disclose the grounds of detention. On Saturday, police said a Delhi resident was attacked in Muzaffarnagar when he was on a personal visit to the district.

They said Anandpuri area residents suspected him to be a child lifter and thrashed him on Friday but an investigation found he was innocent. In Ballia, a mob physically assaulted a woman beggar on Friday, suspecting her of being a child lifter in Kotwali Police Station area.

The woman was rescued by police. In Banda, four labourers were beaten up in Atarra township. Police said the labourers were taking rest at Lohia canal bridge when rumours of them being child lifters spread.

A mob soon gathered and beat them up. The labourers were handed over to police, which allowed them to leave after three-hour questioning. (PTI)
