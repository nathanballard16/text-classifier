Indian equity market witnessed third straight day of gains on July 17 that pushed Nifty above 11,700 intraday and Sensex by over 150 points but selling pressure at higher levels capped the upside.

The final tally on D-St – Sensex rose 84 points to 39,215 and Nifty closed 24 points higher at 11,687.

In terms of sectors, the BSE IT index remained the outperformer for the second consecutive day in a row, followed by the S&P BSE FMCG index, and the Bankex. Selling pressure was seen in the auto, oil & gas, and telecom space.

The broader market underperformed – the S&P BSE Midcap index fell 0.15 percent while the S&P BSE Smallcap index closed with a marginal loss of 0.7 percent.

Markets will react to Wipro, and Yes Bank results on July 18 that came post market hours. Wipro reported 3.86 percent sequential fall in Q1 consolidated profit and 2.4 percent decline in revenue from operations on July 17.

YES Bank turns black in Q1 as it reported a net profit of Rs 113 cr which was slightly lower than CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 149 crore. The net interest income was also less than estimates. NII stood at Rs 2,281 crore compared to CNBC-TV18 poll of Rs 2,482 crore.

"Market was rangebound but Bank Nifty outperformed in expectation of transfer of RBI reserve to the government. Q1FY20 is unlikely to cheer investors due to the risk of a downgrade in FY20 earnings given muted expectation,” Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services Ltd told Moneycontrol.

“Finance and cement sectors are expected to be strong performers, while auto, metal and oil & gas sectors are likely to underperform due to weak consumer demand, lower realisations and slowdown in the global economy,” he said.

In terms of technicals, Nifty formed a bullish candle on the daily charts, but it moved in a narrow range for the most part of the trading session. Important support for the index is placed at 11,600, and then towards 11,550.
