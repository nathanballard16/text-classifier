Tackling locust

THE current locust attack in Pakistan is unusual. Normally, it used to come from Iran in February-March, pass through deserts of Balochistan and Sindh in April-May and cross over to India in June.

Locusts normally turn back by monsoon winds in July-August and then fly back to their home in Africa in October-November. This year the swarms returning from India are much bigger, covered more districts and are still staying around.

The swarm is nibbling not only at our tomatoes and onion nurseries but also our premier crop – wheat – endangering our food security. There is a danger that it may lay eggs in the desert of which larvae will emerge next spring and start new swarms.

Previously, locust attacks appeared roughly at intervals of 10 to 12 years. Because of this uncertainty, the department of plant protection had a relaxed attitude. There was an inadequate budget allocation and even location of its office and hangar at Walton airport was threatened several times.

There are five single engine Beaver aircraft which are at least 50 years old with their engines rebuilt several times. Only three aircraft are operational.

The Civil Aviation Authority is urged to examine the air worthiness of these aircraft before something unpleasant happens. The Economic Coordination Committee has approved Rs460 million to control the spread of desert locust but this step has been taken quite late.

In order to avert future crop destruction by locusts, it is proposed that the department of plant protection should have a newer version of Beaver aircraft and hire more pilots and ground staff apart from building/strengthening airstrips in the desert, stocked with spare parts and insecticide.
