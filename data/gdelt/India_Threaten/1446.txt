Heavy snowfall has blanketed several parts of the world -- from US andin North America, to France and Germany in Europe, and Afghanistan and India in South Asia.The blast of Arctic air that brought record-breaking cold and caused at least a dozen deaths in the US Midwest spread eastward on Thursday, bringing sub-zero misery to the Northeast.A prediction of warmer weather by the weekend offered little comfort to those enduring icy conditions, brutal winds and temperatures as low as minus 30 F (minus 34 C)."This morning is some of the coldest of the temperatures across the upper Midwest and we still have some dangerous wind chills," Andrew Orrison, a forecaster for the National Weather Service, said in a phone interview to Reuters.In Minnesota and upper, temperatures will be at minus 20 F (minus 29 C) on Thursday and parts of North Dakota can expect minus 30 F, forecasters warned.The bitter cold was caused by displacement of the, a stream of air that normally spins around the stratosphere over the North Pole but whose current was disrupted. It pushed eastward and states including Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania were experiencing bitterly cold temperatures. Boston was at minus 5 Fahrenheit (minus 15 Celsius), according to the National Weather Service."This morning is the worst of the worst in terms of the cold," Orrison said. "It'll be the coldest outbreak of Arctic air for the Mid-Atlantic and the Northeast."Videos this week showed boiling water freezing as it was tossed in the air in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and transit workers in Chicago, Illinois, setting fire to train tracks to keep them from locking up.In Canada, the icy temperatures -- stretching from Manitoba in the western Prairies region to the Atlantic seaboard -- prompted a rare "hazardous" cold warning from the government.Environment Canada reported record-breaking snowfall at the Ottawa airport, where some 50 flights were cancelled, with an accumulation of nearly a meter (more than three feet).An additional 200 flights were cancelled at Toronto's airport.The national weather service placed about half of France on alert for snow, ice and strong winds as a storm descended Tuesday evening. Some highways were closed, notably in the Paris area and the northwestern region of Normandy.A cold front has impacted the region near Feldberg mountains around Frankfurt Germany, bringing freezing conditions.'Chillai-Kalan', the 40-day harshest period of winter in Kashmir, came to an end on Thursday but intermittent snowfall and low visibility has cut off the valley from rest of India. Srinagar-Jammu Highway remained closed while no flight has been able to land here so far, officials told PTI.The closure of the road has resulted in shortage of essentials like cooking gas and eatables including vegetables and mutton, local residents claimed.Officials of the Divisional administration maintain that some trucks, which were stranded along the highway, have been able to reach here over the past two days."The supplies have reached, we have enough stocks of essentials. There is no need to panic," a senior official said.The weatherman has forecast more rain or snowfall in the valley over the next few days, with chances of precipitation lesser on Saturday and Sunday.-- With inputs from agencies
