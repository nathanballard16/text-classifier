India’s Wild Tiger Population Rises, Despite Conflict With Humans

NEW DELHI — India’s population of endangered Bengal tigers is on the rise, officials said Monday.

According to a government estimate, there are nearly 3,000 Bengal tigers in the wild in India, a 33 percent increase since 2014. Wildlife experts say better safety monitoring and stricter wildlife policies have helped the tiger population grow to its largest in about two decades.

“Once the people of India decide to do something, there is no force that can prevent them from getting the desired results,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said at a news conference on Monday announcing the figures.

But as the number of tigers has increased, so have the human-tiger conflicts in India, a country of 1.3 billion.

India has created nearly two dozen tiger reserves in the last decade, but many are surrounded by villages. As development projects shrink the space separating humans and tigers, the animals are spilling out of reserves in search of prey — wild pigs, cattle and sometimes people.
