'War, Jihad, Falsehood, Deceit': India Exposes Imran Khanâ€™s UNGA Speech With Brilliant Tweet

New Delhi:

Pakistan's jingoism was at full display for the whole week as Imran Khan tried to target India and rake up the Kashmir issue during his US visit to attend the United Nations General Assembly. Imran Khan's speech at UNGA on Friday was the peak point of this propaganda effort with the Pakistan Prime Minister making threats of nuclear war and terror attacks against India during his speech.

Shortly after Imran Khan's speech at the annual United Nations General Assembly, India hit back at Pakistan exposing it using Khan's own words.

Raveesh Kumar, spokesperson of the Ministry of External Affairs, slammed Pakistan and Prime Minister Imran Khan for misusing the global platform. He shared a picture showing the words used by Imran Khan during his speech.

The MEA spokesperson shared an image of a map of Pakistan superimposed with the words that were part of the Pakistan PM’s speech. The graphics shared by Kumar on @MEAIndia handle, shows how Imran referred to India, PM Narendra Modi, Kashmir, RSS etc during his speech.

The caption read, "But then, not everyone feels that there is life beyond the jingoism of nuclear war, jihad, encouraging terrorism, war mongering, falsehood, deceit and misuse of the highest global platform.”

What made the tweet more striking was a comparison with Kumar's previous tweet where he had shared PM Modi's engagements at the UNGA.

"Climate change, universal health, sanitation, interaction with Fortune 500 companies, Bloomberg's Economic Forum, Mahatma Gandhi, bilateral meetings, CARICOM & Pacific Islands plurilaterals, a dignified & statesman-like address at the #UNGA," read the tweet.

PM Modi highlighted India's contribution to the world peace and how the country plans to develop in the next five years. Modi talked about India's contribution to UN peacekeeping missions, its efforts to adress the climated change problem and the highly successful 'Swacch Bharat' mission.

Compare this to Imran Khan, who according to graphics, mentioned Islam 70 times in his speech, Terrorism 23 times, Kashmir 21 times, India 16 times and PM Modi 12 times. Even the word 'bloodbath' made an appearance in his speech.

Imran Khan spoke for more than more then 50 minutes at the UNGA. However, it was almost a repeatation of the things he has been saying ever since India revoked provisions of Article 370 ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

Appealing openly to the Muslims across the world against "ethnic cleansing of Muslims" by an "RSS Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi", Khan warned of "a bloodbath" in Jammu and Kashmir when the curfew (restrictions) is lifted.

Khan even threatened that "there will be another Pulwama and then India will blame Pakistan". On February 14, 40 CRPF jawans were killed in a terror attack in Pulwama carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammed. JeM, led by Maulana Masood Azhar, is based in Pakistan.

India will use the Right to Reply option at the UN General Assembly (UNGA) in response to Khan's speech. The Right of Reply generally means the right to defend oneself against criticism in the same venue where it was made.
