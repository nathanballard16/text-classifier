In the wake of a Cyclonic Circulation over South Chhattisgarh and adjoining Odisha, heavy rains are expected to lash parts of South Chhattisgarh. The system would also give heavy Monsoon showers in the southern districts of Madhya Pradesh during the next 24 to 48 hours.

Jagdalpur has already received 202 mm of rain in a span of just 24 hours from 8.30 am on Sunday. And the city may continue to receive heavy Monsoon rains for another two to three days.

Meanwhile, good rains are expected in the central and northern districts of Chhattisgarh. However, the intensity would comparatively be more over the southern parts.

Similarly, the western and southwestern parts of Madhya Pradesh such as Sehore, Guna, Bhopal, etc have observed heavy rains in the last two to three days.

Now we expect the areas lying South of Madhya Pradesh to see moderate to heavy Monsoon rains. The spread and cover of the rains would gradually increase and other areas will also start observing enhanced rainfall activities. This spell is likely to continue until August 2. During this period, local flooding cannot be ruled out in South Chhattisgarh and parts of Madhya Pradesh.

The axis of Monsoon Trough continues to pass through South Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Moreover, back to back Low-Pressure Areas are expected to form soon due to which Monsoon rains will remain active in the states.

Due to good amounts of rainfall in the recent past, West Madhya Pradesh is rain surplus. We expect rainfall amounts to become surplus in East Madhya Pradesh as well considering chances of good showers in the region.
