Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said the government wanted to “break the back of terrorism” and would take all steps for a peaceful and prosperous Kashmir.

After e-inaugurating several infrastructure and development projects for Kashmir and elsewhere, PM Modi said a peaceful atmosphere would help development and progress in the state.

“We want to break the back of terrorism in the state,” he said at the Sher-e-Kashmir International Conference Centre after inspecting the Dal lake here this afternoon.

Modi said surgical strikes had shown to the world the new policy (neeti) and tradition (reeti) of the country in responding to acts of terror.

He said it was painful to learn about the killing of youth in the state, particularly Kashmir valley, where the youth were being targeted by the (separatist) militants.

Without referring to the separatists, he said the people of Kashmir, by participating in the urban local body and panchayat elections last year, had sent across a clear message to those believing in “hatred and negativity”.

“It was a clear message for them (separatists) as the people made clear their belief in the democratic process of the country,” Modi said. He also referred to former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee’s dreams for Kashmir and added that his government would continue to fulfill the dreams for uplifting the trouble-torn state.

He reiterated his slogan of “Sab ka saath sab ka vikas” for a prosperous Kashmir, saying that his government would continue to “strive for that”. Modi pointed out that his government had the distinction of completing projects on the ground, which had not been the practice of the previous government.

During his rally in Vijaypur, Jammu, Modi talked about a “very emotional issue” of Kashmiri Pandits, saying he have been bearing the pain of their exodus.
