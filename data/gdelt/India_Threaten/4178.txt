Agra: Dalit whose marriage procession faced caste protest gets offers to contest Lok Sabha polls

AGRA: Two political parties have offered an election ticket to Sanjay Jatav , a Dalit , whose baraat was opposed by the Thakurs of Nizampur village in Kasganj , to contest Lok Sabha polls from the Hathras seat.Jatav has been approached by Ambedkar Samaj Party and Jan Adhikar Party to contest the election. “I will choose a political party to fight elections soon,” he said. “My endeavour is to bring equality in society, and I believe that 18 lakh voters of Hathras will back me,” he added.Last year, after upper caste men stopped him from taking out his procession through the village, he approached police, who came to his aid.Tej Singh, chairperson of Ambedkar Samaj Party, allied with Shivpal Singh Yadav ’s Pragatisheel Samajwadi Party , said, “We want Sanjay to contest elections on our ticket as he represents the new face of Dalit youth. He fought against all odds to break a regressive tradition.”Babu Singh Kushwaha of Jan Adhikar Party has also approached Sanjay. Kushwaha was a senior member of the UP cabinet until he was named in the NRHM scam .
