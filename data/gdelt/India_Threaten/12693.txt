Pakistan rules out change in its nuclear policy

Pakistan won't start war or use nukes first against India, says Imran Khan

ISLAMABAD: A day after Prime Minister Imran Khan unexpectedly announced that Pakistan will not use nuclear weapons or initiate military action against India first, Islamabad on Tuesday in a U-Turn said that there was no such change in its nuclear policy.Addressing an event of Sikh community in Lahore on Monday, Khan had said that both Pakistan and India were nuclear-armed countries and if tension escalated between them, the whole world could be in danger. “But there will be no first from our side ever,” Khan reportedly said.However, Dr Muhammad Faisal, spokesperson of the foreign affairs ministry, in a tweet said, “Prime Minister’s comments on Pakistan’s approach towards conflict between two nuclear armed states are being taken out of context.” “While conflict should not take place between two nuclear states, there’s no change in Pakistan’s nuclear policy,” he added.Since New Delhi nullified the special status of Jammu and Kashmir on August 5, Imran Khan has been appealing to the world leaders asking them to play their part in resolving the Kashmir issue to prevent a fatal war, a reference to the use of nuclear weapons between Pakistan and India. Khan has repeatedly warning the international community that Pakistan-India conflict will not be limited to South Asia but will have global consequences.Last month, India’s Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had said that his country’s commitment to ‘No First Use’ (NFU) policy for nuclear weapons may see a shift in future. “It is for now, but what happens in future depends on the circumstances,” Singh had said.
