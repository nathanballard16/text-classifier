OU warns former students to vacate hostels

Hyderabad: The Vice-Chancellor of Osmania University Prof. S. Ramachandram has warned ex-students to vacate the hostels immediately.

Some students who have already completed their courses are overstaying in hostels as they prepare for competitive examinations.

Now, the university plans to seek the help of the police to evacuate the ex-students. They also cautioned them that the authorities would not intervene in-case of police raids.

The former students are occupying accommodation which meant for fresh students hailing from districts.
