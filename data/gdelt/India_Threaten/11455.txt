Rajkot: Man who tried to sabotage marriage of daughter's friend identified

AHMEDABAD: A 48-year-old man has been identified as the person responsible for sending lewd and malicious messages about a friend of his daughter's, to malign her so that her marriage would be broken.Cyber cell sources said they have identified the accused and have dispatched a team to arrest him.In a complaint lodged by the 23-year-old victim, she stated that she is friends with the accused's daughter and they used to spend time together. "A few years ago, she was engaged to a youth from Rajkot, but the 48-year-old man created a fake social media ID and sent malicious messages to her fiance, which alluded that she "was not of good character" and that he should break off the engagement. Her fiance apparently broke off the engagement over this," a cyber cell investigator said. About one year back, the victim married another man from Rajkot.The accused once again created a fake social media profile and started messaging the victim's husband. "He told the husband that the victim's engagement was once broken off 'due to her character' and that 'she had a lot of boyfriends'. The victim's husband did not believe this and spoke to his wife about the messages. She was surprised, because she did not know her broken engagement had been precipitated by social media messages," said a cyber cell official.
