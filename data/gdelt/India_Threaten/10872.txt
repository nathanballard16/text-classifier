Uhuru made arrangements for Laboso to be taken to India for treatment — DP William Ruto

Deputy President William Ruto on Friday thanked President Uhuru Kenyatta for his unconditional support to the late Bomet Governor Joyce Laboso during her fight with cancer.

Speaking during Laboso’s funeral service in Bomet, Ruto recalled seeing Laboso in hospital three months ago and he was so confident that she would recover almost immediately.

“When I went to see Joyce about three months ago, I was so confident that she would be alright.

“I prayed with her and told her that she would go to London and come back to a big celebration in Bomet.

“I regret that I was not right,” said the DP.

He stated that after doctors had requested Laboso’s family to take her home, President Uhuru Kenyatta stepped in to offer assistance.

“The President called me and asked me whether we are bringing Joyce home or taking her to India.

“You and Edwin better agree because I want to do the best for Joyce,” said Ruto.

The DP then told the President that Laboso would be taken to India and he (Uhuru) quickly made arrangements for the trip to take place.

“Your excellency, you were a genuine friend to Joyce,” said Ruto.

Earlier, Edwin Abonyo, Laboso’s husband, thanked the Head of State for his continuous support during his wife’s trips to hospital, constantly checking on her progress.





Various leaders described the deceased as a strong leader who did not like confrontation and held the people of Bomet close to her heart.

She will be laid to rest on Saturday at her matrimonial home in Fort Ternan.
