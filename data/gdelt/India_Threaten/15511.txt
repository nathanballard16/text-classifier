Trouble brewing at AIM-listed Koovs, the wannabe Asos of India

When Lord Waheed Alli sent out invitations to investors, analysts and journalists to attend a presentation about Koovs, the wannabe Asos of India, he had no idea he would have to cancel.

It was Oct 10. Eleven days later, a vital £6.8m funding injection from Kishore Biyani, a retail billionaire in India, collapsed. The Capital Markets Day was subsequently cancelled.

Koovs has warned since that it has £3.3m in the bank until the end of the year to stay afloat. It will also pause spending cash on new stock and marketing, its biggest expense.

Doubts over Koovs’ future are building five years after Lord Alli, or Baron Alli of Norbury in the London borough of Croydon, listed the business on London’s junior stock market, AIM.

His ambition to replicate the growth he oversaw at Asos for 12 years as chairman seems improbable despite a recent uptick in sales. It posted a loss before tax of £15.5m for the year to end of March, flat on the previous year. Sales were down to £7.5m from £9.6m.
