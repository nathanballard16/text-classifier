Pak government promotes controversial Khalistani sympathiser Gopal Singh Chawla in ETPB's committee

AMRITSAR: After the inclusion of the controversial Khalistani sympathiser Gopal Singh Chawla in the Kartarpur corridor panel setup, the Pakistan government has raised eyebrows yet again by including him in the newly constituted 24-member committee of the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB).According to highly placed intelligence sources, Pakistan’s ministry of religious affairs and interfaith harmony issued a notification with regards to the reconstitution of the ETPB. The twenty-four member committee includes six official and nineteen non-officials members.While official members includes chairman, additional secretary, secretary ( human rights and minorities affairs, secretary (minority affairs department), secretary (auqaf, haj, religious and minority affairs ) and secretary (religious affairs and interfaith harmony).The non-official members includes Gopal Singh Chawla and Pakistan’s Hindu, Sikh and Muslims members from the provincial assembly.Sources informed that the government revamped the ETPB body on April 19 when Khalistani ideologues from UK, US and other countries were camping in Pakistan.On March 27, Pakistan's’ federal minister for information and broadcasting Chaudhary Fawad Hussain had announced the ten-member committee comprising of Gopal Singh Chawla. Following which, the India’s external affairs objected to the inclusion of ‘controversial elements’ in the ten-member committee.Hours after objections were raised, Chawla, presumably on the directions of Pakistani government, blocked his Facebook account, having pictures with Mumbai terror attack mastermind Hafiz Sayed and hates speeches against India. But he began uploading Khalistani propaganda material on his Facebook page.“Pakistan is on way of realisation of our worst dream of using Kartarpur corridor for making Khalistan’s propaganda and fanning anti-India sentiments and by including Chawla in the ETPB committeee it has done the same” said sources.Notably Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has already warned against Pakistan government’s designs and had raised on Pak army’s interest and intentions to open the Kartarpur corridor.
