Gadkari issues stern warning to Pakistan, says stop supporting terrorism or else river water will be stopped

There was water treaty between India and Pakistan in 1960 and its basis was peaceful relations, but if the present face of terrorism is not changed, in such circumstances, India wouldn't take much time to take the harsh decision of stopping river water to Pakistan, the BJP leader said.

"The Union government is already making a road map to stop water of rivers flowing from India into Pakistan," he said Gadkari was speaking while campaigning for Amritsar BJP candidate Hardeep Puri. The minister said that the government is planning to build six water dams in Punjab, Haryana, Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and this step would solve the water problem enormously.
