The fake Facebook page also encouraged users to share the post and spread it to family and friends.

In April, Netsafe chief executive Martin Cocker said scams were increasingly being repackaged to target people via social media.

"The most effective scams on social media are transferred through friends' networks because, naturally, your guard's down when you receive posts that are from friends and people you trust," Cocker said.

According to Netsafe Kiwis lost $33 million to online scams last year.

The figure reversed a trend that had seen reported losses drift down from just over $13 million in 2015 to $10m in 2017.

The most common scams were "tech support" phone scams believed to be mostly run out of call centres in India.

But the most costly scams for victims were romance and investment scams, where victims are duped into sending large amounts of money overseas.
