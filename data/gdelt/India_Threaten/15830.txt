Ayodhya verdict today: No objectionable posts, no slogans, no celebrations, warn cops

The Pune City Police, Pimpri-Chinchwad Police and Pune Rural Police have taken steps to maintain law and order and prevent any untoward incidents in their jurisdictions after the Supreme Court delivers the Ayodhya verdict on Saturday.

“We are prepared. A force comprising 500 officers and 8,500 personnel will be on duty. Even police personnel on leave have been called in. We appeal to people to maintain peace,” said Joint Commissioner of Police Ravindra Shisve.

Police have also warned of action against those found to be spreading objectionable content on social media. Police are keeping a close watch on social media posts.

A press release by Shisve on Friday appealed local residents, especially those using social media, to prevent posting any content that will hurt sentiments of persons from any religion.

The press release stated that Pune residents should inform the cyber police station on 020-29710097, 8975433100 and 8975283100 about any suspicious and objectionable information on social media platforms.

Police have also asked Pune residents not to burst crackers after the verdict or raise slogans that will hurt religious sentiments. People should avoid putting up banners and taking out processions after the Supreme Court verdict, said police.

Police have also urged people not to forward any content regarding communal incidents that have taken place in the past, and to avoid rumour-mongering.

On Thursday, police had organised meetings with leaders of different communities and other prominent persons, including those who are part of various committees, at all police stations in Pune City Police and Pimpri-Chinchwad jurisdictions.

Police will also keep a close watch on sensitive places and ‘trouble makers’, said sources.
