Delhi based hip-hop phenoms Prabh Deep and Sez on the beat have dropped new music acting as an interlude between their seminal debut album Class-Sikh and Prabh’s next offering 84 - 18 - his sophomore project that promises to take an in-depth look into the 1984 anti-Sikh pogrom. Titled as K.O. , this will be a continuing series of short productive outputs by the duo, showcasing their versatility and talent.

The new music video released by Azadi Records is directed by Anurag Sharma. Shot among Delhi lanes, the video looks slick with the duo’s crew backing the singer and producer’s flow.
