Mamata Banerjee on Congress and Left: We will fight together at the national level

New Delhi:

The situation in the country is worse than an emergency, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday and asserted that she would fight along with the Congress and Left at the national level despite their bitter rivalry in the state. Democracy has become 'Namocracy' under PM Modi-led NDA government at the Centre, said Trinamool Congress chief.

“We will fight collectively in coming days. Whatever fight we have with the Congress, CPM will be limited to state. We will fight together at the national level. Let them fight against me, I don't mind. For the interest of the nation, I'm ready to sacrifice my life/party,” the West Bengal chief minister said while addressing a mega rally organised by the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) at the Jantar Mantar in the national capital.

"Opposition parties will fight unitedly at the national level," she asserted.

She also attacked the Centre over the CBI's failed bid to question Kolkata police commissioner Rajeev Kumar at his home, saying she had not seen a government that "stooped so low".

"It is Prime Minister's last day as an elected leader in Parliament today," she said after the Lok Sabha adjourned sine die. "Everyone is afraid of Gabbar Singh. There are two of them -- (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi and (BJP chief Amit) Shah," she added.

A host of opposition leaders including TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu, National Conference's Farooq Abdullah, Nationalist Congress Party's Sharad Pawar and CPI(M)'s Sitaram Yechury spoke during the rally.
