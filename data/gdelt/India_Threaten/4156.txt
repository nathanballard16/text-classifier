Pakistan May Move Int'l Court if India Engages in 'Water Aggression' - Islamabad

Earlier, on Sunday, India's Minister of State for Water Resources Arjun Mehghwal claimed that water amounting to 0.53 million acre-feet from its eastern rivers, which was flowing into Pakistan, had been stopped and would be utilized for drinking and irrigation purposes.

"0.53 million acre-feet water has been stopped from going to Pakistan and has been stored. Whenever Rajasthan or Punjab needs it, that water can be used for drinking and irrigation purposes", Meghwal said while speaking to media on Sunday.

Arjun Meghwal claims that India has stopped water flowing into Pakistan.

The Indian government had been threatening to launch a water war against Pakistan since the 2016 Uri terrorist attack. As tensions escalated once again after a suicide terrorist attack that killed 40 Indian soldiers in the Pulwama district of Kashmir, the Indian government once again reiterated that it will stop the flow of water from three rivers that were part of the Indus Treaty. India has a positional advantage in controlling the flow of the Indus Basin Rivers, but due to lack of hydrological infrastructure, it has never used this weapon.

The World Bank-brokered Indus Water Treaty has withstood many ebbs and lows of Indo-Pak ties, including three wars and a skirmish. India now feels the treaty is lop-sided, as it was allowed to use only 20 percent of the water that flows from the first three rivers of the Indus basin, while water from the other three rivers allocated to India flows freely into Pakistan.
