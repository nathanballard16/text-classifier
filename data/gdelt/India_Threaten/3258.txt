ISLAMABAD, Feb 27 — Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan today called for talks with India and hoped “better sense” would prevail to de-escalate the dispute with its nuclear-armed neighbour following air strikes by both sides.

“History tells us that wars are full of miscalculation. My question is that given the weapons we have can we afford miscalculation,” Khan said during a brief televised broadcast to the nation. “We should sit down and talk.” — Reuters
