In a statement, Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr Muhammad Faisal said the Indian forces along the Line of Control and the Working boundary are continuously targeting civilian populated areas with heavy weapons.

He said the deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas is indeed deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws.

The Spokesperson said the ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.

He urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement; investigate these and other incidents of ceasefire violations; instruct the Indian forces to respect the ceasefire, in letter and spirit and maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary.
