New Delhi: The Intelligence Bureau (IB) has warned the Delhi Police of potential terror attacks in the National Capital Region (NCR) by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) supported terror groups.

India’s internal spy agency warned that Al-umar-Mujahideen (AuM) might carry out the attacks outside Kashmir valley in the backdrop of Centre scrapping Jammu & Kashmir’s special status, a report by the news agency IANS said.

The IB in a top secret report said: "With Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) exposed at international platforms, Al-umar-Mujahideen (AuM) is the new poster boy of ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence) and is capable of carrying major terror strikes outside the Valley".
