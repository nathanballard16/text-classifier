NEW DELHI: The government has drawn up a list of around a dozen state-run firms which can go for possible buybacks in this financial year.The list includes, Container Corporation of India and some other rail sector central public sector enterprises (CPSEs), according to officials. They said the identified companies will discuss plans with their administrative ministries regarding the time and size of buybacks.“Discussions are on with the administrative ministries and now the firms are expected to share their buyback plans,” said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.Other CPSEs which may opt for buybacks include MMTC, he said.In 2018-19, the government had raised around Rs 17,000 crore through share buybacks from CPSEs including Oil and Natural Gas Corporation,, NMDC and. The total collection from disinvestment during the year was Rs 84,972.16 crore.A finance ministry official said that if the firms do not have capital expenditure plans or are unable to come out with a public offering, they will have to explore the buyback route. “Now there is this tax issue, but then we will have to see how it plays out,” he said.In the budget for 2018-19, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced an additional tax of 20% in case of buyback of shares by listed companies.As per existing guidelines, every CPSE having a net worth of at least Rs 2,000 crore and cash and bank balance of Rs 1,000 crore shall exercise the option to buy back its shares.According to experts the government will continue to use the buyback tool as it aims to push CPSEs towards increasing capital expenditure. “We will have to see if government firms participating in buybacks get any tax exemption which may further help these firms to come with buyback offers,” said Jagannadham Thunuguntla, senior vice president at Centrum Broking.The government will also be focusing on strategic sales this year given that it now has the mandate to bring down its holding in select firms below 51%. It has set a disinvestment target of Rs 1.05 lakh crore in 2019-20.Sitharaman had said that the Centre would be open to bringing down its stake below 51% in a government owned firm provided the combined stake of the government or government-owned agencies stays above that threshold. Already, there is ‘inprinciple’ approval for strategic disinvestment of 23 CPSEs.
