Randeep Hooda Gets Injured On The Sets Of Salman Khan's 'Radhe' & Is Back In Action Now

Randeep Hooda, who will be next seen playing the antagonist in Salman Khan's Radhe, is training hard to fit into his role. Foraying into this genre, the actor is leaving no stone unturned to look absolutely convincing on the big screen.

However, the recent development is that he got injured on the sets of the film while canning a power-packed action sequence for the film.

According to news reports, the 43-year-old actor suffered a slight dislocation in the knee and had to be rushed to the Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani hospital in Mumbai.

A picture of the actor is also doing the rounds on social media which shows him sitting on the wheelchair. He is reportedly back from the hospital, recuperating well from the injury, and is in good health now.

Well, Salman clearly couldn't save the actor from getting hurt on the sets.

Coming back to the movie, Salman has reportedly signed a special Korean stunt team to design the action sequences.

Salman and Randeep will be at loggerheads in the action sequences which may also involve a shirtless fight scene between the two actors. The action-packed film will also feature a smoke fight, hand-to-hand combat, gun shootouts and a lot more.

This is not the first time Randeep will be seen sharing the screen space with Salman as the two have previously worked together in the 2016 action-drama Sultan.

It will be a visual treat to watch the two actors in one frame in the much-awaited Radhe. The movie is scheduled to hit the screens on May 20, 2020, during Eid.
