The Maharashtra unit of the Karni Sena on Moday warned actress Kangana Ranaut that its members would burn down the sets of her films if she continued to criticise the outfit.

"If she continues to threaten us, we will ensure that she will not be able to step into Maharashtra. We will burn the sets of her films and destroy her career," Ajay Singh Sengar, president of the Maharashtra Karni Sena told reporters here.

The Karni Sena, which had threatened violence against the movie 'Padmavat' two years ago, has now set its eyes on 'Manikarnika - The Queen of Jhansi' in which Ranaut plays the eponymous role.

The outfit, which claims to represent Rajputs, has demanded that the producers hold a special screening for its members before its commercial release.

Sengar also warned that members of his outfit would attack theatres if the film was released without their approval.

The Karni Sena has opposed to scenes of Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi dancing to a song and her alleged relationship with a British officer.

Following threats issued by Karni Sena earlier this week, Ranaut had warned that she would 'destroy it' if they disrupted the film's release. "If they don't stop then they should know I am also a Rajput and I will destroy each one of them," she was quoted as saying. Ranaut is also the co-director of the movie.

The biopic on Rani Laxmibai of Jhansi, whose maiden name was Manikarnika, is due for release on January 25.
