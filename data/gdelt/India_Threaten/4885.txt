Pact in Jammu, fighting in Valley: BJP on NC, Congress

National General Secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Ram Madhav on Tuesday said the alliance between the Congress and the National Conference (NC) is a dichotomy everyone fails to understand.

Addressing a party meeting in Srinagar, Ram Madhav said, "J&K is one state. The NC and the Congress have alliance in Jammu region, while they will fight each other in the Valley.

"It is a dichotomy everyone fails to understand. They are double-faced and double-tongued. They say one thing in Delhi and quite the opposite in the Valley."

These are their gimmicks to fight the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, he said, adding that they will not succeed by doing such dramas.

Madhav expressed hope that the BJP would produce better results in the state during these elections.

The BJP had bagged three out of the six Lok Sabha seats in 2014 elections in the state.

Out of 87 members in the state Legislative Assembly, the BJP had 25 while it had the support of two other members of the Peoples Conference (PC) led by Sajad Lone.
