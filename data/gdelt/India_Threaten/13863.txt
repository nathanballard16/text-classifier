UP triple talaq victims to get Rs 6,000-a-year support: Yogi

LUCKNOW: UP CM Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday announced a rehabilitation package for triple talaq victims in the state, including an annual payment of Rs 6,000 each to the affected women till they become self-reliant. Yogi has asked the home, social welfare and minority affairs departments to prepare the plan, which will include Rs 5 lakh insurance cover for the victims and their children on the lines of Ayushman Bharat, apart from free legal aid.The CM announced the package at an event where he met the victims of triple talaq. He promised action against those police personnel who have not handled cases of triple talaq as per the new law. Every woman who attended the event was asked to submit her case details to additional chief secretary (home) Awanish Awasthi, who has been tasked to monitor each case. A total of 127 applications were received.Elaborating on the rehabilitation plan, Yogi said: “Women who are educated should be absorbed within the system and given employment. Women who are thrown out of their homes should be given houses under the PM Awas Yojna or the CM Awas Yojna. We would also look at linking them with Waqf properties across the state.”He added that police had filed FIRs in 273 cases of triple talaq in the past one year. Yogi also warned that action would be taken against those Hindu men who go for a second marriage and abandon or harass their first wife. “No leniency should be allowed,” he said while emphasising that the BJP government was “working without any bias”.
