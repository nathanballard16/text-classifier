Nagaland names 5 endangered species for recovery programme



Dimapur, June 27 (EMN): The government of Nagaland has identified five most endangered species among the state’s wildlife population to be included in the first phase of the Recovery Programme of Endangered Species.

A press release from the state’s Principal Chief Conservator of Forests and Chief Wildlife Warden, Dr. Ramesh K Aima on Thursday informed that the species identified were: hoolock gibbon, clouded leopard, Malayan sun bear, Blyth’s tragopan and black softshell turtle.

The decision was taken during the first meeting of the State Wildlife Advisory Board held at the chief minister’s secretariat office, under the chairmanship of Chief Minister Neiphiu Rio, on June 26, it informed.

During the discussion, there were suggestions to add more species to the programme, including Mithun.

The chief minister also expressed concern that the celebration of Amur falcon week in the state takes place during the roosting period of the birds, leading to disturbance at the roosting sites.

Rio suggested identifying “the best time for the celebration week in such a way that there is least disturbance to the birds”; and conduct awareness programmes to sensitise people about the event.

The advisory board also approved the agenda of notification of all community conservation areas as community reserves in accordance with The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, in a phased manner.

Other legislators to attend the meeting include Dr. Neikiesalie Kire, Toshi Wungtung and T Amenba Yaden. Dr. Suresh Kumar, senior scientist at Wildlife institute of India; Dr. Divanshu, scientist at the Zoological Survey of India; Dr. N Odyuo, senior scientist at the Botanical Survey of India, and other eminent wildlife activists and conservationists attended the meeting.
