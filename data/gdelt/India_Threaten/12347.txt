Mamata Govt To Table Anti-Lynching Bill In Bengal; Accused To Get Life Term, Fine Up To Rs 5 Lakh

"Whoever contributes or enforces a hostile environment on a person or a group of persons shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend up to three years," the senior TMC minister said. The legislation will pitch for a jail term, which may vary from three years to life, for those involved in assaulting and injuring a victim of mob violence.

The Mamata Banerjee-led West Bengal government is likely to table an anti-lynching bill in the Legislative Assembly that proposes a maximum punishment of life imprisonment along with a fine ranging between Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The bill has been planned by the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) to check incidents of mob assault and lynching in the state. According to reports, the West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019 is likely to be tabled in the House on August 30. "The bill aims to protect the constitutional rights of vulnerable persons and prevent incidents of lynching. It also proposes action against those involved in perpetrating the crime," a senior TMC minister told news agency PTI. As per the current legislation, if anyone is found guilty of publishing, communicating and disseminating any offensive material either physically or electronically, shall be liable to imprisonment up to one year and fine up to Rs 50,000, the minister said giving a broad outline of the bill.
