Concentration risk rising: 5 key states account for 55% of MFI loans

“During FY16-19, the MFI loans disbursed in the Rs 50,000-60,000 ticket size range registered 55% CAGR, while disbursements in more than Rs 60,000 ticket size showed sharp 108% CAGR,” MOFSL’s report said.

“Concentration risk” is rising in the country’s microfinance industry as Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Bihar, Karnataka and Maharashtra — the top five key states for the industry — currently account for 55% of the total microfinance loans in India, reflecting ‘caution’ among microfinance institutions (MFIs).

“Further, the East and the North-East regions account for 40% of the total industry. During FY16-2QFY20, microfinance loans in Bihar and West Bengal expanded sharply at 48% and 35%, respectively, versus industry growth of 31%. Further, the top-30 districts account for 24% of the total outstanding portfolio (as on FY19),” according to a latest report by Motilal Oswal Financial Services (MOFSL) on the microfinance industry.

“All this points towards concentration risk rising in few states/districts led by increasing average ticket size, which in turn reflects caution in the sector,” the report said. In order to maintain robust loan growth momentum in the industry, various MFI players have increased the average ticket size in some key geographies, such as West Bengal, Assam and Tamil Nadu.

“During FY16-19, the MFI loans disbursed in the Rs 50,000-60,000 ticket size range registered 55% CAGR, while disbursements in more than Rs 60,000 ticket size showed sharp 108% CAGR,” MOFSL’s report said. West Bengal has the highest average ticket size per borrower at Rs 54,000, followed by Assam (Rs 52,000) and Tamil Nadu (Rs 43,000). Bihar has the highest number of operational NBFCs-MFIs, while Delhi has the lowest number of operational microfinance institutions at the end of the second quarter of the current fiscal.

According to the MOFSL report, Bihar and Delhi have 35 and 5 operational MFIs, respectively. Odisha has 28 microfinance institutions, while three states — Jharkhand, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh — have 26 MFIs.
