Cannot trust Pakistan on intent behind Kartarpur: Punjab CM

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Saturday reiterated that he did not trust Pakistan ’s intent behind opening the Kartarpur Corridor and that their agenda was “nefarious and political and aimed at exploiting the sentiments of the Sikhs”.Speaking to mediapersons to list out achievements of his government after completing two years in office, Amarinder said the need to keep a close watch on the corridor needed to be underlined. He added that while he was all for the corridor, which was a matter of devotion for the Sikhs, there was need to exercise caution. Pakistan was doing it with a different intent, which was not at all aimed at promoting peace, the CM added.“India’s agenda is religious but theirs is totally disruptive,” he said, citing ‘Referendum 2020’ as an example of ISI’s attempts to exploiting Sikh sentiments to divide and destabilize Punjab, and in fact the entire nation.“While Pak Prime Minister Imran Khan talks of peace, their army chief General Bajwa continues to promote his evil designs,” said Amarinder warning that the number of ISI-backed terror modules busted in Punjab in recent months indicated their true intent. The grenades used in Maqsudan and Pathankot attacks were of Pak origin, he added.In response to a question, the chief minister said the number of devotees proposed by Islamabad to be allowed to pass the corridor was not at all sufficient and he wanted at least 15,000 pilgrims to be permitted to visit the historic gurdwara through the corridor every day. He reiterated his demand for ‘khule darshan’ at the Kartarpur gurdwara, questioning the rationale behind having a corridor at all if the need for passport and visa was still there.‘Cong govt would have also atced after Pulwama’Asked if the recent air strikes by the Indian Air Force would benefit the BJP in the coming elections, Captain Amarinder said any government of the day, including the Congress, would have retaliated after the Pulwama attack. The government just did its job, which Congress governments had done in the past too, he said, adding that the Modi government had simply coined a new phrase – surgical strikes – for such action.
