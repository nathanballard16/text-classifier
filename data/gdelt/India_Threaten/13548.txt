RAJKOT: A building contractor was arrested for raping a 28-year-old woman number of times by promising her a good job in Rajkot city on Thursday.

The accused Dipesh Mishra (35), native of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh, was arrested from his house on Dhebar road after the woman lodged complaint with the University police station on Wednesday night.

Police said that Mishra is accused in couple of other cases of forging land documents and for carrying illegal arms. He was out on bail in both the cases, they added.

According to the woman’s complaint, she had come in contact with Mishra two months back when she was searching for job to support her mother and her seven-year-old son, as she had recently separated from her husband and their divorce process was on.

Mishra promised the woman a good job through his contacts. He had also helped her with the admission of her son in the school. Later, about a month back, Mishra helped the woman fined a new house in Munjka village of Rajkot. On the day the woman shifted to the new home, Mishra allegedly raped her for the first time.

Police said that Mishra later threatened to kill the woman’s son and her mother and raped her 3-4 times.

Tired of repeated abuses and threats, the woman lodged complaint against Mishra with the University police station on Wednesday. Based on the complaint Mishra was arrested on Thursday morning.
