SURAT: BJP president Amit Shah on Sunday asked people belonging to Modh Vanik Samaj to dedicate their two months to help Prime Minister Narendra Modi get re-elected to the post in the ensuing Lok Sabha elections.Addressing the national convention of the community in the city, Shah said after the United States and Russia, India has also become a country that can take immediate action if someone hits its security personnel.India will be among the top five economies soon, he said and listed BJP-led NDA government’s achievements to the members of Shree Surti Modhvanik Samasta Panch, Shree Samast Gujarati Modh Modi Samaj and Akhil Bharatiya Tailik Sahu Mahasabha, who were attending the convention.“We suffered a lot at the hands of terrorists belonging to Pakistan. 26\11 attack, Mumbai bomb blasts and other such incidents are still fresh in our minds. However, today the masterminds of terror get reply within 24 hours thanks to our political will. But statements of people like Akhilesh, Mamata and Rahul are music to the enemy’s ears. If they can’t praise the work of the government, they should keep quite,” the BJP president said.“Prime Minister Modi has received awards from international organizations and several countries for the work he has done. Today BJP-led NDA and BJP have governments in 16 states. This means our government cares for the people,” Shah said, adding that Modi sincerely works for 18 hours in a day.“BJP has given a Prime Minister, who is decisive and sensitive of people’s needs. He is one of the most popular Prime Ministers that the country ever had. I urge you all members of his community to give two months from your busy schedule to ensure that Modi is reelected as the Prime Minister,” the BJP president said.Jharkhand chief minister Raghubar Das and Shree Samast Gujarati Modh Modi Sama president and Prime Minister’s brother Soma Modi were among those who attended the convention.
