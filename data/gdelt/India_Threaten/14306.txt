Ola driver who abandoned woman customer at a deserted spot in Bengaluru arrested

City police arrested and released the Ola driver, who abandoned a woman customer at a deserted spot in the wee hours of Wednesday when she insisted he take a different route.

The woman passenger took the cab at 3:15 am from Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) to Indiranagar. The passenger asked the driver to take the National Highway route when she observed he was on the alternative route that was not well-lit and was where a cab driver had killed a woman passenger in July, also in the wee hours of the day.

The Ola driver Shivashankar got her off the cab at 3:30 am and drove off, following which she lodged a complaint with the police.

Bheemashankar S. Guled, DCP (North East) said they had arrested and released the driver on bail. Police have booked a case under Section 336 of IPC for an act endangering the personal safety or life of others.
