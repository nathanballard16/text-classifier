Hate crimes on alarming rise in India: AI

In India, hate crimes have witnessed the steepest rise in numbers since 2016.

This has been revealed by Amnesty International India’s interactive website ‘Halt the Hate’ in its latest data on hate crimes for the first six months of 2019.

The report said that in the first six months of 2019 alone, 181 incidents of hate crimes had been recorded by the website, nearly double than previous three years’ half-yearly counts.

Aakar Patel of Amnesty International India said people are targeted because of their identity stemming from race, religion, caste and gender amongst others.
