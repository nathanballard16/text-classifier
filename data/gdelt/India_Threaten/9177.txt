Weather Forecast Today HIGHLIGHTS: Monsoon hits Mumbai today, covers entire Maharashtra

Weather forecast and Temperature today HIGHLIGHTS: Monsoon hit Mumbai Tuesday, covering all of Maharashtra after a rather slow-progressing stage experienced until last week. The monsoon, which generally arrives in Mumbai on June 10 every year, is behind schedule by more than two weeks, which is the longest such delay in the last ten years. Strong monsoon winds are likely to prevail between June 25 and June 28, making the further advancement swifter.

Up North, mercury in the national capital is likely to drop owing to light rainfall, easterly winds, and a western disturbance. Moisture-laden easterly winds are moving towards Delhi while western disturbance is also affecting weather activity in the hills and the northern plains. The Met Department, meanwhile, has issued fresh yellow weather warning for thunderstorms in Himachal Pradesh till Tuesday.

Meanwhile, severe rainfall deficit in Kerala is being seen as the result of the late onset of the southwest monsoon and the emergence of Cyclone Vayu in the southeast Arabian Sea before it moved northwest towards the Gujarat coast.
