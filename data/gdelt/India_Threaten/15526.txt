New Delhi, November 2

Lawyers and police clashed at Tis Hazari Court complex here this afternoon during which at least 20 police personnel and several lawyers were injured, while many vehicles were vandalised, according to officials and eyewitnesses.

The injured included Additional Commissioner of Police (North District) Harinder Kumar, SHOs of Kotwali and Civil Lines, and the operator of Deputy Commissioner of Police (North), the police said.

Lawyers alleged that many of their colleagues were injured, including two in police firing, but the police said they fired in the air. Both parties have lodged complaints and the cases will be probed by a special investigation team of the Crime Branch. Bar associations condemned the incident and called a one-day strike across all district courts in the Capital on November 4.

Secretary of Tis Hazari Bar Association Jaiveer Singh Chauhan said a lawyer’s car allegedly hit a police jail van following which an argument ensued between him and the police personnel. “He was then taken to a lockup and beaten up,” he alleged. Chauhan claimed that the police fired four rounds of bullets.

A police vehicle was set on fire and eight others were vandalised during the fracas. Eight bikes were also torched, the officials said, adding that the Fire Department dispatched 10 fire engines to the spot. — PTI
