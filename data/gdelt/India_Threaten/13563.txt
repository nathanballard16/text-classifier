Prison officials must correct and transform inmates, says DGP Megharikh

MYSURU: Warders must care for prisoners like the shepherd who cares for his wounded sheep, said N S Megharikh, DGP, Karnataka Prisons and Correctional Services, on Thursday.Megharikh was addressing the first batch of trainee warders of the Temporary Police Training School on the City Armed Reserve Grounds.“Though convicts or undertrials may be aggressive outside, when they are sent behind bars they become like rats and may slip into depression, affecting their mental health. It is the job of courts and authorities having magisterial powers to punish the wrongdoers and put them behind bars, but the work of prison officers is to correct and transform them,” Megharikh said.The DGP said, “We’re not jailors of the British era. We’re living in a democratic society and have to work according to its principles. We have to ensure human rights are not violated and moreover be cautious about our safety at work places, too.”In an effort to cut the number of vacancies, the department is going all out in its efforts. Soon, the Karnataka Prisons Department will become a model government agency in the country by bringing down the number of vacancies to zero. In the last 18 months, 1,070 warders were trained and deputed and another 700 will be added, the DGP said.Department consultant H S Revanna, a former IPS officer, briefed about various reforms brought in the administration, and infrastructure development, said a proposal to set up Prisons Development Board is pending before the government and once it is set up the department will become financially self-reliant.Southern range IGP Vipul Kumar, police commissioner K T Balakrishna and SP C B Ryshyanth, DCPs M Muthuraj, B T Kavitha and Temporary Police Training School principal DCP Chennaiah were present.11 BE grads to work as jail wardersOf the 85 male jail warders who completed the nine-month basic training in Mysuru, 11 are BE graduates, nine are post graduates and 51 graduates.
