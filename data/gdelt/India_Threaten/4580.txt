Traders burn goods, protest China’s backing for Azhar

Launch campaign to boycott products from that country

Members of the trader’s union, Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), burnt Chinese goods in Sadar Bazar here on Tuesday as part of campaign to boycott goods from that country.

The campaign against Chinese goods is in response to China placing a hold on the request to list Jaish-e-Mohammad leader Masood Azhar as a global terrorist in the United Nation’s Security Council’s 1267 committee.

‘Economic Chowkidars’

Terming the trader community “economic chowkidars” of the country, CAIT general secretary Praveen Khandelwal said traders would boycott the goods of any country that stood against India’s national security. In a statement, the union said Chinese goods were burnt at 1,500 places across the country.

As part of its campaign, the CAIT said it would urge consumers not to purchase Chinese goods and educate traders “as to how their money for purchasing Chinese goods is being used against the interests of the country.” The group demanded that the government increase import duty on Chinese goods.
