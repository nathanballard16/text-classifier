Mahanta, who was the vice-president of All Assam Students’ Union, left AASU to join the AGP, an alliance partner of the BJP. Mahanta, brother of state water resources minister Keshab Mahanta, will fight the Lok Sabha election from Kaliabor constituency. BJP national president Amit Shah, who had reportedly vowed last month in a public meeting at Lakhimpur in Upper Assam to pass the bill in Parliament if the BJP returns to power, on Thursday urged voters to vote for Mahanta at an election rally in Kaliabor. Asked if he would support the bill now that he had joined a BJP ally, Mahanta said his opposition to the bill would continue. Chetia, who was adviser of the All Tai Ahom Students’ Union, a vocal critic of the BJP government for trying to pass the bill and who spearheaded the anti-citizenship bill protest in Upper Assam, joined the BJP a few days ago. Asked if he would support the bill now that he had joined the BJP, Chetia said the issue was irrelevant at present as the bill had not been passed by Parliament. “If it comes again, I will have to think about it,” he added. The Northeast was on the boil till January this year in protest against the bill that seeks to accord citizenship to Hindus, Jains, Buddhists, Sikhs, Parsis and Christians who fled Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh and entered India before December 31, 2014, after six years of residence in India instead of 11 years.
