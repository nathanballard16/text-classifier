Let Gandhis go, India's Congress party deserves new leadership

India's grand old Congress party has once again defied calls to break with the dynastic Gandhi family and has re-elected Sonia Gandhi as the interim president. It was a shocking news, at least for me. We know that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have been reluctant to take over the reins of the party, even then the responsibility has been thrust on the family once again.

It is not going to help the party in the long run. Is it sycophancy, because there is no dearth of talent in the party. Congress has a number of veteran leaders who are capable of steering the party, and give it a new direction. So why is dynasty politics being allowed? Congress is among the most storied institutions in India. Its failings are of its own making.
