MUMBAI: Incessant rains lashed Maharastra capital city Mumbai on Saturday, creating havoc as locals waded through ankle-deep waters to commute. A 4.74-metre high tide is expected at 2:52 pm on Saturday afternoon, warned the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), further asking people not to venture near sea around that time.

The India Meteorological Centre, Mumbai, meanwhile predicted heavy rainfall in the city and the suburbs with the minimum and maximum temperatures hovering around 25 degree Celsius and 30 degree Celsius respectively on Saturday.
