Maharashtra: BJP, Shiv Sena announce poll pact for Lok Sabha, Assembly elections

"We have been together for over 25 years because of our shared ideologies and spirit of nationalism. In 2014 elections, owing to certain reasons we had split, but later since the past nearly five years we are in alliance in Maharashtra and at the Centre," Fadnavis said adding that it was public sentiment that both parties should come together.

MUMBAI: The BJP and the Shiv Sena on Monday announced their poll pact for upcoming Lok Sabha and assembly elections in Maharashtra. The decision was taken during a meeting between BJP president Amit Shah and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray here. The BJP will contest 25 seats and Shiv Sena 23 of 48 Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtra. The two parties will contest equal number of seats, along with their other allies, in elections for the 288-member state Assembly, due this year. BJP President Amit Shah and Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray, along with Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, former Lok Sabha Speaker Manohar Joshi and other senior leaders from both sides made the announcement at a joint media briefing late this evening. The BJP and the Shiv Sena, who have had a strained relationship for over four years despite being partners in the central and the state government, had contested the October 2014 Maharashtra Assembly election separately and came together to form government in a post-poll arrangement.
