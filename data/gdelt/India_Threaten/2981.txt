New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Sunday detained a man, who had called up the control room and threatened to blow up Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The investigation revealed that the man was drunk when he made the call and had had a fight with his landlord.

The man had alleged to be a terrorist, officials said on Monday. The Delhi Police had received the call at 10.30 pm on Sunday.

The man is a labourer. "I am a terrorist. PM Modi will be blown up and Delhi will be bombed," the man had said during the call, reported news agency PTI.

The caller was then traced and detained on the basis of the call.

He was jointly grilled by Delhi Police's Special Cell, the Intelligence Bureau and the local police. He was later released as the call was found to be a hoax.

According to the Delhi Police, the man had consumed liquor following a fight with his landlord and had made the call in an inebriated state because he was angry.
