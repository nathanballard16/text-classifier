Millions are in the path of a ‘very severe’ cyclone. It’s threatening India with flooding rains and storm surge.

It’s not just the winds that will be destructive. A seven-foot storm surge is “likely to inundate the low coastal areas,” which could put tens of thousands of residences in jeopardy, especially on the island of Diu. The island is home to 45,000 people and is off the Kathiawar peninsula. A river separates it from the Gujarat mainland, with only two major routes off the island. Diu is only a few meters above sea level and could be ground zero for significant flooding.
