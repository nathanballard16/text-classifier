Multilayer security arrangement in place for Independence Day

‘Threat perception is high in the wake of situation in J&K’

Delhi Police has made multilayer security arrangements for the 73rd Independence Day, given the “increased threat perception” this year in the wake of the Kashmir crisis.

A senior police officer said that the threat perception on August 15 is high due to the situation and necessary tie-ups have been made with crack units like National Security Guard, Special Protection Group and Indo-Tibetan Border Police.

20,000 policemen

Besides, 20,000 Delhi Police officers have been deployed. “All the agencies will be working closely with each other. SWAT teams and Parakram vans have been strategically stationed,” the officer said.

The State police have also installed over 1,000 cameras across districts. Special facial-recognition cameras have also been installed at strategic locations. Anti-drone detection teams, rooftop deployment and snipers have been put in place. Officers will also ensure that aerial space over Red Fort remains clear.

Multilayer checking using metal detectors will be conducted during the Independence Day function.

“Apart from security at the main venue at Red Fort, adequate security arrangements for at-home function at the Rashtrapati Bhawan have also been made. Citywide alert is being exercised by the DCPs of all districts,” the officer said.

The route to Red Fort and the New Delhi districts which the VIPs and dignitaries will cross will be under surveillance.
