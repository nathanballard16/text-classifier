Norka Roots warns against unauthorised hiring agents in Kerala

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Norka Roots , the public sector undertaking of the department of non-resident keralites affairs (Norka), has warned against unauthorised recruiting agents who offer visit visas to job aspirants possessing ECR (emigration clearance required) passports, bypassing the mandatory registration through the ministry of external affairs’ e-migrate portal.According to Norka Roots CEO K Harikrishnan Namboodhiri, those seeking jobs in 18 countries, where emigration check is required for ECR passport holders, were the ones getting cheated. The countries include all GCC nations (the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait) besides Malaysia , Indonesia, Iraq, Jordan, Afghanistan, Lebanon, Libya, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, Thailand and Yemen.“The job seekers holding ECR passports should take extreme care to opt for foreign migration through recruiting agencies registered in the e-migrate web portal of the ministry of external affairs. They should avoid migration via visit visas being arranged by unauthorized agencies,” he said, adding that people in the state were getting cheated in spite of repeated warning by Norka.For an ECR passport holder, a labour contract via e-migrate website is mandatory for accepting job visas. But unauthorized agencies bypass this procedure by offering a visit visa, and after the candidate’s arrival in the destination country, the foreign employer will be able to change it into a job visa.“However, the foreign employer might not be preparing the work contract through the e-migrate system. The employee/worker will then be treated as an illegal migrant, and the employer will be able to exploit them by denying them their deserving salary, accommodation and other allowances. Several people are thus being forced to work and live in very unhygienic conditions in these countries,” the Norka Roots CEO said.Intervention by respective Indian embassies and Norka Roots has helped in repatriating several such people undergoing hardship abroad after getting cheated by unauthorized recruiting agencies, he added.
