Citizenship Bill: Alliance partner IPFT to re-consider ties with BJP in Tripura

BJP's alliance partner in Tripura, the Indigenous Peoples Front of Tripura (IPFT) is mulling over thinking over its association with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

Recently, the Asom Gana Parishad (AGM) broke ties with the BJP in Assam over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.

Following outrage over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, the ruling National Peoples' Party (NPP) in Meghalaya, too has echoed similar sentiments with tribal groups protesting heavily against the Bill in the state.

"Since long IPFT has been opposing the Citizenship Bill. Very soon our party's Executive Committee will have a meeting and decide whether to continue the alliance or not," Tripura Tribal Welfare minister and IPFT General Secretary Mevar Jamatia told India Today TV.

Renewing its demand for curving out a separate state with tribal dominated areas in Tripura, Jamatia said, "IPFT has one agenda and we will be focusing on that single point -- that is the creation of a separate state based on scheduled areas in Tripura."

This is not the first time that the alliance partner IPFT has spoken out against the BJP government in Tripura. Last year, it had demanded implementation of NRC in the state on the lines of Assam.

Earlier this week, several protesters were injured in clashes with the police in Tripura during an agitation against the Citizenship Bill. Police had to open fire in the air to disperse the crowd after the protests turned violent in Khumulwng, the headquarters of the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC).
