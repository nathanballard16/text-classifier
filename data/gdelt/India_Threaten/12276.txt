Imran Khan should stop making empty threats: Naqvi on Pakistan's nuke warning

Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has hit out at Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan over his nuclear threat to India on Monday. Naqvi has said that Imran Khan should quit making such empty threats over and over again.

Speaking to India Today TV, Naqvi said, "He should stop issuing such empty threats time and again and look at the condition of his own country. He will have to decide if he wishes for the support of terrorists or the world."

On Monday, while addressing Pakistan, Imran Khan said, "If the [Kashmir] conflict moves towards war then remember both nations have nuclear weapons and no one is a winner in a nuclear war. It will have global ramifications. The superpowers of the world have a huge responsibility...whether they support us or not, Pakistan will do everything possible."

Imran Khan said Pakistan will go to any extent for Kashmir.

Naqvi has hit back and said, "Today the entire world is talking against terrorism and Pakistan has been isolated."

Speaking on how Imran Khan has taken the bilateral issue of Kashmir to the global community to internationalise it, Naqvi said, "Pakistan is frustrated and trying to scratch any surface to make some noise. Such acts will have no gains for Pakistan."

Naqvi added, "No one will listen to them or even try to understand them. Neither will India try to make anyone understand, nor will the world understand. His statements are laughable and his statements only make me laugh."

While addressing the nation on Monday, Imran Khan said that the time had come for Pakistan to be decisive on the Kashmir issue. He added that Pakistan had made attempts to open dialogue with India but had not found the same support from the other side.
