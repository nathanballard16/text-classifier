We remain committed to continuously enhancing safety features for users: TikTok - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

NEW DELHI: TikTok said it remains committed to “continuously enhancing” safety features for its 120 million users in India after the Madras High Court on Wednesday lifted ban on the short-video app.

The Madras HC has lifted its earlier ban on the Chinese short-video app with the condition that the content hosted using it should be free from obscene videos of children and women.

It also warned the company that if any controversial video violating its conditions is found posted using the app, it would be considered as contempt of court.

The Madras HC had on April 3 directed the Centre to ban the Chinese app voicing concern over “pornographic and inappropriate content” being made available through such apps. After the Supreme Court refused to stay the Madras HC order, tech giants Google and Apple had removed TikTok from their app stores in India to prohibit further downloads of the app.

“We are glad about this decision and we believe it is also greatly welcomed by our thriving community in India, who use TikTok as a platform to showcase their creativity,” TikTok said in a statement.

It added that the company’s efforts to fight against misuse of the platform has been recognized.
