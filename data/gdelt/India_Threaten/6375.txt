Terrorists Planning Pulwama-Like Attack During Lok Sabha Elections, Could Use Bikes To Carry Out Strike

Even as the country is yet to recover from the shock of the terror attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14, intelligence agencies have warned of another possible attack.

The development comes even as there is a heightened security deployment across Jammu and Kashmir, like other parts of the country, due to the ongoing Lok Sabha polls.

According to intelligence agencies, Pakistan-based terrorists could strike Srinagar or Kupwara and that the bombers could be named after Mughal emperors.

What makes the prospect of the attacks even more serious is the report that motorcycles could be used to carry out the strike.

This makes the job of the security agencies even tougher as two-wheelers could prove to be more maneuverable and easier to reach any target.

Similar to Pulwama, reportedly the plan is to ride the motorcycle with explosive-filled bags fitted on both sides and hit the target to inflict maximum damage.

This is not the first time since Pulwama, terrorists have used similar modus operandi to target the Indian security forces.

Earlier this month a CRPF convoy came under an attempted attack on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway when a Hizbul militant tried to ram a gas cylinder filled car on the convoy. However, he could not execute the plan properly. He ended up blowing up his car before it hit the convoy and fled the scene. Even though the bus suffered damages, there were no casualties and the attacker was arrested two days later.

Using explosives-filled vehicles to carry out attacks is something that was unfamiliar in India before Pulwama, though the likes of ISIS have been using it effectively in many countries.

Since the Pulwama terror attack, it has been decided to procure a fleet of mine protected vehicles (MPVs) and small 30-seater buses to ensure the safety of the troops.
