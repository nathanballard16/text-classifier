BSM teacher warned for misconduct

VADODARA: In the MSU syndicate meeting on Sunday, two cases of sexual harassment complaints — against Dr Praful Purohit of Baroda Sanskrit Mahavidyalaya (BSM) and Dr C J Panchal, associate professor of Department of Applied Physics of Faculty of Technology and Engineering (FTE) — were taken up. The members decided to issue a warning to Purohit against whom a complaint was registered last year by a group of second year students of the college.With regard to Panchal’s case, the varsity has decided to seek legal opinion from a retired high court judge after the case took a curious turn last year.The faculty officials had earlier constituted their own committee to conduct primary inquiry into the allegations. Sources said that three girl complainants appeared before the faculty-level committee, but Panchal did not turn up.Later, when the university’s Women’s Grievance Redressal Prevention of Sexual Harassment and Counselling Cell (WGRPSHCC) constituted a probe panel, Panchal appeared before the panel, but, this time the complainants did not register their statements.On the other hand, Panchal has also issued defamation notices to these students.The reports of these sub-committees constituted by the WGRPSHCC for reviewing the complaints against Purohit and Panchal were tabled before the syndicate members in the syndicate meeting.The original complaint by the BSM students was against two teachers, Dr Prafulla Purohit and Dr Chetan Pandya. Both teachers had then refuted the allegations. However, sources said that later Pandya submitted an unconditional apology.The sub-committee report on Purohit points out at his behavioural issues. MSU’s in-charge registrar N K Ojha said, “The syndicate has resolved to issue a warning to the teacher for his misconduct . We will seek an undertaking from his to behave appropriately with the women staff and students.”A member of the syndicate said that the varsity will seek legal opinion on Panchal’s case to ascertain whether the matter can be considered as sub-judice or if the university can take any action at this stage.
