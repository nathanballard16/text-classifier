Ex-Indian judge warns Modi against misadventure

ISLAMABAD: Former Indian Supreme Court Judge Markandey Katju has warned the far-right Narendra Modi government against any misadventure against nuclear-armed Pakistan, saying that ‘Pakistani armed forces are ready to face us’.

In an interview with the Indian media, the former Indian judge said the people demanding action in the aftermath of Pulwama attack should remember that Pakistan is a nuclear power. “Pakistani armed forces are ready to face us and war will not be a surprise for them,” he said. “On crossing the Line of Control, we will meet a strong reaction of the claims we are making,” he warned.

He said that the surgical strike claims of the Indian government have no reality. “The government is threatening Pakistan for another surgical strike. They seem unaware of the surgical strike consequences,” Katju said.

Justice Markandey Katju said that it is the inefficiency of the Indian government that Kashmiri people are standing against India. He said the majority of the Kashmiris support the militants fighting for their rights.
