Islamabad rebuffed at UNSC again

NEW DELHI: Even as Pakistan sought in a letter an urgent meeting of the UNSC on the J&K issue, its latest effort to internationalise the issue didn’t seem to get much traction at the Council. The fact that Islamabad had sought an "on record" emergency meeting with the right to present its views and even have minutes of the meeting recorded had found few takers in the Council, TOI has learnt.The Council, in fact, hasn’t seen a meeting like that for decades.Pakistan’s problems at the Council were further compounded with Russia again coming out in support of India saying there was no alternative to resolving differences between Pakistan and India ``except bilaterally through political and diplomatic means’’. This was conveyed by Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov to his Pakistan counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi in a telephonic conversation shortly after the latter wrote another letter to the Security Council in which he sought an emergency meeting, saying Pakistan’s restraint should not be mistaken for weakness by India.``Representatives of Russia to the UN adhere to this consistent position,’’ said Moscow after the conversation which was at Islamabad’s behest.Russia is not just a permanent member of UNSC but will also hold the Council’s presidency next month. Moscow has been more forthcoming in its support to India than any other P-5 country. In an earlier statement on August 9, it had said the revocation of J&K special status and its reorganisation was carried out within the framework of Indian Constitution. France, another permanent member, though has remained silent on the issue until now.In his third letter to UNSC in the past couple of weeks, Qureshi had sought an urgent meeting on the Kashmir issue claiming there were ``credible reports’’ that scores of unarmed demonstrators who “breached the brutal curfew’’ had been killed in indiscriminate firing by Indian security forces.Indian officials described Pakistan’s claim as propaganda fuelled by fake news.Significantly, Pakistan seemed to be hedging against a possible terror strike in J&K with Qureshi mentioning in his letter what he described as a false flag operation by India to provoke ``another crisis with Pakistan’’. While Pakistan politicians have often spoken publicly about a false flag operation, Islamabad has now officially raised it before the UNSC.According to Pakistan’s version of the exchange with Russia, this ``possibility of a false flag’’ by India was raised by Qureshi with Lavrov too. Pakistan PM Imran Khan had warned India last week that more Pulwama-like attacks could happen because of India’s decision to revoke J&K’s special status.Indian officials described Qureshi’s assertion as another attempt by Pakistan to present an alarming picture of ties between the 2 countries and provoke intervention by major powers.In his letter to the UNSC president on Tuesday, Qureshi had said an emergency meeting was important to consider the situation arising from ``the recent aggressive actions by India’’ which, it claimed, posed a threat to international peace and security and unilaterally aimed to alter the demographic structure of the territory, while violating the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people.
