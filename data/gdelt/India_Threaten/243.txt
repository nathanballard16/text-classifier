I avoid attending ISC sessions: CNR Rao

Scientists slam ‘irrational’ claims about ancient India, plan nationwide protests

Eminent Indian scientists and researchers from several institutions as well as laypersons interested in science have condemned the “irrational and unscientific claims” made by two scientists at the ongoing Indian Science Congress (ISC).On Sunday, representatives from the Akhila Karnataka Vicharavadigala Vedike (Karnataka Rationalists’ Forum), and Breakthrough Science Society (BSS), an organisation of scientists and researchers that seeks to popularise science, as well as other organisations held a silent protest with placards outside the Indian Institute of Science in Bengaluru.“We had met the ISC Association president after the Mumbai session in 2015 and handed him a petition raising our concerns. After that we’ve had the congress in Mysuru, Tirupati, and so on, and the same things continue. People must ask the organisers how they allow this,” Rajani KS, secretary, BSS Karnataka, said.BSS will hold protests in multiple Indian cities on Monday, including outside Andhra University to protest claims by its V-C, G Nageswara Rao, that Kauravas were born using stem cell technology , and Ravana had 24 types of aircraft. A protest outside the Indian Institute of Science on Sunday saw participation from students and IT professionals too. “We will be holding protests in more than 10 cities tomorrow. It is important that we tell people that such claims should have no place at an event like the ISC,” Rajani said.The statement issued by the All India Committee of BSS said, “It is absolutely distressing that these claims were made in the Children Science Congress section of ISC where the audience was largely comprised of teachers and young students.”Reputed Indian scientists also decried such claims about ancient Indian inventions, made on an eminent platform like the congress. Aerospace scientist Roddam Narasimha pointed out that previous sessions had also seen such claims.CNR Rao, noted chemistry professor said, “I avoid attending sessions of the congress. If I attend, it might appear as if I am endorsing these statements and claims.” Meanwhile, as the Children’s Science Congress concluded in Jalandhar on Sunday, ISCA general president Manoj Kumar Chakrabarti told the attendees to forget the claims made by the two scientists on Friday.
