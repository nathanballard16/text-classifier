Mumbai: Youth morphs minors' pics, held by Vakola police

A 20-year-old man has been arrested for morphing two minor girls' pictures and blackmailing them into video-chatting with him through a mobile application.

The accused has been identified as Janam Porva, who was picked up from Ahmedabad. As per the two FIRs registered against him at Vakola police station, he would take victims' pictures posted on social media and morph them. He would threaten to circulate the morphed pictures on social media to make them chat with him.

According to police, the victims in these cases are residents of Vakola and the complaints were registered in January and February. Technicalities involved in the case and a smartly-arranged cyber setup by Porva made it difficult for cops to breach the system and get a breakthrough.

"The accused used to make video calls from a mobile application, which was designed in a manner to avoid being tracked. Also, international numbers were used to make calls, which made the investigation more complex. The cyber arrangements and latest updated domains helped him for a while to escape the police's radar. But after a chase of over one month, Porva's name cropped up and he was arrested on priority," said a police officer.

Porva also used to record the video chats without the girls' knowledge. Police also suspect Porva to have sexually harassed them over the video calls.

"The accused is a Class 12 dropout and stays with his family in Ahmedabad. We are ascertaining if there are any other such complaints registered against him. He has been active for the past three months," said Deputy Commissioner of Police, Zone VIII, Anil Kumbhare.
