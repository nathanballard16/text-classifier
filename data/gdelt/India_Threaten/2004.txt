Is India the next target in the Trump administration’s trade wars?

Into this picture comes Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who was to arrive in New Delhi for his first official visit to India. On Thursday, he was supposed to confer with his Indian counterpart, but because of a flight cancellation, he will participate remotely. A contingent of 20 chief executives of American firms is still expected to attend a forum with Indian business leaders. They are likely to underline the potential to boost trade in areas such as energy and aviation.
