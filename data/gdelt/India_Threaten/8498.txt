NEW DELHI: Setting his focus on quality education and bringing down school dropout rates , minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi has said that the government would soon start work on providing central schools on the lines of Kendriya Vidyalayas in minority concentration districts.After a review of various schemes earlier this week, Naqvi announced that the ministry of minority affairs will be soon roll out 'Padho-Badho' campaign to bring down the school dropout rate of girls from the Muslim community . "Of the 308 districts identified for coverage under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Vikas Karyakram, 50 districts will be taken up in the first six months for Padho-Badho campaign and then it will be extended to other districts," Naqvi said. He also said that the ministry has set a target to provide 'Pradhan Mantri Scholarship' to five crore students in the next five years, which will include 50% girl students.When asked about the status of implementation of the recommendations of a 2017 report that sought central schools for minority concentration districts, Naqvi told TOI, "In principle there is agreement between MoMA and HRD ministry over the plan wherein we (MoMA) will provide the infrastructure for the school in identified minority concentration districts and HRD will make way for central schools like Kendriya Vidyalayas here." He went on to say that the ministry will now expedite work on framing the proposals for these schools.In 2017, noting that there was a vital gap in affordable and quality school education for children from minority communities, a high level committee under the Maulana Azad Education Foundation had recommended among various other things setting-up of 211 central schools in identified minority concentration districts and cities. The committee led by Afzal Amanullah had recommended that these schools should be on the lines of Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas."The literacy rates among Muslims in 2001 was 59.1 per cent and in 2011 it was 68.53 per cent against the national average of 64.8 per cent and 72.98 per cent respectively. The difference in enrolment rate between Muslims and the remaining population is also sharp," it was pointed out in the committee's report.It was also observed that while the mean years of schooling of Muslim children is only 83 per cent of all children, the disparities are highest in the case of rural boys which is only 78 per cent that of all rural children followed by rural girls. The differential in higher education revealed the same grim picture.The Niti Aayog strategy paper on New India at 75 too emphasised on the need to bridge the gap between minority communities and the rest of the population with respect to various socio-economic and human development indicators through affirmative action.Citing survey data available with the government, the strategy paper highlighted that the highest proportion of out of school children in the country belong to Muslim communities (4.43 per cent), followed by Hindus (2.73 per cent), Christians (1.52 per cent) and others (1.26 per cent).
