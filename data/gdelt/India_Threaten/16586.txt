JMM, Congress betrayed Left parties: CPI

Ranchi: Communist Party of India ( CPI ) on Wednesday released its 42-point election manifesto promising to protect “jal, jungle, jameen”, raise the issue of displacement and strive for implementation of Land Acquisition Act, 2013, as introduced by the UPA government.While presenting the manifesto at the party’s office in Ranchi, CPI state secretary Bhubneshwar Mehta said, “Legends of Jharkhand, including Birsa Munda, fought for jal, jungle and jameen. CPI cadres have also made the supreme sacrifice fighting for the cause in the past.” He said CPI will become the voice of the unemployed, make efforts for reservation in Grade III and IV jobs for locals and 27% reservation for other backward classes. The party said it would fight for regularizing jobs of para teachers, pension of Rs 10,000 to farmers above the age of 60, ending mob lynchings and ensuring Rs 18,000 as minimum monthly wage for contract workers.Mehta accused JMM and Congress of stabbing the Left parties in the back for fielding candidates on seats that have been their stronghold. He said, “After promising to include the Left parties in the opposition alliance, Congress, JMM and RJD failed to offer us a reasonable share of seats. Now they have fielded candidates in seats like Sindri and Rajdhanwar where Marxist Coordination Committee and CPI (M-L) have performed well in the past.” He added, “Nevertheless, the Left parties will support the opposition candidates who are likely to defeat BJP nominees.”
