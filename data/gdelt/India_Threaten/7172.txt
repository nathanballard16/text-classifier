Indian ceasefire violations may lead to strategic miscalculation:FO

Indian Deputy Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia was summoned to Foreign Office today and a strong protest was lodged over unprovoked ceasefire violations by the Indian occupation forces along the Line of Control on Thursday and Sunday last.

In a statement issued today (Wednesday), Foreign Office Spokesperson Dr. Muhammad Faisal said the Indian forces are continuously targeting civilian populated areas with heavy weapons along the Line of Control and the Working Boundary.

He said the deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas is indeed deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws.

The Spokesperson said the ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.

He said Pakistan urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement, investigate these and other incidents of ceasefire violations, and instruct the Indian forces to respect the ceasefire, in letter and spirit.

On Thursday last, a 15 years old boy Tahir Hafeez was martyred while his 9 years old sister Tahira sustained serious injuries in Rakhchikri Sector along LoC.

Two innocent civilians including a woman Nasreen Bibi and a 12 years old child Muhammad Zahid s/o Shabbir Ahmed were martyred while a woman Sonia Bibi sustained injuries in Hotspring and Kotkotera sectors along LoC on Sunday last.
