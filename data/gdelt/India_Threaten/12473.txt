What are the penalties if you miss the deadline

Anyone who misses filing the ITR before their respective deadline will have to pay a penalty. While earlier there was no fine on delayed ITRs, the government in 2017 announced a fine for the same. Filing your tax after the due date is called belated ITR and it can be submitted till March 31, 2020.

However, if you fail to adhere to this deadline as well, you will have to wait for a notice from the tax department for filing your ITR.
