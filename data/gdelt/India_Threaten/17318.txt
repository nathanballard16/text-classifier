India’s new citizenship law sparks anger and unrest

In India’s northeast — a collection of seven states that share borders with Bangladesh, Myanmar (also known as Burma) and China — passage of the bill sparked violent protests in which two people were killed Thursday and 25 injured by security forces, according to a senior police official in the state of Assam. Police also detained more than 1,000 people across the state.
