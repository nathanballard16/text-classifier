Governor Not 'Guide' Or 'Mentor' To Assembly Speaker: SC In 2016 Verdict In Arunachal Case

Amid the crisis, a 2016 Supreme Court verdict assumes significance in which it had held that it is not within the governor's domain to interfere with the functions of the Speaker as he is "neither a guide, nor a mentor" to the latter.

: Karnataka Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy on Friday said the Governor was interfering in the conduct of the trust vote and dictating terms to the Assembly. He also moved the Supreme Court contending that Governor Vajubhai Vala cannot dictate Speaker K R Ramesh to conduct the proceedings of the Assembly which is debating the confidence motion moved by him. Kumaraswamy questioned the deadlines set by the Governor one after another to complete the trust vote. In his petition, he said "the debates on the motion are currently ongoing and the House is in session. The Speaker has opined that the division will take place only at the end of the debate. In these circumstances, the Governor cannot dictate to the House the manner in which the debate of the confidence motion has to be taken up."
