Armeena Rana Khan calls out Bollywood celebs for 'glorifying' war

In light of the present situation between India and Pakistan, lauded actor Armeena Rana Khan has stepped forward condemning Bollywood celebrities for ‘glorifying war.’

The Jaanan starlet turned to Twitter to express her rage over the rising tensions between the two countries and calling out celebrities on the other side of the border for rooting for war and venerating it instead of promoting a tranquilizing peacemaking outlook.

“I’m watching some of these Bollywood accounts in dismay, glorifying war. People should take note: In the future, these particular individuals shouldn’t be allowed to preach peace to the world. Artists are supposed to be sane, pacifying voices,” she stated.

“I’ve seen what war can do. Trust me, you will not want it once you see just how bloody and scary it can be. Nobody wins a war; humanity loses,” she added further.

She continued saying: “The last few days have been very heavy on my heart. All around me is war, carnage, blood, hatred and division. Where did humanity go wrong? May the Creator deliver these power hungry monsters to hell and rid us of their evil.”

For all the wonderful keyboard warriors out there. kindly do not drag mothers and sisters into your disgusting brawls. You swear at someone’s mom then they’ll swear at yours out of retaliation. so much fun having your parents abused in public. For what?” she stated ending her Twitter thread.
