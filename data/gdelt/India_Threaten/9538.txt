Rahul Gandhi resigns as Congress President, Takes blame for defeat in Lok Sabha elections

New Delhi: Indian National Congress chief Rahul Gandhi finally calls it a quit on Wednesday as he places his official resignation. Citing the poor performance of the party in the Lok Sabha elections, Gandhi shares his resignation letter through his twitter handle.

The outgoing Congress chief, while placing his resignation, has also added that he has vowed to resist Bharatiya Janata Party's idea of India. Terming himself as "a loyal soldier of Congress" and "a devoted son of India," Gandhi says that he will continue to be with his party and protect the country till his last breath.

Rahul wrote, "It is an honour for me to serve the Congress Party, whose values and ideals have served as the lifeblood of our beautiful nation. I owe the country and my organisation a debt of tremendous gratitude and love."

He further added, "As president of the Congress party, I'm responsible for the loss of the 2019 elections, accountability is critical for the future growth of our party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress president."

Although Rahul Gandhi has resigned from Presidentship, he has also added that the next Congress chief is not decided yet. However, he has also revealed as to who is liable to select the new Chief.

As the recently concluded Lok Sabha election revealed an utter failure of the Congress party with a blank in 18 states and Union Territories, this was an indication that the party badly needs a revolution of its thoughts and ideas. Irked at the crash of the party and the poor performance of its members Rahul Gandhi had to call it a quit.

He has also added that he will not be a part of the selection of the next Congress chief. The Congress leaders are being asked by him to look for his successor.
