Trees uprooted, houses damaged as gales lash DK

Mangaluru: Though the Cyclonic storm Kyarr over east central Arabian Sea moved north-north eastwards and lay centred about 190 km, nearly to the west of Ratnagiri (Maharashtra), the effects were felt in the Dakshina Kannada district which experienced heavy rain on Thursday night and intermittent heavy rain throughout the day. Gales caused several houses to get damaged in many parts of the taluk like Vittal, Moodbidri, and Sullia, due to trees getting uprooted. Even Sasihithlu Beach bore the brunt, as trees on the shore got uprooted.Since fishermen were advised not to venture along the Karnataka coast and north-east Arabian Sea during the next 24 hours, the boats were anchored near the estuary mouth of the Gurupur River, which is likely to hamper the Coast Guard’s search and rescue (SAR) operations in case of any eventuality, as the estuary mouth has been blocked by more than 200 boats. The coast guard has now stationed a Dornier aircraft for SAR operations.IMD and KSNMDC warned that the sea condition is likely to be very rough along the Karnataka coast in the next one day, predicting light to moderate rainfall at most places, with heavy to very heavy rain at isolated places over the coastal districts of Karnataka.On Friday, the district received 32.4mm of rain against no rain during the same day last year. Bantwal, Belthangady and Mangaluru received in excess of 35mm of rain, with the least being in Sullia at 21mm.The water level in the Nethravathi River at Uppinangady was rising steadily, and was at 25 metres, with the danger level being 29.5 metres.
