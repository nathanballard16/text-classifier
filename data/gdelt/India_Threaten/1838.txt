The deployment of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) at state jails may soon be a reality. A joint team of the CRPF and the Jails Department has started a survey of six Punjab prisons to work out modalities for the same. The demand was raised by the state to strengthen security of jails and to break the alleged connivance of officials with prisoners.

Jails Minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and ADGP (Jails) Rohit Chaudhary confirmed the development.

“Despite Tihar jail in Delhi being considered the most protected jail in India with three-tier security system, mobile phones are still being recovered from inmates. The first layer is of the CRPF, second Madras police and third Delhi police. Though three-tier security is not possible in Punjab, two-tier system will soon be in place,” Randhawa said.

Chaudhary said the CRPF and the department today started a survey of six jails — Nabha, Patiala, two in Amritsar, Bathinda and Jalandhar — where two CRPF companies are likely to be deployed after the survey was over. “We have demanded four companies from the Centre, but we are likely to get two companies consisting 160 to 180 jawans,” the ADGP said.

Randhawa said 550 posts in the Jails Department would be filled in the next six months. “It is sad that the Centre is ignoring demands of states,” he claimed.
