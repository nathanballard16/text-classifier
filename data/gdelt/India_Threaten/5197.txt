The Indian Election Commission set up a polling booth for a single voter deep inside the Gir forest in the western state of Gujarat.

A day before the third phase of elections began, five officials traveled about 60 kilometers (40 miles) into the forest to set up an entire voting facility for one man.

“This is done for every election. The Election Commission criteria is that we have to provide polling station for every person within a two-kilometre radius,” said Vinod Chandra Prajapati, deputy district election officer.

As Darshandas stepped out of the polling booth, he said, “I have today and I would like to ask everyone to use their individual vote and there should be 100 percent voting. Just like there was 100% voting here, it should be so everywhere.”

Due to the geography and the extensive terrain of India, the Election Commission has to ensure that every person is provided with a polling booth in their vicinity.

“Because he resides there, we have to get here. Whether he casts his vote or not, it does not matter -- we have to go there and set up the booth,” said Prajapati.
