Mamata Banerjee accuses Asaduddin Owaisi of divisive extremism. Here's what he said

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has accused the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) party of dividing communities, and warned minorities against what she describes as "extremism".

The AIMIM's leader, Asaduddin Owasi, shot back on Tuesday, saying it wasn't religious extremism "to say that Bengal’s Muslims have one of the worst human development indicators of any minority".

Mamata Banerjee, the leader of the Trinamool Congress, was speaking on Monday at a rally in Cooch Behar, a border district in West Bengal where illegal immigration from Bangladesh is a hot-button issue.

Although Banerjee didn't explictly name the AIMIM or Asaduddin Owaisi, she made a clear allusion to them when she said they were based out of Hyderabad.

Owaisi is the MP from Hyderabad.

Mamata Banerjee said the AIMIM was creating differences, and asked minorities not to make the mistake of "trusting these forces".

She also warned voters against "Hindu extremist forces".

Asaduddin Owaisi tweeted on Tuesday that "if Didi is worried about a bunch of us from Hyderabad then she should tell us how BJP won 18/42 LS seats from Bengal."

Mamata Banerjee has governed Bengal since 2011.

But she is expected to face an uphill task as she prepares for a new assembly election in 2021: the BJP, buoyed by a spectacular improvement in fortunes in Bengal parliamentary elections, is eyeing the state with interest.
