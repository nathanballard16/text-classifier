kamal haasan: Kamal Haasan's 'Hindu extremist' remark stirs row; BJP seeks EC action

Free India's first terrorist was a Hindu: Kamal Haasan

ARAVAKURICHI (TN): Makkal Needhi Maiyam founder Kamal Haasan's remark that India's first "extremist was a Hindu" drew sharp reactions from several political parties, who slammed the actor for indulging in "divisive politics".Addressing an election campaign in Tamil Nadu's Pallapatti on Sunday, Haasan said he was one of those "proud Indians" who desires an India of equality and where the "three colours" in the tricolour, an obvious reference to different faiths, "remained intact.""I am not saying this because this is a Muslim-dominated area, but I am saying this before a statue of Gandhi. Free India's first extremist was a Hindu, his name is Nathuram Godse . There it (extremism, apparently) starts," he had said.Hitting out at Haasan for his remarks, BJP state president Tamilisai Soundararajan said it was "strongly condemnable" that the actor-politician used the phrase "Hindu extremism" in a Muslim-dominated area."Though he talks of taking forward a new kind of politics, he also indulged in the old, mischievous, poisonous and divisive vote bank politics," Soundararajan said, adding thathis remarks amounted to inciting "communal violence".AIADMK leader and Tamil Nadu minister K T Rajenthra Bhalaji said that Haasan's tongue should be cut off for "sowing violence" and demanded that the Election Commission act against the MNM leader.Union minister Giriraj Singh said that Haasan has started speaking in the Congress's language and alleged that he was trying to falsely accuse Hindus. Kamal Haasan has joined the league of Naseeruddin Shah and other people who speak in the language of Congress. The ones who invented terms like Hindu terror, saffron terror. Hindus give food and water to even ants and trees, his statement is pathetic," Singh said in Patna.Slamming the actor-turned-politician, Shiv Sena said his theory is a "flop story" and likened him to Congress leader Digvijaya Singh."Kamal Hassan is a very good actor. But his theory (on Nathuram Godse) is a flop story. People do not have sympathy for Godse. Hindus will not tolerate it when their religion is linked with terrorism. There is no difference between Kamal Haasan and Digvijaya Singh. It is a useless statement just to gain publicity," Shiv Sena spokesperson Sanjay Raut said.Meanwhile, the BJP moved the Election Commission seeking a 5-day ban on the actor. The complaint was filed by BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay, who said the statement was intended to outrage religious feelings of millions of Hindus.Haasan, however, found support from the Congress and Dravidar Kazhagam (DK), whose leaders said they found nothing wrong with the actor-politician's remarks.TNCC president K S Alagiri said he concurred with Haasan "1,000 percent", while DK chief K Veeramani said Godse trained with RSS.Responding to reporters' queries on the matter, Alagiri alleged that Hindu outfits like RSS "believe in destroying those with opposing views" and equated the saffron organisation with ISIS, saying the Islamic organisation does not tolerate contrarian views even from fellow Muslims.Backing Haasan for his "Godse is the first extremist in free India" comments, Alagiri said, "I support him and concur with him, not just 100 percent, but 1000 percent."Veeramani, a strident critic of the BJP and Sangh Parivar, said "Not just that, even (Sadhvi) Pragya Singh Thakur is only out on bail," referring to BJP's Bhopal Lok Sabha candidate, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case.He also supported Haasan for his statement on Godse.RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav too came out in support of Haasan, saying he found nothing wrong in the statement.Earlier too, Haasan had triggered a row, when in November 2017, he took potshots at what he termed as "Hindu extremism", which drew condemnation from the BJP and Hindu outfits.
