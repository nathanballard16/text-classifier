AAP will not tolerate violence against students Sanjay Singh

New Delhi: The Aam Admi Party (AAP) leader Sanjay Singh said that according to police statements the ten people arrested in the bus burning incident at New Friends Colony were not students. Singh said the miscreants should be punished and that AAP will not tolerate violence against students and neither should students resort to violence. Singh said, "the Delhi police in a statement said that not one of the students is from Jamia in the ten arrests that have been made. This shows that the Jamia students were not part of the violence or bus burning so why did the police enter the campus or library and the hostel and beat them up. The AAP is against violence of any sort and specially when it comes to young students.
