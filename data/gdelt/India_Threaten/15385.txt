IMD: Heavy rain alert for today and tomorrow

Panaji: The India meteorological department (IMD) has issued a heavy rain alert for Thursday and Friday, and added that showers will be accompanied by gusty winds. “This is a second cyclone genesis in the Arabian Sea,” said director K Padgalwar. Goa had experienced very heavy rain last week owing to cyclonic storm Kyarr that passed the west coast of India before moving toward Oman.“A new system has developed in the west central Arabian Sea about 220km southwest of Thiruvananthapuram. It is moving northwestwards. This will be parallel to Goa between October 31 and November 1,” he said.Thus, IMD has issued a yellow alert across the state for the next two days.The department, however, has said that since the phenomenon will be 350-400km from the Goa coast, it will have less of an impact as compared to Kyarr. Yet, it said Goa will experience squally weather , and cautioned citizens about gusty winds.“The wind speed will be 20-30km per hour from Thursday to Friday. Fishermen have been warned against venturing into the west central Arabian Sea till Sunday and into the adjoining north and east central Arabian Sea during the next 24 hours,” Padgalwar said.Following incidents of people being hit by lightning in the state, a two-day warning has also been given against lightning.“There will be thundershowers as well, so people will have to be careful of lightning as well,” Padgalwar said.
