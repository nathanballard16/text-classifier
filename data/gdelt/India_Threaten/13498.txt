Canadian teenager diagnosed with illness related to vaping

Toronto: A high school student in Canada has been diagnosed with a severe respiratory illness related to vaping, officials said, in what's believed to be the first reported case in the country.

Dr Christopher Mackie, medical officer of health and chief executive of the Middlesex-London Health Unit in London, Ontario, said the youth was on life support at one point but had since recovered and was at home.

"The only issue that was identified was that the individual vaped e-cigarettes," Mackie said. "As far as we are aware this is first case of vaping-related illness that's been reported in Canada."
