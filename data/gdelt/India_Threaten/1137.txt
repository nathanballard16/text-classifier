Tirupur takes a giant leap, eyes polyester options

CHENNAI: Sensing the next big opportunity in manmade fibres, commonly known as polyesters, knitwear hub Tirupur is taking baby steps in its usage and the early trends appear encouraging.Reliance and Grasim are setting up design studios to help entrepreneurs turn it into a new business opportunity, that is nearly twice as big as cotton-based knitwear. However, there are teething issues. “The polyester prices are very high when compared to cotton. Imports are cheaper than domestic material. I have been fighting for the removal of this distortion for the past 15 years, if the skew in pricing is resolved then Tirupur will take the lead,” said A Sakthivel, president, Federation of Indian Exporters Organisations (FIEO).Notwithstanding the price issues, garment exporters from Tirupur have started engaging with Reliance and Grasim. “After we reached out to them, both these companies have set up their studios in Tirupur. They are now closely working with us. It is a very early stage,” Raja M Shanmugam, president, Tirupur Exporters Association (TEA) told TOI at the Global Investors Meet (GIM) held in Chennai.“This is the next big opportunity for us. If we are able to crack this, then the wave begins. We are excited, let us see how things progress,” he said.Boom town Tirupur exports around 27,000 crore worth knitwear each year and produces another 9,000 crore worth garments for the domestic market.The textile industry is the second largest employer in the state. “There are opportunities to invest in processing (dyeing) and technical textiles in the state,” said state textile commissioner Kumar Jayant.The government, he said, has revived the integrated textile complex in Ramnathapuram district, it proposed in the previous edition of GIM. The unique feature of the proposed complex is that it will take residual salt from the zero liquid discharge unit and dump it directly into the sea.
