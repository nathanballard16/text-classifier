Shiv Sena banners want both Aaditya & Uddhav Thackeray as Maharashtra CM

Amid the uncertainty over government formation in Maharashtra, two banners have propped up in front of Matoshree, the residence of the Thackerays in Mumbai.

While one banner supports Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray as chief minister of Maharashtra, the other supports his son and Yuva Sena chief Aaditya to head the state.

The banner in support of Aaditya even goes on to claim that he will take oath in a few days. The other banner in support of Uddhav says Maharashtra needs a CM like him.

The political crisis in Maharashtra deepened on Sunday with the BJP announcing it would not form the government in view of the Shiv Sena's refusal to join them.

This puts the onus on the Sena to muster the requisite numbers if it wants a chief minister of its own. Sena MP Sanjay Raut said the party will install its chief minister at any cost.

The conflict between estranged allies BJP and Sena has given enough fodder to the Congress and a glimpse of hope as well of getting a shot at governance.

On Sunday morning, Congress leader Milind Deora tweeted, "Maharashtra's Governor should invite NCP-Congress - the second largest alliance - to form the government now that BJP-Shiv Sena have refused to do so."

Another Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam, however, cautioned against an alliance with the Sena.

"In the current political arithmetic in Maharashtra, it's just impossible for Congress-NCP to form any government. For that we need Sena. And we must not think of sharing power with Sena under any circumstances. That will be a disastrous move for the party," he said.
