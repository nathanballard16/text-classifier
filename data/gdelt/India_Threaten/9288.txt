The IAF’s Jaguar fleet has been waiting for an engine upgrade for years to make it more agile. The IAF has so far lost 10 aircraft in 2019; making it the most unsafe year for the force in many years. Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh warned India's parliament on Wednesday that the force had lost at least 33 aircraft, including 19 fighter jets, since 2015-16.

Earlier this month, a n AN-32 crashed in Arunachala Pradesh near China's border.

"Every aircraft accident in the IAF is investigated by a Court of Inquiry (CoI) to ascertain the cause of accident, and the recommendations of the completed Court of Inquiry are implemented," Rajnath Singh said.
