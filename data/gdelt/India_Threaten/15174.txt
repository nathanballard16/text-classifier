BJP focus on national issues yields limited results in assembly polls

PM Modi thanks the people for their mandate

NEW DELHI: After the sweep comes the stumble. Just months after having decisively won the Lok Sabha elections with a decisive mandate, BJP on Thursday turned in not-so-impressive performance.It scored a less-than-emphatic victory in Maharashtra and fell short of the majority mark in Haryana, in an outcome that will reignite the debate over the effectiveness of its “nationalist” plank in state polls, enthuse opponents and can trigger an introspection on how to address issues arising from slowdown.The party did not lose. In Maharashtra, where it had played second fiddle to Shiv Sena for decades, it defied incumbency to retain the CM post and its status as the number one player. In Haryana, a virgin territory until 2014, the party finished on top and can form government with the support of Independents. But the tallies fell short of the expectations aroused by its victory in the Lok Sabha polls.The vociferous insertion of national issues made the Maharashtra and Haryana assembly polls more of a verdict on decisions of the Modi government than might have been the case despite the clear prominence of local and regional factors and caste equations associated with state contests.While the jury remains out on whether BJP would have fared worse if the elections had been more centred around local matters, the party made the decision to scrap J&K’s special status and a tough approach to Pakistan important aspects of its poll messaging.A read of the results indicates that the gambit had its limits with the Haryana result proving a case in point. Voters delivered all 10 Lok Sabha seats to BJP with large margins only to take a very different view when it came to state polls where the local incumbencies they had chosen to ignore became decisive.BJP had some time between the Lok Sabha results and the assembly elections to address issues of civic incompetence and bureaucratic lethargy that had become to disillusion urban voters. The re-assertion of the Jat vote that backed Modi at the Centre but worried about being sidelined at the state level took BJP by surprise, indicating lack of political foresight.The situation was more comfortable in Maharashtra, where BJP retained the backing of urban voters while in the end containing the charge of Maratha warhorse Sharad Pawar even though he managed to restrict the saffron numbers. Yet, it was a close thing and clearly BJP did not anticipate such a strong showing from NCP, which, it felt, had been pinned down under corruption charges.The below-expectation results mean BJP will find itself a peg or two down from the post-Lok Sabha high it enjoyed and which saw it have its way in Parliament with the passage of contentious bills to make triple talaq punishable and abolish J&K’s special status. The opposition would have recovered some of its spunk by the time the winter session of Parliament begins on November 18.The opposition did focus on the economic slowdown and unemployment and the barbs did hit home, and the BJP brass can ill-afford to be negligent on this score with assembly polls in Jharkhand and Delhi on the horizon. But in the end, BJP has shown enough resilience to retain office in Maharashtra, and that too as head of the alliance with Shiv Sena. In Haryana, it might have done just enough to ward of the pincer attack of a rejuvenated Congress and the new kid on the block, Dushyant Chautala , ending six short of the majority mark.The relative inexperience of BJP chief ministers, reassertion of caste factors and a slowing economy could have extracted a steeper cost. For the opposition, waiting it out another five years will be a demanding task.
