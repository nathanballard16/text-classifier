West Bengal minister and state president of Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, Siddiqullah Chowdhury, Sunday said Union Home Minister Amit Shah would not be allowed to step out of the airport whenever he visits Kolkata if the Citizenship Amendment Act is not immediately withdrawn.

Chowdhury said the contentious law is against humanity and the citizens of the country “living here for ages”.

“We may not allow him (Shah) to step out of the city airport if necessary. We may gather one lakh people there to

stop him,” he said at a Jamiat-Ulema-e-Hind rally against the CAA.

The state’s library service minister claimed that the organisation’s movement would be democratic and peaceful.

“We don’t believe in violent protests, but we will certainly oppose CAA and the National Register of Citizens (NRC) tooth and nail,” he said.

The minister said the BJP has already been rejected by the people. “Just look at the ongoing protests all over the country, including in Kolkata,” he said.

Chowdhury, who addressed the rally at Rani Rasmoni Avenue, said the “56-inch chest” of PM Narendra Modi has let down the people of the country, as he is “pursuing the politics of hatred and division”.

“What they (Modi and Shah) are doing is thrusting one agenda after another on the people. They don’t believe in discussion, they don’t believe in dialogue. We won’t let them pursue this,” he asserted.

The speakers at the rally also thanked Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for hitting the streets to register her protest against CAA and NRC.

“Please don’t resort to violence, demonstrate peacefully. Muslims, Hindus and members of other communities in Bengal are fighting the CAA and NRC battle together. We must maintain that amity,” one of the speakers said in his

address.
