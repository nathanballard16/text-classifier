Office-goers and others who depend on auto rickshaws for their daily commute are likely to have a tough time as thedrivers have threatened to go on anfrom midnight of Monday. Around 2.2 lakh rickshaws will remain off roads inwhile the strike is likely to spread to different cities and towns inin support of their demand for hike in fare. In all, 20 lakh auto drivers are expected to participate in the strike.Around 350 different associations across Maharashtra have come together under the banned of Auto rikshaw Chalak Malak Sanghatna Sanyukta Kruti Samiti Maharashtra and have called for a statewide strike.Secratary of the Kruti Samiti, Shashank Rao, who is also the union leader of the largest rickshaw association, has demanded that the government increase the fares based on the recommendation of Hakim Committee as against the Khatua Committee.The unions want the government to freeze the process of issuing permits for auto rickshaws, stating that their numbers have doubled. “In Mumbai alone in the past one year, the number of auto rickshaws has increased from one lakh to two lakhs,” said Rao.Rao has also alleged that many autos and buses are operating illegally, saying that they are eating into their business. “There should be one team formed in each city across Maharashtra to crack down on vehicles operating illegally,” said Rao.According to Rao, the fare hike is the need of the hour as the auto fares have not been raised in the past three years. He said the unions resorted to strike as multiple reminders sent to transport minister, transport secretory, transport commissioner and other officials concerned did not yield any positive result.“Just about 10 days ago on June 29, we submitted a letter to the all officials concerned, including the chief minister, asking them to resolve the issue but there was no response. It will be a complete strike with its ‘epicentre’ in Mumbai but will spread to other parts of the state,” said Rao.The unions have also demanded that schemes such as those related to medical benefit and pension be launched under the recently set up Welfare Board for auto drivers.
