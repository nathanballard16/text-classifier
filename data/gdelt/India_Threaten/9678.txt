Gujarat: Rivers in spate, officials warn people of danger

VADODARA: The district administration of Chhota Udepur has issued advisory to citizens to stay away from rivers and ravines in the wake of fresh inflow of water in Orsang and Ashwin – the two major rivers of the district.Heavy rainfall in the upper catchment areas has resulted in rivers brimming bank-to-bank. The district received average rainfall of one inch on Saturday. But with the neighbouring Alirajpur district in Madhya Pradesh receiving an average rainfall of over 2.8 inches, the rivers in Chhota Udepur witnessed fresh inflow of water.As the water level in rivers have increased at least four causeways have become unusable. “We have requested people not to cross causeways in such conditions. They should take a longer route so that no untoward incidents take place,” said district collector Sujal Mayatra Earlier last week causeways near Bhorda village and Sukapura villages were closed as water had started flowing above the causeways. At Undva village in Pavi Jetpur, a causeway was damaged which was later repaired and made useable.Last week, three persons had drowned while crossing causeways over different rivers and their bodies were fished out.On Sunday, a rail underbridge at Pratappura in Bodeli had become inaccessible as water had accumulated there. Officials of the district administration made efforts to pump out water.
