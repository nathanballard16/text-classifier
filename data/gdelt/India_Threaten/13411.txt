Amit Shah cites Ramayana to warn about the consequences of war

NEW DELHI: After Pakistani PM Imran Khan raised the spectre of a nuclear conflict with India over the Kashmir issue, home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday cautioned against war and said one should take a cue from the Ramayana about how frightening it could be.“One can learn how frightening war can be from the conversation between Lord Ram and the sea god mentioned in Valmiki Ramayan... it also tells us how sacrosanct a woman’s dignity is as there could be war for the dignity of a woman,” Shah said while inaugurating the fifth International Ramayan Festival organised by Indian Council for Cultural Relations on the occasion of PM Modi’s birthday.Shah was referring to Lord Ram’s prayers for three days on the sea shore as he fasted and meditated, praying to the sea god, Varuna, to help him find a way to cross to Lanka. Finding no response, Ram shot arrows into the sea, leading to death of several creatures after which Varuna responded to his request.Earlier, speaking at the 46th National Management Convention held by All India Management Association, Shah spoke about the bold decision-making on national security and said though Indians feel proud when steps like surgical strikes and air strikes are taken, it is a fine line that the government has to tread and ensure that nothing goes wrong. “Modi government will not compromise even a bit on national security. This is amply evident again in the bold decision of removing Articles 370 in J&K,” he said.Shah said earlier the world used to say that India does not have a national security policy, India only talks and does not take action to secure its people and it was also said that the surgical strikes were a fluke and a knee-jerk reaction.“With the Balakot air strikes, a clear message was sent out that India has a welldefined policy to defend our borders and not even an iota of aggression towards the country will be tolerated. Post the air strikes, India’s stance has attained respect globally,” he added.
