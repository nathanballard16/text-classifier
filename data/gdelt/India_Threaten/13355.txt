Chennai IIT readies plan to demolish Maradu flats

Kochi: An expert panel from the Indian Institute of Technology, Chennai, has prepared an interim report on the ecological impact of demolishing the Maradu flats and will submit it to the state government on Tuesday while 13 agencies from outside the state have evinced interest in carrying out the razing work.

“The IIT team headed by Ravindra Gettu, professor, Building Technology and Construction Mana-gement Division, prepared the interim report which mainly focuses on the demolition plan for the five apartments. The same will be studied in detail before handing down further directions to the Maradu municipality,” said a senior government official.

“I will formally submit the report to the government tomorrow,” Gettu told DC.

The principal secretary, Department of Environment, had earlier approached the IIT seeking technical guidance in carrying out the demolition. The state has to file a compliance report to the Supreme Court on the action taken before September 22.

Meanwhile, the Maradu municipality has prepared a list of 13 experienced companies for carrying out the demolition.

“All the agencies are from outside the state though no international companies have responded. All of them have adequate experience. Now one of them will be selected by a technical wing of IIT after figuring various factors like plan with minimal environment impact and debris management,” said a municipality official.

The deadline for responding to the expression of interest ended at 5 p.m. on Monday.
