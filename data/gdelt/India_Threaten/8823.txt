Doctors stir

There is no crime more deplorable than an assault on the saviours of human life. A doctor who enters the medical profession taking the Hippocratic Oath will never deliberately harm a patient. Those in the medical profession must be given moral and emotional support. The government must also assure doctors that criminal acts against them will be punishable (Page 1, “Doctors stir: Home Ministry sends advisory to West Bengal”, June 16).

While the concerns of the striking medical doctors may be genuine, as no doctor can discharge his or her duties properly when in constant threat of retaliation for acts done in good faith, a tough political stance too can end up vitiating an already surcharged atmosphere. The government needs to initiate confidence-building measures. At the same time, the NDA government should not view the crisis in West Bengal as an opportunity to enhance its political prospects. Health is not an issue where one can resort to the detestable act of fishing in troubled waters.
