No chance of bilateral talks with India on Kashmir until curfew is lifted: Imran Khan

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday said his government will not hold any bilateral talks with India unless curfew and restrictions are lifted in Jammu and Kashmir.

Speaking to local media in Pakistan, Khan said, "There is no chance of talks with India on Kashmir until the curfew is lifted."

Khan, who has been vocal against the Indian government on the scrapping of Article 370, had said earlier that there is "no question" of talks with India. Since the decision, Pakistan has been trying to garner support from the international community to back its stand.

However, India has reiterated several times that its decision to abrogate Article 370, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir, was done with respect to Constitutional guidelines.

New Delhi further informed Islamabad and all international forums that Kashmir is an internal matter and Pakistan has no right to interfere.

Indian envoys have also explained how scrapping Article 370 could lead to better living conditions for people in Jammu and Kashmir.

Despite several explanations and statements, Pakistan continues to attack the Indian government every day over the situation in Kashmir.

Following Union External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar's statement on PoK, Imran Khan warned New Delhi against making such "irresponsible and belligerent" statements as it could lead to further escalation.

"We strongly condemn and reject the inflammatory and irresponsible remarks made by the Indian external affairs minister regarding Pakistan and PoK. These remarks are an obvious manifestation of India's utter frustration over the continued international censure of its egregious human rights violations in Kashmir," said Pakistan's Foreign Office in a statement.
