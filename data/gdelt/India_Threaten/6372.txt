AAP plans to release central manifesto on May 25

The AAP has planned a central manifesto to be released on April 25 for the May 12 Lok Sabha elections while next month after May 1, its seven candidates will release their constituency-specific manifestoes.

AAP senior leader Gopal Rai in the presence of all the seven AAP candidates made the announcement, and added that the party will begin its third phase of election campaign in the national capital.

The party in the central manifesto will tell the voters why they should vote for the AAP. The party will share with the people its roadmap and advantages of electing the AAP in the Lok Sabha elections in Delhi, said Rai.

“Our candidates have worked hard and earned the trust of people in Delhi,” said the AAP leader.

Terming Congress a “vote-cutter” party, Rai warned people against voting for it. “It’s a battle for Delhi’s right and this time you need to think carefully before exercising your franchise,” he said.
