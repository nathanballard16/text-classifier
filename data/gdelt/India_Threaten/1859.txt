Congress alleges conflict of interest in Mehrishi’s role as CAG

NEW DELHI: Fearing Modi government’s attempt to hand itself a clean chit in the CAG report on Rafale, the Congress on Sunday raised questions over the credibility of auditor general Rajiv Mehrishi and alleging a conflict of interest because he served as finance secretary when the 36 aircraft deal was finalised.The much-awaited CAG report on the Rafale deal is likely to be submitted to the government by the auditor on Monday for tabling in the ongoing Budget session of Parliament.In a clear indication that Rafale, for the Congress, is far from being a “dead horse”, the party prepared ground for fresh clashes between the BJP and opposition in Parliament over Rafale by claiming Mehrishi is “disentitled” to probe his own decisions.Congress also sent a five-page memorandum to Mehrishi, in which Sibal and leader of opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad cited the cardinal principle of law that “no one can be a judge in his own cause”. They also pointed to facts that Mehrishi was finance secretary from October 29, 2014 to August 30, 2015, the period in which UPA II’s 126 aircraft deal was scrapped and a new 36 aircraft deal was signed between the Indian and French governments.“This means that at the time of unilateral announcement for purchase of 36 Rafale aircraft at a cost of Rs 58,000 crore by Prime Minister Modi, you were the Finance Secretary. Even at the time of cancellation of the 126 aircraft MMRCA deal on June 24 2015, you were the Finance Secretary,” the Congress memorandum said, adding that Mehrishi was also involved in the negotiations of the Rafale deal.Congress also accused CAG Mehrishi of failing to put on record his role in the Rafale deal to the Supreme Court, pointing to a direct “conflict of interest" which renders him “ineligible to conduct any audit on the Rafale deal as CAG”.“We urge upon you that you are disentitled in law from conducting a forensic audit of the Rafale deal as the CAG in the light of incontrovertible and overwhelming facts and evidence that exist. It is an act of gross impropriety for your to deal with the audit of the 36 Rafale aircraft deal on account of patent conflict of intent writ large. You are constitutionally, legally and morally disentitled to either conduct an audit or to present a report before the Parliamentary Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Parliament,” Congress said.On Sunday, Sibal said Mehrishi must recuse himself from the investigation and publicly accept the “gross impropriety” he committed by initiating the audit of the 36 aircraft deal. “Officials should know that elections come and go...We will keep an eye on officials who are over enthusiastic and trying to show loyalty to PM. They should remember that the Constitution is bigger than anything,” Sibal said, a second such warning to bureaucrats by Congress leaders in the last one week.
