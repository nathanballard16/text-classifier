No headway in TV crew attack case

Police scan CCTV cameras at entry and exit of the road

A day after crew members of a TV news channel were attacked on the Barapullah elevated road, the police said on Monday they were yet to make any headway in the case.

In the absence of CCTV cameras on the elevated road, the police said they were scanning footage of CCTV cameras available at the entry and exit points of the road.

Sketches prepared

“We have alerted the entire network of informers with the details of suspects. Sketches of two suspects have been prepared and circulated for identification. The forensic examination of the cab which was attacked is also being carried out. A total of 16 teams are working on the case and multiple raids have been conducted in Delhi-NCR,” said DCP (Crime) Ram Gopal Naik.

The officer added that teams of Crime Branch and District Police are investigating the case.

“We have several leads in the case and the teams are working on it. We are also verifying the status of robbers who had recently been released on bail from Tihar jail,” the officer added.

Early morning on Sunday, in a suspected robbery attempt, two bike-borne assailants opened fire at the TV crew which was on its way to an assignment. The assailants fired three shots aiming at the car.

Suspended cops

Preliminary inquiry found that policemen on duty at the barricade ignored the complaint of the victims. The three policemen were suspended for ignoring their complaint.

Joint Commissioner of Police (Southern Range) Devesh Srivastava said that the police have rounded up more than 50 people for questioning and have scanned more than 100 CCTV cameras installed at possible routes taken by the assailants to enter or exit the evaluated road.

“The Delhi police will not tolerate insensitive behaviour of its officers. We are working to deploy PCR vans and ensure patrolling by police motorcycles to provide maximum security on DND and Barapullah flyovers,” added Mr. Srivastava.
