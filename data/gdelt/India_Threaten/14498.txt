Volunteers work to update GR Ronald McDonald House

From our media partners at WOOD TV:

GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (WOOD) — More than 120 volunteers are working Monday and Tuesday to update the Ronald McDonald House of Western Michigan.

The Ronald McDonald House in Grand Rapids was awarded the annual volunteer project for 2019 by Herman Miller in Zeeland. Each year, Herman Miller gives its employees 16 paid hours to work with a charity of their choice.

On Monday, volunteers worked on a new mural designed by Mamata Volvoikar, Herman Miller’s top graphic designer from India. OAK Construction installed the wall on which the mural was painted.

“Every piece of that mural means something specific to the Ronald McDonald House. They gave us a bunch of words they were interested in us portraying. Hope, community and family and that’s all seen in the mural,” Sasha Wolff from Herman Miller said.
