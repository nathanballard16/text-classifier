Moody's: Moody’s warns about banks’ real estate exposure, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

MUMBAI: In the wake of default by Altico Capital , a real estate-focused NBFC backed by marque investors, global ratings major Moody’s has warned about the increasing stress for Indian banks due to their exposure to realty.It believes real estate companies are facing difficulty in repaying and refinancing their loans which are maturing because of slowing property sales.The ratings major also said in a report that although the government has announced creation of a fund that will give soft loans for residential real estate projects, it’s not clear if the step would address the sector’s short-term liquidity issues.Although domestic banks’ exposure to Altico Capital was modest, “the default signals increasingly tight liquidity among property developers, a credit-negative for Indian banks given their significant exposure to the real estate sector”, the report said.Currently, of the several domestic banks Moody’s has rated, Yes Bank (with 14% of gross loans) and IndusInd Bank (12%) have large direct exposure to the commercial real estate sector.These banks “would be susceptible to asset quality difficulties if the real estate sector continues to slow”, the report said. ICICI Bank and Axis Bank also have significant exposure to the sector “with commercial real estate loans making up more than 5% of their overall loans”.Indian banks have indirect exposure to the realty sector through their lending to NBFCs and HFCs, which also lend to real estate developers.“Based on data from the RBI, overall exposure of NBFCs and HFCs to the real estate sector was only about 6% of their total assets as on March 31, 2019. However, some NBFCs and HFCs are more exposed than others, making them vulnerable to a slowdown in the sector,” the report warned.For long, analysts and brokers have been raising concerns about Yes Bank’s exposure to the real estate sector. On Thursday’s weak market, Yes Bank closed over 15% down after its main promoter Rana Kapoor sold part of his stake to pare personal loans.
