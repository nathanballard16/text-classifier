"The woman, in her early 30s and mother of a 9-year-old son, appeared very angry and upset, hurled expletives at everyone and even threatened to mow down anybody who came near her," Gawari said.

"Hearing the commotion at that early hour, several residents rushed out and summoned the police," added Gawari. Mishra let off a string of abusive words at the people and the police, threatened to mow down anybody who dared to confront her.

At one point, she even threatened to remove her clothes if troubled.

Later, she was taken away by her family members.
