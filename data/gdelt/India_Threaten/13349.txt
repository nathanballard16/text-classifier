Mamata Banerjee likely to meet PM Modi on Wednesday

NEW DELHI: West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi here on Wednesday, according to state secretariat sources in Kolkata. She is expected to reach Delhi on Tuesday evening.The meeting, in the backdrop of the ongoing CBI investigations into the Sarada Ponzi scheme scam that alleges involvement of several TMC leaders and renewed efforts to question ADG, CID and former Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar, would be the first between Banerjee and Modi since the Prime Minister won his second term and took office in May.Banerjee’s meeting with Modi is also significant as it comes weeks ahead of bilateral talks between Modi and Bangladesh premier Sheikh Hasina here on October 5. Hasina is slated to attend the India Economic Summit in New Delhi on October 3 and 4.According to government sources, the sensitive Teesta water-sharing treaty with Bangladesh might come up in the PM’s talks with Banerjee, who had earlier told Modi that she was not opposed to sharing water with Bangladesh but sharing water from river Teesta would adversely impact irrigation in north Bengal. The CM had suggested that the Centre should instead offer to share waters from other rivers, like Sankosh, Torsa, Manshai and Dhansai, with Bangladesh. Even the Bengal BJP unit is on the same page with Banerjee on this issue.Apart from a host of Centre-state issues, like delay in payment under MNREGS, bank mergers and the plight of BSNL employees, Banerjee may update the PM on the ground-level operations against Bangladeshi operatives of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen who have been arrested in Bengal.Banerjee, a harsh critic of BJP and various policies of the Modi government since his last term, had cancelled her visit to Modi’s second swearing-in ceremony in the last moment, after first accepting the invitation, as BJP leaders had invited a group of victims of violence in Bengal to participate at the ceremony with the purpose of “showcasing breakdown of law and order in the TMC-ruled state,” that irked the chief minister.“An appointment was sought by the chief minister's office last week for an appointment from Modi's office for the meeting. It will take place at 4.30 pm in New Delhi on Wednesday,” a CMO official said in Kolkata.The last time that Banerjee was in Delhi was before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, when the TMC chief was playing an active part in the opposition formation of parties against the BJP-led NDA, to work out a coordinated blow to the BJP, but with the poll results bringing back BJP with an improved majority in the Lok Sabha as compared to the last time, the opposition unity of parties fell apart.BJP’s first big victory in Bengal with 18 out of 42 Lok Sabha seats for the first time in the party’s history, that delivered an unexpected blow to TMC which was hoping to improve its own tally in the state, also fueled greater viciousness between the two sides which are fighting a bitter battle in the state at present, targeting the 2021 assembly polls.Hence there is much speculation on the political outcome of the Banerjee-Modi meeting coming up on Wednesday.The last time that Modi and Banerjee met was for the convocation ceremony of the Vishwa Bharati University, in Santiniketan in May 25, 2018.
