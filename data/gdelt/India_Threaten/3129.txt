World Community Urges India, Pakistan to Avoid Escalation of Hostilities

New Delhi (Sputnik) — China, considered a close ally of Pakistan, has called for restraint on the part of both India and Pakistan, urging both to do more to improve bilateral ties in the aftermath of the alleged violation of Pakistani airspace by the Indian Air Force, which the latter claim was an anti-terror operation.

"India and Pakistan are both important countries in South Asia. Sound relations and cooperation serve the interest of both countries for peace and stability in South Asia," Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang said during a press briefing today.

The Chinese spokesperson further added "the two countries can keep restraint and do more to improve bilateral relations."
