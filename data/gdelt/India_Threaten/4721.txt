Sam Pitroda's comment on Balakot strike leaves Congress red-faced

NEW DELHI: An embarrassed Congress was forced to distance itself from tech czar Sam Pitroda ’s statement that air strikes on the Jaish terror camp in Balakot in Pakistan were “not the right approach” even as PM Narendra Modi pounced on the comment to attack the opposition party.In comments on the Pulwama terror attack, Pitroda, an adviser to Rahul Gandhi , said attacks happened all the time and then referred to the Mumbai terror strikes in 2008 when the Congress-led UPA was in office, saying the then government could have used air power too but that would not have been the right approach. He also sought more information on the Balakot air strikes, referring to media reports questioning claims that 300 terrorists were killed.With the IAF action a key element of BJP’s nationalism and national security plank, Modi picked up Pitroda’s comments, saying the remarks reflected that Congress was unwilling to respond to forces of terror. With several BJP leaders following suit, Modi said Rahul’s “most trusted advisor and guide”, had kick-started Pakistan National Day celebrations on behalf of his party, “ironically by demeaning India’s armed forces”.Modi posted a series of tweets using the hashtag ‘Janta Maaf Nahi Karegi’ (people won’t forgive), and said, “Loyal courtier of Congress’s royal dynasty admits what the nation already knew — Congress was unwilling to respond to forces of terror. This is a New India — we will answer terrorists in a language they understand and with interest.”Pitroda, who headed Indian Overseas Congress and has been the organiser of Rahul’s foreign engagements, had said one cannot “jump on an entire nation” (Pakistan) just because some eight people “came here and attacked”.Congress said this was his personal opinion while highlighting that Rahul had called the Balakot air strikes a “shining example of the valour of Indian Air Force”. With the BJP brass seizing on Pitroda’s remarks to call Congress soft on terror, the AICC tried to wriggle out with a counter offensive. Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “PM Modi is hiding behind the valour of our defence forces and clinging on to the allegation of a particular person — that is his personal opinion and has nothing to do with the party — to do politics so that he does not have to answer questions about corruption.”Calling Pakistan a “terror state”, he said Pulwama was a national security failure of the Modi regime and that BJP had released Jaishe-Muhammed chief Masood Azhar who was directing attacks on Indian soil.
