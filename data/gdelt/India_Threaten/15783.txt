MP government may impose cow tax to generate gaushala funds

The Madhya Pradesh government under the leadership of Congress leader Kamal Nath had promised to open gaushalas in every panchayat before the elections in the state. However, the party has not been able to fulfil its promise till now.

According to the government it requires a huge fund and the government treasury is not in a position to bear this burden.

To reduce this burden, the Animal Husbandry Department of the Kamal Nath government is now considering imposing cow-cess or cow-tax in the state.

A highly placed source of animal husbandry department confirmed this to India Today on phone that during a recent meeting a proposal came to impose cow-cess but no decision has been taken on it yet.

Right now this is only an idea that was discussed in the meeting. It is not yet decided when will it be implemented and on which items or products this cess will be imposed.

Animal Husbandry Department said that there are about 10 lakh destitute cows in Madhya Pradesh according to the latest cattle census.

Simultaneously, the state government has announced opening of 1000 gaushalas. Although the promise of opening a gaushala in every panchayat was made at the time of elections, it is not possible due to shortage of funds.

Reportedly, the government's treasury has died due to the damage caused by heavy rains and floods this year. Therefore, new ways of raising funds for gaushalas are being considered.

However, it is not clear when the final decision will be taken or whether it will be implemented or not, as the department has also expressed the possibility that issue of imposing cow-cess may become a political tool for the opposition party.
