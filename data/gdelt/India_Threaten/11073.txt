NEW DELHI, India: The former Chief Ministers of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Mehbooba Mufti and Omar Abdullah have formally been arrested by Indian forces after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led New Delhi government repealed the Special Status of the Occupied Valley by abolishing the Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.

Earlier both of them were placed under house arrest. But now as per the Indian media, Mehbooba Mufti has been formally arrested and taken from her home in Srinagar to a nearby government guest house.

We wrongly preferred India over Pakistan: Mehbooba Mufti

Meanwhile talking to BBC Urdu, the President of the Jammu and Kashmir Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Mehbooba Mufti admitted that they were wrong to prefer India over Pakistan at the time of accession in 1947, and said that the Indian government wants to create a Gaza-like situation in Jammu & Kashmir, and wants to treat the valley the same way as Israel is doing to Palestine.

Mehbooba Mufti said that she was severely disheartened over the announcement by the Indian Home Minister Amit Shah to abolish Jammu and Kashmir’s Special Status. She said that today is the darkest day for Indian democracy.

The former J&K Chief Minister said that even the Parliament, which is the political temple in India, has also disappointed them. She said that now they feel that the Indian leadership merely wanted to occupy the Jammu and Kashmir Valley, and they are not concerned about its people.

The PDP President warned that the unilateral move by the Indian government would leave far-reaching and dangerous consequences for the subcontinent.

The abrogation of Article 370 hasn’t just made accession null & void but also reduces India to an occupation force in Jammu and Kashmir. https://t.co/PS6JxYhSaI — Mehbooba Mufti (@MehboobaMufti) August 5, 2019
