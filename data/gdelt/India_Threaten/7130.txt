US Warns India Against Any Move to Impose Retaliatory Tariffs

Nevertheless, Ross emphasised the market opportunities available in India despite trade barriers. Earlier in the day, Ross met the Indian prime minister and "raised several matters, including trade barriers".

"There is an imbalance in Indo-US trade. I would like to rephrase 'Make America great again' with 'Make America great with Indian cooperation'", Ross said.

The statement came in the backdrop of US President Donald Trump's remark on Sunday, saying tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% on Friday. It sent ripples in the Asian market. In addition, Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on an additional $325 billion of Chinese goods "shortly". The announcement came in the midst of trade talks between the US and China.

Last month, Trump called India a "tariff king", which was countered immediately by the South Asian country.

"They charge us 100% tariffs on goods. So, they send a motorcycle — and they make a lot of them-Indian cycles. They send them to our country. We charge them nothing. We send a Harley Davidson to India and they charge us 100%. Not fair, okay. Not reciprocal. It's not fair", Trump said at the National Republican Congressional Committee's annual spring dinner in April.

India imposes high duties on several items, such as whiskey and wines (150%), automobiles (60-100%), mango juices (50%), and marble blocks (40%). The country's average tariff at 13.8% may be higher than that of the US' 3.4%, but is almost at par with South Korea's (13.7%).
