Garo woman rescued in Delhi, FB friend held

SHILLONG: A 22-year-old Garo woman was rescued from Delhi international airport by police early on Friday morning.

According to a press release by the Delhi Police North East Representative (DPNER) member Daniel Stone Lyngdoh, the woman hailing from Williamnagar in East Garo Hills was stranded at the airport when she reached there at midnight from Guwahati International Airport as her mobile phone had conked out. She came to Delhi to meet a Nigerian national who she had befriended on Facebook.

According to the release, the woman had asked for help from a lady who in turn notified the IGI T3 police as well as Malviya Nagar police station. Lyngdoh was also notified by the police about the woman.

Upon interrogation, the woman revealed that she came to Delhi without informing her relatives to meet Franck Essoh, who had also booked the flight ticket for her. He was arrested after she gave his details.

The girl was then taken to Meghalaya House where Lyngdoh held a meeting with the deputy residence commissioner who helped in tracing her relatives on the same day with the help of Rev Ferdie Areng of Delhi A’chik Christian Fellowship. In this regard, Lyngdoh issued a warning on the use of social media as many from the North East are being cheated and remain untraceable.
