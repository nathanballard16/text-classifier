(This article was originally published by The Economic Times on 04/01/2019.)New Delhi: Pakistan has positioned groups of terrorists, Special Service Group commandos and snipers opposite the Rajouri and Poonch areas for a possible plan to carry out attacks on Indian Army posts along the Line of Control, intelligence and defence officials said.Security agencies for the past few days have been consistently receiving inputs of a strong concentration of Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists and Pakistani commandos opposite the Rajouri sector and Poonch’s Krishna Ghati sector. This comes immediately after a failed Border Action Team (BAT) attempt to attack an Indian post in the Naugam sector on December 30.A BAT consists of a handful of SSG personnel and terrorists, created to quietly and swiftly carry out crossborder attacks on Indian posts. While the terrain, including the thick vegetation, in Rajouri and Krishna Ghati could provide cover to the BAT, the Army here has a robust anti-infiltration system.The Army last month foiled at least four BAT attempts to attack its posts along the LoC in Poonch, Tangdhar, Keran and Naugam sectors. The latest was the one which took place in Nougam in which two Pakistani intruders were killed. The intruders, who were dressed in combat uniform, were carrying a large amount of arms, ammunition and improvised explosive devices, which sources indicated that they were planning a major attack.“Pakistan has been concentrating terrorists and SSG commandos opposite Rajouri and Poonch sectors. There are about five to six groups of terrorists with these commandos. This comes after the most recently foiled BAT attempt,” an official said.According to sources, the latest inputs suggest that a platoon (comprising about 30 personnel) of a light commando battalion of Pakistan, with snipers from another commando unit, has been positioned opposite the two sectors.Intelligence agencies have also gathered that there has been heightened activity at several Pakistani posts, especially at their Shini, Batal and Peer posts, located opposite Krishna Ghati.Sources said in light of this information, the possibility of a BAT attack in the Krishna Ghati sector could not be ruled out, as the hills there are smaller in comparison to other areas along the LoC, making them easier to cross. There is also thick vegetation ahead of Indian posts and nullahs, which can provide cover to BAT members.
