Pakistanâ€™s ballistic missile arsenal and why India is safe from all of them

New Delhi:

In one of the biggest announcements on Jammu and Kashmir post India’s Independence in 1947, the central government-led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently bifurcated Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. Along with the bifurcation, Article 370 – which grants special status to Jammu and Kashmir – was removed. Also, the Article 35A of the Indian Constitution, which empowers Jammu and Kashmir state's legislature to define “permanent residents” of the state and provide special rights and privileges to those permanent residents, was scrapped. The move was appreciated across the country. The change in status of Jammu and Kashmir means that a better-coordinated security force would be on the LoC keeping a tighter vigil on Pakistan's activities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir including Gilgit-Baltistan. Due to the move, Pakistan was irked and approached to the United Nations. On the other hand, India received support on the international forum and countries like US and Russia over its move on Jammu and Kashmir. In the meantime, Pakistan PM Imran khan often tries to threaten New Delhi with nuclear arms, something which has been done by other heads of the neighbouring country. The tension between India and Pakistan is currently at its peak. Here’s the list of missiles of Pakistan that can be used against India. Also, here’s the reason why India has the edge against Pakistan.
