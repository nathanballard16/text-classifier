Trump trying to double-cross India, Pakistan: Pak Minister

Rawalpindi, Aug 29 : Pakistan's motormouth Railway Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad on Thursday said that US President Donald Trump is trying to mislead both India and Pakistan on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.

This comment at a press conference, comes after his prediction of a war between India and Pakistan in October-Novemeber at a rally here on Wednesday.

Ahmad said that Trump had earlier said that he was ready to mediate on the Kashmir issue if India wanted and that his offer was based on a request from Prime Minister Modi, but later took a u-turn and said both India and Pakistan should talk and resolve the issue bilaterally.

Accoring to reports in the Pakistani media, Ahmad told mediapersons here that no power on earth could restart the cross-border Thar and Samjhauta Express trains, which he had stopped, as long as he remains the Railway Minister.

He said that if war broke out between the two South Asian neighbouring nations, "we will destroy India".
