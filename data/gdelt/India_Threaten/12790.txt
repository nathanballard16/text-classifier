Protests in occupied Kashmir claim another life

SRINAGAR: A man died in occupied Kashmir nearly a month after being injured in a protest, officials said on Wednesday.

Asrar Ahmed Khan, 18, from the disputed region’s main city Srinagar, died on Tuesday night in hospital, succumbing to wounds he suffered a month ago, officials said.

“He was reportedly injured with a blunt object in a law and order situation where a violent crowd was indulging in stone pelting,” Jammu and Kashmir Director General of Police Dilbagh Singh said.

Some protesters said Khan was hit by a tear gas canister, though authorities suspected a stone struck him, Singh said.

Media have reported several other deaths during protests, but authorities have denied that.

India flooded the occupied valley with troops, restricted movements and cut off communication as Prime Minister Narendra Modi withdrew special rights for India-held Kashmir on Aug 5.

The occupied region lost its right to frame its own laws and non-residents were allowed to buy property there in changes the Indian government claimed would help the region’s development.

Mobile and internet connections have been off for 31 days. Hundreds of political leaders and activists, including three former chief ministers, have been detained.

A senior government source said last week that at least 500 protests and incidents of stone throwing have occurred since Aug 5, leaving nearly 100 civilians and 400 members of the Indian security forces injured. Reporters have spoken to relatives of three people they alleged have died — including a man and woman in separate incidents after tear gas was released near them, and a teenager who drowned while being chased by police.

Prime Minister Imran Khan this week warned of the risk of war with India, but said Pakistan would not act first.
