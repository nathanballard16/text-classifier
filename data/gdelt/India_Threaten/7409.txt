Siddaramaiah out to topple coalition govt, says BJP leader Jagadish Shettar

HUBBALLI: Indicating fissures between the Congress and JD(S), BJP leader Jagadish Shettar on Tuesday said that Siddaramaiah has fixed a time bomb which will destroy the coalition government on May 23, the day results of the general elections will be announced.Shettar alleged that Siddaramaiah is planning to become the chief minister by ousting H D Kumaraswamy. He said that the recent war of words between Siddaramaiah and JD(S) H Vishwanath is proof enough of trouble in the coalition.“At one place he says he will take retirement from active politics and at another place he says he will become the CM next time. These statements clearly show that Siddaramaiah is instrumental in creating confusion in the government,” Shettar said.He also asked Siddaramiah to clarify is stay at Cauvery guesthouse. “After stepping down as the CM, there is only two-month period to shift to another place. But Siddaramaiah is still staying at the same house. Using his pressure tactics, Siddaramaiah got the CM sanction it to K J George. He should clarify whether he is paying rent or staying there instead of George,” he said. Shettar dared Congress and JD (S) leaders to name the at least 10 BJP MLAs who are in touch with them.
