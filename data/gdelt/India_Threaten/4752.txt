The Delhi Police are scanning CCTV footage to identify four-five accused who robbed Rs 1.40 crore from a businessman here on Friday, said a police officer here on Saturday.

The incident occurred around 7 p.m. when Vinod Garg, a grain trader, and his son were returning to their home in Saraswati Vihar of Outer Delhi in a car with Rs 1.40 crore cash in a bag.

"When they reached near Kapil Vihar of Rani Bagh, four-five bike-borne men wearing helmets intercepted the car and asked the duo to hand over the bag to them flashing guns. The accused dragged them out of the car and threatened to kill," Deputy Commissioner of Police Seju P. Kuruvilla told IANS.
