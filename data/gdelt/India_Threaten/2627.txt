Prakash Javadekar assures no threat to Kashmiri students

Union Minister dismisses claims of any threats being faced by Kashmiri students in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack.

As Kashmiri students across the country have been facing verbal and mental harassment from isolated mobs in the country, Javadekar assured them that Ministry of Human Resource Development (HRD) is in contact with the educational institutions.

The minister on Wednesday said, “There is anger in the country against Pulwama terror attack. But, I want to say that this [threats to Kashmiri students] is not true. We are in touch with universities and nothing of this sort has happened.”

Also the HRD ministry said that universities have been issued circulars to protect Kashmiri students and stay alert for any such cases.

The statement comes aftermath two educational institutes in Dehradun last week refused to admit Kashmiri students in future. The statement was given under pressure as the institutions were threatened by a mob.
