Maharashtra Assembly polls: Rift rife between Congress, NCP over seat-sharing

Serious differences have come to the fore between Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) to arrive at a consensus on the seat sharing arrangement for the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly election. Of the 288 seats, Congress has staked its claim over 145 seats leaving 125 seats to NCP and the balance 18 to other like minded and secular parties. NCP has taken a strong objection to Congress party's ''rigid'' stand saying that there is no unanimity yet between the two parties. In Mumbai of the 36 seats, Congress will fight 29 and 7 by NCP. Another NCP leader, who is engaged in negotiations with Congress, said the Congress party is not prepared to leave its ''rigid'' stand.
