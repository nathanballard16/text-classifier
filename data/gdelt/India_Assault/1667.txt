SC says enough is enough, transfers Muzaffarpur shelter home case to Delhi court

The Bihar shelter home was being run by Brajesh Thakur.

The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the transfer of the Muzaffarpur shelter home rape case from Bihar to a court in New Delhi.

The top court transferred the case from the Bihar CBI court to a POCSO (Protection of Children from Sexual Offences) Saket trial court. The court has ordered the judge to begin the trial in two weeks and complete it within six months.

While slamming the Bihar government for its management of shelter homes, the Supreme Court said, "Enough is enough. Children cannot be treated like this. You cannot let your officers treat children this way. Spare the children."

The court also rapped the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) for transferring its officer probing the sexual assault case and said it amounted to a violation of its order. A bench, headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, asked the probe agency to file an affidavit giving an explanation.

It said the court will summon the chief secretary if the state fails to give all the information.

The Muzaffarpur case received national attention last year -- a study highlighted that out of 42 girls living at an NGO-run short-stay home, 34 were found to have been sexually assaulted.

The shelter home was being run by Brajesh Thakur. An FIR was lodged against 11 people, including Thakur, on May 31.

The probe was later taken over by the CBI.
