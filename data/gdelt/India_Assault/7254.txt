Hyderabad: Another ghastly crime was reported from Telangana’s Yadadri district, just days after a girl’s body was recovered from a well. Shockingly, it was the same well that has become the centre of locals’ ire as the second body extracted from it also suggested that the victim had been sexually assaulted too.

The well of horror is situated in Hajipur, Yadadri district. Even before residents recovered from the shock of having found the body of a 14-year-old girl, allegedly raped and murdered, from an abandoned well, the body of another girl, aged 18, who had been missing for 45 days was found last evening from the same abandoned well.

Angered by the news, locals set the house of the accused on fire and vandalized the same.

The second body was discovered by the police when they were looking for clues into the alleged rape and murder of a minor girl whose corpse was found in the well. Upon scrutinising the structure, it was found that there was another body of a girl in a different part of the well.

Some people are suspecting this to be the heinous work of the accused rapist-murderer who killed both the victims in a crime spree.
