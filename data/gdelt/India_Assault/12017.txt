Foreign national gang-raped by 2 auto drivers

She had hired the vehicle to reach a metro station; accused arrested

A 24-year-old foreign national was allegedly gang-raped by an autorickshaw driver and his friend after she hired the three-wheeler to reach a metro station late on Thursday, the police said on Friday. The two accused have been arrested, they said.

The woman, a hair stylist, had hired the autorickshaw from outside Sahara Mall around midnight to reach Guru Dronacharya metro station. She had come from Delhi to visit a night club at the shopping mall on Mehrauli-Gurugram Road and was returning home when the incident happened, the police said.

The driver’s friend was there on the rear seat of the auto-rickshaw when the woman boarded the vehicle. The accused took the woman to a room in Sheetla Mala Colony and then allegedly took turns to rape her.

The woman, however, managed to open the door of the room without the knowledge of the accused and escaped around 3 a.m. She stayed at a friend’s place and approached the police during the day on Friday to file a complaint. A case was registered on charges of rape at Sector 5 police station in this connection.

Her medical examination was conducted and statement recorded before a Magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC.

Several police teams were formed and the driver’s friend was arrested from CRPF Chowk. The driver was later arrested and his vehicle was impounded.

Gurugram Police Spokesperson Subhash Boken said that the accused have confessed to having gang-raped the woman. The accused, both autorickshaw drivers, live in rented accommodations in Gurugram. Mr. Boken said that they would be produced before the court on Saturday.

The M.G. Road stretch in Gurugram, dotted with shopping malls, is infamous for crime against women. Many cases of abduction and rape have been reported in this area.
