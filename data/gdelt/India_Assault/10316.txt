Binoy Kodiyeri, son of CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, who has been booked by Mumbai police after a Mumbai-based woman accused him of rape, is absconding.

A team of investigating officers from Mumbai, who reached Kannur on Wednesday to probe the rape complaint against Binoy, has not been able to trace him. The team visited both his residences at Thiruvangad and Moozhikkara, but he was not there, according to reports.

According to local media reports, the team comprising of two officers of Sub-Inspector rank have met Binoy's family members. Binoy’s phone is reportedly switched off. The police have reportedly also sent him a notice a couple of days ago summoning him for interrogation.

"Yes he is missing, but we will not be able to divulge more details as it may hamper the investigation," a police officer from Mumbai told TNM.

A Mumbai-based woman on June 13 had filed a complaint at Mumbai’s Oshiwara police station in Mumbai alleging that Binoy had raped her for years after promising to marry her and that she has an eight-year-old child born out of the relationship. The woman, a native of Bihar, also stated in her complaint that she was not aware that Binoy was already married.

The Mumbai police have booked Binoy under IPC Sections 376 (rape) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property).

Binoy, meanwhile, has denied all the allegations. He had also told media that in April itself, he had filed a complaint with the Kannur Range IG against the woman, stating that she was blackmailing him.
