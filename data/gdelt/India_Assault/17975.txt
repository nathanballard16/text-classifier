Delhi Policemen Hold Unprecedented Protests After Clash With Lawyers

It's been a day of unprecedented protests by the Delhi police outside the Police Headquarters. Hundreds of policemen and policewomen say they feel humiliated and angry after many of their colleagues were beaten up by lawyers on Saturday after a parking incident went out of control at the Tis Hazari Court. The incident was followed by a video of another purported incident at the Saket Court where a policeman on a motorcycle was seen being assaulted by lawyers.
