The Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Monday arrested a thirty-year-old pharmacist for allegedly raping a United Kingdom (UK)-based government officer.

The Gaodevi police station registered rape case against the accused identified as Junaid Ansari.

Ansari was arrested by Unit 2 of the Mumbai Crime Branch and handed him over to the Gaodevi police.

The incident happened in the month of July near Girgaum Chowpatty in Mumbai when Junaid had taken the woman on a drive.

According to the Mumbai Police, Junaid raped the victim in his car when she had come to India to meet her relatives.

Junaid owned a shop in Dongri from the victim's mother used to by medicines and ship them to her in the UK.

The victim too had met the accused over the counter while buying medicines for infertility.

The victim got divorced from her husband in 2016 and had been visiting her mother in India on many occasions since then.

It was then that she met Junaid and became friends with him. The accused had promised to marry the victim, however, refused to tie knots with her later.

When Junaid found the woman alone, he raped her in his car at the time when she was visiting him this year in July.

When the victim returned to the UK and asked about their marriage plans, Junaid refused to marry her and asked her to forget whatever had happened between them.

The victim tried approaching Junaid to know what was wrong and even returned to India trying to meet him. The accused, however, refused to even talk to her.

Eventually, the victim realised that she had been cheated and had been taken advantage of. She later filed a complaint with the police about the incident following which Junaid was arrested.
