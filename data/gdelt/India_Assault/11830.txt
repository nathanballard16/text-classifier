AAP MPs meet HM Amit Shah over Delhi's law and order situation

Three Aam Aadmi Party Rajya Sabha members Tuesday met Union Home Minister Amit Shah over the national capital's law and order situation and urged him to look into the performance of the Delhi Police.

During the meeting, Sanjay Singh, N D Gupta and Sushil Gupta requested Shah to form a committee comprising himself, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik to analyse the city's law and order situation.

Singh said Shah assured them that he will look into the matter.

The three AAP MPs also handed over a memorandum to Shah, listing instances of crimes reported in the national capital in the past few months.

"We wish to apprise you that every year cases of crime in Delhi are increasing. According to the annual crime data of the Delhi police, 20,143 rape cases were recorded in Delhi last year. The number of murders also increased by 3.27 per cent in the last one year," the letter signed by the three MPs said.

They urged the Home Minister to take action to improve the law and order situation in Delhi.
