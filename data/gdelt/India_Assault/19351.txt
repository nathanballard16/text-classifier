India shaken by rape, murder of veterinarian, 26, on her way home

New Delhi: Hundreds of people have gathered in New Delhi, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and other Indian cities on Monday to demand justice in the case of a veterinarian who was gang-raped and killed last week.

The protesters demanded a fast-track investigation of the case and stringent laws for the safety of women in India.

"We are not safe anymore in India. We are scared to move out of our homes," said Sejal Kumar, a college student from New Delhi.

It was about 9pm when the 26-year-old woman returned to the toll plaza where she had parked her red scooter. It had a flat tyre, and a group of men nearby offered to help.

Then they grabbed her, police said, took turns raping her and smothered her to death. They tried burning the evidence of the crime: her charred body was found the next morning, identified by her elephant-shaped locket and a white scarf nearby.
