Bengaluru: A 75-year-old man was brutally hacked to death by unidentified miscreants in Channanaya kanapalya on Friday.

The deceased, Nagappa, was heading to his farm when the miscreants attacked him with rods.

The incident took place around 7.45 am and the police suspected that the fight over land could be the reason behind the murder.

“We inspected the spot where the murder took place. We got a gold chain worn by the deceased on the spot, indicating that the murder was not for robbery,” a senior police official said.

The incident came to light at 11 am when Nagappa's wife sent their servant in search of Nagappa when he did not return even after hours. When the servant went to the farm, he found Nagappa's body lying in a pool of blood.

The police who have registered a case suspect it to be the work of Nagappa's relatives.
