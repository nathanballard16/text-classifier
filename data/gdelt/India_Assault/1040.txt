Chennai: A 70-year-old man was found dead, with multiple stab injuries, at his home in JJ Nagar on Monday. The Police suspect that the murder took place because the man was allegedly in an illicit relationship with his daughter-in-law.

Yesurajan, who ran a workshop in the Ambattur area in Tamil Nadu, lived with his wife Kala (51). Their son and daughter had married and been living in the same house. The family came to believe that Yesurajan had an illicit relationship with his daughter-in-law.

He allegedly became so obsessed with his love that he wrote off all the properties he had on her name. When Kala came to know about this, she told her brother Gopal the entire story. For the fear of losing his property, Kala along with her brother Gopal, sister Daisy, daughter Jennifer and her husband Prince Xavier, planned to kill Yesurajan.

A few days ago, while Yesurajan was asleep, they smothered him with a pillow and escaped. The neighbours, at a later time, informed the police about the incident. The JJ Nagar Police arrested all the accused in the case.

In the course of their investigation, they admitted to killing Yesurajan for having an affair with his daughter-in law and for the want of his property. Following the incident, the police filed a complaint in Poonamalle Court on Wednesday night. The accused were sent to the prison as per the court order.
