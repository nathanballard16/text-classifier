Chandigarh, August 7

On the day of the pronouncement of the quantum of the sentence in the Sector 29 auto gang rape case, which took place in 2016, the public prosecutor moved an application in the local court today seeking the death penalty as enhanced punishment for convict Mohammad Irfan, who is already undergoing life imprisonment till death in the Sector 56 auto gang rape, by including Section 376 E (punishment for repeated offenders) of the IPC in the present case.

The defence counsel has been asked to submit a reply tomorrow, after which the quantum of punishment will be pronounced.

As per the application, Section 376 E has provision for enhanced punishment to a convict in case he is found to have been convicted again under Section 376 (rape) or Section 376 A or Section 376 D.

Irfan was already convicted in the auto gang rape case of 2017 under Sections 376 D and 506 of the IPC. The application states, “Taking into consideration the said judgment, according to the provisions of Section 376 E, Irfan is liable for enhanced punishment.”

According to the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, “whoever has been previously convicted of an offence punishable under Section 376 or Section 376 A or Section 376 D and is subsequently convicted of an offence punishable

under any of the said sections shall be punished with imprisonment for life, which shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person’s natural life, or with death.”

Uttar Pradesh-based Mohammad Irfan (29) and Kamal Hasan, alias Dil Dil, from Delhi were held guilty by the court of the Additional District and Sessions Judge on August 1 of raping a 21-year-old girl in 2016.
