One of 7 Indian nationals abducted in Afghanistan returns

The Ministry of External Affairs on Monday said one of the seven Indian nationals abducted in Baghlan province of Afghanistan has safely returned to India.

Militants had abducted seven employees of an Indian company KEC in May 2018.

“We are grateful to the Government of Afghanistan for their support in securing the release and repatriation of the Indian national,” the statement said.

“We continue to work closely with the Government of Afghanistan for safe and early return of the remaining six Indian nationals,” it added.

The Indian engineers were working on a project for construction of a power sub-station in Afghanistan, when they were kidnapped.
