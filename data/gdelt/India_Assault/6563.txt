She’s fair. He’s dark. So Bareilly wife sets husband on fire

A woman has set her husband on fire, killing him, for not having a fair complexion, in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly.

The incident happened on Monday when the accused Prem Shri set the victim Satyaveer Singh on fire while he was sleeping, reported The Times of India.

The victim’s Satyaveer’s brother Harveer Singh said that his sister-in-law didn’t like his brother because of his dark complexion.

Harveer said, as quoted by the national daily, She always commented on my brother’s dark complexion but we never thought that she would take such a step.

Married for over two years, the couple has a five-month-old girl child.

Inspector Sehdev Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Kurh Fatehgarh, said that initially, an FIR was registered under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code but later it was converted to section 302 (murder) after the death of Satyaveer Singh.

The accused also suffered burn injuries on her legs.
