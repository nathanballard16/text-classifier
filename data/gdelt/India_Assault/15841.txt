AN 18-year-old Rakiraki resident studying on a scholarship in Goa, India fears for his safety after being assaulted by a group of men on Wednesday night.

Shoheel Rosheel Narayan wants to either return home or have his university changed.

“One of them asked us what we were doing here and said we don’t belong here,” he said.

The group then proceeded to assault them.

Last week, Goa’s Chief Minister Pramod Sawant had appealed to people to stop looting and thrashing tourists coming to the State.
