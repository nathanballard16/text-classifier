British woman sexually assaulted during massage at five star hotel

A tourist who went for a foot spa has accused a masseuse of sexually assaulting her.

The woman, 54, was staying at an unnamed hotel in northern India where the alleged assault happened.

She told police the man in his 20s had touched her inappropriately during a massage in the city of Chandigarh on December 20.

However, the suspect has now fled the city and a manhunt is underway to find him.

Deputy superintendent of police Harjeet Kaur said: ‘We have booked the accused under rape charges as the woman alleged in her complaint that the accused touched her inappropriately and inserted his fingers into her vagina while giving her the massage.’

Police said the woman had complained to the hotel authorities the same day but lodged a formal complaint only after returning from trip to Shimla on December 27.

The woman was taken for a medical examination and her statement was recorded in front of a magistrate.

Police said they are examining CCTV footage and call records for any clues as to the man’s whereabouts.

Kaur added: ‘We haven’t arrested the accused yet as he has absconded. We are investigating the case and very soon the accused will be arrested.’

The shocking incident happened on the same day as another British tourist was raped in the western Indian resort state of Goa.

The 48-year-old British tourist was raped in the same Goan town where just 19 months ago Irish backpacker Danielle McLaughlin was raped and murdered.
