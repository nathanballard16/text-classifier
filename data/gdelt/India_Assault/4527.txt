Shameful: Beau strips pregnant lover, records act for black mailing

Hyderabad: Once known for its rich culture among minority Muslims, the city is slowly turning into a safe haven for budding criminal minds with a variety of anti-social activities reported on a day-to-day basis.

In a yet another disgusting incident, a 19-year-old intermediate student stooped so low that he stripped his 17-year-old girlfriend and recorded video of her at an isolated place near DBR Mills at Lower Tank Bund just five days ago.

The incident was reported by the victim’s family Yesterday, TOI reports.

The victim is a polytechnic student and had left her house at Domalguda on March 3 to meet her accused boyfriend.

“Alleging that she was having an affair with another boy, the accused made her strip and physically assaulted her. He also recorded her video, while she kept on pleading with him to stop,” informed P vishwa Prasad, Central Zone DCP.

The victim now pregnant was forced by the accused to abort the child. When she refused to do so, in a fit of rage took the step and recorded the video to blackmail her.

The victim told about the incident to her friend who met the accused near DBMS Mills, in place of her, where he was waiting with his four associates.

Though she forcibly made the accuse delete the video saved in his phone, the video has still been in circulation on social media and now Police are trying to find the responsible person.

The Police has now also filed a case under IPC Section 376 (rape) and the POCSO Act with victim opening up about her relationship with the accused.

A manhunt has been initiated to nab the accused.
