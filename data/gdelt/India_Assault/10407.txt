A nurse was arrested on Friday for allegedly torturing an ailing 85-year-old woman in Kolkata. According to the police, the nurse was attending the old lady for the last four months in southern Kolkata's Gangulybagan area.

The family members of 85-year-old Sukumari Saha had lodged a police complaint after which the nurse, Sanjukta Paik, was arrested by Patuli police station officers.

The family of the old woman had also submitted a CCTV footage purportedly showing the nurse beating the ailing lady, police said. The family members had installed a CCTV camera in the room of the old lady after noticing black injury marks on her face and body.

"We had taken her to a doctor thinking that the marks could be because of some illness. But despite giving her medicines, those marks remained. We then found that it was the nurse who was beating her brutally every day. We have submitted CCTV footage to the police along with our complaint," the octogenarian's son Uttam Saha said.

The old woman, who met with a brain stroke a couple of years back, was unable to move on her own and needed help even to take medicine and hence nurses were employed by her son.

Police sources said that the arrested nurse admitted of beating the old woman.

Uttam Saha said, "She (the nurse) had become almost like our family member. I'm quite shocked to see what she had been doing to my mother. This is a criminal act.. she must be punished."
