RAJKOT: In a major breakthrough, Kutch police arrested mastermind of a gang specialised in bank ATM thefts from Jodhpur in Rajasthan. The gang was involved in as many as 11 ATM theft cases across Gujarat.After receiving a tip-off that the key accused, Hasamdeen Khan (46), was hiding in Malar village of Falodi taluka in Jodhpur, Kutch police officials went there and nabbed him on Sunday.It is reported that Khan confessed of committing 11 ATM thefts in Gandhidham, Rajkot, Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Panchmahal, Surat and Bharuch.Khan led a team of 10 gang members whose modus operandi was to search for ATMs on Google map. After zeroing on the target, they would take out their pick-up van and put it inside a truck of Haryana passing to avoid toll booths and to camouflage cops so that the van could not be tracked.“After reaching the ATM, which they had zeroed in as the target, they would cut the ATM with a gas cutter and steal the cash. Thereafter, they would put the van back in the truck and take the van out only after reaching five to 10 km from the crime spot,” said Parikshita Rathod, superintendent of police, Kutch (East).With the arrest of the mastermind of this gang, police would be able to crack ATM loot cases at Padana in Gandhidham and Varsana in Anjar, police said.Mewat gang is a Haryana-based gang. Gang members keep their cellphones switched off while committing the crime sothat their locations could not be traced. Also, the gang wear gloves to evade their fingerprints and cover their faces in order to avoid detection on CCTV cameras.
