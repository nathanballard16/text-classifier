France freezes JeM leader Masood Azhar’s assets

The French government has decided to freeze the assets of Jaish-e-Mohammad leader Masood Azhar at the national level, the French government said Friday.

“France has always been and always will be by India’s side in the fight against terrorism,” the statement said.

The move comes a few days after China put a technical hold on a resolution seeking to blacklist Masood Azhar in the United Nation Security Council.

A joint statement issued by the interior and finance ministries said that the government will discuss putting Masood Azhar on the European Union list of people suspected of being involved in terrorism.

Pakistan has been under pressure for the last couple of weeks after a suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a convoy of Indian troops, killing at least 40 soldiers in Indian-administered Kashmir’s Pulwama area on February 14.
