Game of Thrones 8 ep5 preview: The war for the Iron Throne has begun

Today morning, we saw the fourth episode of the cult series Game Of Thrones season 8 and now the makers have also released a teaser video of the next episode. With just two more episodes remaining for the series to come to an end, there is a lot of tension and curiosity amongst the masses. The final war for the Iron Throne is about to begin and the teaser shows too many possibilities, with some not having a happy ending.

In the latest episode, we saw Tyrion and Varys discussing Daenerys Targaryen’s state of mind and their concern had a reference to her lineage. The teaser of episode five opens with an afraid Tyrion walking slowly towards Dany, who is standing looking at the sky. Tyrion is suspicious about her actions and so are we. Meanwhile, everyone is preparing for the war and seems like the ball is in Cersei’s court. But there is suspense at the end of the teaser. While Euron Greyjoy is ready with his army to target the last dragon, something in the sky shocks him and we hear a dragon roaring in the background. This has intrigued us to the maximum level and now we are wondering what the twist is all about. We certainly can’t wait for next Monday, what about you guys?
