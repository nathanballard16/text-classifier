Pollachi news: Lok Sabha election: Pollachi issue won’t affect BJP-AIADMK alliance’s prospects, Muralidhar Rao says

COIMBATORE: The BJP demanded that AIADMK government in Tamil Nadu take action in the Pollachi issue where a gang of men raped several girls and women, said party national general secretary Muralidhar Rao here on Tuesday. He was replying to a question about BJP's ally AIADMK's name being involved in the issue."AIADMK is a big party and an undesirable thing has happened. As a party they have to take action. The BJP demands that the government take action in the issue. We have hope that the state would take action," he said.Rao added that if the AIADMK leaders were seen as insensitive or not justice oriented, there would be a problem. “But the BJP hopes, there would be proper action,” he said.However, when asked about the NDA alliance's poll prospects being affected because of the issue, Rao said the alliance's poll prospects would not be affected by any single issue.It is to be noted that the AIADMK expelled A Nagaraj, a party member from Pollachi, for assaulting the brother of a girl who had complained against her harassers.
