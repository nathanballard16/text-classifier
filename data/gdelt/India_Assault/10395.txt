One worker was killed and another injured after a fire broke out on board the INS Visakhapatnam, the under-construction Project 15-B class stealth destroyer at Mazgaon Docks Ltd, this afternoon, fire officials said.



The person who lost his life was employed as a contract worker. He was declared brought dead by officials at the J J Hospital late this evening. The cause of death has been given as asphyxia and burns. The injured person was undergoing treatment. Their names haven’t yet been released by the authorities.



According to Mumbai Fire Brigade Chief P S Rahangdale, the fire was first reported at 5.44 pm. Eight fire engines and a Quick Response Vehicle were rushed to the spot where the second and third decks of the warship were found to be on fire, Rahangdale added.



MDL authorities said later in the evening that the fire broke out while grinding operations in the tank of the ship was being undertaken. “The fire was brought under control by 7 pm,” MDL said.

The shipyard officials added that an inquiry will be held to look into the cause of the fire.



Work on the INS Visakhapatnam began at Mazgaon Docks in April 2015. It is the first of the four stealth guided missile destroyers to be built under Project 15-B Class, according to reports.
