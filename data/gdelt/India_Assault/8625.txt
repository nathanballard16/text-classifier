Two kill each other in drunken brawl

Coimbatore: Two men, one of them a history-sheeter, stabbed each other to death in a drunken brawl at Podanur here on Monday night.

Police identified the deceased as John Britto, 26, of Sriram Nagar in Podanur, and Goldwin Raj, of Goldwin.

A painter, John Britto has murder and assault cases pending against him with the Podanur and the Chettipalayam police.

According to an investigation officer, Britto, along with his friend Praveen Prabhu, went to the Tasmac bar on Sharadha Mill Road on Monday night. “Goldwin and his friends Milton and Kutti also came to the bar. When the three were about to leave on their two-wheeler after consuming liquor, Britto and Prabhu made fun of them.”

The trio stopped the vehicle and entered into an altercation with Britto and Prabhu and they soon started to exchange blows. Britto, meanwhile, attacked Godwin with a knife and the latter suffered injuries to his stomach and head. Other people in the area soon intervened and managed to end the scuffle and send them home.

Despite his injuries and blood loss, Goldwin, along with his friends, followed Britto and Praveen to Sriram Nagar. “When Britto was about to enter his house along with Prabhu around 11.30pm, the trio challenged the two and they picked up another fight,” the police officer said.

Hearing the commotion, Britto’s father and some other neighbours came out of their houses. When Jayaprakash tried to pacify them, much to the horror of the onlookers Goldwin stabbed Britto on his chest, killing him on the spot.

Goldwin Raj and his friends immediately sped away on their two-wheeler. Goldwin later got himself admitted to a private hospital in the city, where he succumbed to his injuries without responding to treatment on Tuesday afternoon.

The Podanur police have registered a case and launched a manhunt for Goldwin’s friends Milton and Kutti, who are on the run.
