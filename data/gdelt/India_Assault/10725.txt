Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], June 27 (ANI): A Mumbai court on Thursday granted interim relief from arrest to Binoy Kodiyeri till July 1 in connection with a rape case filed against him.

A case was registered against Binoy at Oshiwara police station on June 18 in Mumbai, which Benoy described as a case of blackmail to media persons in Kerala.

According to the complaint filed by the girl, she had met Binoy for the first time in 2008 in Dubai at a dance bar, where she used to work as a dancer.

"Binoy used to visit the dance bar regularly and our friendship later transformed into a love affair," the complainant had stated.
