Corporal punishment in 50% of child homes: Report

NEW DELHI: Corporal and coercive punishment, in violation of clearly laid out norms, was reported in close to half of 9,500 child care institutions and homes with hitting and spanking, restrictions on movement, withholding food, rough language and intimidation being forms of chastisement of inmates.An analysis of data on children homes gathered between 2016-17, but released only recently shows that nearly 4,130 child care institutions and homes admitted to using measures to discipline children that are violative of the law and in many cases amount to corporal punishment and humiliation.The report gains salience after the Muzzafarpur "horror home" in Bihar was exposed last year when investigations revealed that its girl inmates were sexually assaulted with impunity. The committee said "it is a serious cause of concern to see that such negative and legally forbidden practices are in use, to some extent, in almost all the CCIs/Home of States/UTs."The findings form part of a report of a committee set-up by the ministry of women and child development to examine CCIs on a range of issues. Officials said the government took note of the data and has issued advisories and increased scrutiny.The report was submitted to minister of women and child development Maneka Gandhi late last year with a set of recommendations and is now in the public domain. According to officials, the findings of the report helped reinforce measures for corrective action and directions to CCIs are being issued from time to time on the various concerns cited in the report .The data indicates that restricting movement of children is highest at 25% in CCIs in Arunachal Pradesh, followed by 24% in Haryana and 23% in Tripura. In terms of numbers, it is seen that Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have a substantial number of CCIs/Homes where this practice is being followed.A cause for great concern was percentage of CCIs using hitting and spanking in Meghalaya (19%), Haryana (17.7%), Arunachal Pradesh (12.5%), and Delhi (10%). However in terms of actual numbers of CCIs and homes violating this rule, those in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Kerala and Tamil Nadu are far higher.
