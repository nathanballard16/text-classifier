RAJKOT: A nine-year-old girl was allegedly molested by an unidentified person in Nava Gam on the outskirts of Rajkot city on Wednesday evening. The accused also urinated on her dress when she resisted his rape attempt, said police. The incident occurred near the school where the girl studies in class IV.

During recess time in school the girl decided to go home to have something to eat. While she had walked past some distance from the school, an unidentified man grabbed her. Gagging her mouth with a piece of cloth, he dragged her to the nearby shrubs.

“The accused ripped her uniform off and urinated on it when the girl refused to comply to his wish of oral sex. Then as a passerby approached the spot, the girl shouted for help. Sensing trouble, the accused fled away from the spot,” said an official from Kuvadava Road police station.

Meanwhile, the police has started hunting for the accused. “We will prepare a sketch of the accused on the basis of the description given by the girl and try to match it with the suspects of the area. We are also trying to find out as to how many persons had used the road near the school on Wednesday evening. The biggest hurdle in our probe is the absence of a CCTV footage, as there are no cameras installed near the spot where the incident took place,” added the official.

The girl's parents are labourers. Police has booked an unidentified man under section of Indian Penal Code dealing with attempt to rape and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
