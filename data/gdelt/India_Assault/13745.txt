This Kingsnake Was So Hungry That It Ended Up Swallowing Half Of Its Own Body!

If you fear snakes and the sight of slithering reptiles make you cringe, this is the last thing you'd want see. But just in case you've gathered the courage to do so, here is a snake trying to to eat itself out of hunger. No kidding!

In a bizarre incident caught on camera, a snake in Pennsylvania “swallowed almost half of his body.”

The incident took place Friday and the video was captured by Jesse Rothacker, of Forgotten Friend Reptile Sanctuary in Elm.

Rothacker, posted the video to the sanctuary’s Facebook page, said that the kingsnake at the facility actually mistook its bottom half for another snake.

In the video Rothacker said it is rare for kingsnakes to try to swallow themselves. "As you can see, he did not just find a snake to eat. He did not just nibble on himself. This poor kingsnake is actually in the process of swallowing his own tail... He is not the smartest kingsnake around."

“They will sometimes see their own tail, they’ll think it’s a snake, they’ll take a bite out of it, and they’ll realize they’ve bit themselves,” Rothacker said.

When the kingsnake refused to let go, Rothacker was forced to use his fingernail and pull the snake from its own mouth.

Kingsnakes are nonvenomous predators that normally kill their prey by constriction.
