Voter drive ad has Nirbhaya rape convict’s photograph

HOSHIARPUR: The photograph of a death row convict in the 2012 Nirbhaya gang-rape case found a ‘pride of place’ on a flex board to create voter awareness, put up by the district electoral officer at the Hoshiarpur administration complex in Punjab.The error is glaring as the heinous and brutal crime and the subsequent trial and conviction in the case had hit news headlines across the country and the photo of the convict, Mukesh Singh, was widely used.What is more surprising is that these boards were put up at different places inside and outside the district administration complex before the Lok Sabha elections, yet no one spotted it.Thousands of people may have come to the public office after the flex board was put up, but the blunder was detected only on Friday by a visitor on seeing the board on the second floor of the complex. Soravdeep Singh, a senior executive in a corporate, said, “I had seen his picture repeatedly during the controversy around his shocking interview to a British documentary film-maker and his remorseless remarks had led to lot of outrage. His image has been identified on the internet and one can only wonder when it was downloaded and why nobody cared [to check].”In December 2012, Nirbhaya was raped onboard a moving bus in Delhi by six men, while her friend was beaten with an iron rod. She died of the brutal assault 13 days later.The convict’s shocking quotes, accompanied by his picture, were widely reported in the media when screening of the documentary “India’s daughter” was banned in the country.When contacted, Hoshiarpur deputy commissioner Isha Kalia said, “We’ll find out how this picture was selected and who is the printer. Let me inquire into it. I have asked my people to check its location and who put it up there.”
