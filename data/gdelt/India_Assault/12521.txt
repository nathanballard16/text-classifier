Don't ask questions if a BJP MLA is accused of having raped you: Rahul Gandhi on Unnao rape case

Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Monday targeted the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government over the road accident of the Unnao rape survivor.

In a tweet, he said that women shouldn't ask questions if a BJP MLA is accused of having raped you. He tweeted, "Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao. A new special education bulletin for Indian women. Don't ask questions if a BJP MLA is accused of having raped you."

Earlier in the day, CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury also linked the BJP to the accident and said that the government's 'Beti Bachao' slogan was a "grim warning in this context" as the sexual assault case was against a ruling party lawmaker.

On Sunday, a car carrying the 19-year-old survivor, who has accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of rape, her family and lawyer was hit by a speeding truck in Rae Bareli. While her two family members were killed in the accident, she and her lawyer were critically injured, police said.

Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government has said that it is ready for a CBI probe into the accident of the woman from Unnao, who had accused a BJP legislator of rape, if a request is made, the state police chief said on Monday.

Delhi Commission for Women chairperson Swati Maliwal also visited the Lucknow Trauma Centre to meet the victim.

"We will fight for the girl to get justice. The family has alleged that the accident was a conspiracy," Maliwal said.
