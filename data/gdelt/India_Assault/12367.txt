Lucknow: 'Dada gave me food, then he raped me'

LUCKNOW: Neetu curses the day she accepted a lunch invite from a stranger two years ago."I was returning home to a slum at Ballu Adda that day. Two girls approached me near Samtamulak crossing and took me to Bangali (Vijay Badri). He gave me chicken to eat, and gifted new clothes and money. I come from a poor family; how could I even resist the temptation?" she recalled.The 15-year-old was not alone to have found who she then thought was a good Samaritan. There were more boys and girls her age. She was offered the "royal treatment" the next day too, but there was a catch."This time, Bangali laced my food with sedatives. He raped me and held me captive for a few days before pushing me into prostitution. He used to send me away with men and take all the money," said the survivor who was rescued by RPF with three others, two boys and a girl, on Thursday.Neetu tried to escape several times in the past, but was caught and beaten up by Bangali's goons. Like her, other children were also born and bred in poverty. They were lured by Bangali - whom they learnt to call ' Dada ' - into a life that they soon realised they didn't want.Nilesh, 14, a native of Barabanki said, "I came to Lucknow to find work, but was trapped by Dada. He made me beg, steal and run errands."( Names changed to protect identity of the victims )
