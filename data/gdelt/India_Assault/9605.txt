Chennai: Police in the state capital of Tamil Nadu on Sunday arrested an engineer after he reportedly set off a mini-bomb at an IT Park near Singaperumal Koil on June 7 after a failed attempt to extort his employers. A 29-year-old, the man was arrested when he was trying to take his own life. He was then produced before a court which sentenced him to jail.

According to reports, the man was employed by a private firm in Mahindra Tech City. In dire need of Rs 50 lakh, he anonymously sent an email to his employers asking them to pay the sum or he would trigger a bomb in the office. When his employers did not respond, the accused downloaded a mobile phone application to trigger the bomb remotely. On June 7, he stuffed a homemade bomb in a small ball and set the device off outside the IT Park.

While the bomb did nothing more than creating smoke, security guards deployed at the IT Park reported the matter to local police who launched an investigation into the matter. By way of examining footage retrieved from closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras, police officials managed to identify the accused and traced him to his residence at Maraimalai Nagar area of Chennai.

A graduate of electrical and electronics engineering, the accused caught wind of the fact that police were on to him and tried to take his own life. However, he was found and arrested before he could take the extreme step. The Times of India reported that accused was produced before a court which sentenced him to judicial custody. It is still unclear as to why the accused was in immediate need of a hefty amount such as Rs 50 lakh. However, further investigation into the matter is likely to reveal a startling story.
