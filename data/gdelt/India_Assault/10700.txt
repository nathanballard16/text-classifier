VADODARA: Four foreign students of a private university were arrested by the taluka police on Wednesday morning for assaulting and injuring a man.The accused, all Zimbabwe nationals, were produced before a local court that sent them to judicial custody. According to the police, the accused got into fight with 34-year-old Kanu Tamboli, a resident of Shyamal Green Society near Waghodia Crossroads late on Tuesday night.“One of the accused, Tampivendse Montohary, was on his way to meet his friends who stay in Shyamal Green Society on Tuesday night. He was asked by the security guard at the gate to enter his name in the register before entering the colony . Montohary got into arguments with the guard and refused to enter his name,” said S Vaghela, taluka police sub-inspector.“Tamboli who was sitting nearby intervened and asked Montohary to enter his name in the register. The accused got into heated arguments with Tamboli too and soon a fight broke out,” Vaghela told TOI. Montohary’s friends Tadfazwa Sumba, Hopwave Zou and Watidaize Zanze, who were staying in the society, too arrived and got into fight with Tamboli, the police said.Montohary picked up a stone and hit it on Tamboli’s head. He suffered injuries and was rushed to a private hospital for treatment. The incident, however, angered the locals who gathered at the spot and demanded that the students, who were staying on rent, should be thrown out of the society.The police said that all the accused had come to the city for studying.
