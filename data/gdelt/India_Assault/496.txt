Granthi named by Justice Jora hits back at retired judge, AAP

JALANDHAR: A day after Justice Jora Singh (retd), who headed one-man commission probing Bargari sacrilege and Behbal Kalan firing incidents, claimed that Burj Jawahar Singh Wala gurdwara granthi and a few others were not interrogated by the Punjab Police, Punjab Ekta Party chief Sukhpal Khaira produced the granthi before the media who claimed that he and his wife were subjected to third degree torture by cops and they had even undergone narcoanalysis tests.Justice Jora, who recently joined AAP, had said on Wednesday in presence of party MLAs that he had found during his probe that cops did not investigate the sacrilege cases properly and did not question the persons they should have.On Thursday, Khaira attacked AAP and Jora Singh asking if they wanted that granthi and other Sikhs should be tortured again by the police when SIT probing the case had already found Sirsa dera followers were responsible.“I was tortured very badly. I was made to lie on ice and my legs were pulled apart, while my wife was given electric shock. We were taken to Gujarat for lie detector test twice and then CBI also took us to Delhi for questioning and we fully cooperated with the investigations. My wife suffered serious health issues due to the electric shocks given by the police and the torture derailed our lives,” said Burj Jawahar Singh Wala granthi Gora Singh.Gurmukh Singh from Bargari village said that he and his kin were also subjected to similar torture by Punjab Police. “We were even taken to private places for torture and even our house was damaged,” he said.Both of them said that their torture in fact started after Jora Singh once pointed out that we were not interrogated. They alleged that then SAD minister Sikandar Singh Maluka would himself call up the police officials and then they would be subjected to more torture.“The SIT top officials investigating the case later apologized to us after dera premis were held but Justice Jora Singh has again started pointing finger towards Sikhs,” they said.They said that around 15 Sikhs from Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village were badly tortured and one even became mentally unstable.A case should be registered not only against police officials but then home minister Sukhbir Badal also as they were tortured at his behest and he falsely attributed the blame for sacrilege on two Amritdhari brothers,” Khaira said.“Justice Jora Singh did not name Badals or Saini and did a shoddy inquiry and badly failed to bring out the truth. He should rather return the remuneration received from the government,” the former leader of opposition said.
