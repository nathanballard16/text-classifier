Under-trial prisoner dies, family alleges custodial torture

Mumbai, Jan 20 (PTI) An under-trial prisoner died

after being found unconscious in his cell in Maharashtra's

Aurangabad district Saturday, the police said.

The family of Yogesh Rathod (29), the deceased,

alleged that he was tortured by police which led to his death.

Rathod, a resident of Bharamba Tanda in Kannad tehsil

of the district, had been arrested a few days ago in a case of

house trespass, a police official said.

He was sent to Harsul prison after a court remanded

him in judicial custody.

He was found unconscious in his cell Saturday evening

and rushed to a government-run hospital where he was declared

dead, the official said.

While his family members alleged that he died due to

police torture, the exact cause of death will be known after

autopsy, he added. PTI DC
