1 held from Nagpur in Kamlesh Tiwari murder

The accused was identified as Sayyad Aseem Ali (29), who runs a hardware business.

Mumbai: The Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) made an arrest on Satur-day from Nagpur in connection with the murder case of Kamlesh Tiwari, a former Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha leader, who was hacked to death in Uttar Pradesh.

The suspect was arrested from Mominpura where he had been hiding following the murder, officials said.

The accused was identified as Sayyad Aseem Ali (29), who was apprehended following information from the Uttar Pradesh police.

The investigators said that Ali runs a hardware business and he had organised a protest against Tiwari earlier in the past and had issued a warning to him via an online video.

Tiwari (45), leader of the lesser-known Hindu Samaj Party (HSP), which was earlier associated with a faction of the Hindu Mahasabha, was killed at his home in Lucknow on Friday. Five persons, including three from Surat were arrested by the UP police earlier in the case.

“The suspects were ‘radicalised’ and appeared to have targeted Tiwari for his inflammatory remarks made in 2015. So far, there is no terror angle associated with this incident,” said O.P. Singh, DGP Uttar Pradesh Police.

The three arrests from Surat were made by the Gujarat ATS and they were identified as Faizan Yunus Bhai, Maulana Mohsin Sheikh and Rashid Ahmed Khursheed Ahmed Pathan.
