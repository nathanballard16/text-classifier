Two police officers were caught on camera physically assaulting and pushing a woman out of the Kumaraswamy Layout Police Station in Bengaluru. One of the officers, an assistant sub-inspector, has been suspended following the incident.

In the video of the incident on January 19, ASI Renukaiah is seen violently pulling a woman away, hitting and forcibly pushing her out of the police station. He is also seen manhandling the woman outside the police station in spite of her asking him not to lay hands on her. Another police officer is seen grabbing and pushing the woman away at the start of the video.

The woman in question, Saraswati, had arrived at the station to resolve a family dispute involving her daughter Rakeshwari when the assault occurred. The assault was caught on video by a person in the station. The video has since been shared widely and has sparked debate on the abuse of power by the police official.

Bengaluru South DCP Annamalai K conducted an enquiry into the incident. ASI Renukaiah has been suspended with immediate effect. It is not immediately known whether the other police officer in the video is being investigated.

The BJP in Karnataka took to Twitter to highlight the incident and accused the officers of resorting to hooliganism. The party, in a tweet, also referenced former Chief Minister Siddaramaiah following the incident in Mysuru in which he misbehaved with a woman party worker.
