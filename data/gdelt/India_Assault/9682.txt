Pune: A 25-year-old man has allegedly stabbed his girlfriend to death suspecting that she was cheating on him. The victim has been identified as 22-year-old Veena Patle.

The incident happened on Tuesday evening when the victim went to meet the accused Kiran Shinde in Pune's Chandannagar area. Before killing Veena, the accused had gone incommunicado since the last few days.

"Shinde and Patle were working in an IT firm as back office support staffs and their friendship turned into a relationship. It has been revealed that since Shinde was not in contact with anyone for the last few days, Patle and their common friend Prakash Gapat came to Chandannagar area on Tuesday night," a PTI report quoted a police official as saying.

Police say Shinde has of late started suspecting that Patle was cheating on him. During the meeting, an argument broke out between Patle and Shinde, who stabbed the victim with a sharp-edged weapon and fled. Patle was declared brought dead at hospital. The accused has been absconding since committing the murder.

In a similar case in February this year, a woman was stabbed to death by her husband, who suspected that she was cheating on him. The incident took place in Indore district of Madhya Pradesh. The woman's son who tried to save his mother also sustained injuries in the attack. The accused stabbed the woman 12 times on her torso and limbs.
