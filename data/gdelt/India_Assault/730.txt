Cows made to walk on fire as a ritual in Karnataka’s harvest festival

Devotees led decked-up cows over burning hay to celebrate the Hindu harvest festival in a ritual, called Kicchu Hayisuvudu, seeking good fortune and protection from harm.

The Makar Sankaranti festival marks the advent of spring and is celebrated by kite-flying and other regional festivities in the month of January.

In the southern city of Bangalore , men decorated the cows with garlands and bells and walked them over hay set ablaze.
