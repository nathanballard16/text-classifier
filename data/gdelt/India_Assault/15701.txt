TV actor Ankit Raaj who plays the role of Adhiraj in Main Bhi Ardhangini was taken to a private hospital in Jaipur after the actor injured himself during the shoot on Tuesday midnight. Ankit and Heena Parmar , who is playing the character of Mohini, were rehearsing for a romantic scene when one of the focus lights fell on Ankit’s leg. The actor told us, “We were so engrossed in the rehearsals that we didn’t pay heed to anything around us.One of the focus lights fell on one of my legs. I was taken to a nearby hospital and got two stitches below the knee. This happened on Tuesday midnight and on Wednesday morning, we had to shoot for a water sequence. However, the doctors advised me to stay away from the water because of the stitches. But since the episode has to go on air on Thursday, I covered my wound with a plastic wrap and shot for the sequence.” The shooting of Main Bhi Ardhangini has been going on in Jaipur for the past many months.Heena Parmar and Ankit Raaj in a scene from the show Main Bhi Ardhangini
