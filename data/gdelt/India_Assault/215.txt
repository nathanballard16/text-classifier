Britain is ‘ignoring torture of Scots Sikh’ Jagtar Singh Johal

A lawyer who fought for justice for the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six has accused the British government of ignoring evidence that a Scottish terrorism suspect has been tortured in India.

Gareth Peirce claims that the British authorities are secretly colluding with India’s counterterrorism agency in the investigation into Jagtar Singh Johal, a Scottish Sikh who is being held in connection with the murder of Hindu nationalists in 2016 and 2017.

Ms Peirce’s previous clients include Gerry Conlon, who spent 15 years in prison after being wrongly convicted of the Guildford pub bombing. She is investigating how photographs of Sikh activists apparently seized by British police ended up in the hands of Indian interrogators.
