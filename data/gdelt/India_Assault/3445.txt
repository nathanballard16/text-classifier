Maharashtra CRPF troopers' widows hail IAF strikes against JeM

The widows of two Maharashtra troopers killed in the February 14 Pulwama suicide attack on Tuesday lauded India's air strikes against the JeM terror camps in Pakistan.

"I am very satisfied by this action. This is a real tribute to the 40 soldiers (troopers) killed in Pulwama. Finally, their souls will rest in peace," said Sushma Sanjay Rajput of Malkapur village.

"I am happy that this action has been taken to avenge the untimely deaths of our soldiers (troopers) in Pulwama last fortnight. The government has finally acted," said Vandana Nitin Rathod of Chorpangra village.

Both the widows told IANS that they felt the Indian action was belated and if had been taken earlier, "the valuable lives of our husbands, and many more like them could have been saved."

Sushma and Vandana also said that this must be followed up by stronger action from the Indian side to teach Pakistan "a lesson once and for all", and uproot all terror activities for permanent peace and security in the sub-continent.
