Delhi: Man strangles mother to death with son's help over property dispute

A man with the help of his son strangled his mother to death over property dispute in Delhi's Jyoti Nagar area. Police have arrested both the father and son for the murder.

The deceased, 70-year-old Maya Devi lived with her family in Jyoti Nagar. She had four sons and a daughter. Maya Devi had some land and the house in her name.

On the night of the murder, Maya Devi's eldest son Rajveer had a fight with her over the property. Later in the night, Rajveer found an opportune moment when his mother was alone and strangled her to death with the help of his son Akash. The two then fled the spot.

Rajveer and his family lived in the upper part of the house. He was also engaged in a civil case with his mother for his share of the property.



Two days ago, Maya Devi had cut off the electricity on Rajveer's floor. This angered him so much that he decided to kill his mother.

Police received information about an elderly person's death and sent the body for post-mortem. On investigating the case, police were shocked to find out that the 70-year-old was killed by her own son and grandson for property.
