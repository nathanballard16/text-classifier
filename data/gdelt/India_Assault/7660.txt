India’s longest serving woman prisoner and life convict in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case Nalini Sriharan has submitted a petition before the Madras High Court against Tamil Nadu Governor Banwarilal Purohit.

In her petition before the Madras High Court, Nalini has stated that the TN governor has delayed countersigning the cabinet resolution to release her and the six others accused in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case.

The TN cabinet passed a resolution last year on September 9, to release all seven life convicts, AG Perarivalan, Murugan aka Sriharan, Nalini Sriharan, P Ravichandran, Shantan, Jayakumar and Robert Payas, under the provisions of Article 161 of the Constitution.

The petition submitted by Nalini’s counsel states that this delay is a "failure of the constitutional machinery" in the state.

Speaking to India Today TV, Nalini’s Counsel Advocate Radhakrishnan cited the Supreme Court’s order in the case Maru Ram Vs Union of India in which a five-member constitution bench stated that the power under the Article 72 and 161 could be exercised by the state and Centre, not by President or Governor.

In April, Nalini approached the Madras High Court seeking permission to make a personal appearance to make an argument for herself as she wanted six months leave to make arrangements for her daughter’s wedding.
