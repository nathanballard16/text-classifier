Rahul Gandhi nowhere close to single good deed of Savarkar: Fadnavis

Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], Dec 14(ANI): Hitting back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for 'My name is not Rahul Savarkar' remark, former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday said the former is nowhere close to even a single good deed of Hindu ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar and his greatness.



"He (Rahul) is nowhere close to even a single good deed of Veer Savarkar and his greatness," Fadnavis tweeted saying that Gandhi scion's statement is "absolutely condemnable!"

Taking a jibe at Rahul, the BJP leader said that one cannot become 'Gandhi' by just keeping his surname as Gandhi.

"Not just this, he should not even do the blunder of considering himself as 'Gandhi'! One cannot become 'Gandhi'by just keeping his surname as Gandhi!," he said.

Hailing Savarkar for sacrificing his life for the nation, Fadnavis said: "Veer Savarkar has sacrificed his entire life for our MatruBhumi. Using such language for him is an insult to all the great patriots and freedom fighters who have sacrificed their lives!"

He further said that Rahul must apologise to the nation for his yet another "irresponsible statement".

Addressing a rally earlier today, Rahul Gandhi said he would not apologize for his "rape in India" remark as his name is not Rahul Savarkar.



"I was asked by the BJP in Parliament yesterday to apologize for the comment. I was asked to apologize for something which is right. My name is not Rahul Savarkar. My name is Rahul Gandhi. I will never apologize for truth," Gandhi said.



Reacting to Gandhi's statement, Savarkar's grandson Ranjit has said that Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray should beat Gandhi publicly for 'insulting' his grandfather.

"I want Uddhav Thackeray beat Rahul Gandhi openly as he said many times that if anyone insults Savarkar, he will beat him publicly," he said. (ANI)
