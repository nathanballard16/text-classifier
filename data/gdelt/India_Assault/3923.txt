Subjected to mental harassment by ISI, says IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan

NEW DELHI: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman went through mental harassment during his captivity in Pakistan but was not subjected to any physical torture, reported news agency ANI quoting official sources."After returning from Pakistan, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman has informed that though he was not physically tortured by the Pakistanis; he went through a lot of mental harassment," sources said.The handing over of pilot Abhinandan Varthaman to India at Attari-Wagah was delayed yesterday as he was made to record a statement on camera by Pakistani authorities before he was allowed to cross the border.Indian officials said the statement was extracted under duress and had undermined Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s “peace gesture” of releasing him.The IAF pilot is currently undergoing a series of medical tests as part of the "cooling down" process which is expected to continue till Sunday. Once the health check up phase is over, debriefing sessions will be arranged for him, officials said.Abhinandan was captured by Pakistani authorities on February 27 after his MiG 21 Bison went down during a dogfight with Pakistani jets. But before his plane was hit, Varthaman shot down an F-16 of Pakistan air force.
