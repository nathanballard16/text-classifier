Ranchi: Days after Tabrez Ansari died in a hospital after he was brutally beaten by a mob in Jharkhand on the suspicion of theft, one of his relatives on Wednesday claimed that the 22-year-old was later given poisonous water.

The Jharkhand police have arrested 11 people, including the main accused, in the case. Two police personnel have been suspended.

Mohammad Masroor, an uncle of Tabrez, alleged: “After Tabrez was thrashed, he was given water mixed with dhatura (a form of a poisonous leaf).”

He further insisted that police should file charge sheet immediately and the accused must be punished.

On Wednesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, while speaking in Parliament, said the lynching of Tabrez Ansari had “pained” him.

"The lynching has pained me. It has saddened others too. But some people in the Rajya Sabha are calling Jharkhand a hub of lynching. Is this fair? Why are they insulting a state?"

Meanwhile, the Congress, Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), and Left parties yesterday staged a sit-in at the Governor House, calling for a CBI probe into the incident.

Tabrez Ansari breathed his last at a hospital on Sunday, days after he was assaulted by a mob at Dhatkidih village in Seraikela district on suspicion of stealing a bike on June 17.

Police alleged that a stolen motorcycle and some other things were found from his possession.

The incident hogged the limelight after a video started doing the rounds, showing Ansari being tied to a tree and being beaten by a mob. He was also forced to continuously chant Jai Shri Ram and Jai Hanuman.

After the assault, he was handed over to police. Tabrez was taken to a hospital after his condition worsened. Tabrez Ansari died on Sunday.
