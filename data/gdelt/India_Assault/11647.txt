Bengaluru woman alleges friend raped her multiple times, fled after knowing she is pregnant

A woman in Bengaluru has alleged she was raped multiple times by a man whom she met on a social networking site. In her police complaint the woman has alleged that she is pregnant and that the man has refused to marry her.

The 23-year-old woman told police that she met a man through social media and soon thereafter they decided to meet in person when they became friends. She however alleged that man raped her multiple times at the paying guest accommodation in Nagawara where he was staying, Bangalore Mirror said in a report.

The woman said when she realised she was pregnant, she informed the man. But he refused to meet her and stopped answering his calls. She told police that the man soon left the city and went to his hometown in Andhra Pradesh. The woman then called his brother and aunt and told them everything. However, they allegedly abused her on phone and cut the call.

Following this, the woman approached the police and filed a complaint.

The report said police have registered a case of "rape and cheating" against the man, who is identified as Shafi, 26, and three of his family members. The newspaper said the woman in her complaint has said, "She met Shafi in December 2018 on a social networking site. They later met in person and became friends. When the woman had a fight with her family members and her teeth were broken, she moved in to Shafi's accommodation."

Quoting a police officer, the report said the woman has alleged that she was raped twice when she visited Shafi at his paying guest accommodation.

The police officer said after getting a call from her parents, the woman later returned to her home. But two months later she realised she was pregnant.

Meanwhile, the police have reportedly registered a case under Sections 376 (rape), 420 (cheating), among others, of the Indian penal Code against the accused and his family members.
