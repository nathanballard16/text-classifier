India accepts Pak’s offer of consular access to Kulbhushan Jadhav

A day after Pakistan offered India consular access to retired Navy officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, government sources said the proposal had been accepted.

Government sources said: “Today, after victory in the ICJ, India will be proceeding for consular access to Jadhav. Indian Charge d’ Affaires, Shri Gaurav Ahluwalia, will be meeting Jadhav. We hope that Pakistan will ensure right atmosphere so that the meeting is free, fair, meaningful and effective in keeping with the letter and spirit of the ICJ orders.”

Pakistan on Sunday that they would provide consular access for Kulbhushan Jadhav on Monday “in line with Vienna Convention on Consular relations, International Court of Justice judgement and the laws of Pakistan”.

Jadhav, a former naval officer who has been sentenced to death by Pakistani court for alleged “espionage and terrorism”.

This is the first time that Jadhav would be given consular access.

After repeated requests to Islamabad, India flagged the matter to the International Court of Justice in the Hague, which was also hearing New Delhi’s appeal for the cancellation of his death sentence.

India maintains that Jadhav is a retired naval officer, who was abducted from Iran, where he was running a business. In one of the earlier hearings, the court asked Pakistan to hold off his execution till it reaches its final verdict in the case.

In July, the ICJ ordered Pakistan to review and reconsider the conviction and sentence of Jadhav and also to grant consular access to India without further delay.

The court agreed with India’s stand that Pakistan had violated the Vienna convention by denying consular access to Jadhav after his conviction in a “farcical” closed trial.

Last month, the Pakistan Foreign Office said Jadhav will be granted consular access the next day. But the meeting did not take place after New Delhi and Islamabad disagreed on the terms.
