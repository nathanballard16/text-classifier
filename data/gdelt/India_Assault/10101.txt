Delhi Police thrash drivers, Ministry of Home Affairs seeks report

The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Monday sought a report from Delhi Commissioner of Police after videos of three Delhi policemen publicly thrashing the driver of a tempo and his son in Mukherjee Nagar area went viral on social media, sources said. A news agency had reported that the policemen thrashed the driver and his son after dragging them out of their vehicle. It is alleged that the policemen thrashed the duo for “no reason”. The police, however, blamed the tempo driver for the incident claiming that he attacked a police officer with a sword and injured another with his tempo. Thereafter, a police officer was also assaulted on the head by the tempo driver with a sword,” the police said in a statement.
