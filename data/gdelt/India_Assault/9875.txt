Residents of Shahdara district, Delhi, India are reeling in shock after a 70-year-old man allegedly went on the rampage in his house and killed his wife.

According to Business Standard, Manak Chand bludgeoned his 38-year-old wife identified only as Lakshmi with a brick.

Shahdara Deputy Commissioner of Police Meghna Yadav said that the man killed his second wife before committing suicide by hanging himself.

"We received a police control room call on Thursday morning from the grandson of the deceased Chand who informed us about the incident. Prima facie no role of an outsider is found yet while there is no evidence of anyone breaking into the house or ransacking it," said Yadav.

His body was found by his grandson dangling from a ceiling fan at their home while the brick he allegedly used to commit the murder was found at the scene.

Chand and Lakshmi were reportedly not getting along. He had seven children.
