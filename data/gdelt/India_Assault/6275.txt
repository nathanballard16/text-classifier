: Pakistan's Premieron Wednesday has said that he believes there may be a better chance of peace talks with India and settle the Kashmir issue if Prime Minister's party Bharatiya Janata Party wins the general elections.India will go to elections in seven phases beginning from Thursday."Perhaps if the....wins, some kind of settlement in Kashmir could be reached," Khan told a small group of foreign journalists in an interview.Calling Kashmir the central issue between the two countries, he said other parties would be afraid of right-wing backlash in case of settlement on the Kashmir issue.India maintains that the entire state ofis an integral part of the country and Pakistan is in illegal occupation of a part of the state's territory.Tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.Responding to Imran Khan's statement, National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah said that Narendra Modi will have to answer for Imran's endorsement for his second term as Prime Minister."Modi will have to answer that because it was Modi only who, till now, was saying that Pakistan and militants want the BJP to lose, but it has become clear today that it is the Pakistan which wants Modi to win again," Abdullah told reporters."So much for Modi Sahib telling the country only Pakistan and its sympathisers want BJP to lose. Imran Khan has just endorsed him for a 2nd term," he said."Just imagine what all the 'Chowkidar' handles would be doing to @RahulGandhi and theright now if Imran Khan had endorsedas PM in these elections? Who is the 'tukde tukde' gang now?" the NC vice-president said in another tweet.The Congress and other opposition parties also said that a vote for Prime Minister Narendra Modi is a vote for Pakistan as they seized on Imran Khan's remarks.The party also said that Khan's remarks reflect that Pakistan has "officially allied" with Modi.
