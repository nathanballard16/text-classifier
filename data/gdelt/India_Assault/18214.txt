Bhandup rape-murder accused may have known victim

Probe finds he lived in the same area before moving to Wadala

The Bhandup police are probing whether the rape-murder accused, arrested on Sunday, had his eye on the victim long before he committed the alleged crime.

The accused, a resident of Wadala, was arrested on Sunday for allegedly kidnapping a 10-year-old girl from near her Bhandup residence on November 5 and raping and murdering her in Vidyavihar, where her body was found on November 9.

According to the Bhandup police, the investigating team, while probing why the accused came all the way from Wadala to Bhandup to commit the crime, has found that he used to stay in the same area earlier.

“We have been able to ascertain that the accused, who now works at a small restaurant in Ghatkopar, had a similar job in Bhandup and lived in the area. We suspect it was during this time that he first saw the victim, and chose her as a target,” an officer with the Bhandup police said.

The police is now trying to retrace his steps through cellular location mapping and CCTV footage in order to get a better sense of the exact sequence of events on November 5.

“We have confirmed that the victim was taken to the railway tracks some 150 meters away from Vidyavihar railway station, where the accused forced himself on her and then strangled her to death. The selection of the spot also implies prior knowledge of the fact that it is secluded at night, which is another aspect that we are verifying,” the officer said.

Meanwhile, the police have sought information from all police stations in Mumbai, and from the accused’s native place in Uttar Pradesh, to check whether he has any criminal record.

The accused was arrested from his Wadala residence on Sunday night and charged with rape and murder under the Indian Penal Code along with relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
