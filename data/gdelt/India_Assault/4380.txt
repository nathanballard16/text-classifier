HC to hear #MeToo producer’s plea against censor board on Friday

Photo: ANINew Delhi: The Delhi High Court will hear on Friday the plea of the producer of the Bollywood movie “#MeToo” challenging the censor board order asking him to change the movie name. Justice Vibhu Bakhru will hear the plea. The plea was filed by producer Sajid Iqbal Qureshi who has sought the setting aside of the November 12, 2018 order of the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC). The CBFC, in its order, had directed modification of the title of the movie “#Me Too” and also ordered that the public exhibition of the film be restricted to adults. The advocate said that the filmmaker’s intent was to convey what goes on in the minds of men, who abduct a woman with the aim of raping her.
