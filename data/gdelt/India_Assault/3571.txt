International efforts to against the illegal call centre network in India between September 2018 and January 2019 led to the takedowns and arrests of people now facing prosecution there, the RCMP said.

“The scam is being committed by organized crime groups operating out of multiple locations throughout India,” police said.

In 2018 alone these scams cost Canadians a reported $6 million and police believe the true dollar figure is much higher with many victims not reporting their losses.

To shut down the call centres, the RCMP said that it and its international partner rely heavily on tips from the public both in Canada and abroad. Tips can help Indian police and an RCMP liaison officer assess the credibility of information they’re receiving and lead to call centres being shut down.
