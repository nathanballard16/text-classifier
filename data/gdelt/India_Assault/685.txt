JAMMU: A BSF officer was killed in Samba sector in the Jammu region on Tuesday in yet another sniper attack from across the border as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire both at the Line of Control and the International Border.The officer, Vinay Prasad, was attacked at 10.50 am when his patrol was carrying out border domination exercise near the IB in Samba sector, a BSF spokesperson said. “Pakistani snipers opened fire at them, leading to grievous injuries to the officer,” the spokesperson said. “Prasad was rushed to a military hospital in Satwari, Jammu, for specialised treatment where he died of injuries,” the spokesperson added.There have been over a dozen sniper attacks by the Pakistan army from across the IB in 2018, official sources said. The attacks from across the LoC have been even more, officers said. An Army officer was killed and another one injured critically in a sniper attack from across the LoC in Kashmir’s Kupwara district on December 21. Another soldier was killed in a similar attack in Sunderbani sector on November 11.In fresh ceasefire violation, a BSF personnel and an Army jawan were injured in unprovoked firing by Pakistani troops in Sunderbani sector of Rajouri district on Tuesday, official sources said.“One of them has been shifted to the military hospital in Akhnoor and the other one evacuated to military hospital in Satwari, Jammu,” sources said.An Army spokesperson told newspersons in Jammu: “Pak continues its nefarious activities along the LoC. At about 1700 hours, it initiated unprovoked firing by small arms as also shelling by heavy caliber weapons in Sunderbani & neighbouring sectors of Jammu region. Our troops are retaliating strongly and effectively,” he said.Sources said Pak Rangers and Pak army using snipers to target Indian jawans and officers has become a regular affair since 2017. The snipers have been provided with sophisticated rifles which have a capacity to shoot a target at more than 1 km range.The Pakistani snipers also take advantage of high altitude in some regions, making it difficult for Indian jawans to duck or save themselves while patrolling, the sources added.
