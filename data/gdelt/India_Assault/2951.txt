India vice-captain Harmanpreet Kaur has been ruled out of the upcoming ODI series against England, to be played in Mumbai from February 22, due to an ankle injury. Harmanpreet was not involved in the training session with the team and will head to NCA in Bangalore for rehabilitation.

Himachal Pradesh's 20-year-old batter Harleen Deol has been called up as a replacement for Harmanpreet.

The T20I series, from March 4, will likely see vice-captain Smriti Mandhana step up to take on the leadership role if Harmanpreet doesn't recover on time for it. Mandhana led in the last game she played - for Board Presidents XI against England Women in the warm-up fixture, which the visitors won by two wickets.
