Mumbai: Teen's autopsy report finds no signs of gang rape

The post mortem report of the 19-year-old from Aurangabad pins the cause of her death as complications arising from AIDS, and finds no indication of rape or sexual assault. The Begumpura police conducted the autopsy on Saturday evening, in the presence of three city-based doctors in Ghati Hospital. With seven days having lapsed between the alleged rape and medical examination, the police were not sure forensic evidence would be reliable. Sources say police suspected that paths of treatment had failed because her immune system was already compromised by the HIV infection. Sources in Aurangabad say the parents are her adoptive parents, and the brother was not a blood relative.
