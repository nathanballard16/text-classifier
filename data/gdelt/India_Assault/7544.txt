'2012 Gang-rape was blown out of proportion by media', Former Delhi CM Sheila Dikshit

Dikshit is contesting Lok Sabha Elections 2019 from the North East Delhi.

New Delhi: In a conversation with Mirror Now, former Chief Minister of the national capital, Sheila Dikshit mentioned that the December 2012 gangrape case was "blown out of proportion" by the media.

Senior Congress party leader, Sheila Dikshit has been the longest serving Chief Minister of the national capital from 1998-2013. In 2012 when the horrific Nirbhaya Gang-rape took place, the United Progress Alliance led by the Congress party was in power at the Centre and in the state.

In the interview, while talking about women safety and law and order situation in the capital, Dikshit said, "If there is rape, sometimes media ignore rape and put a small column in a newspaper... little children are being raped and one was put into a political scandal which we suffered." She added, that there needs to be a uniformity in media coverage.

When asked about highest per capital crime rate against women, CCTV installations and ensuring proper street lighting, Dikshit mentioned that Delhi police are responsible for this and the department was under the Central government in her tenure.

She further claimed that the Delhi government has no role to ensure women safety in the national capital, especially where the police is concerned. Upon asking about solutions to the issue of women safety, Dikshit replied, I have no solution which will be under my purview. Solutions are with the government of India, the parliament of India and she would raise her voice in parliament if she comes into power.

Dikshit is contesting Lok Sabha Elections 2019 from the North East Delhi. All seven seats in Delhi will vote on May 12.
