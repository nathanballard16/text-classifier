Jammu And Kashmir: Pakistan Violates Ceasefire Along LoC In Poonch

On Sunday, the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement said that the Pakistani Army has resorted to more than 2,050 unprovoked ceasefire violations this year in which 21 Indians have been killed. MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that India have highlighted the concerns at unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistan forces, including in support of cross border terrorist infiltration, and targeting of Indian civilians and border posts by them. "This year they have resorted to more than 2,050 unprovoked ceasefire violations in which 21 Indians died," he said.

Pakistan violated ceasefire in Balakote, Mendhar sector in District Poonch on Monday. The Pakistani Army resorted to mortar shelling on forward posts and villages along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district, officials said. A few Army personnel, part of an ambush party, were injured when two mortar shells exploded near them during the shelling on Sunday night, the officials said. A defence spokesperson was quoted as saying, "Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by firing of small arms and intense shelling with mortars in Balakote area of Mendhar sector around 2230 hours on Sunday. Indian army retaliated befittingly." Officials said an army column was on ambush duty near the LoC when two mortar shells exploded near them, causing injuries to a "few personnel". "The injured were immediately evacuated to military hospital and their condition is stated to be stable," they said.
