Unnao Rape Accused's Sister Seeks Probe by Top Indian Agency, Alleging Conspiracy

The sister of the man accused of burning a woman he'd been accused of raping alive Thursday in the Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh, India has demanded that the country’s top investigative agency should probe the case.

The victim, who reportedly walked nearly a kilometre in burnt state to seek help, had shared in her statement that she was beaten up by the five men, who then knifed her before setting her ablaze.

The sister, who did not wish to be named, alleged it was a political conspiracy and that her family was being targeted because it’s a part of the village’s local governing body.
