Jamia Violence case: Delhi HC to form committee for inquiry after lawyers chant 'shame shame' post court order

A bunch of lawyers in Delhi High Court urged the Chief Justice to take suo motu cognizance under the contempt of court act against those attorneys who raised 'shame shame' slogans in the court on Jamia matter.

The Chief Justice said that the court will refer the matter to a committee that will take an appropriate decision on the matter.

The Delhi High Court on Thursday refused to grant interim protection from arrest to Jamia Millia Islamia students in the case of alleged violence near the university last Sunday.

The court adjourned the matter for further hearing on February 4.

After the request for an earlier date was denied, the lawyers raised 'shame shame' slogans in court.

On Sunday, nearly 100 students, many of them serious with one losing an eye, were injured when the police stormed the campus. The police used tear gas on students and even barged into a library. Students claim they were beaten up by the cops inside the library.
