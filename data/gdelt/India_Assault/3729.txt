In a ceasefire violation by Pakistani troops along the LoC in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, one civilian was injured on Friday, officials said.

In Kamalkote area of Uri, Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing towards Indian posts and villages.

The intermittent firing continued through out the night. One civilian has been injured in the firing. Indian Army has responded to the Pakistani firing in adequate measure, the officials said, reported PTI.

As tensions between India and Pakistan rose, the ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops comes following the February 14 terror attack in the state's Pulwama district in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed.

For the attack, Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group claimed responsibility.
