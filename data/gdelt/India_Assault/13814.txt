Tamil Nadu Police rescues 7-months pregnant minor from prostitution

Chennai: Tamil Nadu Police have arrested a 24-year-old woman for forcing two minor girls into prostitution in North Chennai. According to sources, while police rescued the minors, one among them was found to be seven months pregnant. She was aged 17.

The accused woman has been identified as Indu. She confessed to police that she befriended the girl in 2017 when she was 15 years old. Her father abducted the victim because her mother passed away. Indu took advantage of this situation and offered a job to the girl.

Trusting Indu, the girl went to the former's home. Later the girl was forced to get into prostitution. Meanwhile, another case was filed in the same police station through which information about this prostitution case surfaced. A chain snatcher was arrested and during questioning, he issued a statement to the police that he allegedly married a minor and was sent to Indu's house. After some days that minor was also forced to get into prosecution by Indu.

Police said to media that Indu accommodated many women in her house and later sent them to hotels and other houses to meet clients. Many women have reportedly escaped from Indu's house also. Meanwhile, the police are investigating to find the suspects who raped the minors.

In a similar incident, on July 20, Tamil Nadu Police have arrested eight persons for sexually assaulting two minor girls in Villupuram, Tamil Nadu. The siblings, aged seven and nine were allegedly raped over a period of five months.

The incident came to light when the victims were taken to hospital for a medical check-up after they fell sick. When the doctor noticed wounds and bite marks on the body of the children, he alerted their parents.
