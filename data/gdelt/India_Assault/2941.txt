Amritsar, February 20

Members of a local club on Wednesday lodged their protest against Pakistan for its involvement in terror attacks by making the neighouring country’s Lahore-Delhi bus drive over Pak national flag.

Member of ‘Idiot Club’ prepared a big replica of Pakistani flag and placed it on the GT Road near Rayya from where Pakistan’s Lahore-Delhi ‘dosti’ bus passes to reach the Integrated Check Post, Attari.

The driver was made to run the bus over the flag as he could not take the chance of halting the bus.

President of the club Rajinder Rikhi said it was their way of lodging a protest against Pakistan’s nefarious designs as that country is behind the Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of 44 soldiers.

“We laid down Pakistan flag on the main road at a time when the Pakistani bus enroute to Lahore was to arrive from Delhi. We compelled the driver to run over the flag. We were successful in our programme without any resistance,” he said.

Though, the DSP, SHO and his team reached the spot, but they didn’t intervene.

Others present on the occasion included Jagtar Singh Billa, Sumit Kalia, DK Reddy, Gurpreet Monu, Chandan Kumar, Kala and Navroop Salwan.
