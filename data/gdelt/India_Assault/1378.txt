Hyderabad: 22 YO rape convict gets 10 & 7 years jail term for raping minors

Hyderabad: A 22-year-old rape convict was sentenced to 10 years and seven-years of jail term respectively in two different sexual assault cases against minors by the First Additional Metropolitan Sessions Judge in the city on Thursday.

The two cases date back to August 23, 2016, where the convict had sexually assaulted a five-year-old boy and a 13-year-old girl. The jail sentences will now run concurrently, TOI reports.

According to additional public prosecutor K Pratap Reddy, on August 23, 2016, the convict had first sexually assaulted a 13-year-old girl and within a few hours, he sexually assaulted a five-year-old boy at Kanchanbagh.

The rape convict who was a pan shop owner reportedly dragged the 13-year-old victim an isolated plot and raped her when she came to his shop to buy a pan for her father.

Shortly after the first crime, the convict went on to assault another victim by luring the five-year-old into the bushes by offering him chocolates.

He was however arrested on August 27, 2016. The accused was convicted under relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and IPC.

“In his defence, the accused claimed that he was suffering with mental illness since 2012 but he did not produce any documents to prove that he was mentally unwell at the time of the offence. As a result, the court opined that the claims of the accused do not have any proof for substantiation. The victims identified the accused and the DNA analysis also proved that the offence was committed by the accused,” Reddy added.
