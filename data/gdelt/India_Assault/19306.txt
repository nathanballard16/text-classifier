BAREILLY: A six-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 14-year-old boy in Gola village of Lakhimpur Kheri district on Saturday. After returning from school, the girl went out to play with her friends when the accused, who is a Class VIII student, offered her chocolates and convinced her to visit his house to play.

The accused then took her to the roof of his house and allegedly sexually assaulted her. The boy has been detained and will be taken to a juvenile court.

Divulging details of the case, SHO Gola police station DP Tiwari said, “The accused is known to the girl and her family. The parents had never thought that the boy whom they knew for several years could commit such a crime. We have booked the accused under IPC sections 376 (Rape) and POCSO Act. The girl was sent for medical examination and the report has confirmed that she was sexually assaulted by the accused. Doctor also confirmed that her condition was stable. Since the accused is a minor, he will be sent to juvenile home.”

A police official, on the condition of anonymity, told TOI, “The accused had a habit of checking certain pornographic content on his phone and he indulged into this habit through his friend. He committed the crime possibly because of excessive anxiety. Such videos are easily available and young men often fall prey to these contents.”

Earlier, a four-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a 32-year-old neighbour – a father of three little children - in Hyderabad area of Lakhimpur Kheri district on November 17. The accused on that occasion was under the influence of alcohol and also set the girl’s house on fire after her parents made a police complaint. He was arrested and sent to district jail on November 18.
