Pakistan Reportedly Foils Attempt by US Military Aircraft to Enter its Airspace

Pakistan's Civil Aviation Authority reportedly thwarted an attempt by a US military plane to enter its airspace on Wednesday.

The authority claimed that the US jet had tried to enter into Pakistani airspace from the Karachi region without having the relevant clearances and codes.

According to reports, the US plane was coming from Muscat and Pakistan’s civil aviation authority claimed the air traffic controller in the area immediately sent out a warning, so the aircraft was forced to head back.
