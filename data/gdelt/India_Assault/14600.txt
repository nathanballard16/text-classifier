Naamkarann actress Nalini Negi has been in the news and not for the right reasons. The actress was allegedly beaten up by her roommate and her mother for asking them to vacate the house. In retaliation, the two allegedly beat her up and tried to harm her face, too. The actress has now filed a complaint at the Oshiwara Police Station against the two under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. According to the actress, her roommate was supposed to move out a while back and Nalini let her stay for a few more weeks since she was not able to find accommodation for herself but the roommate moved in with her mother instead. Since Nalini was expecting her folks over, she asked them to move out as soon as possible, a conversation that took a rather ugly turn.

ANI tweeted saying, “Actor Nalini Negi filed an FIR against her roommate, Sunita Rana and her mother for allegedly assaulting her. Case registered under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Oshiwara Police Station.”
