Unnao case: Deposition of survivor underway

NEW DELHI: Sacked BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar , prime accused in the Unnao rape case , was on Wednesday brought to the AIIMS in connection to the survivor's deposition at a temporary court here.Special Judge Dharmesh Sharma arrived at the temporary court for recording the statement of the survivor. He had on Saturday ordered the AIIMS management to place a stand with curtains in the designated space for the proceedings.Anyone apart from the parties and lawyers associated with the case were not allowed to enter the floor where the proceedings took place.Sharma's court was permitted by Delhi high court to carry out the deposition of the survivor at the AIIMS Trauma Center, where she is currently being treated for critical injuries she suffered in a road accident in UP's Rae Bareli earlier this year.Judge Sharma in his letter to Delhi HC had said, “Bringing the survivor to the courtroom on a stretcher or trolley might entail grave risk to her identity, privacy, and security.” The court, which is currently recording the statement of the survivor’s uncle, also said that summoning survivor to court might expose her to some medical complications as she could be brought only on a stretcher or a trolley. “And it is but expedient that while under examination there should be available timely medical aid in case of any kind of emergency or otherwise,” he pointed out.Judge's directions on Saturday sought to keep the accused privy to the proceedings, but, at the same time, disallowed them to come face-to-face with the survivor. "The recording of testimony of the survivor shall commence on Wednesday (September 11) from 10.15am onwards and shall continue on a day-to-day basis till such time her testimony is concluded," Sharma had said.All lawyers party to the case have been directed to reach the venue - first floor, seminar hall, AIIMS Trauma Center - at 10am on Wednesday. The proceedings, according to court order, will be held "in camera" and no public person will be allowed to enter the seminar hall without permission. There is also clear direction barring any audio or video recording of the deposition.
