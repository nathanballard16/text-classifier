Existing investorIndia (Naukri.com) also participated in the pre-series A round by investing Rs 4 crore.The current fund will be deployed for aggressive growth in the footwear segment. Soon the startup will also enter into B2B fashion and lifestyle space. As per the startup, last month, ShoeKonnect crossed Rs 100 crore in annualized GMV and is currently growing at a 25% average growth rate month-on-month basis.“We have successfully executed the solution in the footwear category, now endeavoring to be the market leader in the fashion and lifestyle space, an $80 billion Indian market opportunity with 50 lakh registered fashion retailers in India” said Siddharth Vij, co-founder, ShoeKonnect.According to the startup, its larger vision is to build a global ecosystem of trust for businesses to trade in a similar space.Explaining to ET, WaterBridge Ventures said it has been closely following the $80 billion B2B fashion and lifestyle space for a while and believe that it has several characteristics that can be economically and efficiently served by a technology driven solution.As per WaterBridge Ventures there are four major characteristics, first, B2B fashion & lifestyle space is very fragmented space on both the seller and buyer end. Second, there are a wide variety of styles, sizes and categories. Third, tastes differ by region and often within a region as well. Finally, the current buying/selling process is inefficient for both sides and ties up working capital at both ends. There is significant margin in the supply chain between seller and retailer that the potential to develop a profitable business model exists.“Putting all these points together, the only way to serve this market efficiently is to use technology to enable product discovery, match sellers and buyers and enable efficient logistics” said Sarbvir Singh, Managing Partner, WaterBridge Ventures.“They have executed successfully in one vertical, they will soon be replicating the business model in other verticals of the fashion industry like apparel and accessories” said Kitty Agarwal, AVP -Corporate Development, Info Edge (India).Cofounded in 2015 by Siddharth Vij, Chaitanya Rathi, Shubham Agrawal and Siddharth Rastogi, it raised its first funding of Rs 95 lakh within a year of operation from Indian Angel Network ( IAN ). Later Info Edge India came as major investor. With this funding round, ShoeKonnect has raised Rs 24 crore in total.
