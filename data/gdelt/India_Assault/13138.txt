Lucknow: The District Magistrate of Unnao has issued an order to cancel the license of all the arms and weapons issued to the expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, an accused in Unnao rape and accident case.

Sengar, the BJP MLA from Uttar Pradesh who was earlier expelled from the saffron party amid the 2-year-long Unnao gang-rape case.

The four-time UP Assembly legislator, who has been in jail since April 2018, is also accused of plotting a fatal accident last week which resulted in the death of two relatives of the Unnao rape victim and severely injuring her and her lawyer.

UP government earlier handed over the investigation of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and Sengar was arrested on 13 April 2017.

“The cancellation process of his arms licence is strictly a judicial matter, not administrative. A decision on that can be taken only after the court hears both the parties,” District Magistrate Divendra Kumar Pandey said, according to news agency PTI.

The Unnao teenager had accused Sengar of raping her in 2017 at his residence and he was subsequently arrested after a case was registered following the allegations. The matter triggered a massive controversy and caught everyone's eyeballs after the rape survivor’s father died in police custody the very next day after she attempted to commit suicide by immolating herself in front of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s official residence on 8 April 2018. Later on, videos emerged showing Kuldeep and his brother Atul beating her father brutally.

The Bharatiya Janata Party on Thursday confirmed that Sengar has been expelled from the party.
