Shukla’s mother-in-law was also present in the two-room house in Mehrauli during the murders. When Shukla did not open the door of his room on Saturday morning, she informed their neighbours, who broke it open and found him sitting next to the bodies, the officer added.

The police were informed, following which they reached the crime scene. They recovered a written note in which Shukla had confessed to the killing of his wife and children. However, he did not mention any reason for it, the police said, adding that Shukla is suspected to be suffering from depression.
