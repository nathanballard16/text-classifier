Five arrested for rape

Five persons have been arrested for allegedly raping a widow in Manesar here this past week.

The 45-year-old woman, a resident of Delhi, had come to Gurugram on December 29 afternoon to settle financial issues with a private firm in Manesar, where her husband worked as a contractor, when the incident took place.

She took an autorickshaw at Nakhrola village to reach the company at Industrial Model Township in Manesar, but the auto driver, identified as Ankit, took her to a room in Bhangrola village. The room belonged to another auto driver Deepak, who was also in the auto with Ankit. A third man was allegedly waiting for them at the room. While Ankit and Deepak took turns to rape her, the third man, Mahipal, allegedly molested her, the police said.

Ankit and Deepak then took the woman to Rampura village in an autorickshaw where two more men, both auto drivers, raped her, said the police. She was later dumped at a dhaba near Rampura flyover at night. A passer-by spotted her and took her to a police station. The case was registered at Manesar’s women police station on December 30.

Two of the accused were arrested on Monday morning and the rest late at night.
