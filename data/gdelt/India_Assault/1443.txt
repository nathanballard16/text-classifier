Delhi: 20th Bharat Rang Mahotsav serves a slice of life

The youth forum at the 20th Bharat Rang Mahotsav presented the plight of male rape survivors in a play titled "Mr" on the second day of the international theatre festival being held at the National School of Drama. Another played titled "Trash", by DramaNomics — theatre society of the College of Vocational Studies — protested against the effects of plastic pollution. Staged by Navrang — theatre society of the Institute of Home Economics — the play portrayed unspoken shame, disgust, complex and reluctance on part of the victims. Directed by Urmil Kumar Thapaliyal, Harishchannar Ki Ladia, was a Hindi play with two parallel stories. It also brought out a separate aspect of the different circumstances that can lead to such a crime.
