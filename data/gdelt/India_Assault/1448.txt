Hisar, February 2

Thirty-five persons belonging to the Jat community were today sentenced to three years in jail for attacking a person of the Scheduled Caste and a few others at Petwar village of Hisar in 2008.

As per the complainant, Jai Singh, the accused had attacked Surat Singh on January 8, 2008, injuring him and a few others besides ransacking his house. A total of 52 persons were booked in the case.

Hisar Deputy District Attorney Rajiv Sardana said some village youth had been on a hunger strike in the village protesting against Surat and others, who, they alleged, had constructed houses on the land meant for a school.

Though a panchayat was held in the village to resolve the issue, the meeting remained inconclusive. Thereafter, the accused attacked the victims and hurled stones at the police and damaged their vehicle.

Sardana said of the 52 accused, 14 were still absconding and declared proclaimed offenders, while one was facing trial in a juvenile court. As one of the accused had died during trial, remaining 35 persons were held guilty and sentenced to three years in jail. He said the court had also slapped a fine of Rs5,000 each on those convicted.
