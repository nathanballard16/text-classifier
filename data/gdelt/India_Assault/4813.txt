Probe Robert Vadra, but also investigate PM Modi: Rahul Gandhi

Gandhi, who asked the students to challenge him and "make him uncomfortable", also questioned whether the prime minister could stand in a large audience and answer people's questions.

CHENNAI: Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday interacted with students of Stella Maris College for Women in Chennai. Wearing a jeans and T-shirt, Gandhi faced a range of questions from the students about the Congress-led UPA's plans for economic growth, bringing peace in Jammu and Kashmir, on charges against his brother-in-law Robert Vadra, views about the Modi government and the reason for hugging Modi in Parliament. Gandhi, who asked students to refer to him as Rahul, said the law must apply to everybody and not be applied selectively. He said this in response to a question on his brother-in-law Robert Vadra, who is being probed in connection with a money laundering case related to purchase of assets abroad and a land case in Rajasthan's Bikaner district. "Law should apply to everybody equally. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has his name in government documents which say that he is directly responsible for negotiating parallelly with Dassault on Rafale deal. Investigate everybody," he said. "I will be the first person to say it... Investigate Robert Vadra but also investigate Prime Minister Narendra Modi."
