QChennai: Water Tankers to Go on Strike, Activist Mugilan Arrested

Even while Chennai is waiting to receive its 10 MLD/day water from Jolarpettai via train from 7 July, the Tamil Nadu Private Water Tanker Lorry Owners’ Association has announced an indefinite strike beginning 8 July.

The announcement came soon after close to 40 water tankers were reportedly seized at Parivakkam village in Tiruvallur district where villagers alleged that they are plundering their groundwater.
