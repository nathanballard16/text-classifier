Accused in TMC leader's killing nabbed in Nagpur

One of the prime accused in Trinamool Congress (TMC) leader Dilip Ram murder case was nabbed on Wednesday from Nagpur in Maharashtra, nearly four months after the incident which occurred in Hooghly district of West Bengal, police said.

The accused Mohammed Akbar Mohammed Israil (33), who has been on the run since Ram was shot dead on railway tracks at Bandel station on June 29, came to Nagpur last week, an official said, adding that he was hiding at the residence of his relative in Mominpura area.

Israil is a resident of Dingalhat area in Boropara in West Bengal.

Acting on a tip-off given by West Bengal police, a team from Tehsil police station picked Israil from Mominpura.

According to police, Israil was hired by prime accused Shakuntala Yadav alias Samudri Yadav to kill Ram.

Israil had arranged for the shooters to commit the crime.

He will be handed over to the West Bengal police on Thursday, the official said.
