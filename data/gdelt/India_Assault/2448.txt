Pulwama: Attack Pak even if LS poll gets delayed, says Guj

A senior Gujarat minister Saturday said a retaliatory strike against Pakistan for the Pulwama attack is a must even if it is at the cost of delaying the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.

Speaking at a public gathering in Surat, Gujarat forest, tribal development and tourism minister Ganpatsinh Vasava advocated a tit-for-tat response and said a "condolence meet" should also be arranged in Pakistan before the Lok Sabha polls.

In one of the deadliest terror strikes in Jammu and Kashmir, a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle laden with explosives into a CRPF bus killing 40 jawans in Pulwama on Thursday.

Vasava, speaking in Gujarati, said, "Atyare chunav roki do, ane ne Pakistan ne thoki do (put on hold the Lok Sabha polls and attack Pakistan)".

He said it was fine if the general polls are delayed by two months but Pakistan must be taught a lesson.

"All 125 crore Indians want our armed forces to do something like this (retaliatory hit on Pakistan). We will certainly take revenge for killing our soldiers. We have full faith in our jawans. And CRPF has said it will decide on place and time to take revenge," said Vasava.
