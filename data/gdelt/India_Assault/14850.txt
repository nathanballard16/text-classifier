New Delhi: In a big development, Unnao rape survivor on Monday gave her statement to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in connection with the accident which left her critically injured. The recent development has come after doctors in AIIMS, where she is currently undergoing treatment, declared her fit to give a statement to the CBI.

According to reports, the CBI is said to be close to concluding the investigation in the accident case of the Unnao rape victim. Top CBI sources have said that the investigative agency will present its final status report in the case before the Supreme Court in the coming weeks.

The rape survivor met with a deadly accident on July 28 when the car, in which she was travelling in along with her two aunts and her lawyer, collided with a truck while she was on her way from Unnao to Rae Bareli. The victim and her lawyer sustained critical injuries while two of her aunts died in the accident.

Initially, the injured were admitted to a Lucknow hospital but after a Supreme Court order, they were airlifted to New Delhi for better treatment. Also, the accident case was handed over to the CBI which has booked 10 people for murder, including BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the prime accused in the Unnao rape case. Sengar, however, has denied his involvement in the conspiracy behind the accident.

Sengar, who has been expelled by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the wake of the Unnao rape case and accusations against him, has been charged under IPC Sections 120 b (criminal conspiracy), 363 (kidnapping), 366 (kidnapping or inducing a woman to compel for marriage), 376 (rape) and sections 3 and 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
