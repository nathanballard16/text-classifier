Panaji: While the recent encounter killing of four accused in Telangana rape and murder case has sparked a debate with some hailing the police action while others opposing it, a Goa minister has suggested that those who commit such crimes should be hanged at a public stadium.

Michael Lobo, Goa Port minister on Saturday demanded that rape and murder case convicts should be hanged to send out a strong message to the people committing such heinous and rarest of rare crimes.

"Such crime does not have place in our society or even in jail. Amendment needs to be done in Indian Penal Code by Parliament to see that such type of crimes are tried by a fast track court within a period of four months," Lobo said while speaking to media persons on the controversial encounter killing of four rape and murder accused in Telangana.

"Maximum time given (for trial) should be five months. Public hanging, which was in existence before British rule in some places in India or internationally, should come in place for rape with murder. That particular accused, once found guilty should be hanged in a stadium..." he added, IANS reported.

The Goa BJP minister further opined that the public hangings would work as a strong deterrent for the "type of men" who think that law cannot touch them.

The minister also appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to bring necessary amendments to the law, which facilitates public hanging for rape and murders.

"The Prime Minister and Home Minister Amit bhai Shah, who is very, very strong, should take cognisance and propose an amendment to the law and see that the particular amendment goes through and capital punishment should be made compulsory for rape and that also publicly," Lobo said.
