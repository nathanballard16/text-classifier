The public is being urged to report these directly to the Canadian Anti-Fraud Centre (www.antifraudcentre.ca or 1-888-495-8501) if you have fallen victim or have information in relation to those responsible.

According to their news release the RCMP and the CAFC have been working with international law enforcement partners to disrupt and dismantle the illegal call centre network in India, which is responsible for perpetrating the CRA tax scam and other mass marketing related scams. According to police, the scam is being committed by organized crime groups operating from several locations in India.

From Sept. 2018 to Jan. 2019, approximately 40 call centres were taken down and arrests made of over 60 individuals, who are now facing prosecution in India.

To avoid falling victim to these scams the RCMP offers these tips:

The CRA will not call and threaten you to pay a tax debt;

The CRA will not call, leave a voice message, text or email you advising of a warrant of arrest for a tax debt;

The CRA will not request you pay a tax debt through crypto currencies such as Bitcoin, gift cards, or money transfers;

The CRA will not have you deported if you do not pay an owed tax debt.
