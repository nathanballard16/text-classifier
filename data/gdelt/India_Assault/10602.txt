Abhimanyu's uncle who commented below the Facebook post by electricity minister M.M. Mani on a recent movie Nan Petta Makan which portrays the life of Abhimanyu, said that the all culprits behind the murder were not arrested and some have reportedly left the country.

KOCHI: Nearly a year after the murder of Abhimanyu, SFI leader and student of Maharajas College Ernakulam, his family came out publicly against the the probe team alleging that there are lapses in the investigation and all the accused in the case were not yet arrested.

Abhimanyu's uncle who commented below the Facebook post by electricity minister M.M. Mani on a recent movie Nan Petta Makan which portrays the life of Abhimanyu, said that the all culprits behind the murder were not arrested and some have reportedly left the country.

“It’s going to be a year after he (Abhimanyu) has gone and the culprits behind the murder are still absconding. There are also reports that they have left the country. We don’t know the status of the investigation. The officials of the investigation team are not responding to our calls. We expect a response from you,” the comment read.

The probe team had earlier submitted the charge sheet at the court against 16 accused who directly took part in the crime and those who were at the crime scene. According to the investigation team, it was Sahal (21) who unlea-shed an attack on the SFI workers and stabbed Abhimanyu on his chest which led to his death. Sahal is still at large.

Abhimanyu, M, a second-year B.Sc Chemistry student of Maharaja’s college was stabbed to death by a 16-member gang on July 2. The charge sheet says the members of the gang were activists of Campus Front of India (CFI), Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) and Popular Front of India (PFI) who conspired the attack at the college.
