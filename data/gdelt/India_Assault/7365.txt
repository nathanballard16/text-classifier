Tirupur residents allege priest sexually harassed minor girl

Tirupur: Nallur police intervened and took the priest of a temple in Cheran Thozilalar Colony on Dharapuram road to the station after residents cornered him alleging he had sexually abused a minor girl.

The residents said the priest had sexually assaulted a Class VIII girl in his house on the premises of the temple. They said the girl had gone to the temple on Tuesday along with her grandmother. After offering prayers, they were about to leave when the priest asked the girl to come to his house for ‘prasadam’. When she went to his house he misbehaved with her and asked her to come to his house alone on Wednesday.

The girl rushed out to her grandmother. After reaching home, she told her mother about the harassment, following which her relatives and neighbours went to the temple to confront the priest. However, the temple authorities stopped them and sent the priest inside the temple.

Police reached the spot and took the priest to the police station. The residents are angry that no case has been filed.
