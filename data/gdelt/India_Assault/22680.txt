VARANASI: A minor gang rape survivor and her parents consumed poison outside the office of Varanasi district police chief on Monday alleging that cops were giving a long rope to one of the accused. The girl and her parents are undergoing treatment at the trauma centre of Banaras Hindu University and their condition is stated to be critical.A note was recovered from the pocket of rape survivor’s father in which he stated “the police should be held responsible for their suicide”. The note accuses circle officer, in charge of Cantonment police station and police outpost in charge of threatening the family not to pursue the case against one of the accused, Zamir.The note says that the CO had even promised that if the girl agrees not to press charges against Zamir, he will help her fulfil her ambitions.In the note, the girl’s father said he was tired of pursuing the case against the accused who are well-connected and financially sound.“My financial condition does not allow me to put up a fight against these people. For last two months, I have been running from one office to another to meet IG, SSP and DM,” said the note, which also named a UP minister, whom he tried to meet.Before being referred to trauma centre, the girl also said she was upset with the injustice being meted out to her.SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary told TOI, “Two of the three accused have already been arrested. On the basis of girl’s statement before a magistrate, section 376 (rape) and 372 (selling a minor for prostitution) have been added to the FIR.”The SSP said the third accused, Utkarsh Tiwari, had applied for anticipatory bailin local court where it was rejected. Later, he moved the Allahabad High Court for anticipatory bail.He said police have approached the court for nonbailable warrant for the third accused. NBW is a part of the proceedings required for attaching the property of an accused.Initially, the FIR was lodged on November 3 under sections 363 and 364 (kidnapping) of IPC and Section 3/7 of the POCSO Act.“Police are investigating the provocation behind the family for taking the extreme step,” the SSP said, adding that they are verifying call details of the family as the rape survivor was reportedly seen informing someone over the phone that she has consumed poison.According to police, the girl and her parents reached district police headquarters on Monday morning and consumed poison about 150metres away from the SSP office.When cops and other people present there saw them falling unconscious, they rushed the trio to the district hospital from where they were referred to BHU trauma centre.SSP Prabhakar Chawdhary, SP (city) Dinesh Kumar Singh and other senior officers visited them in the hospital.Giving details of the rape case, police said in his complaint, the girl’s father had named Vishal Maurya, Utkarsh Tiwari and Zamir Alam of kidnapping the minor girl on October 19 and taking her to Mumbai where they gang-raped her and allegedly sold her for prostitution.The girl somehow managed to escape and reached Allahabad from where the government railway police (GRP) took her to her parents on November 3 after which an FIR was lodged the same day.Police said Vishal Maurya was arrested in the first week of December and Zamir Alam was held four days ago. Tiwari, whose plea for anticipatory bail was rejected by the court, is on the run.Cops claimed that the rape survivor’s brother had committed suicide in October and in his suicide suicide had expressed his anguish over his minor sister’s behaviour.
