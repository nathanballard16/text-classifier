Imran Khan meets COAS Bajwa amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan

Islamabad [Pakistan], Feb 21 (ANI): Pakistan Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Jawed Bajwa on Thursday met Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan amid heightened tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad in the wake of Pulwama terror attack.

The meeting comes amidst India’s mounting pressure on Pakistan as the February 14 terror attack was carried out and claimed by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad.

India has been impressing upon the world powers, including the US, to exert pressure on Pakistan so that action is taken against JeM and its chief Masood Azhar.

Following the attack, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo strongly condemned the terror attack and reiterated that Pakistan should not provide safe haven to terrorist groups operating on its soil.

United States National Security Advisor John Bolton also called his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval to express condolences and outrage over the Pulwama terror attack. The two NSAs agreed to hold Pakistan accountable for its obligations under the United Nations resolutions and to remove all obstacles to designating JeM chief Masood Azhar as a 'global terrorist' under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 Committee process.

Ambassador of France to India Alexandre Ziegler said that his country is “pushing” to put JeM chief Masood Azhar on the UN sanctions list.

This will be the second time that France will put forth its proposal at the United Nations.
