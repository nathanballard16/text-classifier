Rajnath asks BJP cadres to stand with Kashmiris if they are troubled

Beawar (Rajasthan), Mar 8 (ANI) Condemning attacks on Kashmiris in various parts of the country, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Friday asked BJP cadres to stand with the people from the valley if anybody tries to trouble them and urged state governments to ensure that they are “protected and loved”.

“I heard about a few incidents against Kashmiri children. I want to convey a message to the entire country – Kashmiris are, were and will remain our people,” he said while addressing a BJP event here.

“If somebody conspires and troubles our Kashmiri students, then it's the responsibility of BJP workers to stand with the Kashmiri students,” the senior leader of the ruling party told the gathering of party cadres here.

He said he has also asked Chief Ministers of all the states to ensure that Kashmiri students are “protected and loved”.

Singh’s comments came against the backdrop of an incident in Lucknow on Wednesday when two Kashmiri dry fruit vendors were assaulted by some members of a right-wing fringe group.

The Uttar Pradesh police acted swiftly and arrested four people in connection with the incident which had evoked a nationwide outrage. (ANI)
