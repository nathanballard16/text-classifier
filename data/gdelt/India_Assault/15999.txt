ABP Shikhar Sammelan: 'India Not A Dharamshala', Says Anil Jain As He Hails NRC Exercise

He also hailed the abrogation of Article 370 which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir and said that without any bloodshed the government has successfully got the country rid of it.

BJP general secretary and in-charge of party’s Haryana and Chhattisgarh units, Anil Jain, said that India is not a “dharamshala” where anybody can enter, while defending the National Register of Citizens which has been published in Assam, and which Union Home Minister Amit Shah has proposed to introduce throughout the country. “We will drive the infiltrators out of the country. Home Minister Amit Shah has also said that NRC exercise on the lines of Assam, will be implemented throughout the country. If it is implemented across the country, we will implement it in Haryana as well,” he said while speaking to ABP News at its flagship summit Shikhar Sammelan, held in the poll-bound state. He also added that wherever across the globe Hindus are tortured, they will be provided a place in India.
