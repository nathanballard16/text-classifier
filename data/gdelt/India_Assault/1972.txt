FB user calls for new Godse to kill Gandhis

The curtains are up and political theatre has taken centrestage in the run-up to the general elections. On Tuesday, the social media cell of Pune City District Indian National Congress Committee (INCC) filed a complaint with Shivajinagar police station, claiming that a woman had threatened to kill the Gandhi siblings — Congress president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi — on Facebook.The complaint elaborated that the cell had posted the rabid video of the Hindu Mahasabha’s national secretary Pooja Shakun Pandey, who recreated Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination, by shooting his effigy complete with the gore of blood sprouting, at Aligarh on his death anniversary on January 30. “Condemning the act in the video we’d captioned it — Bapu hum sharminda hain tere qatil aaj bhi zinda hai,” informed Chaitanya Purandare, chief of INCC’s social media cell.In response to this post, one Niti Gokhale, allegedly used very foul language to declare that two more Gandhis are still living and one more Nathuram Godse is required to kill them, Purandare recounted. Interpreting this as a direct threat, the complaint has been filed. “We approached the police and demanded strict action under various sections of cybercrime law and also the Indian Penal Code,” he added.Acknowledging the receipt of the complaint, an officer at the Shivajinagar police station said, “We are taking the help of cybercrime to ascertain the identity of the suspect.”It may be recalled that Pandey and her husband Ashok have been arrested from Tappal in Uttar Pradesh by the state police for their treacherous act in recreating Gandhi’s killing. However, the duo remained unrepentant of their action even after the arrest.
