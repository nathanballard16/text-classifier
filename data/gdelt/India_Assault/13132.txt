Unnao rape victim accident: Number plate of killer truck was clean hours before crash, reveals CCTV footage

Police now suspect that the truck driver smeared the number plate with grease after passing the particular toll plaza.

The truck that hit the car of the Unnao rape victim, killing two of her relatives and seriously injuring her, had a "clean and clear" number plate when it crossed a toll plaza at Lalganj area of Rae Bareli, which is about 20 kilometres from the crash site in Gurbakshganj area.

CCTV footage from the toll plaza shows that a truck entering the area at around 5.20 am on July 28, while the accident occurred at around 12:40 pm, reported The Times of India.

It was earlier reported that the number plate of the truck which hit the Unnao rape survivor's car was smudged, but the CCTV footage shows that the number plate of the truck was clear just hours before the incident.

However, at the time when the accident took place, the number plate of the truck was smeared with grease, added the report.

According to the report, local police had earlier claimed that the truck owner Devendra Singh informed that the number plate was deliberately smudged to evade the financier's staff since he defaulted on loan installments.

Police now suspect that the truck driver smeared the number plate with grease after passing the particular toll plaza.

The driver and cleaner of the truck have already been arrested. Meanwhile Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the rape accused and nine others have been booked after the incident.

The Supreme Court recently passed orders to transfer all five cases related to the Unnao rape from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi. It gave the CBI 14 days time to provide a report on the mysterious accident.
