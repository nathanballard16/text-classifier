Mumbai: Woman gang-raped by three; two arrested, one absconding

The Saki Naka police have arrested two men in connection with gang rape of a 25-year-old woman. While two men have been arrested, their third accomplice is still on the run. The accused duo has been identified as Sanket Palkar (25) and Deepak Kubekar (24).

According to police sources, on June 26, the victim got a call from an unknown number, asking her to meet for just five minutes. When the woman declined, the man said he had something important to discuss. The woman then agreed to meet at Sangharsh Nagar, Andheri (E) the next day. As decided, she reached the location at 10.30 am, but to her surprise, the man had come with two more men. After a scuffle, the woman was overpowered by three men and was gangraped. The accused men fled the spot soon after the incident.

The victim approached police and lodged a complaint against three unidentified men for gangraping her. Saki Naka police began their investigation and checked the spot for any CCTV cameras. But since the incident occurred at a secluded spot facing the mountain, they did not find any. Police then checked the Call Data Records (CDR) of the woman, from where they obtained the mobile number of the accused and traced him to Malad a month later.

On Wednesday, police nabbed Palkar and Kubekar in connection with the case. They are booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Police said, Palkar and Kubekar were produced in a local magistrate court on Thursday and remanded in police custody. Meanwhile, the search for the third accused is still underway.
