Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) The Emergency Response Support System (ERSS) is a pan-India single number (112) based response system for persons in distress. Citizens can access emergency services by using the following methods: Dial 112: A person in distress can dial a pan-India number: 112. Press power button: A citizen can press the power button on a smartphone thrice quickly to activate a panic call to ERC. Long press 5, 9 keys: In case of a feature phone, a citizen can long press on number 5 or 9 on the phone keypad to activate the panic call. The other ways to access the emergency service is by logging onto the ERSS website for the state and lodge the emergency or send SOS alert to State ERC or use 112 India Mobile App, which is available free on Google Play store and Apple store. Key Highlights • Under this system, all the states have to set up a dedicated Emergency Response Centre (ERC). • The centres will have a team of trained call-takers and dispatchers to handle emergency requests relating to assistance from police, fire & rescue, health and other emergency services. • The police can view all events after an emergency call is made at the ERC. The ERCs are connected to District Command Centres (DCC) and the Emergency Response Vehicles and assistance and response to victims are facilitated through them. • The centre is designed to be a common protocol managed by each state and union territory. • For Women and children, 112 India App provides a special SHOUT feature which alerts registered volunteers in the vicinity of the victim for immediate assistance. • The Central Government is funding Rs 321.69 crore to the states and union territories for the emergency system as a part of Nirbhaya scheme project. The service has already been launched in Himachal Pradesh and Nagaland.
