Eight of the survivors who were sexually assaulted at a state-funded shelter home in Bihar's Muzaffarpur must be reunited with their families, the Supreme Court told the state government today. The top court also said financial, medical and educational assistance must be given to the eight survivors.

Over 30 girls were raped and sexually assaulted at a shelter home in Muzaffarpur in Bihar for years. The allegations came to light last year following a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS).

The top court's order comes after TISS submitted a report before it in a sealed envelope, saying the eight girls were fit to be handed over to their families.

Manju Verma, one of the accused in the case, stepped down as the Social Welfare Minister in the Nitish Kumar government after allegations of close links between her husband and Brajesh Thakur - the prime accused in the Muzaffarpur shelter home scandal.

Brajesh Thakur, a journalist-turned-social activist, headed the NGO that ran the shelter home. The case was handed over to the CBI last July. Eleven people including Thakur were charge-sheeted.

The CBI had said that allegations regarding involvement of outsiders, who used to physically or sexually abuse the girls, have been properly investigated by them and accused have also been charge sheeted as per revelation made by the survivors.
