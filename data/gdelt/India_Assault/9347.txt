New Delhi: Responding to a rather bizarre public interest legislation (PIL), the Delhi Police has managed to infer that it supports the action of traffic police personnel hiding behind walls or trees in order to apprehend traffic rule violators. The petition was filed under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by Delhi High Court advocate Bijendra Pratap Kumar while the reply was furnished by Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Sandeep Goyal.

In his petition, Kumar had asked the Delhi Police whether there is a rule or order which allows traffic police personnel to hide behind trees, walls or shrubs in order to apprehend violators using the element of surprise. The petitioner alleged that this practice resembles 'ambush prosecution' and is the kind of approach taken up by law enforcement agencies dealing with criminals or terrorists, not tax-paying citizens.

Demanding an immediate stay on this practice of 'ambush prosecution', Kumar said that the Delhi Police had asserted that traffic inspectors, zonal officers or constables can position themselves on intersections and red lights in order to apprehend violators. Claiming that no citizen would dare to violate traffic norms in the presence of law enforcement personnel, the petitioner said that even if that happens, the concerned officer can note down the vehicle's details and send a notice to the violator.

Meanwhile, the Joint Commissioner of Police (Traffic) defended the move by saying that traffic police personnel, zonal officers or constables deployed at red lights across the national capital region often hide behind walls or trees with the intention of fining violators who attempt to break the law. In his reply, Sandeep Goyal also said that concerned law enforcement agents will take up positions at red lights in the near future in order to efficiently apprehend violators. However, the jury is still out on whether tax-paying citizens should be subjected to the act of 'ambush prosecution' by traffic police personnel on the streets of the national capital.
