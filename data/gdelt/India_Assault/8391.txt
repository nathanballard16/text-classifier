Rajasthan Police on Saturday filed a chargesheet against six accused in the Alwar gang-rape case in the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (SC-ST) Court here.

The chargesheet was filed against the accused—Indraj Singh, Hansraj, Mahesh, Ashok and Chotya alias Chotelal (all Gurjars)—under relevant sections of the IPC and the SC/ST Act and IT Act, Superintendent of Police Alwar Paris Deshmukh told The Tribune.

The sixth accused, Mukesh Gurjar, who had shot and circulated a video on social media on May 4, was charged under the IT Act, the SP said.

A team of five cops headed by Investigating Officer Jagmohan Sharma, three Inspectors and one Sub-Inspector finalised the chargesheet, the SP said.

On April 26, the five accused had allegedly gangraped a woman in front of her husband when she was going with him on a motorcycle on the Thanagaji-Alwar road. Another accused had shot a video clip of the crime and circulated it on social media on May 4.

The FIR was lodged on May 2. The state government had also ordered a probe by the Jaipur Divisional Commissioner.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had met the rape survivor in Alwar’s Thanagji on May 16 and assured her of justice, while Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot assured a government job to the victim.
