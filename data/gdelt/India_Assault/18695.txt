NEW DELHI, Nov. 23 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Friday night's attack by armed rebels Naxals on policemen in India's eastern state of Jharkhand has risen to four, a local police source said on Saturday.

The armed rebels had attacked a patrolling police party in Jharkhand's Latehar district, as the cops were on duty to ensure security arrangements in the area in the wake of the ongoing Assembly polls in the state.

An official at the office of Latehar Superintendent of Police (SP) Prashant Anand told Xinhua over phone that those killed included Assistant Sub-Inspector Sukra Urav, and three Home Guards.

Another Home Guard was also seriously injured in the attack, said the official.

According to him, the Naxals opened indiscriminate firing on the police party near the Lukuiyya village of Latehar district. The cops retaliated and opened up return firing. In the encounter, the four cops died.

The Naxalite insurgency has its genesis in the violent left-wing rebellion that began in 1967 at village Naxalbari in the Indian state of West Bengal.
