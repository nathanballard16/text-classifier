5 photos capture the havoc wreaked by overnight rains in Pune

Thirteen people were killed after heavy rains in Maharashtra’s Pune on Thursday. More than 500 people were rescued from waterlogged areas that saw cars and other vehicles being washed away. While seven bodies were recovered from different spots in Pune city, five deaths were confirmed from adjoining villages.

National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) has been pressed into action to rescue those stranded in the waterlogged areas. The administration ordered closure of schools and colleges on Thursday as the Met office predicted more rains in the next two days.
