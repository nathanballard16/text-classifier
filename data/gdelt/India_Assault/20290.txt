Rape victim dies after being set on fire by gang in India

A rape victim who was set on fire by a gang of men on her way to court has died in a New Delhi hospital in India.

The 23-year-old woman had been travelling to a hearing for her case in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh when she was doused with paraffin and set ablaze.

Five men have been arrested in connection with the attack.

The woman had lodged a complaint with police in March claiming she had been raped at gun-point last December.

Her alleged rapist was jailed, but was released last week on bail.

She died of a cardiac arrest in Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi after suffering 95% burns.

It is the second deadly attack against a woman in recent weeks, causing a public backlash across the country.

Uttar Pradesh has become notorious for its poor record of crimes against women, with more than 4,200 cases of rape reported there in 2017 - the highest in the country.

The burns victim's death came on the same day that police in the southern state of Telangana shot dead four men being held on suspicion of raping and killing a 27-year-old vet.

Their deaths have drawn both praise and condemnation in a case that has sparked protests across the country.
