Day after arrest, abduction accused engineer gets bail

Vadodara: He hatched one of the most detailed plans to demand ransom money which even tested intelligence of police, but a day after the accused Deep Patel’s arrest, he walked out on bail.

The 27-year-old electronics and communication engineer had demanded Rs 25 lakh from his cousin brother as he was in dire need of money by pasting anonymous threat letter. However, his plan had flopped and he was arrested by the detection of crime branch on Wednesday.

On Thursday, Panigate police that had registered the case produced Patel in a local court here, but to everyone’s surprise, police neither sought his remand, nor opposed his bail application which was filed by his lawyer. As per the legal procedure, cops produced Patel and requested the court to take him under its custody.

As he was taken into the judicial custody, his lawyer filed for bail which was granted as no opposition was raised by police. “We have recovered all material evidence from the accused, be it his laptop, phone, cash, car among other things which were listed by senior officials. Also, his interrogation was also over so we did not need his custody,” said inspector N V Vaghela of Panigate police station.

On being asked why Patel’s bail application was not opposed Vaghela said that he was arrested in a bailable offence and since evidence had been recovered, there were no grounds on which his bail could be opposed.

In his anonymous threat letters, Patel had even threatened his cousin that he had hired a contract killer who would kill his son even if he would get arrested.
