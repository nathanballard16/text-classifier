Babul Supriyo News: West Bengal a fit case for imposition of President’s Rule, says Kailash Vijayvargiya

NEW DELHI: A day after Union minister of state for environment Babul Supriyo was heckled and assaulted by students belonging to ultra-left unions in the Jadavpur University in Kolkata, BJP leaders felt the law and order situation in West Bengal had broken down.Talking to timesofindia.com, BJP general secretary in charge of West Bengal Kailash Vijayvargiya alleged that the law and order in the state had broken down.“The extent to which the law and order situation has broken down in West Bengal can be gauged from the fact that state Governor Jagdeep Dhankar was forced to rush to Jadavpur University himself to rescue Union minister Babul Supriyo. There can be nothing more unfortunate than this,” he said.On September 19, Babul Supriyo, who is also the BJP from Asansol in the state, was manhandled and even pulled by hair when he went to the Jadavpur University campus to attend a programme organised by the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad . Students belonging to ultra-left unions agitated against Babul Supriyo and refused him entry.When the minister sought to reason out with the students, they waved black flags, shouted “go back” slogans and heckled him in order to prevent him from going to the venue where the event was being held. With the situation getting out of control, Governor Jagdeep Dhankar rushed to the university and rescued Babul Supriyo from the clutches of the students.Asked whether he had informed Union home minister Amit Shah , who is also the BJP president, about the incident, Kailash Vijayvargiya said he was aware of it.“He [Amit Shah] is in the know of the latest developments. But I will personally apprise him of the state of affairs to him. He is scheduled to visit the state on October 1,” Vijayvargiya said.Vijayvargiya claimed that West Bengal was a fit case for imposition of President’s Rule but he said BJP was against using it.“Although situations warrant imposition of President’s Rule but we do not want to disturb any state. However, I believe that if Mamata Banerjee cannot handle the law and order of the state, the people will demand imposition of President’s Rule,” Vijayvargiya said.The senior BJP leader also added that the party had not yet demanded imposition of President’s Rule in West Bengal from Amit Shah.West Bengal is scheduled to face assembly election in mid-2021.On the question of whether free and fair assembly election was possible in West Bengal under the prevailing circumstances, Kailash Vijayvargiya said, “It is not possible if the Election Commission depends upon the state government,” he said and added that no free and fair election is possible without the deployment of Central armed police force.The state had witnessed the maximum violence during the 2019 Lok Sabha election earlier this year and also during municipal elections in 2017. Several political workers were allegedly hanged and killed for supporting the BJP during these elections.
