Sabarimala Protests: KSRTC Suspends Its Bus Services Between Karnataka And Kerala

The Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) has called off services to Kerala after one of its Airavat buses was pelted with stones at Kaniyapuram in Thiruvananthapuram during the state-wide hartal. One passenger also suffered minor injuries in the altercation.

Deccan Chronicle quoted a senior KSRTC official as saying, “Traders’ organisations and firms operating in the tourism sector in Kerala have announced their decision to boycott Thursday’s bandh call, but it is very difficult for our corporation to operate services because most of the buses which ply to Kerala are high-end club class services, so the damage is huge. As soon as one of our buses was attacked in Thiruvananthapuram, we immediately said told our drivers to stay off the road, keeping in mind the safety of passengers and the bus.”

The corporation is facing a revenue loss of Rs 10.16 lakh a day and 92 buses that were scheduled to travel to Kerala, particularly from Mangaluru and Bengaluru, have been cancelled. KSRTC has requested the travellers to alter their travel plans accordingly.
