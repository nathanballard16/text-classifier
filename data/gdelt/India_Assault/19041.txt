Hyderabad/New Delhi, Nov 29

The brutal rape and murder of a veterinary doctor has sent shock waves across Telangana, prompting the National Commission for Women to rush a member to Hyderabad. The 26-year-old was raped and her body burnt on the outskirts of Hyderabad by four men after they offered to fix her scooter’s flat tyre.

The victim rang up her sister telling her a few persons near a toll plaza were making her uncomfortable. Neither she nor her sister called up the police. Her charred body was later found at an underpass. The police have rounded up four suspects for rape and murder, among them a truck driver and a cleaner. The police suspect the girl was gangraped, strangled and the body burnt to destroy evidence. Police suspect the assailants first punctured the scooter and kidnapped the doctor on the pretext of helping her.

NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma, while vowing not to leave "any stone unturned" till perpetrators were punishment, sent notices to the state police chief and administration seeking urgent action under the amended criminal law amendments that address sexual assault. The amendments were brought following the 2012 gang rape in Delhi.

Despite SC rulings against identifying a sexual assault victim, the Hyderabad victim was named by several on Twitter, including Rahul Gandhi and spiritual leader Jaggi Vasudev. — TNS
