Sikh woman abducted, forced to convert in Pakistan

A Sikh priest in Pakistan said his daughter, Jagjit Kaur, was abducted and forced to convert to Islam. The woman was missing for three days and returned as a married woman. Jagjit maintains her action were voluntary, but her family has appealed to Prime Minister Imran Khan for justice. They have also threatened to immolate themselves in front of the Governor's house if Jagjit is not returned. As per the FIR, six people abducted Jagjit at gunpoint on August 27-28.



The incident took place in Pakistan's Punjab province, in a Nankana Sahib town, birthplace of Guru Nanak Sahib. The father is a granthi in Gurudwara Tambu Sahib.



The case has led to a strong statement from India. "We have, time and again, raised the issue of persecution, abduction, treatment of minorities and conversions in Pakistan," Foreign Ministry's Raveesh Kumar said, "They have an obligation towards these people, they must fulfil it. They must check themselves before saying anything to others."
