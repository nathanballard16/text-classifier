India can’t hold Kashmiris hostage for long time: Dr. Firdous

Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr. Firdous Ashiq Awan says India cannot hold Kashmiris hostage for a long time.

Addressing a news conference along with Kashmiri leaders in Islamabad on Wednesday, she said India's nefarious acts regarding Kashmir show that it has lost its case in Kashmir.

The Special Assistant said Kashmiris will not accept any decision of India.

She said India has deployed hundreds of thousands of troops in occupied Kashmir to suppress the voice of the Kashmiris, but it will fail.

Firdous Ashiq Awan said we all should demonstrate unity for the Kashmir cause to send across a strong message.

She regretted that the opposition did politics on the issue by insisting issuance of production order for the parliamentarians detained in various cases.

The Special Assistant said the media has an important role to play on the issue.

Speaking on the occasion, Abdul Hameed Lone said revocation of Article 370 is violation of the United Nations resolutions and the Indian constitution.

He said India has imposed restrictions on the media to suppress the voice of Kashmiris.
