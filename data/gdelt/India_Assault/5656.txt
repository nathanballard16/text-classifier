Dube new central police observer for Bengal

Kolkata, March 28 : The Election Commission (EC) on Thursday replaced K.K. Sharma with Vivek Dube as the central police observer for West Bengal, a day after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee objected to Sharma's appointment calling him "an RSS man".

"The Election Commission had appointed K.K. Sharma as the central police observer for West Bengal. Now Vivek Dube, IPS of 1981 batch, has been appointed in his place," Additional Chief Electoral Officer Sanjay Basu said here.

Dube was part of the Bilkis Bano gang-rape case investigations in 2002.

On the reason for change, Basu said it was the commission's decision.

Objecting to Sharma's appointment citing his closeness to the RSS, the Chief Minister on Wednesday said the Trinamool Congress (TMC) will write a "strong letter" to the EC in this regard.

The TMC Chief also released a photograph alleging last year Sharma was present at an RSS function in Kolkata alongside Rantideb Sengupta, BJP candidate for the Howrah Lok Sabha seat.

Basu also said 24 police observers and 47 general observers have been appointed for the districts and constituencies, respectively.

"We had asked for additional central observers for places like Kolkata South, hill areas of Darjeeling and Jhargram. Hence, there are 47 of them for 42 constituencies," he said.
