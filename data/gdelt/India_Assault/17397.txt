Kamlesh Tewari autopsy report out, stabbed at least 15 times and shot once

LUCKNOW: Hindu Samaj Party founder Kamlesh Tewari was stabbed at least 15 times by his killers, who had brought a knife hidden in a sweet box they carried with them to his office-cum-residence in Lucknow on October 18. They posed as supporters of his outfit to enter into Tewari's home.Doctors at King George Medical University in Lucknow, who conducted Tewari's autopsy, mentioned in the postmortem report that seven stab wounds were located at a single spot on the left side of his chest.The post-mortem report, a copy of which is with TOI, mentioned the stabs drilled a hole of about 3-4 cm into his chest. There were also two "incised wounds" on Tewari, one of which was to slit his throat, it said.The report also disclosed that the killers had fired at least once as there is a firearm entry wound on his face. The Police , however, are baffled by the fact how the sound of the gunshot fired was missed by Tewari's wife and gunman, who were on the ground floor of his house.Based on inputs received from cops in Surat and Nagpur, UP Police have arrested the two suspects — Moinuddin Pathan and Ashfaq — late on Tuesday evening.The cops said they have not yet ascertained whether the firearm was present inside the sweet box or hidden elsewhere.“It’s an illegal weapon. So, it is difficult to comment on how and under what circumstances it reached Tewari’s residence. This crucial part is being investigated separately as to whether Pathan and Ashfaq had brought the weapon or was it lying there,” said a senior police officer.
