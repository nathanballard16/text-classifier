Kolkata: CMCH doctor attacked by kin of patient, services disrupted

Emergency services at Calcutta Medical College and Hospital were disrupted for an hour after a junior doctor was assaulted by relatives of a patient on Wednesday.

Doctors protested the assault and demanded strict action against the accused. Soon, police rushed to the spot and the situation was brought under control.

The cause of the argument between the accused and the doctor was issuance of outdoor patient (OPD) ticket, source said. “Before anyone could understand anything, the doctor was allegedly assaulted. Angered over the incident, junior doctors protested and emergency services were not available for nearly an hour,” sources said. However, doctors didn’t call any strike and services were brought back to normal.

This is not the first time that a doctor has been assaulted. A few months ago, junior doctors at NRS hospital were attacked. This caused a a week-long strike by doctors in the state. The agitation was called of after CM Mamata Banerjee’s promise to improve security .
