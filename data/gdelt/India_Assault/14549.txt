Shocking! Couple attempts self-immolation at police station in Mathura

AGRA: A married couple set themselves on fire within the precincts of Surir police station in Uttar Pradesh's Mathura district on Wednesday morning. The police had failed to take action against their neighbour, also a local muscleman, who had been harassing them for long.The entire incident took place in front of the couple’s minor son, who cried while shooting a video of his parents going up in flames.The victims--aged 45 and 43--were allegedly being harassed by one Satyapal Singh, 23. According to police, the couple apparently doused themselves in kerosene before arriving at the police station around 8am. As soon as they entered the boundary wall of the police station, they set themselves afire, leaving bystanders shell-shocked.A 55-second video, purportedly shot by their 14-year-old son who can be heard crying in the background, has been shared widely on the social media. The video shows that the man and woman set themselves on fire and a cop and another man rushing to douse the flames with a table cloth and a blanket.The victims were immediately taken to the district hospital, from where they were referred to a private hospital in Mathura, as they had sustained over 70 per cent burn injuries. Later in the day, they were referred to the Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi, as their condition started deteriorating.Talking to TOI, the couple’s son said that their neighbour had not only been humiliating his parents publicly, but had also misbehaved with his mother several times by tearing her clothes off and literally stripping her. He said, “We had reported the matter several times, but the police were not taking any action against the accused."He told TOI that they had made another complaint on August 23 after the strongman, who was drunk, beat them up after breaking the door of their house, but the police did not register any FIR against the accused. He alleged that police were supporting the accused.Mathura senior superintendent of police (SSP) Shalabh Mathur admitted that no FIR was registered on the Aug 23, as claimed by the victims’ son. He said, however, the complaint was noted in the general diary and medical examination of the victims was also conducted.The medical report had revealed “injuries” to the couple, said the SSP, adding that further action could not be taken as the staff was busy due to Janmashtmi security duties on August 23 and 24.He said, now an FIR has been registered against the accused under section 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), 354 (Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) and 324 (Voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons) on the basis of a complaint filed by the victim Jugender at Surir Police station.The SSP also suspended three policemen--inspector Anoop Saroj, in-charge of Surir police station, and sub-inspectors Deepak Nagar and Sunil Singh--for failing to take timely action against the accused. The suspended policemen have been booked for non-recording of First Information Report (FIR) in this case under section 166 (A) of IPC.Meanwhile, Agra zone ADG Ajay Anand visited the spot and ordered a departmental inquiry to be conducted by SP City, Mathura.Policeman at Surir police station claimed that the victims had filed a complaint on July 13 too and the accused was then arrested on the same day for abusing and beating them. He was, however, released on bail the very next day.
