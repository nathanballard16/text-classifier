Pakistan Foreign Minister confirms Jaish chief Masood Azhar is in Pakistan, says he is unwell

Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has confirmed that Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar is in the country.

The minister said Masood Azhar is "unwell to an extent that he cannot leave the house" while speaking to CNN.

"According to my information, he is very unwell. He is unwell to the extent that he can't leave his house, because he's really unwell," he said.

The development comes at a time when diplomatic pressure is mounting on Pakistan over terror groups operating on its soil. India and US have been critical of Pakistan's shielding of Azhar.

Terror organisation Jaish has carried out multiple attacks on India in over two decades, including the recent suicide bombing in Pulwama which claimed the life of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers.

India has been trying hard on the global stage to brand his as a terrorist as the United Nations Security Council but China has been blocking India's attempts.

Show evidence, we will take action

Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi also said that Pakistan is ready to take action against Azhar if there is evidence that can "stand in a court of law".

"If they (India) have solid, inalienable evidence that is acceptable to courts of Pakistan, share it with us so that we can convince the people and we can convince the independent judiciary of Pakistan," he said.

Qureshi went on to add that the release of captured Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman is a gesture of peace and should be seen as Pakistan's willingness to de-escalate tension between New Delhi and Islamabad.

However, cross-border violation and terrorism continue to act as a menace in the Kashmir Valley. On Friday, a civilian was injured due to cross-border firing by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control (LoC).
