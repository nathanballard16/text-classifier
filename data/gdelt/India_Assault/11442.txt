College student beaten by warden in Anantapur

Yashwant was among the many allegedly caned in the name of discipline

A second-year student Yashwant of Narayana Junior Residential College near TV Tower in Anantapur city was allegedly beaten indiscriminately by the hostel warden in the name of discipline on July 8 night.

There was a petty argument at the hostel mess between Mohan Sai, a junior Intermediate student, and Chandravadan, a senior student. Later, about 15 senior students allegedly tried to question the junior student on his behaviour, but lecturers and the warden stopped them.

The warden, with a view to disciplining them, allegedly canned a few students leading to injuries to Yashwant who was not involved in the incident but was among the students who had came out of their rooms to find out what was happening.

Deputy Superintendent of Police P.N. Babu said that the police had summoned the representatives of the college and students to One Town police station in Anantapur to find out what had happened.

Meanwhile, Student Federation of India district secretary Sury said that they demanded that cases be booked against the “person responsible for the indiscriminate beating of the students in the name of discipline”.
