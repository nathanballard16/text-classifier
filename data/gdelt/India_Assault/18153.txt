Chandigarh, November 8

In continued social media tussle between police and lawyers over the Tis Hazari clash, latest videos of senior woman police officer being allegedly assaulted by lawyers have surfaced.

The shocking videos that have emerged show a mob comprising mostly of lawyers allegedly assaulting Deputy Commissioner, North Monika Bhardwaj at the Tis Hazari court complex on November 2.

Meanwhile, the National Commission for Woman has taken a suo moto cognizance of the media reports. NCW chief Rekha Sharma on Friday wrote to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik demanded an inquiry into the matter and has sought an First Investigation Report registered against the violators.

A minor argument between a lawyer and some policemen over parking at the Tis Hazari court complex flared up, leading to violence and arson. A lawyer was left with a bullet injury.

"Twenty policemen, including one Additional DCP and two SHOs, sustained injuries. Eight advocates were also hurt. 12 motorcycles, one police QRT gypsy and eight jail vans were damaged," police had claimed.

Earlier, a five-minute audio tape of a policeman, who was seriously injured in the clashes, had revealed that the woman police officer present on the spot was allegedly abused and roughed up by the lawyers and an alleged desperate attempt was made to snatch away her PSO's service revolver.

While the PSO (Personal Security Officer called 'Operator' in Delhi police) was thrashed with iron chains and lay unconscious on the floor, the DCP, reportedly Monika Bhardwaj, broke down on November 3 and wept for quite some time, the audio clip had revealed.
