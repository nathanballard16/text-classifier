Maharashtra govt already has a review report on cases against Maratha, Dalit protesters

Mumbai: The new Maha Vikas Aghadi government has promised to review cases registered in the wake of the Koregaon Bhima violence and the Maratha quota stir , but a report on this filed by the Maharashtra police is already pending before the state home department.The report , sources in the state home department told ET, asked the government if it wanted to prosecute only 56 "serious" cases - a list which did not include cases linking prominent activists to the Elgaar Parishad event - out of a total of 641 registered.It was initiated after former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , in March last year, announced in the state assembly that cases of political nature registered against those booked for violence during a statewide shutdown following clashes in Koregaon Bhima near Pune two months earlier and during the Maratha quota agitation the previous year would be withdrawn.Following this, a special committee headed by Additional Director General of Police (law and order) and comprising other senior officers, submitted its report in October observing that 56 cases were of "serious" nature.“These included a death caused during the violence, those pertaining to deterring a public servant from performing his duties and a few of causing damage of properties over Rs.30 lakh ,” said a senior official privy to the details.The report also mentioned that 385 cases were "not of serious" nature and that A-summary - FIR filed but cases remained undetected - had been filed by the police station concerned in 208 cases.“While the former government promised to drop political cases, the home department never issued a government resolution to that effect. In the event the present government plans to drop the cases, our report is already pending before the state home department,” said the official.While elaborating on the procedure to be followed for this by the new government another official said, “The last GR which was issued by the Government for withdrawing of the political cases was in January 2015 which stated that the case up to November 1, 2014 which are political cases or those of political nature should be withdrawn. However these cases were registered in January 2018 and therefore the old GR doesn't stand.”Among the 56 cases found to be "serious" were a case registered with the Kolhapur police where violent clashes had broken out between Shiv Sainiks and Dalit agitators and another in Aurangabad where two police officers and eight constables were injured after more than 3000 protesters gathered near Cidco police station. Police then fired 10 rounds of pellets and lobbed 18 tear gas shells to bring the situation under control. A case registered by the Latur police, in which five policemen sustained minor injuries after agitators pelted stones at a police party also figured in the list.These cases did not include the one registered by the Pune police in connection with the speeches made at Elgaar Parishad, an event held on December 31, 2017, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Battle of Koregaon, a home department official pointed out.In June last year, Pune police arrested five people - Delhi-based activist Rona Wilson, Nagpur-based lawyer Surendra Gadling, Nagpur University professor Shoma Sen, former ‘Prime Minister's Rural Development' fellow Mahesh Raut and Sudhir Dhawale of Republican Panthers.While arresting Rona, police claimed they recovered an e-mail from his laptop that discussed an assassination plot against the prime minister. Police had also claimed that speeches made at Elgaar Parishad were partly responsible for triggering the violence at Bhima Koregaon on January 1, 2018, and even filed two chargesheets saying the event was funded and supported by Maoists.A month later in August, Maharashtra police carried out surprise searches at the houses of seven prominent activists in Mumbai, Delhi and Pune. Four of them – Sudha Bhardwaj, P Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonzalves and Arun Pareira – are still in police custody, while rights activist Gautam Navlakha is presently protected from arrest by the Bombay High Court.
