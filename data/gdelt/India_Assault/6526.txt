The Aam Aadmi Party accused the BJP for the violence that broke out between the traders and the police in Mayapuri. AAP leader Manish Sisodia said that Modi government's policies are hurting business class in Delhi. "The traders have been the worst victims during the last five years of Modi government, which has been proved by sealing and all other activities, including Saturday's attack on them," he said. Thousands of factory owners, scrap dealers and employees of commercial units, who were agitating against the sealing drive by the MCD and Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC), turned violent in Mayapuri industrial area. They pelted stones at paramilitary forces, who also used force in retaliation. While talking to media, Manish Sisodia condemned the police action against the traders. "Then paramilitary forces were called to further terrorise them by throwing bricks and stones on them. Is this the way to deal with traders? Are they terrorists? Why were they treated like this?" Sisodia asked. He further added that the sealing drive at this point of time was a BJP conspiracy, which backfired. The BJP was trying to divert the issue and its leaders were making baseless statements, Sisodia said.
