BJP invokes Pulwama attack

With thousands of cadres trailing behind in two-wheelers, BJP Coimbatore Lok Sabha candidate CP Radhakrishnan crisscrossed the city on the last day of campaigning on Tuesday.

BJP senior leader L Ganesan also accompanied him in the campaign.

While campaigning at Chetty Street, Ganesan invoked Pulwama attack and Coimbatore bomb blast.

Ganesan said DMK chief MK Stalin had raised suspicion over the Pulwama attack. “If we had got the information about the attack, we would have stopped the attack and saved the lives of CRPF men. But on February 14, 1998, DMK leaders and a group of police officials knew that bombs would explode in the evening in Coimbatore city. But they did act to stop the bomb blast and save the lives of the people. We bother about the lives of people. DMK always thinks about votes and not people,” said Ganesan.

Radhakrishnan promised to implement many schemes for the city.
