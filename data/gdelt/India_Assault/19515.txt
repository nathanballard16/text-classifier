Bhatt along with Wadi-City MLA Manisha Vakil, Akota MLA Seema Mohile and other party workers visited Yakutpura where the minor rape survivor stays.

The issue of elected women representative from the city not visiting the family was being discussed since the last couple of days as apart from the MP and two MLAs, the Vadodara mayor is also a lady.

Bhatt said that the girl was very frail and needed care. “I spoke to her mother and asked her to stand by her daughter in the difficult times. The mother assured us that she was taking good care of her and we also felt the same,” said Bhatt.

When asked about the delay in visiting the girl, Bhatt said that she was in Delhi due to the ongoing parliamentary session. “However, I have constantly been in touch with the city police and following up with them. I had also instructed a local party worker to remain in touch with the family and was taking updates from him too,” claimed Bhatt.
