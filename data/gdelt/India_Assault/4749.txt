Oil Companies Dealership: Process to appoint dealers for 50,000 fuel pumps halted

NEW DELHI: State oil companies have paused the process to appoint dealers for about 50,000 petrol pumps following the release of election schedule to avoid any potential political landmine ahead of polls, people familiar with the matter said.Indian Oil,andhave been seeking to appoint petrol pump dealers at about 78,500 locations across the country. The advertisements went out in November and applications have already been received. In all, 95% of locations received interest with 39% getting single application and 56% multiple.The three companies have already declared winners for about a third of the locations advertised following draw of lots and examination of bids, and are now verifying the credentials of winners. Of the winners, more than 2,000 applicants have received letters of intent (LoI) or a formal appointment letter by companies.Companies have halted the selection process for the remaining pumps where winners haven’t yet been declared, in line with the past election practice, a company executive said, adding that a previous government order barred companies from making appointments during the election season. Companies are also thinking of seeking clarity from the Election Commission on the matter, another executive said.After the election dates were announced Sunday, kicking off a model code of conduct that bars any major policy decision or promise by the government until the conclusion of polls to prevent any undue advantage to the ruling party, state oil companies sought the oil ministry’s advice on the appointment of petrol pump dealers.The oil ministry officials are understood to have advised companies to seek clarity from the Election Commission. The government has no direct role in appointing petrol pump dealers these days. It has given state companies the freedom to design their own dealer selection guidelines and appoint dealers in a transparent way. But given the government control of these companies, and the history of controversies that have surrounded past appointments, the oil ministry officials and company executives want to play it safe this time around, people with knowledge of the matter said.Appointing new dealers during elections is quite risky as it makes companies vulnerable to accusations and can potentially put all such appointments in jeopardy should there be a change in government, the person said. An Election Commission’s nod could act as a shield for companies against such potential assaults, the person said.
