Six Indian forces injured in Kashmir grenade attack

Six Indian paramilitary force personnel were injured in a grenade attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar on Saturday evening.

In a statement, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) said that six of their men were injured after unknown militants hurled a grenade in Karan Nagar area of Srinagar. “They [the injured] were transported to hospital,” the statement added.

Ravideep Singh Sahi, the inspector general of CRPF in Srinagar sector, told Anadolu Agency that the grenade was hurled on a CRPF deployment on Saturday evening. “Search operation has been started in the area...,” he added.

The attack came over a couple of months after the Indian government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370 and split it into two union territories.

Jammu and Kashmir has been under a near-complete lockdown since Aug. 5, when New Delhi scrapped the special status of the region, previously codified in the Indian Constitution's Article 370, which allowed it to enact its own laws.

The provisions also protected the region's citizenship law, which barred outsiders from settling in and owning land in the territory.

India has maintained that 93% of the restrictions have been eased in the conflict-ridden region, a claim Anadolu Agency could not independently verify.

Some Kashmiri groups in Jammu and Kashmir have been fighting against Indian rule for independence, or for unification with neighboring Pakistan.

According to several human rights organizations, thousands of people have reportedly been killed in the conflict in the region since 1989.

Since they were partitioned in 1947, India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir.
