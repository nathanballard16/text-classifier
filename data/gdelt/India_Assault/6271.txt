AMMK candidate seeks anticipatory bail

Says charges were made to foil his chances of winning Periyakulam by-poll

MADURAI

A day after a complaint of rape was registered against him, K. Kathirkamu, AMMK’s candidate for the by-election to Periyakulam Assembly constituency, moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Wednesday seeking anticipatory bail. Justice M. Dhandapani adjourned the hearing till April 12.

In his petition, Dr. Kathirkamu alleged that the charges against him were made out of political vendetta and to foil his chances of winning the by-election. The All-Woman Police Station, Theni, registered a case against him under Sections 376 (rape), 417 (cheating) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code on Tuesday.

The victim alleged in her complaint that she was cheated by Dr. Kathirkamu, who had promised to return photographs and video clippings that were taken during their private meetings.

“When I approached him in 2016, he said that he was an MLA and asked not to be disturbed. When I insisted that he part with the videos and photos, he asked me to come to Theni MLA’s office. Believing that he would keep his promise, I went there on May 7, 2017, but I was shocked as Dr. Kathirkamu said that his friends wanted to meet me. I refused to oblige and came back,” the victim said in her complaint.

The victim also told the police that she was under constant threat from Dr. Kathirkamu and on many occasions unknown persons kept calling her. Hence, she lodged a complaint seeking protection and justice.
