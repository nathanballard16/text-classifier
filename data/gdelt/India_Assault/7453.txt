Delhi doctor murder: Flatmate Dr Chandra Prakash Verma arrested from Roorkee

Three days after a 25-year-old doctor was found dead, with her throat slit, at her rented accommodation in Central Delhi’s Ranjeet Nagar, police Thursday night arrested Dr Chandra Prakash Verma from Roorkee for allegedly killing her. The prime suspect in the murder of Garima Mishra — her flatmate and former colleague at a government hospital in Karol Bagh, 30-year-old Verma— was missing since the incident happened. Mishra said his sister came to Delhi in December 2018 and started working at the Delhi government’s NC Joshi Memorial Hospital. When her body was discovered, the third flatmate was in his room, and was detained for a few hours by police. Also, two months ago, Garima had complained to her parents about her flatmate and former colleague.
