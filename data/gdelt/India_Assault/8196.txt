Will not say sorry, says BJP's Priyanka Sharma after her release

Kolkata [West Bengal], May 15 (ANI): BJP youth wing member Priyanka Sharma, who was released on Wednesday after spending five days in jail for posting a meme on West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said that she will not apologise as she has done "no wrong".

"I will not apologise for it. I will fight the case because I have not done anything," Sharma told media persons after she walked free from jail this morning.

The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered her release from jail, but she was freed over 18 hours

"I was kept in prison and tortured by the jail authorities. I was pushed by a jailer yesterday and given sub-standard food to eat," she claimed.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court censured the West Bengal government after Sharma's counsel contended that her release was being delayed.

She also contended that even though the court had directed her to tender a written sorry after release, she was "forcefully" made to sign an apology letter by the authorities before releasing her.

"I insisted them to let me talk to my family and advocate first, but they did not pay heed to it," Sharma alleged.

The BJP activist was arrested on Friday in West Bengal and was sent to two weeks' judicial custody for allegedly sharing a morphed photo on her Facebook timeline in which Mamata Banerjee's face was photoshopped on the form of actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas at the MET Gala in New York.

Mounting a scathing attack on Mamata Banerjee, Sharma said that she should be arrested for spewing poison against Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"If anyone says anything about TMC, will they beat them every time? This is not justice. Police forces have been bought by the TMC government," Sharma said.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court had also said that it will hear the BJP member's plea seeking action against West Bengal Police, in the first week of July. (ANI)
