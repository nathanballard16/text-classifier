Jobless man hacks father to death in Rajkot

RAJKOT: Tired of being harangued about sitting idle and not taking up any job, a 20-year-old man hacked his father to death in Vangadhra village of Vichhiya taluka in Rajkot district on Thursday night. Accused Bharat Dervadia was arrested on Friday for killing his father Ranchhod Dervadia (58).“After killing Ranchhod, Bharat left the body on the cot, went to his room and slept in his blood stained clothes. On Friday morning, when his elder brother Jayanti inquired about his clothes, he said he had slipped from his bike. Jayanti then found his father lying dead in the cot in his farm. When he quizzed about it, Bharat confessed to the crime,” said an official from Vichhiya police station Bharat told the cops that he was sick of his father’s constant haranguing about his unemployment and in a fit of rage murdered him.
