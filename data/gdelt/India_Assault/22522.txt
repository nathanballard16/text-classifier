Indian riots driven by fake news

The new citizenship law is aimed at protecting persecuted religious minorities from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh.

India, like Europe, suffers from an influx of millions of hostile illegal Mohammedans from failed states like Pakistan & Banglatrash. India has a sovereign right to identify these invaders & to kick them out. Fake news media misrepresents the facts & would have you believe that citizenship is to be stripped from resident Moslems, who have nothing to fear.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will reportedly consult with his ministers about the security situation in India, following nationwide protests against a new citizenship law that have left up to seventeen people dead.
