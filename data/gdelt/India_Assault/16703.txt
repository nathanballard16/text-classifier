Devotees rough up cop in Capital

A Constable of Delhi Police was allegedly manhandled by a group of local residents in South West Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar after he objected to their Ramlila procession on Monday morning.

Over 100 locals had organised a Ramlila play on Sunday night, followed by a Ramlila procession around the area.

At the time of the procession, residents were chanting slogans. Constable Jay Prakash, who was on patrolling duty during the night, stopped the group for creating a nuisance. He asked them to avoid chanting slogans and return to their homes. The residents reacted to it and pelted stones, while some also tried to lynch him, said an official of the Khayala police station.

Prakash eventually fired a few rounds of bullets in the air in a bid to save himself. He managed to reach the nearby police post and alerted the police control room about the incident, the official said. We have registered an FIR against the unidentified persons, for obstructing a government official on duty. An investigation is underway, he added.
