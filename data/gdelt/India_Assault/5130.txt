One of 7 Indians abducted in Afghanistan returns

New Delhi, March 19 : The Ministry of External Affairs has said one of the seven Indians abducted in Baghlan province of Afghanistan has safely returned.

Militants had abducted seven employees of an Indian company KEC in May 2018 in Bagh-e-Shamal village.

"We are grateful to the Afghanistan government for their support in securing the release and repatriation of the Indian national," the External Affairs Ministry said in a statement on Monday.

"We continue to work closely with the Afghanistan government for safe and early return of the remaining six Indian nationals," it added.

The Indian employees were kidnapped when they were travelling to an area where the company has a contract for an electricity sub-station.
