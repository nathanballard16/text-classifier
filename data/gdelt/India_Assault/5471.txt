Krushna Sagaria to contest from Jeypore Assembly seat

Koraput: Former Koraput MLA, Krushna Chandra Sagaria, who joined the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) last month, Sunday announced that he will contest from the Jeypore Assembly seat.

Earlier, Sagaria had announced to contest from Bhubaneswar Lok Sabha seat.

The former Congress MLA from Koraput had formally joined the BSP and expressed his desire to contest against Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik in the Assembly elections February 3 this year.

Sagaria, a prominent Dalit leader who was elected from Koraput on a Congress ticket, had joined the BSP in the presence of the BSP’s Odisha in-charge, Dharamveer Singh.

November 6, 2018, Sagaria had resigned from the legislator’s post stating that he had no moral right to hold the position after the Kunduli gangrape and suicide incident. He was expelled from the Congress January 19 along with former Union minister Srikant Jena for indulging in anti-party activities.

On the rape and suicide of the Kunduli victim, Sagaria said the minor Dalit girl, who was raped October 10, 2017, had committed suicide January 22, 2018 after being denied justice.
