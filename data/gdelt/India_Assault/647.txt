Not poisoned, 16 puppies were hacked to death inside Kolkata hospital

A video showing two women hitting puppies with sticks till they were dead went viral leading the hospital authorities to initiate probe. The incident happened on Saturday within the campus of state-run NRS Medical College and Hospital.

The video was shot by students of the adjoining hostel verandah of dental college. “We hear dogs yapping every day but that day there were several of them wailing. I came to the verandah and saw that two women were beating the puppies with sticks till they were dead. We shouted at them and asked them to stop but they were so consumed at the act they could not hear us. The incident happened behind the NRS Nursing Hostel,” said a student of dental college.
