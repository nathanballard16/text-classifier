De-register NTK, Congress urges EC

‘Seeman speech amounts to sedition’

Coming down heavily on Naam Tamilar Katchi’s (NTK) founder-leader Seeman for his election speech justifying the assassination of late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee (TNCC) has demanded that the party be de-registered by the Election Commission of India. Besides, it said Mr. Seeman must be booked on charges of “sedition”.

In a statement issued on Sunday, TNCC president K.S. Alagiri said that by asserting that history will praise Rajiv Gandhi’s killers in his campaign speech in Vikravandi Assembly constituency on Saturday, Mr. Seeman had committed sedition through his support for the illegal activities of the banned Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).

“His actions have affected public tranquillity. We strongly condemn the indecent and arrogant speech of ‘anti-Tamil’ Seeman,” he said.

Mr. Alagiri said that Tamils will never forgive ‘terrorist’ V. Prabhakaran, the late leader of LTTE, for conspiring and assassinating the former Prime Minister. “One cannot expect the ‘political clown’ Seeman to know the grief the Tamil people expressed and the overwhelming support they gave for Congress in the 1991 election,” Mr. Alagiri added.

Mr. Alagiri said that Rajiv Gandhi played a crucial role in a number of key initiatives for the welfare of Sri Lankan Tamils, including the merger of Northern and Eastern provinces of Sri Lanka to form a homeland for Tamils, formation of a first Tamil government in the North-Eastern province with Varadaraja Perumal as Chief Minister and sending Indian Peace Keeping Force to Sri Lanka. “He was even attacked by a Sri Lankan soldier for these measures,” he recalled.

The “ungrateful LTTE”, on the other hand, killed hundreds of IPKF personnel and assassinated Rajiv, he charged.
