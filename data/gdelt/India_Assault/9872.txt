Junior doctors protest against attack

Seek prompt action against the accused

Junior Doctors staged a protest, to condemn the attack on a resident doctor in Kolkata, at the King George Hospital (KGH) here on Friday.

The protest was organised in response to the call given by the Indian Medical Association (IMA) to stage nationwide agitations against the brutal attack on the resident doctor by relatives of a patient, following his death at a hospital, in Kolkata.

The protesting doctors held banners and placards demanding stringent and prompt action against the accused to prevent the recurrence of such incidents in the country.

AP Junior Doctors’ Association (APJUDA) secretary Jyothsna Kiran alleged that the West Bengal government had failed to provide protection and do justice to the doctors. IMA Visakhapatnam vice president P.A. Ramani said that the resident doctor in Kolkata was beaten with bricks on his head, resulting in his sustaining a head injury and fracture of his skull bone.
