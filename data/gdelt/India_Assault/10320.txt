In an FIR, a 33-year-old Mumbai-based woman who hails from Bihar has alleged that Binoy sexually exploited her for several years on the promise of marriage and claims they also have an eight-year-old child.

She registered the complaint at Andheri's Oshiwara police station on June 13, after she came to know that he was already married.

The victim has handed over some crucial documents, including pictures, to the police.

Balakrishnan is now a senior member of the highest decision-making body in the CPI-M and ever since the news of his son became public, he has not reacted to the allegations.

State Congress chief Mullapally Ramachandran, a former Lok Sabha member from Kannur, said the CPI-M which often speaks about morality should speak up on the allegation that has surfaced against Balakrishnan's son.
