Copy of draft education policy burnt

A section of students of Rajah Serfoji Government College, who assembled on the college premises under the banner of Student Federation of India, on Tuesday staged a demonstration against the draft education policy of the Union government.

Terming the draft policy as a document against social justice and anti-regional language, they raised slogans condemning the Centre for its alleged attempt to tear the secular fabric of the country and impose its ‘Hindutva’ agenda on the people.

The protesters, who were prevented from moving out of the college campus by the police, set fire to a photo copy of the draft education policy.
