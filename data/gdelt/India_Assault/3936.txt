Pakistan, India to resume Samjhota Express train service

KARACHI: The Samjhota Express will depart for Pakistan from New Delhi on Sunday, Indian railways officials said, days after the train service was suspended due to escalating military tensions between the two neighbouring countries.



The announcement comes a day after Pakistan released captured Indian Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, and handed him over to India as a peace gesture. The pilot was captured on Wednesday when his MiG-21 among two Indian military aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force after they ventured into the Pakistani airspace.

The Samjhota Express train service was suspended on February 28.

A statement from Pakistan's Foreign Office earlier this week said: "The operation of the Samjhota Express has been suspended on Thursday in view of the prevailing tensions between Pakistan and India."

Operations would resume "as soon as the security situation improves between India and Pakistan", it added.

Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Thursday said the Samjhota Express service would be resumed from Monday, March 04.

The Samjhota Express runs twice a week (Monday and Thursday) from Lahore to Attari via the Wagah railway station.
