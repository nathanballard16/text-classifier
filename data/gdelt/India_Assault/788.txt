Rathod was granted a piece of land under Santhani scheme for Dalits in Gundasar village of Gondal taluka in Rajkot district . The land is adjacent to a government plot which is used for cattle grazing.“Sagathia alleged that in order to usurp the gauchar land, some scamsters of her village had forged documents in which they had named Rathod as the owner.
