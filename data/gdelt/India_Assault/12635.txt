Three civilians including infant injured in border firing in Kashmir

Reuters – Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged heavy fire along the border in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, injuring three civilians, including a ten-day-old infant and a woman, on Sunday (July 28).

Firing reportedly began on Sunday afternoon in Shahpur and Saujiyan sector of Poonch district, along the de-facto border, Line of Control (LoC), between India and Pakistan.

A 45-year-old injured man suffered a shattered knee-bone due to firing. The infant suffered extreme abdominal injuries, his whole spleen was shattered and intestines were also destroyed completely. He is in a critical condition but the other two injured are in stable condition.

It happens to be the third incident of border firing and ceasefire violation reportedly by Pakistan in the month of July. An Indian soldier was killed in an incident of border firing last week.

India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir and came close to a third in February after a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group killed at least 40 paramilitary police.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded by giving security forces “a free hand” to respond.
