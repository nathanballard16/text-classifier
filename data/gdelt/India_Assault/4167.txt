Gang rivalry in Delhi: Gangster rapes, murders woman to frame rivals

A note written by the woman, blaming the rivals for having filmed her nude, was found in her trouser pocket. Revenge finds its own time and place and so was the case with this dastardly crime in which a 25-year-old woman was killed by a gang to frame a rival. During the interrogation, Dinesh revealed that his friend, Dhirender, wanted to frame his rival, Aarush, who had thrashed him in jail, and thus plotted the murder. The gang also roped in two others, identified as Rahimuddin, 25, and Chander Prakash, 30, to help them dispose of the body. The accused has also confessed to having raped the victim, a claim that is yet to be medically corroborated.
