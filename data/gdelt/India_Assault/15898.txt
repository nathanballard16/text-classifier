Retired bank official booked for rape of married woman

Ludhiana: The police have booked on Saturday the former senior manager of a bank for sexually assaulting a married woman. It is alleged that the accused took the woman to Hyderabad on the pretext of sending her abroad, where he sexually assaulted her for 14 days after giving her cold drinks, juices, and eatables laced with sedatives. After reaching home, the woman lodged an FIR against the accused.

The 32-year-old woman stated that her father-in-law had worked as a guard of the same bank in which the accused was senior manager. The accused would often visit their house, and once, he told them his daughters were settled in Canada and USA, and he could help her in going abroad.

She alleged that on July 22, he took her along, stating that they had to meet a travel agent. The accused took her to his house, where he gave her a soft drink laced with a sedative, after which she fell unconscious. When she gained some consciousness, she found herself locked in a room. The manager told her they were in Hyderabad. She stated that in Hyderabad too, he raped her after giving her sedatives.

The complainant added that on August 5, when the accused had gone somewhere, she found Rs1,100 in the room. Taking the money, she somehow managed to escape from there, and boarded a train to reach Delhi. At Delhi railway station, she borrowed someone’s phone and called her husband, who took her back home.
