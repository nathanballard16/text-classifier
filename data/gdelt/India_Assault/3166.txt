18-yr-old UNSC list reconfirms Pakistan as JeM's base

Putting all speculations to rest, India's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Syed Akbaruddin shared a UN Security Council list dating back to 2001 confirming terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed's location as Pakistan.

"May I jog your memories? To all friends who think that @UN Security Council does not know where the Jaish-e-Mohammed is located, my humble submission is that issue was settled way back in 2001," Akbaruddin tweeted.

JeM, which claimed responsibility for the recent Pulwama terror attack, has been listed as an associated entity of deceased terror mastermind Osama bin Laden in the list.

The October 19, 2001 statement brings attention to paragraph 8 (c) of resolution 1333 (2000) which calls on all states to freeze funds and other financial assets of designated entities, connected to Laden, on the list, in a bid to completely block funding to Laden, who had claimed responsibility for the ghastly 9/11 attacks in the United States.

This comes after the Pakistan Army held a press conference, where its spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor dismissed his country's involvement in the attack, despite Pakistan-based JeM's claim of responsibility.

India has asserted that since JeM, which is based in Pakistan, had itself claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack, there was no more evidence required.

The United States had, immediately after the attack, called for Pakistan to stop providing support and a safe haven to terrorist organisations in their country, further cementing their stand against terrorism.

Washington, along with other countries, extended support to India in the wake of the February 14 attack which claimed the lives of over 40 CRPF personnel in Jammu and Kashmir.
