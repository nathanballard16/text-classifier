Indian Prime Minister Modi’s Victory Drums Up ‘Nationalistic Fervor’

"All the polls were definitely predicting this victory," Loomba told Loud & Clear hosts John Kiriakou and Walter Smolarek.

"There were a lot of people who doubted these polls, because not only can polls be wrong in a country like India where it's not a two-party system, where regional politics are very complicated and volatile, and there are lots of local alliances. There were many people who did not agree with the predictions. Personally, I saw no reason to disagree because it seemed to be that that was the way the wind was blowing. The victory has been more decisive than we imagined, so in that sense, they have even exceeded what the polls were predicting. It's a moment of reckoning for people in India to recognize what happened," she added.

The BJP campaign focused heavily on nationalistic themes, especially after the fighting in Kashmir intensified in the middle of the election process, according to Smolarek.
