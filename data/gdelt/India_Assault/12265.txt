HC disposes plea of ex-DUSU prez Tuseed against disqualification

Former DUSU president Rocky Tuseed Wednesday told the Delhi High Court that he does not wish to press his appeal against a single judge order upholding the Delhi University's decision to disqualify his candidature in 2017.

Tuseed's counsel submitted that much water has flown under the bridge ever since passing of that judgment in September 2017 and his tenure to the post of the President of DUSU had expired in September last year.

Taking into consideration the statement, a bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Asha Menon disposed of Tuseed's appeal.

Tuseed was disqualified on September 6, 2017 for not disclosing in his nomination form for Delhi University Student Union (DUSU) polls that disciplinary action was taken against him for assaulting a student in his college.

In his appeal against the July 20, 2018 order, the student leader had claimed that the reasons given by the single judge for upholding his disqualification were different from that given by the DU, which has denied it.

The single judge had said that Tuseed could not have contested the election as he had violated the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations by not disclosing that he had faced disciplinary action of being barred from entering college campus.

The court had in its 2017 order had also noted that the Lyngdoh Committee recommendations "clearly stipulate if a candidate had faced disciplinary action, the same would be a non-eligibility for such a student to stand in the election".

"The affidavit given by the petitioner (Tuseed) that he was not subject to any disciplinary action by the university authorities was not correct," it had said and had dismissed Tuseed's plea against his disqualification.
