Shatrughan Sinha Joins Yashwant Sinha's Rashtra Manch

New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and MP from Patna Saheb Shatrughan Sinha on Tuesday joined a new political forum started by former Union Minister and another disgruntled BJP leader Yashwant Sinha saying since he had no voice in his own party, he would be able to speak through this platform to launch a new movement against the Modi government at the Center.

The actor-turned-politician, along with a number of other leaders from various parties including Pawan Verma of Janata Dal – U, Renuka Chowdhary of Congress, Dinesh Trivedi of Trinamool Congress, Majid Memon of Nationalist Congress Party, Sanjay Singh of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), and former Gujarat Chief Minister Suresh Mehta joined a new political action committee (PAC) called 'Rashtra Manch' launched by Yashwant Sinha who has emerged as the most vociferous critic of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his team at the Center.

"My own party has refused to give me a platform to speak my mind and that is why I have chosen this forum started by Yashwant ji whom I respect a lot. However, my decision to join Rashtra Manch should not be seen as anti-party activities as it is in the interest of the nation," the Patna Saheb MP said.

Yashwant Sinha, former Central Finance Minister, said that situation in India was same today that was exactly 70 years ago when Mahatma Gandhi was assassinated by a Hindu fanatic.

"Our democratic institutions are under attack today and party leaders are living in a constant state of fear. However, we are not afraid of anyone," he said adding under the Modi administration, farmers across the nation had been reduced to the status of beggars as the government cooked up numbers and data to present a rosy picture of the country.

Rashtra Manch is not an outfit but a national movement and the first item on our agenda is to take up the cause of the farmers," the octogenarian leader said.
