Pakistan Minister Sheikh Rashid, who threatened India to 'gouge out eyes', thrashed in London

New Delhi:

Pakistan Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmad was allegedly assaulted by two workers of Pakistan People’s Party in London for using abusive language against party leader Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. The attack took place when Rashid, chief of the Awami Muslim League (AML), came out of his hotel in London to attend an awards ceremony. Shiekh was pelted with eggs and even thrashed by PPP workers, says report.

In the aftermath of the incident, two PPP officials — Asif Ali Khan and Samah Namaz — released a statement claiming responsibility for the attack on Rahid Sheikh.

“Sheikh Rashid has been using abusive and bad language during interviews against our Chairman Mr Bilawal Bhutto Zardari. He should be thankful we only used eggs as a British way of dealing with such uncivilised politician. He started this we ended it”, quoted Pakistani news channel Geo TV Asif Ali Khan and Samah Namaz as saying.

After the statement was released, Awami Muslim League UK President Saleem Sheikh said that he would seek Rashid's permission and then lodge a police case against the assaulters.

Sheikh Rahid has been hogging limelight for making anti-India statements. Just after the dastardly attack in Pulwama, Sheikh Rashid Ahmad had threatened India with dire consequences 'if anyone tried to look at the Islamic nation'. "Imran Khan has sent out a clear message. If anyone tries to look at Pakistan with evil in their minds, their eyes will be gouged out. (Neither will birds chirp, nor will bells ring at the temples after that)," Sheikh Rashid Ahmad said in a video address while speaking on Pulwama terror attack.
