Rajasthan: Police Head Constable Beaten to Death

New Delhi: In yet another case of mob violence, a police head constable was on Saturday beaten to death in Rajasthan’s Rajsamand district.

Abdul Gani, who was posted at the Bhim Police Station, had gone to Hamela ki Ber village while investigating a case. He was probing a land dispute case, when a mob attacked him after an argument over encroachment.

“He was returning from the village on his motorcycle when some 4-5 unidentified persons attacked him with sticks,” superintendent of police Bhuvan Bhushan told PTI.

Gani sustained grievous injuries in the assault. He was rushed to a hospital in the Bhim area, where he succumbed to injuries, the officer said.

A postmortem will be conducted on Sunday, police said and adding that efforts were being made to identify those involved.

Udaipur range IG Binita Thakur, however denied it was a case of mob lynching. “The incident did not take place in the village but when the cop had reached the main road, he was attacked. It appears that 3 or 4 people attacked him,” he said.

Several incidents of mob lynching have been reported in Rajasthan, most notably that of Pehlu Khan and Rakhbar Khan. Another man, Afrazul Khan, was hacked to death on video by Shambhulal Regar in the Rajsamand district.

The UP Law Commission recently submitted a report to the state government, recommending that a special legislation is required to tackle rising incidents of mob violence. The report also noted that police officers were also becoming a target of mob violence. The Supreme Court has also noted that “mobocracy cannot be allowed in democracy” and suggested remedial and punitive measures to tackle the problem.
