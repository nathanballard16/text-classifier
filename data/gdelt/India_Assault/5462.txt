Pak Hindu MNA to table resolution for ending abduction of Hindu girls

Amritsar: A Hindu parliamentarian of Imran Khan’s Pakistan Therek-e-Insaaf (PTI ), Ramesh Kumar Vankwani, has drafted a five-point resolution seeking to end the kidnapping of Hindu girls and forced conversions, which he is likely to table in the next session of Pakistan’s national assembly. He also demanded strict action against controversial Muslim preachers Main Mithu Bharchoondi and Pir Ayub Jan Sirhandi for their alleged role in the forced conversion of Hindu girls.

On Sunday, Vankwani told TOI that through the resolution he has demanded that the unfortunate incidents of kidnappings and forced conversions must be condemned unanimously by all the members of parliament.

According to him, one of the points in the resolution included taking strict action against controversial religious ‘elements’, including Mian Mithu Bharchoondi and Pir Ayub Jan Sirhindi, for their alleged role in supporting such inhuman practice.

“I have asked the parliament to explore why only young girls are converting religion,” said Vankwani, adding that those who were preaching hate in the name of religion must be handled like banned religious organisations.

“The bill against forced conversions, which was unanimously passed by Sindh Assembly in 2016 and then reverted due to pressure of extremist elements, must be resurrected and passed in the assembly on priority basis,” he said.

He informed that the Senate Functional Committee on Human Rights had already unanimously approved the draft bill to amend the Child Marriage Restraint Act raising the minimum age of marriage to 18 years.

“The bill must be passed in national assembly as soon as possible and implemented throughout the country in letter and spirit” said Vankwani.
