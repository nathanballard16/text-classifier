NEW DELHI: Amid international pressure to act after a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber killed 40 CRPF jawans in Jammua and Kashmir's Pulwama, Pakistan has detained at least 44 members of banned outfits, including a brother of JeM chief Masood Azhar. Mufti Abdur Rauf, brother of Azhar, and Hammad Azhar are among those detained during the crackdown, PTI quoted Shehryar Khan Afridi, Pakistan's Minister of State for Interior, as saying at a press conference. He said a dossier shared by India with Pakistan last week also contained names of Mufti Abdur Rauf and Hammad Azhar. He, however, said the action was not taken due to any pressure.
