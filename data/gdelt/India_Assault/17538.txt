Gujarat: Engineer kills fiancée over suspicion of affair

Spot in Porbandar from where the half-burnt body of Reema Joshi was recovered

RAJKOT: Porbandar’s special operations group (SGO) cracked the case of a woman’s half-burnt body that was found buried in sand.

SOG sleuths said that the woman was identified as Reema Joshi and the brutal murder was executed by her fiancé Nirav Thanki who suspected her of having an affair with someone else. On Saturday night, police arrested Thanki (28) who had strangled Joshi, set her body ablaze after dousing it with petrol and buried her in the sand near the bushes in Indiranagar locality on Wednesday evening.

Thanki is an electrical engineer who used to work in a cement factory in Porbandar.

During his interrogation, Thanki told the cops that he had concocted a story to show Joshi as an already married woman and had sent an sms to her cousin Nidhi from her number. The sms read: “Two years ago, I got married to a youth of my choice. Now, I will not return home. You people are dead for me and I am dead for you.”

“Thanki said that he had created a fictitious husband of Joshi and had sent the sms on her behalf to mislead the police. We zeroed in on Thanki as a prime suspect in the case after his two-wheeler was spotted in the footages of CCTV installed near Joshi’s house in Khodiyar Society,” said H C Gohel, sub-inspector with Porbandar special operation group. “We also found that Joshi had a telephonic conversation with Thanki on the day of the crime. Thanki confessed to the crime and said that he suspected Joshi of having an affair as she used to remain online on social media throughout the nights,” said Gohel.
