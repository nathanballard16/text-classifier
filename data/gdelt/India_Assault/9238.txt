Minority leader Monirul Islam offers to resign from BJP, six days after ditching TMC

Follow us on Image Source : FILE/PTI Monirul Islam, the MLA from South Bengal’s Birbhum district, has allegedly been involved in several incidents of torture and atrocities on political rivals.

Monirul Islam, who ditched Mamata Banerjee to join the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) last week, has offered to resign from the saffron party after several leaders expressed objection to his induction.

The BJP West Bengal unit is divided over Monirul Islam's induction into the party, as a section feels that people like him will bring bad repute to it in the state, where the party was trying to oust the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government.

Monirul Islam, the MLA from South Bengal’s Birbhum district, has allegedly been involved in several incidents of torture and atrocities on political rivals.

Many senior BJP leaders and activists have openly questioned and protested the induction of Monirul Islam who, along with a few other TMC leaders, joined the BJP in New Delhi recently.

Since his joining the party, several BJP leaders of Birbhum have staged a protest rally against Monirul and had urged the party leadership to remove him from the party. The BJP earlier projected the decision of the TMC’s Muslim MLA to join the party as a vindication of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwash.

To this end, Monirul Islam has expressed his desire to resign from the party, senior BJP leader Mukul Roy said, adding the party would take a call regarding it.
