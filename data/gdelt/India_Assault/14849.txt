Gas processing innovations spur increased deployments, including role in power generation mix

SINGAPORE--(Antara/BUSINESS WIRE)-- LNG technologies, such as floating LNG (FLNG) innovations, driven by its shorter construction lead times and lower capital investment costs, are increasingly becoming a viable option for increased gas deployments. FLNG helps mitigate siting constraints that shore-based infrastructure may face.At the same time, the continued need for a balanced power generation portfolio as well as the need to address energy security and environmental concerns are driving rapid growth in the gas industry.To support this, Black & Veatch is enhancing its ability to provide clients with FLNG expertise that offers cost and operational efficiencies.“As countries seek alternatives to baseload feedstock for power generation and, in some instances the need to address heavily subsidized fuel oil-based generation, gas-fired generation offers a reliable alternative that helps create a more balanced energy portfolio. Floating liquified natural gas (FLNG) technologies provide LNG exporters and importers flexible, mobile liquefaction and regasification infrastructure,” says Jim Schnieders, Executive Vice President and Managing Director, Asia & Floating Offshore Solutions – Oil & Gas.Black & Veatch is a global leader in FLNG, with multiple first-of-a-kind projects, now fully performance-tested and operational. These include:•The world’s first barge-based floating liquefaction unit deployed offshore Argentina•First-of-a-kind conversion of an LNG carrier to a FLNG vessel, deployed offshore Cameroon•India’s first floating storage and regasification (FSRU) terminal projectThe company’s role encompasses front end engineering design - and detailed design - through to full engineering, procurement, construction, installation and commissioning (EPCIC) solutions. These projects span both tanker and barge-based LNG export and import infrastructure operating around the world.In his new role, Schnieders will lead Black & Veatch’s global Floating Offshore Solutions team, and the oil & gas team in Asia. He takes over the roles from Bob Germinder who retired after a 33-year well-respected career at Black & Veatch. Under Germinder’s leadership, the world’s first barge-based floating liquefaction unit successfully completed performance testing in Nantong, China and will be based in Argentina. It was the first time in history, LNG had been produced onboard a floating facility. In addition, another FLNG vessel went into commercial operation in Cameroon, and a third has begun development, each relying on Black & Veatch’s PRICO® technology and engineering and procurement capabilities.•As a 29-year Black & Veatch veteran, Schnieders spent 21 years working globally, three years in North Africa and Europe and 18 years in Asia. Since 2015, he has overseen the highly complex Power EPC Asia business, successfully building long-term relationships with clients, vendors and partners from multiple countries. Schnieders was responsible for EPC project pursuit and execution for clients in Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Singapore, Australia and New Zealand. Schnieders is based in Kansas City.•Click here to download a photo of Schnieders •Black & Veatch's proprietary PRICO® technology is modular and scalable and can be applied to multiple types of FLNG configurations. PRICO® increases the speed and efficiency with which natural gas can be delivered to market and demonstrates the forward thinking and innovation that are spearheading the FLNG industry.•Black & Veatch's patented PRICO®technology has successfully completed its Guaranteed Performance Test aboard Exmar’s Tango FLNG , the world’s first barge-based floating liquefaction unit.•Black & Veatch received a full notice to proceed on work to jointly outfit a Golar LNG owned LNG carrier, Gimi, with Black & Veatch’s patented PRICO® liquefaction technology •Swan LNG has awarded Black & Veatch the engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) contract to deliver the jetty topside and onshore LNG facilities for the 5 million metric tonnes per annum (MMTPA) plant at Jafrabad in Gujarat.•IOCL awarded a Black & Veatch-led consortium the contract for a new LNG receiving terminal at Ennore. The terminal will be the first-of-its-kind on India’s east coast , with a send-out capacity of five million tonnes.Black & Veatch is an employee-owned, global leader in building critical human infrastructure in Energy, Water, Telecommunications and Government Services.
