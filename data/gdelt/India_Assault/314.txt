Three men who claimed they had committed a murder kidnapped an engineers in his car and freed him after driving about 50 km in Meerut after making him fill up the petrol tank.

The incident occurred on Sunday night in Vasundhara locality of Ghaziabad but came to light on Monday evening.

When he returned to his car, he was overpowered by the three and dumped on the rear seat.

After driving for about 20 km, near Modi Nagar, the criminals filled up petrol and asked the man to pay, which he did.

They then proceeded towards Meerut and left him at Partapur area on the Meerut bypass and drove away with his car.

He went to the Partapur police station but they refused to register his case and asked to report the matter to the police in Indirapuram where he was kidnapped.

"We have registered a case," said Superintendent of Police Shlok Kumar.

The engineer told the police that the criminals claimed they had committed a murder and so needed a car to escape. "But they were polite," the victim added.
