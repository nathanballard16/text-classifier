The mother of the rape survivor has alleged that the accident is a conspiracy to wipe out her family.

An FIR has been registered against BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, his brother and eight others in connection with Unnao rape case victim`s accident in Raebareli.

In the Sunday accident, a car carrying the 19-year-old woman, who has accused BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar of rape, her family and lawyer was hit by a speeding truck in Rae Bareli.

While her two family members were killed in the accident, she and her lawyer were critically injured.

Meanwhile, Congress has asked the Supreme Court to take suo moto cognizance of the matter and intervene. The Opposition party accused the Uttar Pradesh government of inaction in the case.

"We demand that the Supreme Court takes note of the incident involving the Unnao rape victim. The `miscarriage of justice` taking place... and the voice of victims being suppressed will stop only when the apex court directly intervenes and takes note of the entire inquiry into the Unnao rape case," he said.

The demand came on a day when the Uttar Pradesh government said it is ready to order a CBI probe into the road accident in Rae Bareli. The mother of the rape survivor has alleged that the accident is a conspiracy to wipe out her family.
