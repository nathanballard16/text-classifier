Firstpost to launch print edition on January 26

Speaking to afaqs!, Rahul Kansal - business head, print and brand advisor, Network18, says, "This is not an attempt to ambush or overcome the daily newspapers. There is a big gap in the market which brand Firstpost can bridge. There is a market for high-quality newspapers aiming at discerning audiences. The combination of online and newspaper will make it appear more robust and re-stage Firstpost overall. The intent is to turn the Firstpost brand into a multi-media brand."
