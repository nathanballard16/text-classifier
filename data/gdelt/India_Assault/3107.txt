Ahmedabad: The Gujarat Court in a recent judgment has refused to accept 'Main Tujhe Dekh Loonga' as an expression of criminal intimidation, communicating a threat of injury.

According to a report in the Times of India (TOI), the HC announced the judgment while hearing an FIR against a lawyer named Mohammad Mohsin Chhalotiya, who was imprisoned in 2017 for threatening cops by saying 'he would see all of them' and would drag them to High Court. The advocate was based from Prantij in Sabarkantha district of Gujarat.

Meanwhile, the TOI report further claimed that Justice AS Supehia in the order mentioned the threat must cause alarm in the mind of the victim. No such feature emerged in the present case.

In the incident that led to an FIR, Chhalotiya had gone to meet his client in the Prantij police station, where the police objected him to talk to his clients. Meanwhile, this led to a heated argument between the police and the lawyer. And the cops registered an FIR against him under the Sections 186, 189 and 506(1) of the Indian Penal Code, for obstructing a government officer from his duty.

However, the High Court quashed the FIR and signed the order on Wednesday. TOI report mentioned that, 'I will see you' cannot be considered as criminal intimidation. The TOI report mentioned that Chhalotiya's arrest was wrong on the part of the policemen to have interfered with the lawyer's functioning.
