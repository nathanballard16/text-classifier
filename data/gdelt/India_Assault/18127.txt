Manipur: MHRC takes up suo-moto in Thangal Market blast, recommends monetary relief to victims

Manipur Human Right Commission (MHRC) registered a case in connection with the bomb blast at Thangal Market in Imphal on November 5 leaving five police personnel and one civilian injured. The MHRC also sent recommendation to the Chief Secretary of Manipur to provide suitable monetary relief to the injured police personnel and civilian during the bomb attack.

“Even though the Commission’s primary responsibility is to make the state more particularly state police accountable for failing in their duty to protect the rights of citizens, but the Commission cannot be a silent spectator if human rights of innocent citizens including police personnel are being violated by an act of violence and disruptive acts. Life and liberty of every innocent person whether in the state police or a civilian, is a matter of human rights concern”, said Khaidem Mani chairman MHRC.

Mani also informed that the commission has called a detail report from DGP, Manipur by December 4, with regards to the blast.

On November 5, a powerful bomb was exploded at Thangal Bazar near Sani Mandir while police personnel were conducting a routine duty. As a result of the blast, five police personnel including a civilian sustained injury.

Meanwhile, Manipur state cabinet convened on Thursday has given its approval to provide Government job to the widow of a BSF constable, Ningombam Ningthouba, who died in a bomb blast at Koirengei on May 9, 2018.
