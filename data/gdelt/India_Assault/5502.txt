Mumbai: The husband of a Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) corporator was hacked to death in Maharashtra's Beed district by an angry mob which suspected him of helping in a kidnapping of a boy four months ago.

The case revolves around a 16-year-old boy who was allegedly kidnapped by some members of Shikalgar community in the Phule Nagar area. The boy was reportedly having an affair with a girl of the community.

The mob which included the mother of the kidnapped boy attacked Gaikward with swords, sickles and sticks on suspicion that he helped the Shikalgar community in the kidnapping. The boy's body was found a few days later. The Police had launched an investigation but no one has been arrested in the case so far, enraging the people and local residents.

Acting on the Gaikwad's lynching, Police have arrested 11 people, including two women. According to Inspector Balasaheb Pawar of Sambhajinagar police station, out of the 11 arrested five have been charged with murder.

"The mob, which included the mother of the kidnapped minor boy, attacked Mr Gaikwad suspecting he was helping the Shikalgar community members in the kidnapping case," Pawar said.
