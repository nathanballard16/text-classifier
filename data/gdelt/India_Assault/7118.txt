His family is not giving permission for autopsy before registration of FIR against the erring cops and announcement of compensation.Giving details of incident, Adv. Ansar Indori said: “Ramzan, resident of Mangrol in Baran district in the state, was convicted in a case in 1992 and awarded two years imprisonment. He got bail and moved the high court challenging the lower court order. When the high court upheld the lower court order, his bail was cancelled and he was sent to prison in 2018. He was sick. Some days back, his condition worsened. The jail sent him to district hospital for treatment, from there he was referred to Kota hospital in Kota district.

At the Kota hospital five days ago, some cops who were staying with him at the hospital assaulted him. They were drunk. They also hurled communal abuses at him. As he was already sick, after the beating his condition worsened and he died late Friday night.” Talking to India Tomorrow from Kota, a relative of Ramzan said that the family is not giving permission for autopsy. They are demanding registration of a case against the cops who allegedly assaulted him and compensation for the family.In a video believed to be shot at the hospital after the alleged assault some days ago, prisoner said: “3 policemen beat me with pipe. They were my guard and deployed by the police. They beat me 8-10 times with the pipe. They threatened to beat me more if spoke about it.”India Tomorrow
