Rajasthani minor abducted in Kerala: Three arrested, hunt on for main accused

Two days after a 15-year-old girl was allegedly abducted by a four-member gang from her house in Oachira in Kollam district, the police has managed to nab three accused in the case. Vipin Paykuzhya, a native of Valiyakulangara in Oachira, Pyari, a native of Payikkuzhi, and Ajayan, a native of Vallikavu, were arrested and remanded on Wednesday.

The search for the main accused, 19-year-old Mohammed Roshan, and the girl are still on. Roshan is the son of CPI Branch Secretary Navas, who had earlier told the media that his son should be punished if he had committed a crime.

Speaking to TNM, Arunraj NV, the Assistant Commissioner of Police, said, “We suspect that they (the girl and Roshan) are in Bengaluru. We have deployed a team of officers in the Karnataka city.”

In a statement to the police, the girl's father alleged that the accused beat him up and abducted his daughter. “There were bite marks on the father's hands,” the Superintendent of Police at the Oachira station told TNM.

The girl is reportedly the eldest of seven children, and her family is from Rajasthan. The family, who are potters by profession and have been residents of Oachira for the past two years, alleged that they have been harassed by the four accused for a long time.

The girl's parents filed a complaint with the police, following which an FIR was registered. According to reports, the gang broke into the house and took the girl away after beating up her father.

Earlier, several media reports claimed that the gang had reached Bengaluru, which hampered the police’s investigation.

“Several Malayalam newspapers reported that the gang had reached Bengaluru and that the police were tracking their mobile phones. Now we are unable to track their phones as they are switched off,” the SI of Oachira had told TNM. The police claim that they have been unable to trace the minor because of this.
