Kashmiris will collectively resist any assault on Articles 35-A, 370: JRL

In occupied Kashmir, the Joint Resistance Leadership has said that the Kashmiris will collectively resist any assault on Articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution that grant special status and rights to Jammu and Kashmir and its people.

The Joint Resistance Leadership comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik in a statement in Srinagar said that they had serious apprehensions that the Articles 35-A and 370 might be removed in a dramatic manner in the coming days because of the way authoritarian announcements were being made at night.

The JRL said that the ongoing escalation between Pakistan and India have once again confirmed to the world that unless the basic dispute of Kashmir was resolved, the world was in imminent danger that a nuclear war could flare-up anytime between the two nuclear neighbours.

It said the world has to wake up to this reality and pressurize India to talk with Pakistan and resolve the dispute to avert the danger of war.

Meanwhile, six people were killed and thirty-one injured when a bus fell into a deep gorge in Udhampur district, on Saturday.
