Alok Nath granted anticipatory bail by a Sessions court on rape charges

New Delhi:

Actor Alok Nath was granted anticipatory bail on Saturday after an FIR was registered against him by screenwriter and producer Vinta Nanda alleging rape 19 years after the incident.

The court directed him to not leave India without the court's permission.

Vinta Nanda, writer and producer of television serial Tara accused Nath, who was the lead actor in the show, of drugging and raping her. She shared her ordeal in a detailed FB post amidst the ongoing #MeToo movement.

A rape case was registered against Nath by the Mumbai Police on November 21 based on a complaint filed by the writer-producer who accused him, in a social media post, of raping her 19 years ago.

However, Nath refuted the allegations and filed a civil suit against the complainant, seeking Re 1 as damages for defaming him. Though Nanda did not name Nath in the post, the complainant referred to him as the actor who is known as the ‘most Sanskari person’.

Later, the Cine and TV Artists Association (CINTAA) also expelled the veteran actor from the association.

Alok Nath is popularly known for playing characters endorsing moral values or ‘sanskar’ in Bollywood films such as Maine Pyaar Kiya, Hum Aapke Hain Koun!, Hum Saath Saath Hain and Vivah.
