The Assam Police arrested 85 people and detained thousands of protesters on Saturday for their involvement in violent protests across the state.

Speaking to India Today TV, Director General of Police Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta said, "Two people died due to police firing, whereas 25 protesters have received injuries. 50 policemen have also received injuries."

Some policemen also received bullet injuries. Police said that some of the protesters even fired on police using rifles.

When asked if he suspects the involvement of any political group behind the violence, BJ Mahanta said, "We smell conspiracy behind this and we are investigating on this line."

Several police vehicles were set on fire in Guwahati and Dibrugarh by the protesters against the Citizenship Amendment Act.

Director General of Assam Police Mahanta said, "We failed to anticipate that the protesters will get so aggressive and that's why we were unable to curb the violent protests at early stage. However, later we came down heavily and it has been contained now."

On Saturday, curfew in Guwahati was relaxed from 9 am to 4 pm, whereas in Dibrugarh, curfew has been relaxed for six hours from 8 am till 2 pm.

The police are looking at the footage of violence across Assam and are in the process to identify the people involved in the violence and damaging public and private property across the state.

"Any person, who is found in any anti-social activity, will not be spared. We will take strict action," said Mahanta.
