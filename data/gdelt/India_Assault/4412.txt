Ahmedabad: Druggie teen stabs father, beats mother

The argument took a violent turn as the son began beating his mother and threw a stool at her. The son went over and threatened to kill his parents if they stopped him from doing drugs. The 43-year-old man overheard his son arguing with his mother, accusing her of hiding his drugs. However, on Wednesday, when he threatened them even in the hospital, they went to Meghaninagar police. They refused to lodge a police complaint, even as one of them lay on a hospital bed, fearing it would affect his future.
