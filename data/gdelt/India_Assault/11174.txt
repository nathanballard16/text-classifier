New Delhi: An Irish human rights lawyer who was jailed for abusing an Air India cabin crew after being refused to serve alcohol on a business flight, was found dead at her house in East Sussex, England. The incident happened last year when the deceased was onboard a flight from Mumbai to London.

The deceased was identified as 50-year-old Simone Burns, who was found dead on June 1 days after being released from prison. She was jailed in April last year for racially abusing and spitting at the flight attendants. The Telegraph UK reported that she was released from Bronzefield women's prison on license on May 20 and 13 days later she was found dead the foot of cliffs in East Sussex.

Reportedly, Burns was diagnosed with skin cancer 18 years ago due to which she underwent several surgeries and during her hearings she was waiting for a prosthetic nose. News agency ANI reported, a Sussex police spokesperson said that the body of a woman found at Beachy Head on June 1 has been identified as 50-year-old Simone Burns from Hove.

Officer added that the death is not being treated as suspicious and next of kin have been informed about it. Reportedly, the matter has been passed on to the East Sussex coroner's officer. Burns was filmed while she was hurling abuses at the attendant for not serving alcohol and the clip had gone viral on social media.

Reportedly, during her trial at Isleworth crown court in April, Burns's lawyers had said that she had no recollection of the incident and had received death threats online. However, she had admitted being drunk on an aircraft and the assault.
