You think Australian elections are big? In India, an eighth of the world's population has voted

The mass rallies held in searing heat – a trademark of India's electioneering – are something to behold. There's always a lively cast of political characters and a staggering array of parties. But it's the sheer scale that really sets this ballot apart. This year’s poll, which launched on April 11 and ends with the announcement of the result later today, has been the largest democratic exercise in history. About 900 million people are eligible to take part – that’s about one-eighth of the world’s population. The next-largest constituency, which elects the European Parliament, is less than half that size. Over the past five weeks, nearly 4 million election officials and millions more security personnel have managed 1 million polling stations during India’s seven-phase democratic marvel. About two-thirds of voters cast ballots, even though voting is not compulsory. And there were predictions that more women would vote than men for the first time in a general election. Indian nationals living in Australia were able to register as “overseas electors” but they could only cast a vote in the general election at a polling booth in India.

A simple first-past-the-post system is used to elect the 543 members of the Lok Sabha, the name for India’s lower house. (Most members of the 245-seat upper house, the Rajya Sabha, are elected by the parliaments of the 29 states and the seven union territories.) In Australia, an average 100,000 voters live in each federal electorate. In India the typical lower-house MP represents an average of about 1.6 million voters; Malakajgiri, near Hyderabad, boasted 3.182 million electors at the last election – that's just voters, not constituents. A party or coalition with a majority in the Lok Sabha will form the government. Cutouts of Modi before a rally in Kolkata. Credit:Alamy The many moods of Modi: will he prevail again? The election has been cast as a referendum on the incumbent Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. According to exit polls, it's a referendum he has won.

Five years ago Modi led the Bharatiya Janata Party (Indian People’s Party) and its allies to a historic victory. It was the first time in three decades that a single party had won an absolute majority. A gifted orator, Modi promised development and an end to corruption. He also appealed to the majority Hindu population with a brand of pro-Hindu nationalism. Modi’s humble beginnings have been an electoral asset in a nation where GDP per person is less than $2780 a year. Modi’s humble beginnings – his father owned a tea stall – have been an electoral asset in a nation where GDP per person is less than $US2000 a year ($A2780). “He’s got a very relatable story to tell and he’s told it brilliantly,” says Professor Robin Jeffrey, a leading India scholar at the National University of Singapore. Modi’s success has come despite a contentious political career. In 2002, when he was chief minister of Gujarat, hundreds of Muslims across the state died in riots. The rampage was in “retaliation” to the deaths of 59 Hindus killed in an attack. Modi has been accused of being slow to stop the bloodshed although he denies these allegations and none have ever been proved.

There have been missteps during his five-year tenure. A scheme to combat corruption by withdrawing all high-value bank notes from circulation overnight in 2016 caused huge disruption. The introduction of a goods and services tax also came at a political cost. While economic growth has been healthy, the rate of jobs growth has been lacklustre. Modi is the campaign. Without him the whole thing would fall apart. Critics also allege the BJP’s strident Hindu nationalism is dividing the nation and fraying its secular, democratic traditions. Dr Manisha Priyam, a Delhi-based political analyst, said Modi’s political narrative is different to when he won office in 2014. “He came to power with the promise of jobs and a pro-people development agenda but now he is mainly talking about national security and a place for India as a world power,” she says. “It has to be seen if people will forget the old promises.”

Modi, 68, remains a central figure in the BJPs re-election bid. “Modi is the campaign,” says Jeffrey. “Without him the whole thing would fall apart.” The BJP’s electoral pitch was set to be boosted by a dash of Bollywood – a big-budget biopic favourably depicting Modi’s life in politics was due to be released ahead of polling. But India’s election commission banned the movie during the election period amid claims it would serve as propaganda. Rahul Gandhi in New Delhi in March.

Gandhi’s political pedigree is unmatched: his father Rajiv, grandmother Indira and great-grandfather Jawaharlal Nehru were all prime ministers. His mother, Sonia, was a dominant figure in the Congress-led government that ruled between 2004 and 2014. The party was trounced at the last general election but its prospects appeared to improve late last year when the Congress beat incumbent BJP governments in a clutch of state elections.
