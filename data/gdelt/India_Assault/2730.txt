LeT considers IISc attacks one of its biggest failures on Indian soil: Hosur

MANGALURU: For the family of Munish Chandra Puri of IIT, Delhi, December 28, 2005 is a day they wish never came in their lives. However, for the Pakistan based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), it marked the singular biggest failure in their attempt to spread terror against their sworn enemy – India. The incident was the LeT attack on IISc, Bengaluru that left Puri dead and four others injured as they were leaving the campus after a conference.So flustered was LeT by the failure of this attack that it was discussed threadbare at the their ‘classroom’ back home in Pakistan with help of a powerpoint presentation in how not to muck up a carefully researched terror attack, noted Gopal B Hosur, former state intelligence chief. And revealing the stark truth of this self-acknowledged ‘LeT’ failure was none other than one of the students present at this classroom – Ajmal Kasab.It was personal face time that Mumbai ATS provided him with Kasab did this fact come out, said Hosur, also city’s first city police chief in a leadership talk on role of intelligence in good governance he delivered at NITK, Surathkal on Monday. “Kasab was conversant with IISc attack, which gave rise to suspicions in my mind of his involvement. It is when I probed deeper during the course of 3-hour interrogation did this fact become clear,” he said.It was LeTs brief to target educational institutions of repute across India and IISc was chosen after a careful recce as it presented a soft target with handful of unarmed security guards, Hosur was appointed investigating officer in to the incident by then Bengaluru city police chief Ajai Kumar Singh, said. The LeT has used two indoctrinated youths to carry out the recce in the guise of students who had enrolled in Brindavan College, he said.Abu Hamza, mid-level LeT operative who carried out IISc attack and is still at large missed making a bigger ‘statement’ thanks to auto driver who refused to break traffic rules and Bengaluru traffic that delayed him by further 20-minutes in reaching Tata auditorium, Hosur said a dud Afghanistani hand-grenade too compounded Hamza’s woes. It was providence that saw just one die after Hamza sprayed 62 bullets from his assault rifle , he noted.
