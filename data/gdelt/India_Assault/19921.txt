After Delhi govt, Home Ministry rejects Nirbhaya rapist's mercy plea

The Union Home Ministry has sent President Ram Nath Kovind the Delhi government's recommendation rejecting the mercy plea of Vinay Sharma, one of the convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang rape case.

Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal sent the file rejecting the mercy plea to the Home Ministry earlier this week.

The file has now been forwarded to the President for his final decision.

An unnamed official quoted by PTI said the Home Ministry had commented in the file.

Meanwhile, President Kovind has said rape convicts under the POCSO Act shouldn't have the right to file mercy petitions.

He was speaking at an event in Sirohi, Rajasthan.

In December 2012, a 23-year-old paramedic student now known as Nirbhaya was brutally gangraped in a moving bus in Delhi: a crime that sparked nationwide fury.

Nirbhaya later died of her injuries.

The rejection of Vinay Sharma's mercy plea comes on a day when a large section of the public has welcomed the killing of four alleged rapists in what the police say was an encounter.

Among those who lauded the police where Nirbhaya's parents, Badrinath Singh and Asha Devi.
