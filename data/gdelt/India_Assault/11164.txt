Opinion : Rahul Gandhi has quit. But India’s Congress Party needs a mutiny to survive.

Yes, the younger Pilot is technically also a “dynast” in the way that Gandhi is. But dynasty alone doesn’t explain the near-demise of the Congress. In fact, data shows that 30 percent of India’s new parliamentarians are from political families — and that the ruling BJP has a high percentage of dynasts in its ranks, too. Indians appear to have pushed back against Gandhi because he and his family don’t come across as having earned the privilege. By contrast, Pilot left his cushy urban life in Delhi and worked at the grass-roots level in the state of Rajasthan. Even after the Congress failed to do well in the state, where he is deputy chief minister, he was quick to return to the campaign trail and interact with voters.
