Police clueless about girl’s whereabouts

Rajasthan girl was abducted on Monday night

It has been four days since the alleged abduction of a nomadic Rajasthan girl from Oachira, but the police are still clueless about her whereabouts.

The 15-year-old went missing Monday night and according to a complaint filed by her parents, she was forcibly taken from their home by a four-member gang. While the police have arrested three persons in connection with the case, the first accused, Muhammad Roshan, 19, and the girl remain untraceable.

Reportedly, the girl was having an affair with Roshan and they had attempted to elope earlier as well. Ananthu, 20; Bipin, 18; and Pyari, 19;, who were part of the gang who allegedly assaulted the girl's parents and kidnapped her, have been remanded in judicial custody.

Lookout notice

“According to their statement, Roshan and the girl left for Bengaluru by train on Monday night. We have issued a look out notice for them and another team has gone to Rajasthan since the girl has relatives there,” said B. Sabu, Oachira Sub Inspector.

Pyari, who was wanted in another POCSO case, will be booked under Kerala Anti-Social Activities Prevention Act (KAPA).

Since Roshan’s father is a local CPI leader, the Congress has alleged that the police was trying to sabotage the case and save the culprit.

Hunger stir

Kollam DCC president Bindu Krishna began a 24-hour hunger strike in front of the girl’s home on Friday demanding justice for the family.

Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala who inaugurated the strike said that the leaders of the ruling front and their children had thrown Kerala into anarchy. “ The police, a force which should be impartial, is being controlled by the ruling front,” he said.

Meanwhile, Roshan’s father said that he will not protect his son if proven guilty.
