Mentally challenged girl sexually abused by two; cops arrest one

A mentally challenged minor was allegedly sexually assaulted multiple times by two people in Wanawadi. The Pune police have arrested one person in the case, while the other is absconding.



The minor, a 17-year-old girl, lives with her parents. She is nine months pregnant and has been admitted to Sassoon General Hospitals for delivery. The accused has been identified as Prakash Ahir of Dalvinagar, BT Kawade Road and Anil Hafse of Baramati. Ahir was arrested from his residence on Saturday.



According to complaint registered by the minor’s parents, the first series of incidents took place in from April 2017 to November 2017 and later from April 2019 to May 2019.



Sub-inspector Jyotsana Patil said, “The victim was not mentally challenged when she first met the accused. They were in a relationship. She met with an accident and suffered from injuries on the head that resulted in instability. The second accused met her after the mishap. We are yet to investigate his role.”



She added that a month after the minor delivers the baby, a DNA test will be performed to identify the father.



Cops have said that Ahir had met her in various parts on the city, where she was assaulted. Hafse sexually abused her Baramati and even asked her to keep mum about it. The incident only came to light when her parents discovered about the pregnancy.



Police have booked the accused for rape under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code.
