A 33-year-old aspiring filmmaker along with his partner were held on Thursday for abducting a toddler from Shenoy Nagar of Chennai, Tamil Nadu.

Kalimullah, the kidnapper, watched movies online in order to learn how to kidnap a child, police said.

Kalimullah browsed through multiple websites for over a week before committing the crime, police added.

Kalimullah managed to kidnap a three-year-old girl, Anwika and asked for a ransom of Rs 60 lakh in order to produce a film.

The accused is a graduate who has acted in various movies and, is also a model.

After his failure in the film industry, Kalimullah took up a job at a restaurant in Tirumangalam town of Madurai District, Tamil Nadu.

At the restaurant, he befriended Ambika, aged 24, and sought her help in order to kidnap Anwika.

The incident came to light after Ambika kidnapped the girl after the school van dropped the child outside her home.

After that, the kidnappers called the parents and asked for a ransom of Rs 60 lakh from the parents.

After the mother lodged a complaint at the Aminjikarai police station, seven special teams were formed.

Police examined the CCTV footage from the locality which showed that Ambika, one of the kidnappers, boarded a red Tata Sumo with the child.

Police was able to intercept their vehicle near Redhills, media reports said.
