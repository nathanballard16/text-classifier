The same man had registered another case against Amantullah Khan over a separate incident.

The Delhi Police on Friday filed a chargesheet in a 2018 case against Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Amanatullah Khan.

On October 10, 2018, a man had lodged an FIR against the AAP MLA under several sections at New Delhi's Hazrat Nizamuddin police station for assaulting and threatening him at a wedding.

The Delhi Police in its investigation found that on the day, Amanatullah Khan was present at the wedding and the man was beaten up.

The victim had first lodged an FIR at Jamia Nagar police station but Amanatullah Khan allegedly threatened him to withdraw the case.

According to the report, a clash was reported in Kaka Nagar on the same date to Nizamuddin police station.

The investigation revealed that clash broke out at the house in Kaka Nagar where the wedding was taking place. It was learned that the man, SM Faizan, told the police in his complaint that he had gone to Kaka Nagar to attend the wedding of his friend's sister.

The same man had registered another case against Amantullah Khan over a separate incident.

When police found that the legislator had in fact threatened the victim to withdraw the case, they submitted the chargesheet to the court.
