Srinagar

Majlis Ittehad-e-Millat Jammu and Kashmir comprising of major religious organizations of Jammu and Kashmir, namely Jama’at-e-Islami Jammu and Kashmir, Jamiat Ahl-e-Hadees, Tableeg-ul-Islam, Anjuman-e-Sharie Shean, Himayat-ul-Islam, Islami Study Circle, Dawat-ul-Haq Tral, and others, headed by Mufti Azam Mufti Nasir-ul-Islam as President, has vehemently denounced the attacks and assault on Jammu Muslims and Kashmiris outside.

The spokesman in a statement said that attacks and destruction of properties including dozens of vehicles torched in broad daylight in presence of police reminds the gory dreadful scenes of 1947 when thousands of innocent Muslims were massacred.

The spokesman accused the police and administration of supporting the miscreants to assault the people of Kashmir. “The stone throwers were given full shelter while targeting the properties of Muslims in different areas throughout Jammu and at some places, the Masajid too were targeted.

Majlis Ittehad-e-Millat J&K also condemns the attacks on Kashmiri students and traders in various cities in North India by the communalist elements in which a number of Kashmiris got injured. Moreover, Majlis supports the joint protest program of the traders, transporters and employees federations and appeals the masses to maintain communal harmony at all costs being the hallmark of the teachings of Islam.
