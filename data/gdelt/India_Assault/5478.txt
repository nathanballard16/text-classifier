A woman was allegedly gang-raped by three members of staff at an Indian hospital while she was being treated in intensive care.

The woman's husband alleged she was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of the hospital in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh, where she was given an injection and sedated.

She was then gang-raped by three men, her husband told police, according to the New Indian Express.
