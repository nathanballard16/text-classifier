Teams to check stone pelting at Vande Bharat

Allahabad: Railways on Wednesday set up special teams comprising GRP and RPF personnel to track the miscreants pelting stones at India’s first premium class semi-high speed train Vande Bharat. Comprising of RPF and GRP personnel, these teams would roam in civvies and mingle with the rural folk in suspected villages. At the police station level, each team would have a one sub-inspector, two head constables and four constables. But if one repeats the crime, the action would be stringent,” he said.“The teams are being set up both at thana and at police outpost level. Since we deployed two teams, no incident was reported on Wednesday and Friday,” he said.Since introduction, this semi-high speed train has been subjected to stone pelting time and again.Be it at the time of trial run at Firozabad on March 1, Fatehpur on March 12 or the recent incident of March 17 at Prempur near Kanpur, there have been repeated incidents of stone being thrown at the train.
