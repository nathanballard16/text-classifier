There is a snow leopard in the picture. Can you spot it?

An image of a snow leopard has left many baffled. Wondering why? For that, you will have to take a look at this photograph captured by wildlife photographer Saurabh Desai that he shared on his Instagram profile.

Confused why we are showing you an image of a rocky mountain filled with patches of snow? Well, look closer.

If you look closer at the image, you’ll notice a magnificent well-camouflaged snow leopard sitting/lying on the cliff.

Desai captured the animal during his visit to the Himalayan mountain range in North India. The photographer was visiting Kibber Village, the highest village in the world, to catch a glimpse of a snow leopard. About 8 km away from the village, he spotted this big cat.

Native to the mountain ranges of Central and South Asia, snow leopards use their camouflaging skills to ambush their prey. They have also earned the title of “ghosts of the mountains”.
