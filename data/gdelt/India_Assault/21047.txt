Congress accuses Modi govt of diverting public attention

"You (referring to Modi government) are disrupting Parliament from working in order to divert the public attention anarchy spread in the country. You must know that women of this country want a decisive action against rape," Surjewala tweeted.

New Delhi, Dec 13 (IANS) Amid the ruckus over Congress leader Rahul Gandhi's 'rape remark', Congress party national spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala accused the Narendra Modi-led Central government of diverting the public attention from the "ongoing unrest in the country".

"Rape in India is unacceptable. Listen to your own statement regarding rape. If this (statement) is right then you should apologise first," he wrote.

The Congress spokeperson also tagged a video in which the Prime Minister was speaking on the same issue that no policy had been made to stop crime against women saying "they made Delhi a rape capital. They have no policy to stop such crimes".

The Bharatiya Janata Party MPs on Friday demanded an apology from Rahul Gandhi in Parliament over his remark on the most heinous crime against women.

Gandhi took a jibe at the PM's pet project 'Make in India and said: "Earlier, it was 'Make in India' but now it is 'rape in India'..." in Jharkhand during a rally.
