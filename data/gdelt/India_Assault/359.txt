The 20-year-old woman, who has not been identified, was left in critical condition following the attack which began on December 30 in the eastern state of Odisha.

She told officers that the abuse started when a man claiming to be friends with her brother approached her at a station as she waited for a train.

A 20-year-old engineering student said she was lured away from this station by a man claiming to be friends with her brother before being taken to a house where she was gang raped

When she got off the train the man jumped her and dragged her to a nearby house, where the attack took place.

One the woman was inside the house, the man was joined by another five men and the group took it in turns to abuse her over the next 48 hours, police said.
