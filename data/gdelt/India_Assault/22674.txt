Headmistress arrested for beating 9-yr-old student in Odisha

Kendrapada: The headmistress of a government-run primary school in Odisha’s Jagatsinghpur district was arrested on Monday for allegedly assaulting a Class III student for playing during class hours.

The headmistress has been identified by police as Lina Nanda of Balitutha Primary School at Balitutha village under Kujang police station. She allegedly beat up nine-year-old Barsha with a wooden stick on Saturday.

A day after the incident, Barsha ’s father John Swain, lodged an FIR accusing Nanda of brutally assaulting his daughter in school. “Following the complaint, we arrested the headmistress under Sections 294 (obscene act), 325 (voluntarily causing grievous hurt) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and under various sections of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act as the girl student sustained injuries on her hand, fingers and back,” Dilip Kumar Sahoo, the inspector-in-charge of Kujang police station, said.

He added that Nanda was produced in a court at Kujang on Monday. The court rejected her bail application and remanded her to jail custody. The student is now undergoing treatment in a community health centre in Kujang and doctors attending to her said her condition is stable, Sahoo said.

The incident is a violation of an 18 -year-old Supreme Court order to state governments to ban corporal punishment. “Children face physical and emotional trauma in schools owing to corporal punishment. This affects their studies and many of them stop attending school altogether owing to it,” Biraja Pati, a child rights activist of Kendrapada, said.

On being contacted, district education officer Prativa Manjari Das, said, “I have asked the block education officer of Earasama to submit a report after inquiring into the matter. We will initiate proper action once the report comes.”
