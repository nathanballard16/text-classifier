Bilkis Bano case: Supreme Court orders Gujarat govt to pay compensation, provide job within two weeks

The Supreme Court on Monday ordered Gujarat government to pay compensation and provide job to Bilkis Bano within two weeks.

In April this year, the Court had awarded a compensation of Rs 50 lakh to Bilkis Bano, who was gangraped in Randhikpur village in Dahod district of Gujarat during the post-Godhra riots. The court had also directed the Gujarat Government to provide her a government job and accommodation as per rules.

Bilkis Yakub Rasool was 19-year-old and pregnant when she was gangraped during the 2002 Gujarat riots.



Gujarat government council told the bench on Monday that they want the April order to be reviewed. The court, however, asked the government to pay the compensation in two weeks.

The Gujarat government was also asked to take disciplinary action against the erring police officials, including IPS officer RS Bhagora, convicted by the Bombay High Court for dereliction of duty in the sensational Bilkis Bano gang rape case during the 2002 riots in the state.

The Bombay High Court had on May 4, 2017 convicted seven people -- five policemen and two doctors -- under sections 218 (not performing their duties) and section 201 (tampering of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

On March 3 in 2002, 14 people - including four women and four children - were killed while 19-year-old Bilkis Yakub Rasool was gangraped and left to die. But she survived the brutality and fought for justice.

Taking note of the delay, the Supreme Court today asked the state government to speed up the process and provide the compensation to Bilkis Bano within two weeks.
