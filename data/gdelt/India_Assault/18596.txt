Indian leader banished from summit after frustrated outburst at Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: A member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in India was escorted off the premises of the Asia Pacific Summit in Cambodia after he angrily tried to prevent National Assembly Deputy Speaker Qasim Suri from speaking about the human rights situation in occupied Kashmir.

According to a video posted on the social networking platform Twitter by multiple users, BJP leader Vijay Joly was seen yelling and screaming at the participants of the summit when Suri started highlighting the deplorable Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir.

Suri stayed calm and dignified, choosing not to respond and continuing his speech as Jolly was reprimanded and escorted off the premises by security guards. It is unclear whether the Jolly was allowed back inside after the warning, or whether he would participate further in the summit.

In his speech, Suri touched upon the human rights violations in Indian-occupied Kashmir and informed the audience that almost 100,000 Kashmiris had been martyred and thousands were missing as a result of the Indian crackdown in the valley. “More than 11,000 women have been raped. More than 8,000 unmarked graves have been found affected by Indian atrocities. The occupied territory is under a strict curfew and a communications blackout has been in place for the past 106 days,” he said. Suri noted that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights had recorded usage of pellet guns, extrajudicial killings and torture of civilians by the Indian forces. Occupied Kashmir has been under a military curfew since August 5.
