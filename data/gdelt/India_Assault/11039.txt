Odisha: Ruckus in assembly over teen pregnancy

BHUBANESWAR: Speaker Surya Narayan Patro on Tuesday directed the state government to make a statement in the house after Congress MLAs created ruckus over a TOI report regarding pregnancy of a minor girl studying in a government-run SC/ST residential school in the city.Congress legislature party leader Narasingha Mishra raised the issue in the zero hour and criticised the state government alleging that no step was taken by the administration despite repeated occurrences of such incidents.Mishra asked the speaker to direct the chief minister to issue a statement in the house over the issue after conducting an impartial inquiry into the matter by July 12 when the second phase of the budget session will start.“Four girls tested positive for pregnancy in the initial tests. They were sent home and then suddenly three of them tested negative. The officials are trying to suppress the matter,” said Mishra. “Had the incident taken place in cities like Delhi or Mumbai, it would have shocked the entire nation,” he added.The Congress veteran also lashed out at the state government over poor rate of conviction in rape cases while crime against women is on the rise.“The state government claims that it respects women but rape of minor girls are on the rise. At least seven girls are raped every day in the state but only six persons are convicted in a year,” said Mishra.As the speaker allowed the house to run without giving any ruling, the Congress members rushed to the well and continued sloganeering against the state government forcing the speaker to adjourn the house for 10 minutes. The BJP members also demanded a ruling from the speaker over the issue.Deputy leader of the BJP legislature party Bishnu Charan Sethi said 117 cases of exploitation of tribal girls in the state hostels has already been registered. “It is a sensitive matter. Former Union tribal affairs minister Jual Oram had also asked the state government to act in the matter but no step was taken,” Sethi said.The BJP leader said if the chief minister takes credit for all good things, he should also shoulder the blame for these incidents. Keeping the mood of the house in mind, the speaker has directed the “minister concerned” to make a statement after conducting a probe.
