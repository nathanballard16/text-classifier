Gang rape Crime scene to be recreated

Kolkata: In connection with the Panchasayar gang-rape case, police have decided to recreate the crime scene soon with the accused taxi driver Uttam Ram. According to sources, though the victim woman had claimed that she was gang-raped, Ram claimed that he was the only one to torture the woman on November 11 night. Investigating officials suspect that as she was raped more than once, she could have mistaken that there were more than one person at that time. Investigators expect the whole incident will be clear after the crime scene is recreated. Sources informed that Ram confessed to the crime and stated that he saw the woman walking along the road and offered her help.
