PMCH Junior Doctors Call Off Their Strike

Patna: Patients and their family members at the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) got a chance to see the same movie they have seen hundreds of times in the past wherein junior doctors, demanding more security for themselves, go on a lightning strike forcing patients to leave the hospital in search of other facilities as a few patients die in the lack of proper and timely medical care.

As reported, the junior doctors went on a strike on Sunday night after three of their colleagues were roughed up by family members of some patients.

At least one patient was said to have died due to the strike while many others were seen being transported to other hospitals in the state capital.

The strike, however was called off nearly 24 hours after it went into effect. Following assurance from the Medical Superintendent Dr. Rajiv Ranjan Prasad, another oft-repeated scene from the same film, junior doctors withdrew their strike on Monday evening with full service expected to be restored by late Monday evening.

Dr. Shankar Bharti, the president of the Junior Doctors’ Association (JDA), said the situation escalated on Sunday night after a patient, a victim of electrical shock, was brought in to the hospital after he had already died.
