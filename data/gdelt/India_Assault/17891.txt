According to the complainant, who works at a firm in the same colony, five-six men stood in front of the car. When she rolled down the window and asked them to move aside, one of them rushed towards her all of a sudden and groped her.

"I was shocked and couldn't understand what had happened," the woman said. "Another man joined him and molested me. And, after I tried to resist, they punched me on my face and pulled my hair."
