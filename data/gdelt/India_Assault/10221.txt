Just a day after doctors in Kolkata ended their strike over violence, a group of locals in New Delhi’s Maharishi Valmiki Hospital on Tuesday created ruckus in the medical premises. According to news agency ANI, the ruckus was created by the locals over alleged rape of 4-year old girl in Bawana area on Tuesday. The girl was admitted to the hospital and police said that people gathered in the hospital and created ruckus over the rape of the minor girl. Situation was later brought to control by the police. The victim was assaulted by a man in outer Delhi and when she was taken to a hospital, doctors referred her to another one saying emergency services were closed, following which an irate crowd ransacked the facility, doctors claimed. A video by the news agency, purportedly of the hospital, shows a group of people engaging in an altercation with security staff and later smashing up the facility, causing damage to furniture and other objects.
