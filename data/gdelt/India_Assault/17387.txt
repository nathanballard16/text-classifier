Congress MP’s wife says ‘fate is like rape’, faces flak

KOCHI: Ernakulam MP Hibi Eden ’s wife, Anna Linda Eden, was forced on Tuesday to apologise and remove a Facebook post in which she had drawn parallels Monday night between “fate” and “rape”. The post had drawn immediate condemnation from several quarters.In a post on waterlogging in Kochi, she had said: “Fate is like rape, if you can’t resist it, then try to enjoy it.” The statement, which ended with a winking face emoji , was accompanied by visuals of waterlogging in Kochi and Eden, the Congress MP, eating what looked like dessert.Social media users criticised her strongly for posting an insensitive joke, pointing out that it was awfully hurtful to rape survivors and their loved ones. After removing her post, Anna clarified on Tuesday that she had used a comment made by an actor that she had heard during her school days. “I was going through a really tough time. I am extremely sad that my post was misunderstood. I express my regrets,” she wrote.
