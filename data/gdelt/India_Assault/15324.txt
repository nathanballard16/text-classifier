Stay on trial in minor gang rape case

gang rape

I find it necessary to invoke powers under Section 397 of CrPC to array proposed accused (the three police personnel) along with the main accused –Special judge

The trial in a 2014 case involving theof a minor has come to a standstill, as the Bombay High Court wants to examine whether the police personnel who allegedly forced her to marry one of the accused can be prosecuted along with the others.A single judge bench of Justice Ajey Gadkari has granted interim relief to two police personnel allegedly involved in the case – Vivek Shende, then senior inspector of Amboli Police Station, and Janita Bhosale, a woman constable from the same station. A third policeman – then assistant inspector Jaywant Shinde – has also approached the HC, but his petition is yet to be heard.The three, in probably the first such instance in the city, were arraigned as accused under the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and the Child Marriage Restraint Act. The victim was around 13 years of age when she was gang-raped by the accused, resulting in the birth of a child in 2013.The allegations against the three police personnel are that of not registering a complaint when approached, and instead, getting her married to one of the accused – Maqsood Ansari. However, DNA tests later showed that the child’s father was the other accused – Sonu Gaud.In the trial, so far, 10 witnesses have been examined, including the victim and her father. It was after the victim’s testimony got over that her father’s lawyer, Wesley Menezes, filed an application before the court to make the three police personnel accused in the case.Menezes filed the application invoking Section 319 of the Criminal Procedure Code – which means that a court can add someone as an accused based on the evidence brought before it during the course of an inquiry/trial. In an order passed on May 15 this year, special POCSO judge Madhuri More concluded that the trio be criminally prosecuted for the earlier mentioned offences.Represented by advocates Mahesh Vaswani and Dharini Nagda, Vivek Shende’s petition argues that there are too many inconsistencies in the statements of the witnesses – the victim and her father – for him to be made an accused. It says that though the victim, in her statement before a magistrate under Section 164 of the CrPC, does mention Shende’s name, that by itself can’t be treated as enough for him to be criminally prosecuted.“It is submitted that the Ld. Special Judge failed to appreciate that neither there was any material in the charge sheet against the Applicant so as to believe that the Applicant has committed any offence, nor any fresh material was brought during the course of the trial before the Ld. Special Judge,” the petition reads.The petition also cites certain Supreme Court judgments to say that a trial court is supposed be cautious in passing orders under Section 319 of CrPC, and not do so because “the first informant or one of the witnesses seeks to implicate other persons”.In her order Special Judge More, however, had observed, “I find it necessary to invoke powers under Section 397 of CrPC to array proposed accused (the three police personnel) along with the main accused because the SIT (Special Investigating Team) failed to include all these proposed accused in charge sheet though allegations were made by the victim and complainant against the applicant.”
