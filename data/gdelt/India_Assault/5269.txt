Ram Gopal Yadav's Pulwama shocker: CRPF jawans were killed for vote, says SP leader

New Delhi:

Samajwadi Party (SP) leader Ram Gopal Yadav on Thursday said the Pulwama attack was a conspiracy ahead of the Lok Sabha Elections to fetch votes. Ram Gopal said that there were no adequate security checks between Jammu and Srinagar national highway. “There will be an investigation into the incident after the current NDA government changes and those behind the conspiracy will be caught,” he said. On February 14, at least 42 CRPF personnel were killed in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district when a Jaish suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 30 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district that also left many critically wounded.

More than 2,500 Central Reserve Police Force personnel, many of them returning from leave to rejoin duty in the Valley, were travelling in the convoy of 78 vehicles when they were ambushed on the Srinagar-Jammu highway at Latoomode in Awantipora in south Kashmir.



On Wednesday, Ram Gopal Yadav taking potshot at Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said the Congress General Secretary was visiting temples as she is "nervous" and the Congress is in "trouble" in Uttar Pradesh.

"Priyanka Gandhi Vadra is nervous and therefore, she is temple hopping due to her nervousness. People run to temple only when they are in trouble. In Uttar Pradesh, Congress is in trouble," Ram Gopal Yadav told ANI.



Priyanka was on a three-day long 'Ganga Yatra' from Prayagraj to Varanasi. Priyanka's tour focused on 'Sanchi Baat Priyanka ke Saath' in which she talked to people during her 140 kilometres long travel on a steamer boat to Assi Ghat in Varanasi.



The Lok Sabha elections have been scheduled to start from April 11 and will go on till May 19 in seven phases. The polls in Uttar Pradesh will be held in all seven phases. The counting of votes will take place on May 23.
