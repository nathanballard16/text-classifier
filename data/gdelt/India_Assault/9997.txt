Two customs officials suspended for assault on Uzbekistan woman

NEW DELHI: Two Customs officials posted at IGI airport have been suspended for allegedly sexually assaulting a woman from Uzbekistan who was visiting India for the treatment of a relative. The matter came to light last month when a complaint was lodged by a whistleblower to senior officials at the airport who then started the probe.Meanwhile, a complaint was also emailed to the office of revenue secretary Ajay Bhushan Pandey informing him about the incident. The complainant, citing a brief detail of the case, requested the revenue secretary that the matter be looked into with utmost priority.Two superintendents of the Customs department, posted at the airport, were then suspended by the authorities for their alleged involvement in the sexual assault.Giving details of the case, officials said that one of the accused official stopped the Uzbek woman upon her arrival from Tashkent on May 3, for checking of her baggage for any suspected smuggled goods.He then took her to a room, which had no CCTV camera, and spent about half an hour there without being accompanied by any women officer, the official added.It is alleged that the superintendent, in his early 50s, sexually assaulted the woman, who had come for treatment of her sister’s child admitted at a hospital in Delhi.The woman had lodged a complaint with the Customs authorities but retracted later after she was alleged to have been threatened of being fabricated in a false case of smuggling, besides threat to her life by the accused officer.The Customs authorities at Delhi airport, who are tight-lipped about the entire incident, are still looking into the matter. However, it is not confirmed whether or not the Customs department has approached Delhi Police, reporting the alleged crime.While inquiring into the allegations against the superintendent, a role of another officer of the same-rank had come to the notice of the authorities. The duo were then suspended by the customs department pending a detailed probe.
