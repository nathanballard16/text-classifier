Hyderabad rape-murder victim's family expresses joy after accused killed

Family members of the young woman veterinarian brutally gangraped and murdered last week near Hyderabad have reacted with joy to news that all four accused were killed in what the police say was an encounter.

The victim's father told ANI his daughter's soul must be at peace now. He congratulated the Telanagana government and police.

Her sister said she was "very happy," adding that the police's action would serve as an example.

Cyberabad's police chief, VC Sajjanar, said the four accused -- all lorry workers in their early twenties -- were killed in an encounter between 3 and 6 am on Friday.

DCP Shamshabad Prakash Reddy said the accused snatched a weapon and fired at the police during the crime scene re-construction. This, Reddy said, prompted the police to fire back in self-defence, killing the four men.

Several public figures, including politicians, have come out in support of the police.

The parents of Nirbhaya, the victim in the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, have also welcomed the police action.
