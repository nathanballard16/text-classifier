‘Gandhis’ to walk for harmony in coastal city today

MANGALURU: January 30, which is observed as Martyr’s Day across the nation to commemorate the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi in 1948, will witness a patriotic event in the coastal city Team India, a newly-formed organisation of the young generation who love the nation and insist on secularism, will team up to hold ‘Nooraru Gandhiyara Nadige, Souhardatheya Kadege ’. As per the concept, like-minded youth will walk from Gandhi Park to the Deputy Commissioner’s office wearing Gandhi face masks. Programme coordinator Santhosh Bajal told TOI that the main objective of holding a walk for harmony is to build a secular nation. “ Team India was formed recently under the leadership of DYFI state president Muneer Katipalla with an objective to unite all broad-minded and secular youth to spread the message of patriotism and harmony. In fact, January 30 is the saddest day in the history of India, as it was on that day that Mahatma Gandhi, who led the fight against the British, was assassinated by the blind communal ideology. We have planned to make that historical day to pledge against such communal forces and thereby uphold the values of secularism,” Santhosh said.Team India has already carried out campaigns to make the ‘walk for harmony by Gandhis’ programme successful, he said. “We have invited all like-minded organisations to join hands to make the programme successful. We have plans to bring at least 300 patriotic youth to take part in the walk, which will commence from Gandhi Park in front of the Town Hall in the city at 4pm. Later, a public meet will be organised in front of the deputy commissioner’s office,” he said.“It is also a movement against the intolerance and hatred being spread through lies and violence. Such politics based on religion will weaken the nation and its future will be at stake. Hence, all patriotic-minded people should unite to oppose it,” he added.
