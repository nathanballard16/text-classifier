Sikh militancy: Special remission for 5 policemen

Five police personnel, undergoing life sentences for crimes related to the Sikh militancy in Punjab, will be released from jails after the Centre approved a proposal from the Punjab government, an official said.

The decision came a fortnight after the Union Home Ministry decided to release eight Sikh prisoners, lodged in various jails in the country, for committing crimes during the militancy in Punjab and commute the death sentence of Balwant Singh Rajoana, who killed Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh.

“The government of India has accepted the request of the government of Punjab for grant of special remission and release of five Punjab police personnel undergoing sentence in different jails in Punjab for offences committed during the militancy period,” the Home Ministry said.
