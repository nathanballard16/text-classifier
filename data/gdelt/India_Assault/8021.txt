In a rare personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BSP president Mayawati on Monday said he could not be expected to respect others’ sisters and wives as he had abandoned his own wife for political gains.

Mayawati’s scathing attack comes as the Lok Sabha poll gets into the final and fiercest phase where Modi himself is in the fray in Varanasi.

In an interview given to a news agency, Mayawati accused Modi of playing dirty politics on the Alwar rape case saying he was silent till she spoke on it. He wanted to benefit by it in the election season which is shameful, she said.

“Mujhe toh yeh bhi maloom chala hai ke BJP mein khas kar vivahit mahilayen apne aadmiyon ko Shri Modi ke nazdeek jate dekh kar yeh soch kar bhi kafi zyada ghabrati rehti hain ke kahin yeh Modi apni aurat ki tarah humein bhi apne pati se alag na karwa de.” (I have come to know that in BJP married women get nervous when their husbands go near Modi fearing that like him their husbands may also leave them), said Mayawati.

The attack comes a day after Modi during election rallies in Kushinagar and Deoria on Sunday accused Mayawati of shedding crocodile tears over the Alwar rape case and not withdrawing support to the Rajasthan government.

She said the PM’s show of sympathy for Dalits rang hollow as he would have acted against those responsible for Dalit atrocities like in Una in his state and against people responsible for the death of Rohith Vemula.

Mayawati said Modi had been cleverly trying to break the alliance. She said that earlier he always addressed her as ‘Behenji’ but when he realised that the alliance is not falling apart he started addressing her as ‘bua’.

“The ‘sanskari’ people in the country address me as ‘Behenji’. Even my parents address me as ‘Behenji’ and so does Akhilesh Yadav,” she pointed out.
