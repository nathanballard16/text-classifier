Unnao gang rape: CBI files chargesheet against three

The CBI on Thursday filed a chargesheet against three persons in connection with the Unnao gang-rape case.

The next court hearing had been fixed for October 10. The CBI plans to submit additional documents and a list of witnesses.

Those arraigned in the case are Naresh Tiwari, Brijesh Yadav Singh and Shubham Singh. They have been accused of kidnapping and raping the victim about a week after she was sexually assaulted allegedly by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

It is alleged that the incident took place in June 2017 when the victim was a minor. The CBI has already filed a chargesheet against Mr. Sengar and others in another rape case.

A special court recently recorded the victim’s statement in the case against Mr. Sengar and others.

She was seriously injured along with her lawyer, and her two aunts were killed, when a speeding truck collided with their car at Raebareli on July 28.

The victim was admitted to a Lucknow hospital, from where she was shifted to AIIMS. She was discharged from the hospital a few days ago. Based on the threat perception, the court has issued orders to make arrangements for the stay of the victim and her family in Delhi.
