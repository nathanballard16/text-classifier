Pakistan Evaluates Options to Close its Airspace to India

Pakistan had closed its airspace in February this year after an Indian Air Force (IAF) strike on an alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror training camp in the country's Balakot region.

The IAF strike of 26 February came a fortnight after a suicide bomber affiliated with JeM killed 40 Indian security personnel travelling in a convoy through Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama region.

The IAF strike was followed on 27 February by an aerial dogfight between IAF and Pakistan Air Force (PAF) fighter jets over the Nowshera Sector of the Kashmir region, and the capture of IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman by Pakistani forces.

Islamabad released Wing Commander Varthaman on 1 March after facing a lot of pressure from the international community.

Pakistan opened its airspace for all flights on 16 July.

Tensions between India and Pakistan resurfaced after New Delhi abrogated seven decades-old special status of Jammu and Kashmir. It was also decided to divide the state into two central government-administered territories effective from 31 October.

Though diplomatic and trade engagement was suspended, Islamabad did not close its airspace. This allowed Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to fly over Pakistan's air space to attend the G7 Summit in France last month.

India and Pakistan claim Kashmir in full but rule it in part. The nuclear-armed neighbours have fought two of their three wars over the disputed territory.
