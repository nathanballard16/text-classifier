Delhi: Another incident which posed a threat on the safety of women in the country surfaced again in Delhi. A fast-track court held a man guilty of raping his tenant six-years ago. The victim was a US national who was sleeping with her husband when the accused raped her with his finger on June 24, 2013.

The court held the accused guilty of violating the victim on Thursday. While talking to the Times of India, Judge Ila Rawat stated that while the victim was asleep in her room with her husband, the accused entered the room and violated her with his finger.

The survivor was employed with a United Nations agency in India and stated in her statement that she woke up between 4 to 4.30 am when she realised that she was being digitally raped. The survivor saw him and raised an alarm while the accused fled the scene. However, the accused was arrested later the same day. Denying the charges against him, the accused said that the couple was falsely accusing him and they did not pay their rent on time.

The relationship of the survivor faced a rough patch after the incident and eventually, an appeal to dissolve the marriage was filed by the couple. The appeal, however, is still pending. While the defense council stated that the survivor had made changes in her statements, the Judge stated that her statements were consistent.

The defence counsel stated that the survivor had imagined the entire incident while the court said that the woman woke up after being stimulated with finger. The sentence will be imposed on Monday.
