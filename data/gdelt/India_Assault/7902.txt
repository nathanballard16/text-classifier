Elections 2019: Ahead of Delhi polls, BJP raises 1984 anti-Sikh riots issue; NCM sends notice to Sam Pitroda

Besides, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) also sent notice to Pitroda yesterday and directed him to tender an unconditional apology to the Sikh community. The notice, issued on a complaint filed by Delhi BJP leader Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga, said that the remarks had hurt the sentiments of of the Sikh community.

A day after the Congress leader Sam Pitorda kicked off a controversy with his remark on the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the BJP on Friday sought to make it a issue ahead of the May 12 polls to the city's seven seats. The BJP took to Twitter and attached a video of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the riot victims saying, "Those who say it happened so what? Can they give reply on this? What about the Sikh families who are still living with the unbearable memories of those riots. Did Sonia (Gandhi), Rahul (Gandhi) or Priyanka (Gandhi) ever apologise to the nation for the sponsored riots against Sikhs. The country is demanding answers." The video starts with the remark of Rajiv Gandhi that "when a big tree falls, then the earth shakes", which was seen as attempt to justify the riots. The video also shows the riot victims recalling the horror of 1984. The video shared by the BJP also features Congress leaders like Jagdish Tytler, Kamal Nath and H.K.L. Bhagat, who were alleged to have led the mobs. Former Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, who has been convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in a riot case, was also shown.
