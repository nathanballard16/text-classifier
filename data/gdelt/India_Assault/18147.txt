However, the OPD facility remained operative at most private hospitals, while Krishna Rajendra (KR) Hospital registered a spike in the number of patients at its OPD.Meanwhile, the protesting doctors stepped up their demand for the arrest of those who attacked the junior doctor in Bengaluru. In the state capital, the protesting doctors alleged that activists of the Karnataka Rakshana Vedike were the ones who assaulted the doctor.Services at OPDs in most private hospitals including Columbia Asia and JSS were unaffected. Members of the management at the hospitals cited their inability to ensure service to many patients who had travelled from distant places for not joining the strike called by the IMA.In-charge medical superintendent of KR Hospital Dr BL Nanjundaswamy said that they had made the necessary arrangements to handle more patients in view of the strike. “On a daily basis, the number of patients visiting the OPD at KR Hospital is around 14,000, while it was 15,000 on Friday. However, we were prepared to handle a significantly greater number of patients since we had cancelled leaves for doctors and other medical personnel,” he said.The incident that triggered outrage among the medical community and reignited the debate over lack of adequate security for doctors was the alleged attack on a junior woman doctor in Minto Hospital in Bengaluru on Kannada Rajyotsava (November 1). Members of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, who had accompanied a patient seeking compensation for a patient who had lost his sight during a surgery in July, were allegedly upset when the doctor in question did not speak in Kannada, and reportedly attacked her.
