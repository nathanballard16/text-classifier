Bombay High Court dismisses furlough plea of 2012 gang rape convict

The High Court on Wednesday upheld the state government's decision to deny furlough to people convicted for rape. The High Court would not interfere with the state government's decision to excludes rape convicts from being eligible for furlough." Furlough is the right of a convict to be entitled to leave while serving a jail term. Munde has been convicted for charges of gang rape commited in 2012 and is currently lodged in the Aurangabad Central Jail. However, in accordance with the Government Resolution (GR) of April 16, 2018, a person convicted for rape will not be eligible for furlough leave."
