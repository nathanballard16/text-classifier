Yogi Adityanath Says Rahul Gandhi Moves to Italy During Crisis in India

Guwahati: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath attacked Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday alleging that he moves to Italy whenever there is a crisis in the country.

Adityanath said that if Congress Shehjadi (Priyanka Gandhi) and her brother Rahul Gandhi have nothing to do with the people of the country then they should better move to Italy and ask for votes there.

Adityanath, while reiterating about the scuffle between the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) workers in Ghazipur said that the SP and BSP workers were fighting with each other on Monday and the goons were brutally beating up the BSP workers.

The UP CM further said that the BSP chief is sharing the stage with SP leaders only because the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh created a safe and secure environment in the state. He further said that he will address rally on West Bengal on Wednesday as the Mamata Banerjee government has not granted permission to hold a poll meeting in Kolkata.

According to a BJP leader, the UP CM’s meeting which was scheduled at Southwest Kolkata on May 15 was cancelled after permission for it was withdrawn by the local administration.

Adityanath, while taking a jibe at the Congress termed Christian Michel, maternal uncle of Rahul Gandhi as Shakuni Mama saying that he belongs to Italy and is the broker of the Augusta Westland helicopter case. He further stated that the Congress supports this kind of brokers and helps them to fly to Italy from the back door and now that there is Modiji, he has brought back the Shakuni Mama from Italy.
