Nagpur, July 3

A 51-year-old principal of a government school was allegedly hacked to death by her estranged husband in her office in Maharashtra’s Gondia district on Tuesday, police said.

Pratibha Dongre, the deceased, worked as principal of the zilla parishad school at Irritola in the district, police said.

Around 11.15 am Tuesday, Dilip Dongre, her husband, entered into her cabin and allegedly attacked her with an axe following a heated argument, killing her on the spot, said a senior police official.

He then fled from the spot.

Dilip is a drunkard, and he used to harass Pratibha for money, he said, adding that the two were living separately since January.

Police had launched a manhunt for Dilip, the official added. PTI
