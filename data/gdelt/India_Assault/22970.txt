Kushal married Audrey back in 2015 and is survived by his son, Kiaan, a sister, and his mother. His best friend Chetan Hansraj, while talking to us said, "His parents called me up late at night and said that Kushal isn't opening the door. We called the chabbi wala and when we opened the door and we found his body hung over the ceiling. We were all dead shocked and I still cannot believe that this has happened. We tried CPR but it was too late."
