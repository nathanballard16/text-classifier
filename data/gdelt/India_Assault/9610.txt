Bengal: BJP, RSS Workers Found Hanging From Trees After Taking Out Jai Shri Ram Rallies

In a fresh case of political violence in West Bengal, BJP and RSS workers have been found hanging from trees after they took out Jai Shri Ram rallies in the state, Times of India has reported.

As per the report, a BJP worker named Samatul Dolui was found dead on Monday (10 June), hanging from a tree in Sarpota village of Howrah district.

BJP’s Howrah district president Anupam Mallik was quoted as alleging that Dolui began receiving death threats after taking out a Jai Shri Ram rally in the region. Mallik added that the deceased worker’s home was also ransacked soon after the 23 May results.

The violence did not end even in Dolui’s death as some miscreants tried to snatch away his body while it was being taken for a postmortem.

On Sunday (9 June) a senior RSS worker Swadesh Manna was found dead in a similar manner in Achata Village after he too had taken out Jai Shri Ram rallies in the region, claims the report.

The BJP state dispensation has accused the Mamata Banerjee led Trinamool of being behind the murders.
