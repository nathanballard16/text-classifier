Delhi: Court approves plea seeking transfer of Nirbhaya case to another judge

Delhi's Patiala House Court on Monday allowed the transfer of the Nirbhaya rape case to another court. The case will now be heard by Additional Sessions Judge Satish Arora on November 28.

Last year, Nirbhaya's parents had approached the court to expedite the process to hang all four convicts in the case. The matter was adjourned multiple times as the judges were transferred.

Representing Nirbhaya's parents, advocate Seema Smriddhi Kushwaha said, "We had approached the court when legal remedies of the convicts got exhausted. We had sought the court's direction to expedite the execution of the rape convicts."

Nirbhaya, a 23-year-old paramedic, was brutally gang-raped on December 16, 2012, inside a running bus by six people in Delhi. The shocking incident left the nation stunned and forced the government to tighten the rape laws.

The four rapists were given death sentence by the trial court, which was later upheld by the High court and the Supreme Court.

On July 9 last year, the apex court had dismissed the pleas of three convicts -- Mukesh (31), Pawan Gupta (24) and Vinay Sharma (25) -- seeking review of its 2017 verdict upholding the capital punishment awarded to them by the Delhi High Court and the trial court in the case.

The fourth death row convict, Akshay Kumar Singh (33), has not filed a review plea in the apex court.
