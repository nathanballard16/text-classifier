Haryana CM fires 'rape in Congress' salvo at Rahul for his 'Rape in India' remark

Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Friday fired 'rape in Congress' salvo at Rahul Gandhi for his 'Rape in India' remark.

Talking to media persons, when asked to comment on Gandhi's 'rape in India' remark, Chief Minister Khattar said: "Rape in Congress."

As per the Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report for 2017, total rape cases for investigation were 46,984 while total cases for the trial were 1,46,201. Around 5,822 people were convicted for their crimes in 2017.

Earlier in the day, Gandhi refused to apologise for his remark and alleged that the issue is being raised by the BJP to deflect the attention of the people from the protests in the North-East.

"I will not apologise ... I have a clip in my phone in which Narendra Modi Ji is calling Delhi a 'rape capital', will tweet it so that everyone can see. The main issue is Narendra Modi and Amit Shah set North-East on fire. Just to deflect attention from the protests in North-East, this is being made an issue by the BJP," he told reporters here.

Both the Houses of Parliament today witnessed uproar as BJP members demanded an apology from the former Congress president.

Addressing a poll rally in Jharkhand on Thursday, Gandhi had said that Modi had launched 'Make in India' but nowadays it is 'Rape in India'.

"Narendra Modi had said 'Make in India' but nowadays wherever you look, it is 'Rape in India'. In Uttar Pradesh, Narendra Modi's MLA raped a woman. Then she met with an accident but Narendra Modi did not utter a word," he had said.
