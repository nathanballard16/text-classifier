Thiruvananthapuram: Two Youth Congress workers were hacked to death by a gang in Kasaragod district of Kerala Sunday night. Congress alleged that the CPM was behind the attack.

According to police, Youth Congress workers Sarath Lal, 21, and Kripesh, 19, were returning on a two-wheeler from a function when a car-borne gang attacked them at Periya. The car knocked down the bike and then the assailants hacked the two. While Kripesh died on the spot, Lal died while being taken to Mangalore for treatment. Periya had reported political tension in the recent days, but the situation has been under control, said the police.

Alleging that the CPM was behind the attack, the Congress called for a dawn-to-dusk hartal in Kasaragod district on Monday. The Youth Congress would conduct protest across the state.
