A local court in Shahjahanpur, Uttar Pradesh on Saturday pronounced order on the application filed by a special investigation team (SIT) seeking permission to take voice samples of rape accused Swami Chinmayanand and the survivor.

The court allowed to take the voice samples of Chinmayanand, the law student who accused the former minister, and three friends of the law student who have been charged with extortion.

All will be taken to a lab in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh where their voice samples will be collected.

The law student had accused Chinmayanand of rape and blackmail in September, 2019. Chinmayanand, in turn, filed an extortion case against the student and three of her friends.

All the accused are in judicial custody.

The student, who went to the college run by Chinmayanand, had testified before a local court that she was repeatedly raped by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader for over a year.

The student said that the accused recorded the incident on the camera and used it to blackmail her.

The leader, on the other hand, alleged that she along with her friends tried to extort Rs 5 crore from him.

Some videos had gone viral where one video allegedly showed obscene conversations between the woman and Chinmayanand. The other video, which pertains to the extortion case, showed the woman, three others and the driver in a car discussing the amount to be extorted from Chinmayanand.
