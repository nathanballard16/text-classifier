Modi government using CBI, ED to target Chidambaram: Rahul

New Delhi: Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday accused the Modi government of using the CBI and ED and “sections of a spineless media” to character assassinate the Rajya Sabha member.

His remarks came as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) visited Chidambaram’s residence four times following the Delhi High Court’s rejection of his anticipatory bail plea in the INX Media money laundering case. However, there’s no trace of him.

The Delhi High Court passed the order on Tuesday.

“Modi’s government is using the ED, CBI and sections of a spineless media to character assassinate Chidambaram. I strongly condemn this disgraceful misuse of power,” Gandhi tweeted.

A four-member CBI and ED team visited Chidambaram’s residence twice on Wednesday and asked his staff about his whereabouts.

A CBI team on Tuesday night pasted a notice on Chidambaram’s residence asking him to appear before the investigation officer “within two hours”.

Chidambaram’s lawyers have taken the issue to the Supreme Court.

The CBI is investigating Chidambaram in the INX Media case, alleging irregularities in the FIPB clearance granted to the media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during his tenure as Finance Minister.

The ED is probing the money laundering case which it lodged in 2018.
