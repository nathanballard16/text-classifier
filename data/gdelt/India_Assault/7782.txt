Arun Jaitley Attacks Congress On INS Viraat

Guwahati: Union Minister Arun Jaitley took further the statement of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attack on late Rajiv Gandhi for using an Indian naval warship as 'personal taxi.'

Narendra Modi on Wednesday said that Rajiv Gandhi had misused INS Viraat and lashed out at the Congress for saying that he should not refer to the country's armed forces as his own. Modi's statement comes after Congress President Rahul Gandhi said that the armed forces are no one's personal forces to which Modi said that the Gandhi family used INS Viraat as their personal taxi when Rajiv Gandhi as Prime Minister was on a 10-day holiday. "The ship was on duty but was diverted to pick up the Gandhi's," said Modi.

Modi said, "Rajiv Gandhi's in-laws were also present." Modi asked should foreigners have been carried on an Indians warship? Wasn't this playing with India's security?

After Modi's reply to INS Viraat, Arun Jaitley today took Modi's statement a step further by pointing out the difference between the leaders of the ruling BJP and the Congress.

The union minister today tweeted saying, "The Kaamdaars use India's Naval assets to strike at terror and the Naamdaars use them for personal vacations with family and in-laws."

INS Viraat which was India's first aircraft carrier was formally decommissioned in March 2017.

Jaitley further said that from May 1991 till 2004, the Congress blamed its present ally the DMK for Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. It even withdrew support from the United Front government on this ground and it was after 28 years that Congress desperately has discovered the role of BJP.

Jaitley has come up with the remark in response to senior Congress leader Ahmed Patel's assertion that the BJP backed VP Singh government had refused to provide Rajiv Gandhi with additional security and left the former prime minister with one PSO despite credible intelligence inputs and repeated requests.
