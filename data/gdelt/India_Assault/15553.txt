Factory worker held for kidnapping, raping minor

Ludhiana: The police on Saturday night arrested a factory worker for kidnapping and raping a 6-year-old girl here.

The minor was sleeping at her house when a drunk Bablu Kumar, 21, a resident of Tajpur Road, carried her away.

Inspector Harjinder Singh said, “During interrogation, Bablu told that he was drunk that night. He was walking by the area when he peeped inside an open window and saw the girl sleeping beside her mother in the porch of her house. As the main door of the house was open, he sneaked in, picked up the girl and took her to a vacant plot in the locality around 2am.”

Half-an-hour later, the girl’s father woke up and raised the alarm on finding her missing. The area residents gathered at the spot and started looking for the minor. After a few locals told that they had see a man carrying a girl towards a vacant plot, the gathering reached there and found the girl unconscious and in a pool of blood. The accused was also there. They thrashed him black and blue, but he managed to escape. They then sounded the police.

The inspector said, “While assaulting the accused, the residents had asked his name and phone number. He identified himself as Bablu Kumar of Tajpur Road, but gave them an old cellphone number, which he no longer was using. The cellphone number helped get his address and he was nabbed a few kilometres away from Samrala Chowk while he was trying to escape from the city.”

Bablu has been arrested under sections 364 (kidnapping) and 376 (rape) of the IPC and the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act.

‘Try case in fast-track court’

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “The accused brutally raped the girl. She has been administered 24 stitches. We will write to the Ludhiana session judge to put the case in fast-track court, so that it could be decided within a month. This will act as a deterrent.”
