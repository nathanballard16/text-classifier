Delhi BJP Website Hacked; Pro-Pak, Anti-Modi Messages Posted

The hacker group, called _Muhammad Bilal TeAM [PCE] has posted hate messages against India and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, asking the country to remember 27 February (Wing Commander Abhinandan was captured by Pakistan).

“Ghar main ghuss kar marain gy,” a message read.

Another message read, “I can lie a lot, can i also get a ‘Vir Chakra’ like Abhinandan?”.

The message ended with a hashtag that used abusive language against PM Modi, and an Email ID - catch.if.you.can@hotmail.com - probably the hacker group’s email ID.
