2 days, 4 murders. Killing spree rocks Chennai

The young man at the storefront turned away just after a fleeing Kumaresan fell headfirst on a scooter.

But he couldn't help but look back as the rest of the grisly spectacle unfolded -- a group of armed men chased Kumaresan to a two-wheeler stand and hacked away at him.

The last man to leave the motionless body brought his weapon down with such viciousness that it looked like he was digging a pit.

All the while, the life of the street continued largely unabated. Vehicles cruised by. A neatly-dressed man carrying a file walked briskly to safety. He looked back a couple of times, but did not run like the woman just ahead of him.

Kumaresan faced murder charges and was named in ganja cases. He had just returned from a court hearing -- and had finished lunch -- when he was killed by a rival gang in Arumbakkam in Chennai on Monday.

Now the police are looking for one Sagayraj and his associates.

The attack on Kumaresan in Chennai.

Kumaresan's isn't the only murder to have rocked the Tamil Nadu capital in recent days. In fact, three other killings were reported in the space of 48 hours -- on Sunday and Monday.

A 22-year-old history-sheeter, Kumaran, was killed in broad daylight on Sunday after he got into a fight with people he was playing cards with. He'd been out on bail for a little more than two weeks. The police have taken six people into custody.

Also on Sunday, a 70-year-old named Yesurajan and an autodriver in his 40s were killed in separate incidents.

Meanwhile in nearby Gummudipoondi, located in Thiruvallur district, a group of eight hacked three men -- including an 18-year-old college student -- to death at a railway station.

The gang apparently wanted to settle scores with the other two victims.
