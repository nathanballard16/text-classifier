Mumbai: Police watchdog bins assault plaint against senior cop by RTI applicant

The appeal was dismissed on the grounds that Avhad's medical report was not definitive and that he was interested in "publicity". DNA had reported the case on January 28, 2018, when former state information commissioner Thanksy Thekkekara had ordered an enquiry into the assault. It stated that the report Avhad gave from VS Government General Hospital, Thane after the assault was from an audiometry technician and not by a specialist. As for the medical report, he said he had asked his doctor, at a government facility, to state the case in writing, "but they just wrote 'assault'." Bhaskar Prabhu, another activist, said, "It was said during the hearing that the medical report would be sent to JJ Hospital for remarks.
