Teenager Allegedly Beaten For Refusing To Chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’ In Kanpur; 5th Incident In 2 Weeks

In yet another incident, a 16-year-old Muslim boy was thrashed by a mob for wearing a skull cap and refusing to chant “Jai Shri Ram” in Kanpur. The incident occurred on Friday when Mohammad Taj, a resident of Barra, was returning home after offering namaz in Kidwai Nagar.

Police said that three to four unidentified men on motorbikes overtook and stopped Taj a few metres away from his home. The group objected to him wearing the skull cap.

The perpetrators asked the teenager to chant “Jai Shri Ram”, a slogan increasingly used to assert one’s identity and nationalism. When Taj refused to do so, they beat him up and punched him.

“They removed my cap, pinned me down and beat me black and blue while asking me to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’,” Taj told PTI. The 16-year-old further alleged that the men told him that wearing the skull cap was “not allowed” in the area.

The boy said he cried for help and begged the shopkeepers around to rescue him. Later, when a few passersby rushed to help him, the attackers fled.

In the past two weeks, there have been three similar incidents reported from across country.

On June 18, twenty-two-year-old Tabrez Ansari was “mercilessly beaten” for hours after refusing to chant "Jai Shri Ram." Ansari succumbed to his injuries on June 22, after he was denied medical treatment despite multiple requests by his family.

On the same day, an 18-year-old Madrasa student, a resident of Aligarh, was assaulted in a moving train in Bareilly. The attackers removed his skull cap too. Though the incident happened on June 18, the FIR was registered nine days later.

On June 20, a 25-year-old Muslim driver was beaten up in Maharashtra. On the same day, a 20-year-old Madarsa teacher, Hafiz Mohammed Shahrukh Halder, received eye and head injuries after Hindu right activists attacked him for not chanting "Jai Shri Ram" and threw him out of the running local train.
