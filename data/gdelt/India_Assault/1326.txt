Thane: A man hurled his 'chappal' (slipper) at a judge in Bhiwandi court after he was sentenced to six months in prison on Wednesday. The man, who was identified as Ashraf Ansari, was accused in many theft cases. Ansari has already served 14 months in jail in other cases. The incident was reported from Bhiwandi in Thane district of Maharashtra.

After judicial magistrate HJ Pathan had pronounced his judgment, a furious Ansari attacked the judge by throwing a slipper at him, according to a report in The Times of India. Following the assault, advocates reacted by going on a strike and demanding security for judges and lawyers.

Durgesh Dubey, police inspector of Shanti Nagar police station, said that as soon as the judge sentenced Ansari to six months in jail and also imposed a fine on him in one of the cases, Ansari lost his temper and hurled his slipper at the judge. However, the judge managed to escape from the attack and did not get hurt.

Immediately after Ansari assaulted the judge, he was taken to the police station and booked under section 353 (assault on a public servant) and 228 (causing intentional insult to public servant sitting in judicial proceeding) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Earlier this month, a 35-year-old thief was arrested for tearing the uniform of a sub-inspector near Malukpur village in Bareilly. The police officials had gone to arrest the man in case of chain snatching. However, the drunken thief assaulted them after which he was booked under relevant sections of the IPC.
