Hyderabad case: Big statement of India's only executioner says, "If the accused of Nirbhaya were punished..."

In the past, there has been a ruckus in the entire country after the case of the murder of a female doctor in Hyderabad after the gang rape. Meanwhile, with the early action against the culprits, the demand for hanging as soon as possible has increased. It also includes the convicts of the Nirbhaya case. Meanwhile, the executioner Pawan Singh, who is currently the only one to be hanged in the country, has made his pointless remarks on this issue.

In his statement, Pawan said - 'The culprits of Nirbhaya's gang rape and murder should be hanged as soon as possible.' In a way, it will be a strong message to such criminals that if they do such an act, they will also get the death penalty. Pawan says that in the case of gang rape and murder of a doctor in Hyderabad, the punishment should be implemented at the earliest, only then such horrific crimes will be reduced. Until such criminals will not be hanged, as long as there is no fear of law.

The only executioner of the country living in Meerut on this matter, Pawan says that if Nirbhaya's convicts were hanged on time as punishment, the doctor in Hyderabad would not become a victim and her life would saved. On the issue of delay in hanging in the Nirbhaya case, the executioner Pawan said that why the convicts are being kept in Tihar? Such criminals should be hanged and other criminal mentality should be conveyed to the people. Also, Pawan also said- 'I am ready to hang the culprits of Nirbhaya, I need one or two days to prepare for this, that's all. I will give a trial and then be hanged.
