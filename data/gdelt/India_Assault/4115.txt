Ravali and Anvesh were classmates and childhood friends, according to villagers of Ramachandrapuram. The boy was arrested by the police on the same day.

There was public outrage across the district and the villagers were very furious over the incident. The irate villagers wanted the police to treat the boy as he treated the girl. Police commissioner V Ravinder said a case under Sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 354 D (stalking) of IPC were booked against the accused Anvesh.
