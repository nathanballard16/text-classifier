We Don't Have Any 'No First Use' Policy On Nukes: Pakistan Military Denies Imran Khan's Claims

“We will never ever start the war. Both Pakistan and India are nuclear powers and if tension escalates, the world will face danger,” Pakistan PM had said earlier this week.

Days after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan vowed that his country will never start a nuclear war with India first, neighbouring country's military has clarified that it does not follow the 'no first use' policy on nuclear weapons. According to a report by news agency PTI, Pakistan's military spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor on Wednesday denied to be a part of 'no first use' accord on nuclear bomb usage. Ghafoor also said that the first strike could follow with the second strike. While speaking at a media briefing in Rawalpindi, Ghafoor was asked about his take over Defence Minister Rajnath Singh's comment last month that India may witness a change in its 'no first use' nuclear policy depending upon the situation. Speaking about the same, Ghafoor said, "We don't have any 'no first use' policy. Our weapons are for deterrence. As far as India is concerned, it is up to them to formulate any policy." Ghafoor's comment on nuclear weapons doctrine once again came as a mismatch of statement by Pakistan government and its military as Imran Khan has recently stated that his country will never ever start a war with India, amid escalating tensions between the nuclear powers over the Kashmir issue. "Nuclear countries have no room for war," the military's spokesperson said.
