ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Saturday that India didn’t fulfill its responsibility as it failed to protect the Pakistani citizen Shakirullah in Rajasthan’s Jaipur Central Jail mid last month.



Shakirullah was stoned to death by other inmates. The murder of the Pakistani inmate had come after India has leveled baseless allegations against Pakistan of being involved in the Pulwama attack in occupied Kashmir. Shakirullah had been in the Indian jail since 2001.

Pakistan, in this regard, had lodged its protest with India after the inspector general of police (IG) for Rajasthan and in-charge of prisons Kapil Garg confirmed the news of Shakirullah's murder on February 20.

Qureshi, while responding to a separate question, said that there was no international pressure on Pakistan over the Indian pilot's release.

"He was released as per the vision of PM Imran Khan. We could have disturbed their supply line. But we decided to not incur any human losses. The Indians have sent a dossier, our Foreign Office is looking into it," he said.

The foreign minister said that entire India doesn't adhere to the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. 'A majority of the Indians don't want war. The Indian opposition parties are saying that Pulwama incident is being used for politics.'
