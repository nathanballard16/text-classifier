LUCKNOW: National president of Hindu Samaj Party Kamlesh Tiwari (45) was brutally murdered inside his house in Khurshidbagh area of Naka Hindola in UP capital Lucknow on Friday. The incident triggered stiff protests by his supporters. Constables deployed for his security were not on duty when the incident occurred, while another constable was asleep.Police said two persons barged into the house and first slit Tiwari's throat, then stabbed him several times on the chest before escaping. However, the police are yet to ascertain the exact motive of the murder.The sole witness to the incident, Saurashtra Jeet Singh, said that he clearly spotted two men attacking Tiwari. He also alleged that two gunners in Tiwari's security were not coming for the last two days, while another constable who was present was sleeping.Saurashtra Jeet Singh immediately informed the police and called an ambulance. Additional superintendent of police (west) Vikas Tripathi told TOI that they were scanning some numbers whom Tiwari had probably called.Tiwari used to claim himself as the president of Hindu Mahasabha, but another section of the party led by Chakrapani refused to accept him as president.The dispute continued for several years before finally in January 2017, Tiwari quit Hindu Mahasabha and formed his own Hindu Samaj Party. He gained popularity in December 2015 when he distributed pamphlets with derogatory remarks in Deoband, Saharanpur about a community. There were widespread protests across the country. He was arrested on December 4, 2015 and theNational Security Act was slapped on December 10 by the Lucknow district administration on the orders of the then state government. His act was also criticized by the other faction of Hindu Mahasabha led by Chakrapani and other saffron outfits.On September 30, the high court quashed the NSA. However, due to differences with leaders of Hindu Mahasabha, he quit the party in January 2017 and formed Hindu Samaj Party of his own.
