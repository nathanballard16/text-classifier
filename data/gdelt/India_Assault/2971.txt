Mumbai safer, just not for economic fraud

Mumbai saw a drop in cases of extortion, molestation, rape of minors, theft, motor vehicle theft, and rioting in the month of January this year, as compared to last year. On the other hand, however, economic offences have increased.

In January 2019, 12 cases were registered with the economic offences wing (EOW) of the city police as compared to eight last year. The total value of property involved in these cases is Rs 259 crore.

When it comes to cyber crime, 2018 and 2019 both saw a disappointingly low detection rate: 16 of the 120 cases were detected this year, as compared to 17 out of 129 cases in January last year.

A deeper analysis reveals that cases of hacking, sending obscene emails and messages and debit card/credit card fraud have all seen a downward trend this year. As compared to 53 cases of debit/credit card fraud last year, this year saw just 37; 24 cases of sending obscene emails were registered this year, as against 31 last year.

"It's a positive sign that crimes against women, cyber crimes, and cases of extortion, thefts and rioting have seen a downward trend in January this year. We make consistent efforts to keep crimes under control and detect serious offenses," said a senior police officer who did not wish to be named.
