Former IB officer found dead in his east Delhi flat

New Delhi, March 23 : A 60-year-old former Intelligence Bureau (IB) junior Officer was found dead under mysterious circumstances at his flat in east Delhi, the police said here on Saturday.

Narendra Kumar Pal was found dead on Friday by neighbours in Himvarsha Apartments, Madhu Vihara, after they felt foul smell emanating from the flat. The neighbours later informed the local police.

"The deceased was staying alone in his flat following a dispute with wife, a few years ago. He worked as a junior officer with the IB before taking voluntary retirement citing personal reasons in 2010," a police officer said.

"During investigation, it was found that Pal had died a week ago, but the neighbours came to know about his death only after foul smell from the decomposed body started to come out of the flat. Unfortunately, none of his family members came to visit Pal on Holi," the officer said.

"Pal is survived by wife Rajbala (54) and two daughters, Sheetal (27) and Shweta (23), who stayed elsewhere. It is said the deceased suffered from alcohol addiction," he said.

The body has been sent for an autopsy.
