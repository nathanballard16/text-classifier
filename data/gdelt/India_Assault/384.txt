Krishnagiri: After the villagers of Mathepalli organised bull dance without the permission of police and district administration, there was a clash between the locals and cops on Tuesday. When the cops tried to dissuade villagers from organising the event, they were pelted with stones.

A villager who was identified as M Mathesh told The Times of India that over 300 bulls were brought from Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and various parts of the state for conducting the event. Ahead of Pongal, bull dance is held in several parts of the district.

When the police reached the venue, the organisers refused to stop the event. Some people from the crowd started throwing stones at the cops due to which they had to resort to lathi charge to control the situation.

Reportedly, more than 30 people including villagers and police personnel were injured who were taken to Krishnagiri government hospital for treatment. The event organisers and villagers are being questioned. Over 200 cops have been deployed to maintain law and order in the village.

In a similar incident, locals in Tamil Nadu's Malathankulam village organised an illegal Jallikattu event earlier this month. More than 250 bulls from across the state participated in the event. Over 10 people were injured during the event. They were rushed to the Thankavur Medical College Hospital.

Jallikattu is a traditional event in which bulls are released into a crowd of humans who have to grab the large lump on the bull's back with both their arms and hang on as the animal tries to escape.
