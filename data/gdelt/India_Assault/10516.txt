Article content Dix reminded the mourners gathered that the perpetrators not only killed all 329 aboard Air India Flight 182, but they tried to bomb a second Air India plane. The bomb-laden suitcase instead exploded at Narita airport, killing two Japanese baggage handlers. “Those who perpetrated this violence wanted more violence, wanted there to be more victims and we should reflect on that today,” Dix said. “We shouldn’t use exulted terms to describe people who are cowards, who murdered children, who left children orphans. We shouldn’t treat them as anything more than criminal murderers not worthy of our thought or our consideration.” He noted that flags flew at half-mast across Canada, including at the B.C. legislature Sunday to commemorate all Canadian victims of terrorism.

Article content Gurdial Sidhu, who lost her sister-in-law Sukhwinder, niece Parminder, 10, and nephew Kuldip, 9, said the tragedy is made more painful by the fact the terrorists behind the bombings are free. “Thirty-four years have passed and we didn’t get any justice — victims left behind their loved ones, their brothers, sisters, children, parents are still suffering,” Sidhu said. “They didn’t get the justice and the criminals did not get punished yet.” Photo by Kim Bolan/Postmedia / PNG A B.C. Supreme Court judge and a public inquiry determined the bombings were carried out by the B.C. Babbar Khalsa, headed by former Burnaby mill worker Talwinder Singh Parmar. Parmar was killed by Indian police in 1992 before being charged in Canada. Three of his associates, Ripudaman Singh Malik, Ajaib Singh Bagri and Inderjit Singh Reyat were charged in the bombing plot. Malik and Bagri were acquitted and Reyat pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Air India bombing. He was earlier convicted in the Narita bombing.

Article content Former Liberal MLA Dave Hayer said Sunday that he still hopes people with information about the Air India bombing come forward and help police. Hayer’s journalist father Tara Hayer was assassinated in 1998 after agreeing to be a Crown witness against the bombing suspects. His murder remains unsolved. “The victims are still paying the price with their pain and suffering,” Hayer said. “This is a Canadian tragedy. We can’t forget it. We must always remember it.” Relatives of Air India victims outside of Canada also marked the grim anniversary Sunday. From India, Amarjit Bhinder said that “time has not healed” the pain from the devastating loss of her pilot husband Satwinder, who was flying the ill-fated flight with Narendra Singh Hanse.

Article content “At times it feels like it happened yesterday only and sometimes it feels that our whole life is gone without him,” she said. “Life has never been the same again.” Handout She said the act of terror was “some kind of madness and it made thousands who were left behind suffer for rest of their lives.” “We have not got justice from anywhere but will wait for the justice from the court of almighty,” Bhinder said. She has become extremely close to the still grieving son of the other pilot who died. Anil Hanse lives in Australia, but said Sunday that he always receives a call from Bhinder on June 23. “Father is gone but not forgotten, never will be and is always in my thoughts,” Hanse said Sunday. He agreed with Bhinder that more than three decades has not erased the pain. “The anxiety and anger I control with the help of my wife, adult children and exercise.” He said he spends the day in quiet reflection “thinking of all who have lost loved ones on this aircraft.” “Mrs, Bhinder, my dear sister, phones me on this day without fail annually. This issue has created a lifetime bond between us,” Hanse said. kbolan@postmedia.com blog: vancouversun.com/tag/real-scoop twitter.com/kbolan Handout Vancouver Sun Photo by Marcos Townsend / The Gazette Photo by DENIS MINIHANE STAFF / Vancouver Sun Photo by DENIS MINIHANE STAFF / Vancouver Sun Photo by DENIS MINIHANE STAFF / Vancouver Sun Photo by ANDRE DURAND / AFP
