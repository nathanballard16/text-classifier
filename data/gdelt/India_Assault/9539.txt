Hubballi: Hitching a car ride to reach Gadag proved to be costly for a Dubai-return man who ended up being robbed of Rs 55,000 cash, gold chain, laptop, an iPhone and other valuables worth Rs 1.50 lakh.

The victim, Ajith arrived in Mumbai on Friday and reached Hubballi the next day. He had planned to take a bus to Gadag on Saturday night.

with no bus in sight, Ajith finally boarded a car which had other passengers and presumed it was a cab. It was only later that he realised that he had been tricked by the gang of robbers.

The miscreants assaulted Ajith and snatched away valuables from him.

Keshwapur police have registered a case.
