Responding to the reports, the actor told ANI over a telephonic conversation that these are false charges and he has the evidence to prove the same.

"I am being falsely implicated in this case. I have all the evidence and video in this case. I am ready to cooperate with the Mumbai Police. If they will call me for my statement, then I will cooperate. I am ready for investigation. I knew that a case will be registered against me. I am not going anywhere. The police have not approached me after the FIR was registered", he was quoted as saying.
