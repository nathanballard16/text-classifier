New Delhi: Putting an end to any possibility of dialogue between Indian and Pakistan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Monday, said that the brutal terrorist attack in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district shows that time for talks with Pakistan has passed.

Urging all countries to unite against terrorism, Prime Minister Modi said that hesitating from taking actions against terrorists and their supporters will be like encouraging terrorism.

PM Modi’s statement came after delegation-level talks with Argentina President Mauricio Macri, who is on a three-day visit to India.

Asserting that India and Argentina will issue a special declaration on terrorism later today, PM Modi said, “Hesitating from taking actions against terrorists and their supporters will be like encouraging terrorism. Being a part of G20 countries, it's also important that we implement 11 point agenda of Hamburg Leaders Statement. “

The Prime Minister further said that he and Argentina’s President agree that terrorism is a huge threat for global peace and stability. “Brutal terrorist attack in Pulwama proves that time for talks has passed. Now the entire world needs to unite against terrorism and its supporters and take strong actions,” the PM added.

On February 18, 40 security personnel lost their lives and several others were injured after a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Awantipora of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

Earlier, Prime Minister Modi said that if someone teases new India, it will not let it go unpunished. He also said that security forces have been given a free hand to punish the perpetrators of the attack.
