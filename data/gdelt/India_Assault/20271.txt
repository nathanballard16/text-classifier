AAP MP slams Yogi Aditynath over Unnao Rape case

New Delhi, Dec 7 : Sanjay Singh, the member of Parliament from Aam Aadmi Party, slammed Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath over Unnao rape victim's death on Saturday.

While speaking with IANS, Singh said that Yogi Adityanath has no right to comment on the Unnao victim because the culprit belongs to his own party.

"Yogi Adityanath has no right to speak on Unnao because he belongs to a party that supports people like Kuldeep Sengar." He also said that Yogi has no time for issues like women safety but for irrelevant matters like Hindu-Muslim. Why were the culprits roaming scot free? What about the safety of the victim and law and order condition in the state?" Talking about Hyderabad alleged encounter episode, he said: "People are celebrating extra-judicial killings because they have lost faith in the system".

"Unnao rape victim succumbed to her injuries today. She was burnt. Her culprits were out on bail. Delay in justice in such matters has created trust deficit between people and the legal system of this country. That's why people are celebrating Hyderabad encounter," he added.

Singh had come at Rajghat to show solidarity with Delhi Commission for Women chief Swati Maliwal in her indefinite hunger strike.
