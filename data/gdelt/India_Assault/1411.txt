Kaithal man booked for raping 26-year-old married woman

PATIALA: Pasiana police have registered a first information report (FIR) against a resident of Kaithal district in Haryana for allegedly raping a 26-year-old married woman.“We have registered a zero FIR against the accused under Section 376 (punishment for rape ) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Since the sequence of incidents started from Kaithal, the matter would be transferred to Kaithal police for further investigation,” said Passiana station house officer inspector Harwinder Singh.“Both the survivor woman and the accused belong to the same village in the district. The husband of the woman lives in Italy. In our investigation, we found that the woman’s husband demanded divorce after he came to know about her illicit relationship with the accused. We suspect that to save her marriage, the woman has wrongly accused the man of raping her,” the cop said.Meanwhile, the woman told the TOI that the accused had promised to help her and her 6-year-old son in sending abroad, following which he took their passports.“On December 17, 2018, I gave the accused a cheque of Rs 2 lakh for the job. On the same day, he called me for a meeting. He told me that they would have to go to Patiala to withdraw the amount. The accused forcibly took me to Chandigarh where he raped me in a hotel. On December 18, he took me to Kasauli from where he returned halfway and then took me to Kaithal. He then forged a document stating that I seek divorce from my husband and forced me to sign. He submitted the document at Harnoli police post in Kaithal district,” the woman said.She added that the accused then took her to another village, falling in the limits of Passiana police station in Patiala, and raped her again. “I have told everything to my family members. My husband and my family members are with me,” the complainant said.
