India 'no longer helpless in face of terror' after crisis with Pakistan, Modi says

NEW DELHI (WASHINGTON POST) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi broke his silence on Friday (March 1) on the most dangerous clash between India and Pakistan in decades, saying he had begun a new era where India "will no longer be helpless in the face of terror", and casting his critics as foes of the nation.

Mr Modi's remarks, delivered at an election rally in Tamil Nadu, marked his first direct comments on days of tit-for-tat air strikes that raised fears the two nuclear-armed neighbors were stumbling into a broader war.

The tensions ratcheted down considerably on Thursday after Pakistan said it would return an Indian fighter pilot it had captured a day earlier in an aerial dogfight, the first between the two countries since 1971.

The pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, was set to return home to a hero's welcome late on Friday afternoon.

For Mr Modi, who is seeking re-election in polls due later this spring, the confrontation with Pakistan over the militant groups within its borders is a rare political opportunity. Earlier this month, it appeared that India's elections would be fought on terrain not entirely favourable to Mr Modi, with issues like youth unemployment and rural distress near the top of the agenda.

Now the focus has shifted to an arena where Mr Modi has the upper hand: national security. After 40 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed in a suicide bombing on Feb 14 - the deadliest militant attack in three decades of insurgency in Kashmir - Mr Modi vowed to respond.

His response came on Tuesday, when India launched air strikes on what it said was a training camp run by Jaish-e-Muhammad, the terrorist group that claimed responsibility for the Feb 14 attack. India said the strike "eliminated" large numbers of militants, but has provided no proof.
