Bollywood Offers Prayers For Indian Air Force Pilot

Bollywood celebrities pray for the Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot safe return to India, who captured by Pakistan yesterday.

An Indian Air Force Pilot has been captured behind the enemy lines. The Pakistan Army released a video that shows a blindfolded man, identifying himself as a Wing Commander-rank IAF officer and his service number.

The Indian Government has strongly objected to Islamabad putting out photographs and videos of the pilot who was missing in action after he engaged with Pakistani jets that violated Indian airspace on Wednesday morning.

Bollywood Celebrities, such as Arjun Kapoor, Susmita Sen, Farhan Akhtar and filmmaker Karan Johar along with many others offered support and prayer for the pilot.

Filmmaker Karan Johar wrote, “Thoughts and strength to #WingCommandarAbhinandan and his family....India stands tall and proud with you”

Actor Arjun Kapoor tweeted, “My prayers with #wingcommanderabhinandan hope he is safe & we see him back on home soil very soon”

Farhan Akhtar shared, “Thoughts with #WingCommanderAbhinandan and his family. Hoping for his early and safe return. #IndianAirForce”

World beauty Sushmita Sen wrote, “We are all praying for the safe return of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman #IAF gratitude from the daughter of a retired Indian Airforce officer @fbhutto for choosing humanity first & a way to peace...Dugga Dugga & God bless”

Tensions have been elevated between the two countries since a suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based terrorists killed at least 40 CRPF jawans on February 14.
