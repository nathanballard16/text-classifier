CB-CID summons Nakkheeran editor

The Crime Branch CID of the Tamil Nadu police has summoned Nakkheeran Gopal, Editor of Nakkheeran Tamil magazine, to furnish evidence in the sensational Pollachi sexual abuse case.

The police said that Mr. Gopal had released a video of a girl being assaulted and sexually abused by some persons. He also released a video levelling allegations against the sons of Deputy Speaker of the Assembly Pollachi Jayaraman.

“We have summoned Mr. Gopal to provide evidence to the claims he made in the video. Investigators have also summoned Theni Kannan who claimed to have knowledge about the case,” a senior police officer said.

Last week, Mr. Gopal was summoned by the Central Crime Branch of the Chennai Police based on a complaint lodged by Mr. Pollachi Jayaraman that the journalist in the 24-minute video had defamed his family by linking his sons to the sexual abuse case. However, his lawyer had argued that the police had no locus standi to summon Mr. Gopal as the probe in the case was transferred to the CBI.
