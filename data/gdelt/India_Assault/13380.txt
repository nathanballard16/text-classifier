Allahabad: Man hacks brother to death, injures mother over school control

ALLAHABAD: A man in his thirties allegedly hacked his younger brother to death and grievously injured their mother early on Tuesday apparently because she decided to hand over management of a private school the family runs to her younger son.The incident took place in Chitawanpur village under Utrav police station in Trans-Ganga area of the district. Police have launched a manhunt for prime accused Bhola Singh and his three accomplices who have been named by the elderly woman.Preliminary investigation suggests Bhola, a resident of Naini, and his friends attacked his brother, Gopal Singh (25), with a chopper in Chitawanpur while he was sleeping. Their mother, Indradevi (62), tried to save him but in vain. While Gopal bled to death before he could be taken to hospital, his mother is admitted to Swaroop Rani Nehru Hospital, where her condition is stated to be critical.SP (Trans-Ganga) NK Singh said after the death of her husband Jung Bahadur, Indradevi took charge of the school. “The mother had reportedly handed over charge to the younger son or was planning to do so, and this was not acceptable to the elder son. The latter attacked his own brother and their mother,” Singh said.The SP added that Indradevi had named her elder son Bhola and his friends, Rajkumar, Phool Chandra and Deepak, in her statement. “She told police she made a futile attempt to save her younger son. She was also attacked with the sharp-edged weapon and left critically injured. We are looking for Bhola and the others.”A case under Section 302 (murder) and 307 (attempt to murder) of the IPC has been lodged against the four.
