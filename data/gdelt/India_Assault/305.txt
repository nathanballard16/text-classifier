Three days after unidentified persons hurled bombs at the Nedumangad Police Station in Thiruvananthapuram during a state-wide bandh called by the Sabarimala Karma Samiti, a video has emerged in which four men, allegedly belonging to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, could be seen hurling country-made bombs at the police.

The police have claimed to have identified the assailants as RSS workers. In the video, now accessed by India Today, a person identified as Praveen could be seen taking aim at the station and throwing bombs. A case has been filed against four persons associated with the RSS and a district campaigner. Praveen, however, is still absconding.

The January 3 bandh was called to protest against the entry of two women, Bindu and Kanaka Durga, who entered Sabarimala temple early on Wednesday morning.

Sabarimala Karma Samithi, an umbrella organisation of various pro-Hindutva groups, earlier alleged "mysterious link between CPI(M) and radical outfits to destroy" the traditions of the Lord Ayyappa temple. In a meeting of the Samiti leaders, they also sought an NIA probe into the entry of two women into Sabarimala temple with "the support of a Maoist group, hurting sentiments of devotees of Lord Ayyappa".

BJP leaders said they would support the Samiti's agitation to protect faith of Lord Ayyappa devotees and removal of Pinarayi Vijayan from the state's chief ministership.
