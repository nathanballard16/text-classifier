Badshah on calling Kartik Aaryan overrated: Don't know why I named him, he is a brilliant actor

Badshah, who is all set to make a splash in Bollywood with Shilpi Dasgupta's Khandaani Shafakhana, raised eyebrows when he called Kartik Aaryan the most overrated actor in Bollywood during the Rapid Fire round on Koffee With Karan.

In a recent interview with Mumbai Mirror, the rapper-turned-actor admitted that he actually found him to be a brilliant actor. "I don't know why I named him, maybe because we were talking about Kartik during the break. It just came out but the fact is that he is a brilliant actor with a very good script sense. When I told Kartik, I was acting, he joked, 'Beta, ab tu dekh,'" Badshah said.

When Kartik appeared on Koffee With Karan and was told that Badshah found him overrated, the actor was quite surprised. "Badshah called me overrated? But I love his work. I really appreciate his music," he said.

"I mean, he's the one who has actually called me after Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety and said that 'Paaji, I love your work, and I loved Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety aur meri poori family aapki fan hai.' So I don't know why he said that but I really love his music. I seriously appreciate his work," he added.

Currently, Badshah is gearing up for the release of Khandaani Shafakhana, which marks his foray into acting. The film, which also stars Sonakshi Sinha and Varun Sharma, is about a young woman who inherits s sex clinic after her uncle dies. It is scheduled to release on August 2.
