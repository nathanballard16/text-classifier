Court orders Arzoo Govitrikar's 'abusive' husband Siddharth to not enter their Worli house

TV actress Arzoo Govitrikar, who is the sister of popular model-actress Aditi Govitrikar, had earlier filed a complaint against her husband, Siddharth Sabharwal for repeatedly assaulting her in a drunken state. The Dadar Metropolitan Court last month ordered Sabharwal not to enter their Worli house until further notice. The magistrate also prohibited Sabharwal from accosting Govitrikar. Previously, Arzoo lived with Siddharth at their house in Pochkanawala Road in Worli, but she moved out of it in February after being subjected to 'brutal assault' at 4 am in the bathroom. The magistrate did not hear Sabharwal's side and his order stated that he "was satisfied that an ex-parte order was necessary, as the photographs attached with Arzoo’s complaint prima facie suggested that she had been subjected to domestic violence".





In the month of February, Arzoo had submitted footage from CCTV cameras in her house and told the police that she has been subjected to physical and mental torture for the past many years. On February 19, Arzoo had filed a complaint which stated how her husband on February 15 'had dragged her inside the bathroom around 4 am and hit her viciously after consuming alcohol. He had also threatened to kill her entire family. In an earlier incident, he had spat on her as well. The couple got married in March 2010 and have a five-year-old son, who had been taken away by Siddharth in his custody without Arzoo's consent. The police have booked Siddharth. However, he had denied the allegations and told Mirror, "It was she who asked me to slap her saying she was rehearsing for a crime show. I will respond to these allegations at the right forum."
