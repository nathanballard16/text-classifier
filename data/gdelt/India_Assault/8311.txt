Canâ€™t claim we are sanctimonious, not afraid of arrest: Kamal Haasan stands by his Godse remark

New Delhi:

Makkal Needhi Maiam founder Kamal Haasan on Friday backed his remarks that Mahatma Gandhi killer Nathuram Godse was free India’s "first Hindu extremist", saying that all the religions have their own terrorists and that no one can claim to be sanctimonious.

"I feel the quality of polity is going down. I don't feel threatened. Every religion has their own terrorists, we cannot claim that we are sanctimonious. History shows that all religions have their extremists," Haasan said.

The actor-turned-politician, who faced backlash from BJP leaders and attacked during a rally, said that he was not afraid of being arrested as whatever he said was an "historic truth".

"I am not afraid of being arrested. Let them arrest me. If they do that it will only create more problems. It is not a warning but only an advice," he said.

On Thursday, two unidentified persons allegedly hurled eggs and stones at the Makkal Needhi Maiam founder during a rally in Tamil Nadu’s Aravakurichi. Following the attack, MNM workers roughed up the attackers who were later taken into police custody.

The incident comes a day after footwear was hurled towards a vehicle from which Haasan was addressing an election meeting in the Tirupparankundram Assembly constituency in the state on Wednesday evening.

Meanwhile, terror accused BJP candidate from Bhopal, Pragya Singh Thakur has apologised for hailing Godse. Reacting to Haasan’s remarks, the accused of Malegaon terrorist attack had said that Nathuram Godse was a “deshbhakt” (patriot) and those calling him a terrorist should instead look at themselves.

Godse, who was allegedly associated with Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), had killed Mahatma Gandhi in Delhi on January 30, 1948. He shot the ‘father of the nation’ in the chest three times at point-blank range. He was said to be an advocate of Hindu nationalism.
