Unnao Rape Survivor 'Not Stabbed' Before Burning: UP Police

New Delhi:

The Unnao rape survivor, who is battling for life, was not stabbed before being burnt alive on Thursday, police said. “The 5 December medical report of Unnao woman who was set ablaze yesterday, states, ‘no stabbing, only burn injuries’,” Inspector General (Law and Order) Pravin Kumar said. The woman was set afire by five men, including two accused of raping her, while she was on her way to court. One of the two men accused of raping her last year was granted bail 10 days back. The other man had been on the run.

The rape survivor from Unnao, who was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to the Safdarjung Hospital, is extremely critical and on ventilator, doctors attending to her said.

All the five men involved in Thursday morning's attack were arrested within hours and the victim airlifted in the evening from the Shyama Prasad Mukherjee Hospital in Lucknow to Delhi.

Meanwhile, the woman’s uncle has alleged that he has been threatened with "dire consequences" by relatives of the accused.

The victim's uncle, who lives in a rented house here and runs a small shop, told reporters that a relative of the accused Shivam had called him and threatened that he will have to face "dire consequences".

"Your shop will be set on fire and will not let you live," the victim's uncle described the caller as saying.

"I am going to inform the police and demand action in this regard," he said.

When asked about the threat, Superintendent of Police, Vikrant Veer said, "An information was received in this regard that a distant relative of the victim was threatened. We are making arrangements for his security and there will be no laxity in it."

When asked whether the person, who received threat was the victim's uncle or her distant relative, the SP said, "It does not matter. We will provide him security."
