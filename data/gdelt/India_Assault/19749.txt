The ambulance carrying Unnao rape survivor covered a distance of 13 km from the Indira Gandhi International airport to Safdarjung Hospital in 18 minutes.

"We have set up a dedicated ICU under the observation of Dr Shalab Kumar - Head of Burn and Plastic Surgery at Safdarjung hospital," hospital medical superintendent Dr Sunil Gupta had said adding that all the preparations for her treatments have been made.

The woman, who has suffered about 90 per cent of extensive burn injuries, was first referred to a Lucknow hospital from Unnao and then was shifted to Safdarjung Hospital for proper medical treatment.
