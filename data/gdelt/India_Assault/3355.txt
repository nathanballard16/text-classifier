Chennai: Police arrested a man in Kanyakumari on charges of sexual harassment of a 13-year-old student after luring her with the promise that he was in ‘love’ with her. The accused, identified as 31-year-old Subin, is a resident of Sengal near Kaliyakkavilai in Kanyakumari district.

He got friendly with a 13-year-old student in the same locality by telling her that he loved her. Some days ago, Subin took the girl on his two-wheeler to the Sitraar forest area. It was there that the accused allegedly sexually assaulted her. The girl later narrated the incident to her class teacher.

The shocked teacher informed the child welfare officials in Tiruvanathapuram. The officials sent the girl for a medical examination which confirmed that she had been sexually assaulted. The officials then filed a complaint at the Parasalasi police station. After an extended manhunt for Subin, police succeeded in arresting him. After questioning, they took him in remand.

On similar grounds, police have arrested a horse rider on Marina beach, identified as Chellakutti, under POCSO Act for sexually assaulting a Class 7 student. The arrest has been made based on the complaint filed by the girl’s father.
