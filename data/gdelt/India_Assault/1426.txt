Amrutha was 5 months pregnant when Pranay was killed by contract killers hired by none other than her father Maruti Rao. Amrutha voiced her anguish in the interviews to the media and through social media. She stood firmly against all the pressures and demanded that her father be punished for murdering her husband without a thought for their unborn baby.

For voicing out her opinion she was trolled by many who supported caste hegemony and justified the killing of Pranay.

After braving all the harsh trolls and media glare, Amrutha gave birth to a baby boy in a normal delivery in a private hospital in Hyderabad. Her father-in-law shared with the media that the location of mother and child have been kept in a safe location for fear of any further harm to the child.

All her well-wishers are happy that after all the suffering Amrutha has been blessed with a bundle of joy while some, including Amrutha say that Pranay has been reborn.

However some activists feel that tagging the new born as ‘Pranay re-born’ is forcing a context on the child.
