Autopsy rules out foul play in death of VG Siddhartha

The Wenlock District Hospital that conducted the postmortem examination of Cafe Coffee Day founder-owner VG Siddhartha’s body confirmed death due to drowning as the cause on Friday.

“Water in lungs confirms death due to drowning,” the postmortem report said, while ruling out any foul play.

Siddhartha, son-in-law of former Karnataka Chief Minister SM Krishna, was found dead on Wednesday, two days after he went missing mysteriously near Mangaluru in Karnataka. After he went missing on Monday night, a massive search operation was launched along Netravati River and Siddhartha’s body was found after more than 24 hours.

Hours after he went missing, a letter written by him to Board of Directors and CCD employees appeared in the media. He had mentioned in the letter that he had “failed” and was “succumbing to the situation”. In the letter, the CCD founder talked about his “failure to create the right business model” despite his “best efforts”. He also accused a DG of Income Tax department of harassment, saying, “There was a lot of harassment from the previous DG income tax in the form of attaching our shares”. He owned a direct stake of 32.75% in CCD, together with his family, which controls 53.93% of the coffee chain. CCD, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, opened its first cafe in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bengaluru and was listed in S&P BSE 500 in 2015. The company also has its presence in Austria, Czech Republic and Malaysia.
