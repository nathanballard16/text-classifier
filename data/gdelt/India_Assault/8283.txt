CPI(M) extends support to MNM leader

Endorses his views at a party meet

The CPI(M) has extended support to MNM leader Kamal Haasan after he received threats from a few quarters for his describing Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse as free India’s first Hindu extremist.

According to CPI(M) State secretary K. Balakrishnan, the party’s State executive council, at its meeting in Chennai, resolved that Mr. Haasan’s speech about Godse was not wrong.

“It is an undeniable truth that Godse, who killed the person who led the freedom movement — Mahatma Gandhi, was an extremist. Those who have a different opinion have a right to present their point of view. But Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji threatened that Mr. Haasan’s tongue would be cut and the Mannargudi Jeeyar had said that he would not be allowed to roam the streets freely. These are against the principles of free speech enshrined in the Constitution and should not be allowed,” he said.

The party also urged the Centre to ensure that Tamils are given first preference in Central government jobs in banks, public sector units etc. in Tamil Nadu.
