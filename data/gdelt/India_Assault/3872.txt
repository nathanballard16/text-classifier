Blast in J&K's Pulwama, 1 civilian injured

A civilian has been injured in a fresh blast in Tral area of Pulwama district in Jammu and Kashmir.

The explosive device was allegedly laid to target security patrol vehicles but ended up injuring a civilian due to a premature explosion.

Reports suggest that the blast took place around 3 am in Amlar area of Tral and created a mood of panic in the neighborhood.

A police team reached the spot to investigate the matter as forces are on high alert amid escalating tension between India and Pakistan.

Meanwhile, shelling activity occurred for over an hour on Friday (March 1) Pakistan troops on forward posts of the Indian Army and civilian areas.

Reports also suggested that Pakistan had violated ceasefire in four sectors - Mendhar, Nowshera, Balakote, Krishna Ghati.

Villagers in Nowshera, across the line of control (LOC) in Jammu, braced the brunt of shelling by Pakistani troops on Friday evening. Mortar shells were strewn around and damaged walls bore witness to escalating India Pakistan tensions.

While Pakistan was attempting to portray an international image of 'peace gesture' by releasing an Indian Air force officer in custody, villagers on the border continued to face the menace of daily ceasefire violations.
