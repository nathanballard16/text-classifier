Rajkot: Two unidentified assailants fired three rounds at the house of a businessman in Shaktinagar Society of Gandhidham in Kutch district on Wednesday night.

According to the complaint lodged by Juned Nathani (44), two unidentified persons arrived at his house on a bike and opened fire.

“The accused duo had come on a bike. One of them got down and started firing from his pistol at the ground floor of Nathani’s house, where his domestic helps live. When they raised alarm, Nathani, who was at the second floor of his house, rushed down and saw two empty cartridges and one live cartridge, which was misfired, lying scattered in the room,” said B S Suthar, inspector with Gandhidham A division police station.

The police suspect that the firing was meant to scare Nathani in order to make him cough up extortion money. Nathani runs an import-export firm of garments.

The police have launched an investigation on basis of a CCTV footage of the crime in which the accused duo is seen committing the crime. However, the one who actually fired the shots had worn a monkey cap, said cops.
