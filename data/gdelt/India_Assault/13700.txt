Doctor assaulted at SSKM one arrested

Kolkata: Despite repeated requests and awareness by police and the state government, a doctor was assaulted again on Monday morning at SSKM Hospital. According to sources, approximately a month ago a youth identified as Md Sakir (30) was admitted at SSKM Hospital with problems in his kidney and chest. Early on Monday morning, Sakir suffered a sudden cardiac arrest and died. But his family members claimed that when Sakir was feeling unwell, they tried to call the doctor as there was no doctor present in the ward. When Dasgupta and other staff tried to resist, they were assaulted.
