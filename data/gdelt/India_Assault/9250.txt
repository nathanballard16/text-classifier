Make Tamil an optional language for study in other states: CM Edappadi Palaniswami

The decision to implement the three-language proposal in non-Hindi speaking states received huge backlash from south Indian states, after which the Centre dropped the provision. Former Karnataka CM Siddaramaiah too hit out at the Union government and said imposing Hindi on other states is a "brutal assault".

With the outrage mainly being sparked in Tamil Nadu, CM Edappadi K Palaniswami tweeted his desire, requesting PM Narendra Modi to include Tamil as an optional language for study in other states, adding it would be a great service to one of the most ancient languages of the world.

Draft policy's older version had English and Hindi being proposed as mandatory languages in non-Hindi speaking states, while a third language was mandatory in Hindi-speaking states.

On Monday, DMK in Tamil Nadu passed a resolution against the Centre's policy and said that the NDA government should not test its patience. The two-language formula devised by Dravidian icon C N Annadurai should be implemented across the country, the DMK proposed Tuesday.

In an editorial, DMK mouthpiece 'Murasoli' demanded a "full-stop" to the issue.

In Tamil Nadu, a two-language formula of Tamil and English is being followed since 1968 after the DMK stormed to power in 1967 under the leadership of Dravidian stalwart and party founder C N Annadurai.

"Their (BJP's) final goal is only Sanskrit," it alleged. Saffron party's precursor Jan Sangh had once said that Sanskrit should be the official language for the whole of India, the DMK alleged.
