My top priority is keeping Americans safe.

Hassan said she met government and military leaders of Afghanistan, US troops and embassy personnel during her visit. "We discussed topics critical to our nation's security, including counterterrorism efforts, drug trafficking and regional stability," she said in a Tweet.

Long-existing tensions between India and Pakistan dramatically escalated in February when a suicide bomber from the Pakistan-based group, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), attacked a convoy of troops in Kashmir's Pulwama. Forty Indian soldiers were killed in the attack, and in retaliation, the Indian Air Force carried out an aerial strike at an alleged JeM camp in Pakistan's Balakot.

Relations between the two traditional foes were further strained when New Delhi stripped the restive Jammu and Kashmir state of its special status in early August. Islamabad, which also claims to be a stakeholder in Kashmir, launched a diplomatic offensive against New Delhi.
