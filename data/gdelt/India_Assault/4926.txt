RAJKOT: A man, who was arrested for his wife’s murder on Thursday, said on Tuesday that he suffered a bout of epilepsy when he strangled his wife in Rajkot.

Police said the accused, identified as Ashok Vadher (40), a resident of Sadguru Nagar on Kuwadawa Road in Rajkot, initially maintained that his wife Varsha Vadher (35) had died naturally.

“After Ashok claimed that Vadher’s death was natural, his father-in-law Vijay Chauhan became suspicious and asked the police to conduct a forensic postmortem of his daughter. The postmortem report confirmed Vadher’s death to have been caused by strangulation. Then, we interrogated Ashok who claimed that in a seizure of epilepsy he had strangled Vadher to death,” said an official from Rajkot B-Division police station.

The crime was committed after the couple had eaten their dinner and retired to their room to sleep.

“Ashok is a silver jewellery maker. He has two children — one son and one daughter. The reason given by him is very bizarre and we are not convinced by it. Therefore, we will produce him before a court here to seek his remand to know the exact reason for the crime,” added the official.
