Techie held for sexual assault

The Bellandur police on Wednesday arrested a 23-year-old software engineer for allegedly sexually assaulting his friend after spiking her fruit juice with a sedative. The alleged incident took place in his apartment at Bellandur in October 2018.

The victim, 32, lodged a complaint on Sunday said the police.

The accused, Michael, had befriended the woman who worked in a well-known hospital, through a common friend, said the police

On October 21, Michael allegedly invited her to his apartment at Bellandur for dinner and expressed his desire to take their relationship forward. In her statement to the police, the woman said she told him that such a relationship would be inappropriate before marriage.

“A few minutes later, he offered her a glass of fruit juice that the complainant alleges had been laced with sedatives. When she lost consciousness, he allegedly raped her,” said the police.

The victim woke up a few hours later and confronted the accused who promised to marry her. However, Michael relocated to Delhi a few weeks later and has allegedly been evading her calls. She approached the police who traced him to his apartment in Bengaluru and arrested him.
