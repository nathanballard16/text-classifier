Suicide not a solution, BJP tells RTC workers

Hyderabad: TSRTC bus driver Srinivas Reddy, one among the 48,000 corporation employees sacked by the state government who set himself ablaze on Saturday, died on Sunday while undergoing treatment at the DRDO Apollo Hospital.

BJP state president K. Laxman said, “The state government’s attitude towards TSRTC employees is atrocious. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao is directly responsible for the death of Srinivas Reddy.” He urged RTC employees not to take any extreme step as the BJP would remain with them till their legitimate deman-ds are accepted and emp-loyees sacked en masse taken back on duty.

Laxman announced that the BJP will fully support the call of TSRTC JAC for statewide Bandh on October 19. The state BJP president and senior party leaders also visited the DRDO Apollo Hospital following the RTC driver’s demise.

Senior BJP leader N. V. Subhash warned the Chief Minister that he will have to face the heat in coming days if he continues to ignore RTC employees and does not accept their demands. Party leader T. R. Sriniwas said it is high time Chandrasekhar Rao gave up his ego and resolved the strike going on since past nine days.
