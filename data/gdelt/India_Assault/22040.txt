The Supreme Court today refused to stay the operation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, being opposed by many Opposition parties across the country even as it agreed to examine its constitutional validity.

Man sets self on fire at India Gate New Delhi: A 25-year-old man set himself ablaze on Wednesday in the Capital and doctors said he had suffered 90 per cent burns. The self-immolation occurred at the India Gate lawns where protesters have been demanding the rescinding of the Citizenship Amendment Act. The police, however, said the act by the youth, identified as Kartik Maher from Odisha, was not connected with the protests. PTI

A three-judge Bench headed by CJI SA Bobde issued notice to the Centre asking it to respond to 59 petitions and posted the matter for hearing on January 22 next year.

The Bench, which also included Justice BR Gavai and Justice Surya Kant, acceded to advocate Ashwini K Upadhyay's suggestion that people should be made aware about CAA’s aims and objectives.

The Centre should consider using audio-visual media to make citizens aware of the amendment, the Bench told Attorney General KK Venugopal, who said the government would do the needful.

Some lawyers for a petitioner from Assam wanted the Bench to stay the operation of the law, saying, “Five students in the North-East have died.”

As Venugopal opposed it, the Bench said, “We are not going to grant a stay.” Arguments on granting stay can be advanced on the next date of hearing, it added.

On behalf of one of the petitioners, senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan said there was no need to stay the amendment as framing of rules had not been done to make it operational. Senior counsel Kapil Sibal agreed with Dhavan's submission.
