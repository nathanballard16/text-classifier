Farm fire fumes now hit home: Punjab air quality turns poor, Haryana’s severe

On a day the share of stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana in Delhi’s pollution rose to 46 per cent, the highest this year prompting a Supreme Court-mandated committee to declare a public health emergency in the national capital, the farm fires continued to rage on in the two states leading to smog like conditions in several areas.

According to data from Punjab and Central Pollution Control Boards, the state has reported a total of 22,137 cases of stubble burning so far, with Tarn Taran district recording 2,614 incidents. This is an increase of 25 per cent over last year, when the state had seen a total of 17,646 farm fire cases up to October 31, an official said.

Haryana has witnessed 4,288 cases of stubble burning till October 31, a bit lower than 4,589 cases recorded in the state in the corresponding period last year, the official said.

A CPCB official said the air quality index (AQI) entered the “severe plus” or “emergency” category in Delhi early Friday morning. According to official data, the overall AQI was 504 at 3.30 am.

An AQI between 0-50 is considered “good”, 51-100 “satisfactory”, 101-200 “moderate”, 201-300 “poor”, 301-400 “very poor”, and 401-500 “severe”. Above 500 is “severe-plus or emergency” category.

Despite lesser number of farm fires reported this harvesting season, most of the Haryana cities recorded the AQI in “severe” category. As per the CPCB data, Jind recorded an AQI of 480 (at 4pm), Rohtak 467 Bhiwani 466, Sirsa 462, Hisar 456, Sonipat 446 and Fatehabad 393.

Comparatively, most of the cities in Punjab recorded “poor” quality air but fared better than Haryana. Except Khanna, where the AQI was 321 mostly due to industrial smoke from Mandi Gobindgarh, the only city that recorded an AQI of 400 was Bathinda, located near near Haryana’s Sirsa.

As per the CPCB data, Amritsar recorded an AQI of 294, Jalandhar 289, Ludhiana 297, Ropar 251, and Patiala 251.

Farmers in the two agrarian states continue to set paddy residue afire despite a ban on this practice. An Indian Express team witnessed a number of farm fires in Fatehabad, Tohana and Jakhal of Haryana and Sangrur of Punjab. The stubble burning affected the visibility even during the day with sunlight completely blocked by a thick blanket of smog.

As per the data from Punjab pollution control board, the state recorded 2268 farm fires recorded on October 31. The highest number of crop burning incidents continue to be reported from Sangrur (355) followed by Ferozepur (290) and Bathinda (233). The figures for other districts include Amritsar (30), Barnala (125), Fatehgarh Sahib (47), Faridkot (105), Fazilka (53), Gurdaspur (43), Hoshiarpur (17), Jalandhar (77), Kapurthala (79), Ludhiana (87), Mansa (142), Moga (133), Muktsar (148), Patiala (193) and Tarn Taran (94).

An analysis of the data sourced from Punjab and CPCB shows that Ferozepur, Patiala and Sangrur districts reported more than 2,000 incidents each up to October 31. Six districts – Amritsar, Bathinda, Gurdaspur, Kapurthala, Mansa and Muktsar – reported more than 1,000 cases of stubble burning each.

Pathankot still remains the only district to have reported only two incidents of stubble burning.

An official of the Punjab Agriculture Department ascribed the rise in number of these cases to early maturity of crop as crop sowing was advanced to June 13 from June 20.

In Haryana, which witnessed 4,288 cases of stubble burning till October 31, a total of 324 complaints have been lodged with the police against farmers.

In Punjab, a fine of Rs 43 lakh was imposed on farmers for defying the ban on stubble burning and fine of Rs 52 lakh was levied on 26 combine harvester operators for not installing super straw management system (SMS).

The super SMS, which is attached to the combine harvester, cuts paddy straw into small pieces and spreads it on the field. As a result, farmers are not required to burn the straw before the sowing of the next crop.

Meanwhile, Secretary Agriculture, Kahan Singh Pannu, directed the officials to remain vigilant during next one week for efficacious execution of measures against stubble burning. Pannu said that all the officials would be tracked from today onwards to check their movements in the field.

He instructed that all field officers should be on field visits everyday after 12.30 pm to keep a close tab on burning paddy stubble. All the officers, except class IV employees, should visits the rural areas to interact with farmers who have got the paddy recently harvested and motivate them not to burn the straw to safeguard the environment as well as human health.

Pannu also directed the officials to click pictures of combine harvesters operating without super SMS ) and forwarded it to PPCB officials to ensure imposition of fine of Rs 2 lakh against each such machine.

Meanwhile, locals have started complaining about difficulty in breathing and burning sensation in eyes due to smog.

“A public health emergency has been declared in Delhi. They have shut the schools too in Delhi. Just look at the state of affairs here. What is our government doing,” asked Tejbir Sandhu, a Patiala farmer.

“The situation is really bad. We cannot breathe. Something should be done for this. It calls for a mass movement for the sake of our health. People should hit the roads and protest. They should demand oxygen cylinders from the government,” said Jagdeep Singh, a farmer from Rajoana Kalan village in Raikot.

Pannu, however, on Thursday had said that the peak number of fires has already been reached earlier this week and a large percentage of grain has also arrived at purchase centres.

“We have already got 116 lakh tonnes of paddy at the centres. We are expecting 180 lakh tonnes so around 65% have already reached. This indicates that in several places, harvest is complete and the number of fires will come down now. The peak is behind us,” he said.

Every year, Punjab and Haryana are blamed for the rising air pollution and smog due to stubble burning by farmers. Punjab alone generates 20 million tonne of paddy stubble annually.
