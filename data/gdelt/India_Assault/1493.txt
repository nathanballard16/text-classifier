Opp leaders stand 'shoulder-to-shoulder' with Didi, BJP condemns 'unprecedented act'

Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, politician Omar Abdullah and several others came out in support of Mamata Banerjee

Support from opposition leaders poured in for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee whose sit-in over the CBI's attempt to question the Kolkata Police commissioner Rajeev Kumar in connection with chit fund scams continued on Monday.

On Sunday, an all-out war broke out between the Centre and the Mamata Banerjee government, with the feisty West Bengal leader beginning her dharna in front of Metro Cinema in Kolkata over the issue.

Support for Banerjee, who is also the Trinamool Congress chief, poured in even as the CBI moved the Supreme Court accusing the Kolkata Police chief of destroying evidence related to the case and him of indulging in contempt of court.

Supporting the West Bengal CM in her fight are leaders from across the country, including Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Andhra Pradesh CM N Chandrababu Naidu, politician Omar Abdullah, CM of Uttar Pradesh Akhilesh Yadav, among several others.

On the other hand, many BJP leaders, including Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, HRD Minister Prakash Javadekar, condemned the act.

Here's who has to say what!
