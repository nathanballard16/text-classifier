4-Inch Devil Horn Removed From Indian Farmer’s Head

An Indian farmer, who’s 74-years-old had to undergo surgery so his 4-inch devil horn could be removed from the top of his skull, which started to grow after he suffered a head injury in 2014.

Shyam Lal Yadav, a farmer from Rahli Village in Madhya Pradesh, India, had a head injury in 2014, which led to the formation of the cutaneous horn on the top of his skull.

Also called as the devil’s horn, the horn started to grow on the top of his head, and became 4 inches long.

Yadav said that he had been getting the growth shaven down by his barber for years, but the elderly man said it started to grow faster.

After seeking medical help, surgeons at the Bhagyoday Tirth Hospital in Sagar City removed the growth.

Dr. Vishal Gajbhiye, a surgeon at the hospital, said, “Around five years ago the patient had hurt his head after which a lump started growing. Initially, he ignored it as it did not cause any discomfort. Also, he got the growth cut by the local barber.”

He added, “But, when the lump hardened and started growing further, he approached the hospital at Sagar. As the horn is composed of keratin, the horn can usually be removed with a sterile razor. However, the underlying condition will still need to be treated.”

The farmer spent 10 days in the hospital while he was recovering from the surgery, and a biopsy of the growth confirmed that the horn is harmless.

Dr. Vishal explained the treatments.

The Dr. said, “Treatments vary, but they can include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Immediately after its removal, skin was grafted on the wound which has now healed completely.”

The details of this case were sent to the International Journal of Surgery, as this type of case rarely happens.
