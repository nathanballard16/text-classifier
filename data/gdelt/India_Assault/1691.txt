Five persons arrested for PMK functionary’s murder

H. Raja calls for re-enactment of anti-religious conversion law

Five persons were arrested on Thursday on the charge of murdering V. Ramalingam, 42, of Thirubhuvanam, a PMK functionary, on Tuesday night.

The Thiruvidaimaruthur police arrested Nizam Ali, 33, Riswan, 23, and Sharbudheen, 60, of Thirubhuvanam, Azarudheen, 26, of Thiruvidaimaruthur and Mohammed Ryas, 27, of Kurichimalai.

They were booked under sections 302, 294b, 307, 341, 143, 147 and 149 of IPC based on a complaint lodged by Ramalingam’s son, Shyamsundar.

When the accused were produced brought to the District Sessions Court at Thanjavur by the police citing a law and order problem, they were directed to the trial court at Kumbakonam.

Subsequently, the accused were taken to the Judicial Magistrate Court-I where their remand in judicial custody was ordered.

Thereafter, the accused were lodged at the Central Prison, Trichy, the police said.

Raja’s charge

Meanwhile, BJP national secretary H. Raja, who called on the grieving family members of Ramalingam, demanded re-enactment of the anti-religious conversion law in Tamil Nadu.

Mr. Raja claimed that Ramalingam was hacked to death only because he had raised his voice against the attempts by the members of the Popular Front of India to convert Hindus into Islam. He accused the police of attempting to brush the truth under the carpet by inquiring others.

Instead of tracing the car the assailants had used to commit the crime, the police impounded Ramalingam’s vehicle and his mobile phone, Mr. Raja also charged.

In 2002, Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had enacted a law against forcible religious conversion.

However, the law was repealed by an ordinance two years later.
