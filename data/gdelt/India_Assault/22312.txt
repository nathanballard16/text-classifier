Indian Politician Is Given Life Sentence for Raping Teenage Girl

NEW DELHI — A court in India sentenced a regional politician to life imprisonment on Friday for raping a teenage girl, bringing partial resolution to a case that transfixed the nation and raised troubling questions about the cost of justice for women.

The politician, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, had been jailed since last year on charges of having brutalized the young woman in 2017, when she was 17. He was convicted on Monday of luring her to his home in northern India with the promise of a job interview and then sexually assaulting her.

The ruling came a few months after the teenager was critically injured in a car crash on a rural highway that killed two of her aunts. The police suspect that Mr. Sengar plotted the collision, in which a truck with a blacked-out license plate rammed into the vehicle carrying the women. A verdict in that charge, and in other cases related to the rape of the teenager, is pending.

For months, the teenager, whose name has not been released, maintained that Mr. Sengar, who is thought to be in his 50s, had repeatedly threatened to kill members of her family for speaking out. The teenager’s father was beaten to death last year after discussing the case.
