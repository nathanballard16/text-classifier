PM Modi: Police must make women feel safe

NEW DELHI/PUNE: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday stressed on the need for an image makeover of the police so that they inspire confidence among all sections, including women and children, besides emphasising how crucial effective policing was to making women feel safe and secure.The stress laid by Modi during his valedictory address at the DGP/IGPs conference in Pune on making the police more citizen-friendly comes in the wake of two recent cases of sexual violence against women reported from Telangana and UP. In one of these cases, where a young veterinarian doctor in Hyderabad was burnt to death after being allegedly gang-raped, the four arrested accused were shot dead by Hyderabad police in an encounter days after the crime.Modi on Sunday commended police chiefs of all states, particularly J&K and UP, as well as central paramilitary forces, for keeping the country safe and incident-free in the wake of abrogation of Article 370 in J&K and the Ayodhya verdict.Earlier, in his inaugural address at the conference, home minister Amit Shah underscored the government’s resolve to initiate changes in the Indian Penal Code and Criminal Procedure Code to make them more conducive to the current democratic set-up. He described the conference as a ‘Vaicharik Kumbh’, where top policemen of the country come together on one platform to formulate policy decisions pertaining to national security.This year, a PMO release said, 11 core groups brainstormed on aspects such as terrorism, Naxalism, coastal security, cyber threats, combating radicalisation in the digital age, narco-terrorism, border protection, upgrade of forensic capabilities and evidence-based policing. Modi praised the police brass for generating good inputs for policy planning and implementation, and emphasised on emergence of concrete outcomes from the finalised action points.The PM expressed satisfaction at the manner in which the DGP/IGP conference had transformed from a one-day meet to a three-day brainstorming affair since 2015. Unlike earlier when the police brass would meet only in Delhi, the conference was taken to different parts of the country. Even the format of the conference changed with the PM and the home minister being involved in the discussions.As per the new format, committees of DGPs are established in the lead-up to the conference to formulate the contours of presentations, which focus on contemporary security threats. During the conference, break-out sessions are held to further refine policy issues.Modi urged heads of police departments to carry forth the spirit of the conference right down to the police station. After listening to the presentations by different state police forces, he suggested that a comprehensive list of best practices be prepared and adopted by all states and UTs.The PM further said technology was an effective weapon to ensure proactive policing which also factored in the feedback of the common man.
