VADODARA: The Chhani police have booked four persons for assaulting a 27-year-old whom they suspected of being a child lifter. Bharat Bagel, a resident of Bhind in Madhya Pradesh, was travelling by train to Delhi. Bagel, a coolie, told the cops that he was on his way to Delhi from Mumbai to meet his father.

According to the police, he got down at Vadodara railway station to get some water to drink. He missed his train so he began looking for another train to reach his destination. “Bagel somehow reached Dashrath village and some locals spotted him. Four persons questioned him and began assaulting him as they thought he was there to kidnap children,” the police said.

Bagel suffered minor injuries and was taken to SSG Hospital. The police have booked the four unidentified persons for assault and have begun search for the accused.
