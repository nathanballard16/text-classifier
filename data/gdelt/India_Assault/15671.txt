Gang-rape survivor goes missing again

Ludhiana: A 16-year-old girl, who was gang-raped by five accused in May, has again gone missing from her house on Saturday night. The girl’s family has alleged that they were suspecting the same accused persons for confining their daughter in custody, as one of the accused — who is a juvenile — is out on bail. On the father’s complaint, police have registered a case under Section 346 (wrongful confinement) of the IPC.

Investigating officer ASI Harbhajan Singh said, “On Saturday, the girl was at home with her parents when she suddenly left the house without informing anyone. The family suspects the same five accused for confining their daughter in custody. However, four accused are lodged in jail, and one juvenile accused is out on bail. The police have taken the juvenile accused into custody for questioning, but he is not aware of the girl’s whereabouts. The police are further investigating the case to trace the girl.
