International organizations have rejected Indian narrative over Pulwama incident:

Brigadier, retired, Tipu Sultan (Independent Defense Analyst): India calls itself a secular state and use to hide behind the baseless allegations on Pakistan. Not only Pakistan but Indian people are also the victims of Indian aggressions. Indian cruel face has been exposed in front of the world. All the international organizations have rejected the narrative of India over Pulwama incident. Despite of having modern technology weapons and huge army, India still could not fight with Pakistan. Pakistan's government and military establishment can respond strongly to any Indian diplomatic or military pressure on this issue. Pakistan has strong evidences of Indian involvement in efforts to destabilize Pakistan. The tense nuclear stand-off between India and Pakistan may be the most dangerous in today’s world. International experts and analysts believe India lacks the intelligence and capabilities needed to execute targeted strikes or wage a limited war in Pakistani territory.
