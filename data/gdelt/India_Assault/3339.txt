MP twins' murder: Why did cops stumble around for 12 days?

Police say the twins were transported across state lines and into UP after two days. If the borders were sealed, and more than 500 cops were swarming the little town, how did the gang get past them with the twins? But the only outsider with daily access to the twins — tutor Ramkesh Yadav — wasn’t on the list.How tight was the border sealed? A police officer admitted that with such resources, a house-to-house search would have taken two to three days.The twins were in town for two days, and alive for ten. BHOPAL: Twelve days of investigation by a force of 500, two IGs leading the team, cyber cops at hand, inter-state coordination, and yet police could not rescue abducted twins Priyansh and Shreyansh in time.
