Tensions between Pakistan and India have deepened ever since New Delhi scrapped Article 370, which gave Jammu & Kashmir a degree of autonomy. Pakistan has downgraded diplomatic ties with India, and lashed out at India for its "assault on Kashmir".

Times Square, a commercial hub in New York, US, is one of the best-recognised locations in the world, drawing thousands of tourists every day.
