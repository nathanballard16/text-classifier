Hotel Mumbai trailer: Dev Patel and Armie Hammer star in movie inspired by 2008 terror attack

On November 26, 2008, a wave of devastating terror attacks throughout Mumbai catapulted the bustling Indian metropolis into chaos.

In the heart of the city’s tourist district, Jihadist terrorists laid siege to the iconic Taj Palace Hotel, whose guests and staff became trapped in a heroic, day-long fight for survival.

Now the survivors' stories have inspired director Anthony Maras' directorial debut.

The film is based on the 2009 documentary Surviving Mumbai.

The Mumbai terror attack consisted of 12 coordinated shootings and bombings lasting four days.

At least 174 people died, including the nine attackers, and more than 300 people were wounded.
