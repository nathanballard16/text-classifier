Ranbir Kapoor and Ranveer Singh are the most stylish men in Bollywood, says Yami Gautam

Yami Gautam made her Bollywood debut with Ayushmann Khurrana’s Vicky Donor and right after her debut film, Yami became a household name. Post Vicky donor, Yami was seen in films such as Kaabil, Bala, Badlapur, Sanam Re, Kaabil, URI and others, and with every film Yami has only multiplied her fan following. Now during a recent interview, Yami Gautam was asked about the most stylish men in the Hindi film industry and Yami said that according to her, Ranveer Singh and Ranbir Kapoor are the most stylish men. “I think Ranveer (Singh) is quite stylish, even Ranbir (Kapoor). I think it is not just about the clothes that you wear but also about the kind of personality that you have and how you portray it onscreen,” said Yami.

Yami, who is quite fashionable herself and makes a style statement every time she steps out- be it for an awards night or airport, she nails her look and when she was asked to define her style, she said, "Style is an expression of your personality. I have been styled by (celebrity stylist) Allia Al Rufai and I think she understands my style. I feel versatility is necessary when it comes to style but at the same time, it's good to experiment. I feel you shouldn't wear clothes that make you feel awkward and uncomfortable.”

In the wake of the #CAA Protests, and reacting to the Delhi Police assault on students of Jamia Millia Islamia University, who were protesting against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), Yami said, “I think first of all peace is really important, and it is needed at all ends. We need to stop violence whether it is related to students, police or anybody for that matter. I would say peace and harmony is the need of the hour.” On the work front, Yami Gautam will next be seen in Puneet Khanna's "Ginny Weds Sunny" along with Vikrant Massey.
