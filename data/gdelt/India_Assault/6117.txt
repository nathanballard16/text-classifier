Mumbai: Strangled girl after rape, admits accused

"After raping the girl, Gundappa dumped her dead body in the gutter between two stalls of a public toilet. Gundappa's family were booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code for criminal intimidation (section 506(2)), intentional insult (section 504), wrongful restraint (section 341) and common intention (section 34). The police had arrested Gundappa on Saturday after the victim's body was recovered in a mildly decomposed state from the gutter of a public toilet. A day after the 35-year-old paedophile was arrested by Juhu Police for kidnapping, raping and killing a nine-year-old girl, he confessed to have smothered and strangulated the victim to death. Apart from Gundappa, four of his family members were arrested for obstructing the probe.
