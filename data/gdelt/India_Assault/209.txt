Dumbriguda to get its own functional police station from Sankranti

To shift from Araku Police Station soon

Dumbriguda will have an operational police station working out of the mandal headquarters in the next couple of days, Superintendent of Police (Visakhapatnam-Rural) Attada Babujee said on Friday.

The move comes in the wake of instructions issued by DGP R.P. Thakur to have an operational police station in Dumbriguda up and running at the earliest, said Mr. Babujee. The existing police station for Dumbriguda, housed on the premises of the Araku Police Station, was vandalised and set afire by locals after Araku MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma were killed by Maoists on September 23 near Livitiput village in Dumbriguda mandal in Visakhapatnam Agency.

Incensed by the fact that the village’s police station was housed in Araku locals set fire to the Dumbriguda Police Station despite the presence of a contingent of the AP Special Police.

During the investigation, police realised the need for a full-fledged police station in Dumbriguda.

The twin murders, followed by the mob’s ransacking of the Dumbriguda Police Station, resulted in several suspensions and transfers of policemen. The case was taken over by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in December.

Dumbriguda was sanctioned a permanent police station block by the government at Dumbriguda mandal headquarters about four years ago. However, the building then had to accommodate the tribal welfare hostel students. Since then, the police station began operating out of a building on the premises of the Araku Police Station.
