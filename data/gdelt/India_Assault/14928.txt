I had suggested that he marry me, but he refused. He would then harass me and even said that if I wanted to earn money I should work for the ISIS as a nurse. When I refused, he abandoned me in 2017, she also said.

The confession comes in the midst of the National Investigation Agency investigating scores of cases in which several persons have left Kerala to join the ISIS. Many had alleged that there is a deep rooted network to trap women, convert them forcibly and then get them to join the terror group.
