Youth held for stoning neighbour to death

A 20-year-old youth, who had allegedly stoned his neighbour to death along with two accomplices, was arrested from Narela here, police said Wednesday.

The suspect has been identified as Bhupender, a resident of Narela, they said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP), Crime, Ram Gopal Naik said, "A 50-year-old woman from Narela had complained that her son Ajay Kumar (22) was abducted around 6 pm on Sunday."



According to the woman, she and her son had gone to purchase milk from Vijay Chowk in Narela.

Her son was walking at a distance from her, when a car stopped nearby, two persons came out of it and abducted Ajay, the woman told the police.

Naik said she had identified one of the assailants as Mohit, a resident of their area.

Later, Ajay was found dead near the Kundli-Ghaziabad Peripheral Expressway on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday.

His face was badly smashed with stones, he said. The autopsy was conducted on Tuesday.

Police said they got a tip-off Wednesday that Bhupender, who had allegedly killed Ajay along with his two accomplices, was roaming around the Mansa Devi temple in Narela. He was arrested around 8.40 am, police added.

"During the probe, it was found that Ajay and Mohit had a fight over a trivial issue. Ajay had beaten up Bhupender and his friends on Saturday," police said, adding that, thereafter, Mohit and Bhupender decided to kill Ajay, taking the help of their common friend Golu.

"As per their plan, they reached near Ajay's house in Mohit's car on Sunday afternoon. As soon as Ajay was spotted roaming around, they abducted him and took him to the KMP Flyover in Kundli," the DCP said.

They thrashed Ajay and when he fell unconscious, they pulled him out of the car, crushing his head and face with stones, police said.

Police are trying to nab the other suspects.
