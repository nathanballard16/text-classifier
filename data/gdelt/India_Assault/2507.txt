Pulwama attack: Kazakhstan urges world community to implement international obligations on counter-terrorism

Astana [Kazakhstan], Feb 17 (ANI): Strongly condemning Thursday's deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, Kazakhstan on Saturday called on the international community to implement international obligations on counter-terrorism.

Extending condolences to the family members of the 40 CRPF personnel, who were killed in the attack, Kazakhstan's Foreign Affairs Ministry said that countering terrorism is the main task of the global community.

"Strongly condemn the terrorist act in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, which resulted in death and injuries of a large number of soldiers. Kazakhstan calls on world community to implement international obligations on counter-terrorism in practice," the ministry said in a statement.

"We stand in solidarity with the people of India in struggle against this menace of 21st century. We express deep condolences to the families and relatives of the victims," it added.

The 40 security personnel lost their lives after a suicide bomber attacked a CRPF convoy in Pulwama district with a vehicle laden with explosives.

The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2,500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based terrorist group, claimed the responsibility for the attack which left the bus extensively damaged in the blast.

Over 50 countries have condemned the barbaric attack and expressed support to India in its fight against terrorism.

Reflecting the outrage in the country, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said, “The blood of Indians is boiling.” He issued a clear warning to Pakistan, declaring that the “guardians” of the perpetrators of the Pulwama terror attack will be “definitely punished.” (ANI)
