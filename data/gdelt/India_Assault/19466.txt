NEW DELHI, Dec. 3 (Xinhua) -- Students at a government-run school in northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh found a dead rat in their cooked mid-day meal, local television news channel NDTV reported Tuesday.

The meal served to the students under the policy of providing free mid-day meal in schools was prepared by a non-governmental organization Jan Kalyan Sanstha (public welfare committee) in Hapur town of Muzaffarnagar district, about 436 km northwest of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.

"As we took dal (lentils) with a spoon we saw a mouse... It was in the bottom of a container of urad dal (black gram)," NDTV quoted Shivang, a Class 6 student as saying. "Apart from the nine students who fell ill, the food had also been served to 15 other students."

The local government so far has not made a statement on the matter.

The news channel said the district's top official has initiated a probe and ordered registration of a first information report (FIR) against the committee that oversees the mid-day meal in the school.

Last week a video from the state's Sonbhadra district showed a cook at a school mixing a one-liter packet of milk with a bucket of water to feed over 80 students as a mid-day meal.

The video was recorded by a village committee member.

In India, free Mid-Day Meal Scheme was launched by the government to tackle hunger and boost attendance in government-run primary schools.
