Kashmiri student assaulted, beaten up with iron rods in India's Bengaluru

Absar Zahoor Dhar, 24, told the media he was not aware as to why he was attacked by a group of people while he was having coffee at a nearby shop after gym in Bengaluru, India.

BENGALURU: A 24-year-old civil-engineering student and model from Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) was attacked by a violent mob in India's Bengaluru and beaten up with iron rods.



Speaking about his ordeal, the victim, Absar Zahoor Dhar, told the media he was not aware as to why he was attacked by a group of people while he was having coffee at a nearby shop after gym.

Almost four to five people, he said, armed with iron rods dragged him out of the shop and started beating him on March 19. Dhar sustained injuries on his hand, head and face after the attack.

The victim, who funds his studies through modeling, said he continues to live in fear.

"The assailants are roaming freely in front of my house and I am not able to attend college as well," he said.

The attacks on individuals with Kashmiri origins have increased following the killing of 44 Indian soldiers in Pulwama suicide blast.



Earlier this month, some Kashmiri vendors were thrashed by Indian right-wing extremist party members and it was only recently that a Muslim family in Gurgaon was attacked by a violent mob on Holi.

Police, however, in Absar Dhar’s case denied it had anything to do with the Pulwama attack.
