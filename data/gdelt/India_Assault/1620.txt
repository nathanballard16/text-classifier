No regrets, says Hindu Mahasabha leader held for recreating Bapu’s assassination

Aligarh (Uttar Pradesh) [India], Feb 6 (ANI): Hindu Mahasabha leader Pooja Pandey who was arrested on Tuesday for re-enacting the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi said she has no regrets and was merely exercising her constitutional rights.

"We have not murdered anyone, we have used our constitution rights. I don't have any guilt. We don't have any complaint against the government, they are forced to do what they are doing" Pandey said.

Her husband Ashok Pandey said, "We are doing our job, the police are doing their job. This is the unfortunate plight of independent India. People who are disrespecting the country are roaming free, while people like us are being arrested."

On January 30, at an event in Aligarh, Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha secretary Pooja recreated Gandhi's assassination by shooting an effigy of Mahatma Gandhi and hailed the killer Nathuram Godse. (ANI)
