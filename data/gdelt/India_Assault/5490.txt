NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- India's main opposition party - the Indian National Congress (INC) on Monday made a poll promise of providing an income support of 72,000 Indian Rupees (about 1,028 U.S. dollars) per annum to the 20 percent of the poorest families in the country, if the party was able to form the next government after the ensuing general elections.

Rahul Gandhi, INC president, termed this announcement as the final "assault on poverty" in the country.

India faces a seven-phased election beginning April 11. Votes are scheduled to be counted on May 23.

Announcing the party's election promise, Gandhi said that he and his party members had studied the fiscal implications of the scheme.

"20 percent of the poorest families will be given an income support of 72,000 Indian Rupees every year. All modalities have been worked out and this is possible within our budget. We have studied fiscal implications of the scheme," Gandhi said while addressing media persons in the Indian capital.

The INC president, who is also a lawmaker, further said that the amount will be directly transferred to the bank accounts of the poor. "50 million families and 250 million members of these families will directly benefit from the scheme. We will end poverty in this country," Gandhi said.

Meanwhile, the INC is yet to come out with its final election manifesto ahead of the general polls.
