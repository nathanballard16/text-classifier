Kolkata: Political turmoil continues to escalate in West Bengal as 32 seats in the state are set to go to polls in next four phases starting April 29. However, tensions between the ruling Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party rages on with Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and Prime Minister Narendra Modi constantly at loggerheads.

In yet another incidence of violence in the poll-bound state, a poultry farm of a BJP worker was set ablaze allegedly by TMC workers in Nanoor area of Bengal’s Birbhum district.

According to a Times Now report, BJP worker Saptarshi Gupta had apparently attended a rally conducted by PM Modi in Bolpur a day ago, which is why he was allegedly targetted by TMC workers in the wee hours of the morning.

Gupta returned last night after attending PM’s rally and later woke up to flames at his poultry farm. The blaze had charred over 2500 chickens. Though the BJP has blamed the TMC, no arrests have been made yet. This is the third incident of violence since last evening where BJP workers have been allegedly targeted by TMC because of their attendance at PM’s meeting in Bolpur.

Earlier this week, three people were injured on April 23, the day the third phase of voting was conducted after a crude bomb was hurled at them by unidentified men in Domkal municipality in Murshidabad, West Bengal. According to ANI, the three victims are TMC workers and in a video that surfaced online showed some unidentified men hurling bombs near polling booth number 27, 28 in Rani Nagar, which were later closed by the authorities.

Either constituencies in West Bengal will go to polls on April 29 in the fourth phase, while polling in 7 seats will take place on May 6 (fifth phase), 8 on May 12 (sixth phase) and 9 on May 19 (seventh and final phase).
