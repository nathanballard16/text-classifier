Guruvayur temple authorities received message threatening to assassinate PM Modi ahead of his June 8 visit

Beginning his 35-minute-long speech in Malayalam, Modi said, "My dear brothers and sisters, May you all have blessings of Guruvayoorappan (Lord Krishna of Guruvayur temple)." He described Guruvayur as "Bhooloka Vaikunta" (Vaikunta of Lord Vishnu in Earth).

The threat message, which was written on a Rs 500 note was sent in an envelope to the temple authorities on June 7, a day prior to PM Modi’s visit; following which the security at the hospital was further beefed up. As per reports, the message was written in local language Malayalam. Clad in a traditional Kerala 'mundu' (dhoti) and a round-neck half sleeve kurta, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Guruvayur and offered prayers. He changed into the customary white mundu and shawl before going to the famed Lord Krishna temple. PM Modi then addressed the BJP workers of the state.
