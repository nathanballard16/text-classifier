Watch: Kashimri Muslim lynched, forced to chant anti-Pakistan slogan

An undated video of a Kashmiri Muslim man has surfaced online who was ‘lynched and assaulted by Hindu nationalist mob and forced to chant “Death to Pakistan”.



The mob is heard abusing the boy harshly and forcing him to obey them.

The video, shared by US-based journalist CJ Werleman, shows the police supporting the angry group of people gathered there.

“When Indian police arrived, they forced the boy to obey the violent mob. No arrests made!” the journalist said on Twitter.

The boy kept asking for water but no one listened to him.

Kashmiri Muslims are now being harassed across India by the extremists elements since a new wave of anti-Muslim campaign is launched after the Pulwama attack.
