Two-year-old’s organs save four young lives

In an extraordinary gesture, parents of a two-year-old boy from Pune donated his organs after the doctors declared him brain dead at the Bombay Hospital on Sunday. In death, Ivaan Prabhu, gave a new lease of life to four children suffering from end-stage diseases.

The toddler was operated for a brain tumour on Tuesday, but his condition did not improve. His parents, who were well aware of the concept of organ donation, consented to donate all his organs. While his heart was flown to Chennai for transplant, his liver and kidneys were transplanted to patients in Mumbai hospitals. All the organ recipients are minors between three to four years of age. His corneas were sent to an eye bank in Parel.

Amol Kadam, a transplant coordinator from Wockhardt Hospital who was sent to Bombay Hospital for the transplant, said the parents were extremely determined to donate Ivaan’s organs. “They said they wanted their child to remain alive somewhere in the other children,” Mr. Kadam said.

This was the 11th cadaver organ donation in Mumbai this year.
