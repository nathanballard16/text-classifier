Battleground Delhi: Powerful Images Show The Aftermath Of Protests Against CAB

The Citizenship (Amendment) Act has been called "divisive" and in violation of the Constitution by at least 500 noted Indian personalities, who have asked the government to withdraw it.

Protests against the Citizenship Act began on Sunday, in Jamia, reached their crescendo as violence broke out. Buses were set ablaze and conflicting reports continue to raise suspicion over what the actual cause of violence was. The police, however, clamped down on students on a massive scale that hasn't been seen before. As the television channels played out live footage of the turmoil that was taking place inside one of the most prestigious and credible universities of the country, chill ran down the spines of Indians watching the events unfold in utter shock and with a sense of dismay.
