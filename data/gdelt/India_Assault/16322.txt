Lucknow Confidential: The Lull In Between

Priyanka Gandhi Priyanka Gandhi

After Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra aggressively took on the BJP government over the killings of tribals in a Sonbhadra village, the party failed to pursue vigorously any other issue against the state government. In the case of alleged sexual assault case on a law student by former BJP MP Chinmayanand, the Samajwadi Party took a lead by protesting outside Shahjahanpur jail where the student has been lodged. On the other hand, Priyanka kept tweeting on the issue, accusing the Yogi Adityanath government of trying to shield the rape accused leader. After a letter was sent to Priyanka by the father of the jailed law student who has accused Chinmayanand of rape, the Congress has again swung into action. The party has announced five-day “Nyaya Yatra” in support of the student — from Shahjahanpur to Lucknow. To make its presence felt in the state, the Congress has asked its senior leaders to lead the march. Though, it is to be seen that in the absence of Priyanka, how many leaders are able to join the yatra, especially considering that the party is weighing its option to finalise the next president of the state unit following the resignation by Raj Babbar.
