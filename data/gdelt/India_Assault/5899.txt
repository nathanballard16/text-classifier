PM Modi salvaged Hyderabad Woman from Somalia

According to sources Prime Minister Narendra Modi's personal intervention has led to the rescue of an Indian Muslim woman who had been held captive and tortured in Somalia by her in-laws since July 2018. Meanwhile the 31 year old woman, Afreen Begum, was rescued from her captivity at Mogadishu in Somalia on March 28. Accordingly she and her three daughters will land at the Mumbai airport on April 2.





Furthermore as India doesn't have an embassy in Somalia, ground operatives of Indian High Commission in Nairobi conducted the rescue operation with the help from police in Somalia. As per Somalian law, a mother cannot travel out of the country with children without permission of the kids' father. Hence it is at that point PM Modi intervened and spoke to the Somalian authorities and ensured safe and immediate return of Afreen Begum to her home in Hyderabad.









Moreover her parents live in Basharath Nagar in Hyderabad and after she married one Mohamed Hussein Duale. Reportedly Duale and Afreen lived in Hyderabad till July 2018 when Duale expressed his desire to visit his family in Somalia with Afreen and their three daughters. The couple left India on July 4 last year and there Afreen had been held captive. Finally, after the rescue and intervention of PMO, the four were allowed to fly out of Somalia at 2.40 pm IST by Ethiopian Airlines from Mogadishu to Addis Ababa. Perhaps from there, they would take a flight to Mumbai at 10.50 pm and will land in Hyderabad on April 2 morning.
