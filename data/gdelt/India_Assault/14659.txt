Prabhas fan electrocuted trying to erect ‘Saaho’ banner

The film starring Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor released on Friday worldwide

In a tragic accident, a fan of Telugu supersar Prabhas was electrocuted on Thursday while trying to put up a banner of his matinee idol to promote the film Saaho.

The incident, which took place at a theatre located in Mahabubnagar, Telangana, has shaken a lot of Prabhas fans, who are taking to social media to ask everyone to express their fandom responsibly.

The fan in question was rushed to the hospital after he came in contact with an electric wire, while he was trying to erect the poster from a window in the theatre.

Saaho, made with a budget of Rs 300 crore, stars Prabhas and Shraddha Kapoor, and was released in over 6,000 screens across the world on Friday.

Recently, an Ajith Kumar fan in Chennai tried to set himself ablaze for a bizarre reason: non-availability of tickets for his Thala’s Nerkonda Paarvai, which hit screens earlier this month.
