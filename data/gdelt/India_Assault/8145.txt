The Supreme Court today refused to grant anticipatory bail to a 45-year-old man who raped a minor, filmed the offence and subsequently circulated the video clip on social media, terming it as a "serious" case.

A vacation bench comprising justices S A Nazeer and Indu Malhotra took strong note of the offense and said the accused, who is already married, will have to surrender himself before the police for custodial interrogation.

"This is a serious case. Here, the girl is a 17-year-old minor. The accused raped and even video-graphed the offense... He will have to go in for custodial interrogation," the bench said while dismissing the anticipatory bail plea.

The court was hearing the anticipatory bail plea of 45-year-old Shamsheer Ali, a resident of Korba district in Chattisgarh. Ali, who was accused of raping the minor girl and videographing the offense in 2016, was denied the relief of bail by the high court.
