A court here Tuesday granted interim relief from arrest to Bollywood actor Aditya Pancholi till July 19 in connection with a case of rape filed against him by a 36-year-old woman. He had filed an anticipatory bail application in the Dindoshi sessions court. Seeking pre-arrest bail for the actor, his lawyer Prashant Patil argued that the woman had lied in her complaint. Her date of birth was different in her complaint and in her passport, and such discrepancies show "her intention to lie", the lawyer said. The woman waited for 15 years after the alleged crime, and filed the complaint only when Pancholi got a favourable order from a magistrate's court in a defamation case he has filed against her, advocate Patil argued. The police opposed the plea for anticipatory bail.
