Former ‘Bigg Boss’ contestant Ajaz Khan has been accused of bashing up a model and the director of a fashion show in Mumbai. The Vashi police registered an FIR against the actor and his bodyguards and the duo have been booked for assault and rioting. Ajaz was the showstopper for a fashion show. Talking to a leading daily, the police officer said, “Mr. Khan was asked to arrive at the venue at 9 p.m., but showed up at 7.30 p.m. When he was made to sit with the audience in the front row, Mr. Khan and his bodyguards picked a fight with the organisers. They wanted to know they were not given a special room.” After a heated argument, the reality TV star and his bodyguards reportedly attacked Sam Abdul Shikur Khan, the director of the fashion show. Pankajkumar Rajendrakumar, a model, who tried to intervene, also got beaten up. Ajaz reportedly left after the fight and his show was cancelled. The complainants also accused the actor of filming women models and singing obscene songs. Meanwhile, Ajaz Khan has quashed all the allegations and said, “It was a badly organised event, and the models were not provided food, water or AC. I heard some people arguing over the payments as well. The organisers then called bouncers and a fight broke out between them and the models. I tried to stop them. I don’t think my name is in the FIR or else they [police] would have called me. It is irresponsible... to blame me. I am a punching bag. A model has taken a video of the incident and I have proof I was not involved.” (All Photos: Instagram)
