New Delhi: 765 persons were arrested by the security agencies in Jammu and Kashmir in 190 cases of stone-pelting ever since the abrogation of Article 370 on August 5. Union Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy, on Tuesday, said that during the seven-month from January to August 4 — before the abrogation of Article 370 — 361 cases of stone-pelting were registered. The number may be viewed against data which shows that a total of 1,458 incidents were recorded in 2018 in which 3,797 persons were arrested. In 2017, the number was 1,412 incidents and 2,838 arrests and in 2016, it was as high as 2,653 cases and 10,571 arrests.

In response to another related question, Reddy said that 950 incidents of ceasefire violations by Pakistan were recorded along the Line of Control (LoC) during the August-October period.

"Instigators and mob mobilisers have been identified and various preventive measures have been taken against them which include detention under PSA and preventive arrests. An investigation has revealed that various separatist organisations and activists which are part of Hurriyat have been behind the incidents of stone-pelting in Kashmir valley. NIA has charge-sheeted 18 persons in the terror funding cases so far," Reddy told the Lower House of the Parliament on Tuesday.

"The Government also informed that it has not issued an advisory for tourists in Jammu and Kashmir recently and that a total of 34,10,219 tourists, including 12,934 foreign tourists, visited Jammu & Kashmir during last 6 months and an income of Rs 25.12 crore has been earned through tourism during this period," a press information bureau statement said.

Attendance of students in schools stands at 99.7 per cent. "Initially the attendance of the students was thin which gradually picked up," Reddy said in his written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha.

On August 5, the government abrogated Article 370 and revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. On October 31, the state was divided into two union territories (UTs) - Jammu and Kashmir with a Legislative Assembly and Ladakh, without one.
