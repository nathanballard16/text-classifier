She claimed that her husband used to call her from jail and had also informed her about the pendency of a criminal case against him.Counsel for the petitioner, Vinod Kumar said for the past many years, Seema had approached several authorities in MEA and the Indian embassy in Saudi Arabia to urge them to help her husband. The advocate claimed that she had also approached external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj through BJP vice-president Avinash Rai Khanna and Union minister Vijay Sampla. However, no efforts were made by any authorities to secure Satwinder’s release.“She spoke to her husband on February 21 for the last time,when he told her that the Indian government is taking up the matter to resolve his case and he may be released soon. However, after that she stopped receiving calls from her husband. One of her Mumbai-based relatives contacted the authorities and received an email from Saudi Arabia that her husband has been executed (beheaded) on February 28 in relation to murder of Arif Imamddin, an Indian national,” the counsel told the HC. The mail dated March 5, however, mentioned that the death-related documents from Saudi authorities are awaited.The petition also said the copy of e-mail reportedly received from the Saudi Arabian authorities was also marked to Desh Bandhu Bhati counsellor (community welfare) and Vijay Singh, second secretary (community welfare), who are officers at the Indian embassy in Riyadh.The petitioner’s counsel told the HC after receiving the email, the family was in deep shock and wanted to know the whereabouts of Satwinder. Despite several efforts to contact the MEA officials in this regard, no positive step was taken by them to inform Seema about her husband’s whereabouts, he claimed.The counsel also said that another Punjab resident, Harjeet Singh had also been executed along with Satwinder on the same charges.
