RTO notice to Kallada owner

The Ernakulam Regional Transport Officer (RTO) issued notice to K.R. Suresh Kumar, owner of Suresh Kallada Travels, and two of the bus drivers of the group on Tuesday in connection with the incident in which about a dozen workers of the group attacked two students travelling on a Bengaluru-bound bus of the group at Vyttila here on April 21.

The Motor Vehicles Department will initiate action against the three people based on the report to be submitted by the RTO.

The passengers were attacked after they protested against the inordinate delay in arranging an alternative bus in place of a bus that broke down.
