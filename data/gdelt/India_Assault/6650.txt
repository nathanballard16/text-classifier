Trees saved from road project set on fire: Social activist

Tirupur: Social activists were upset after 13 trees they saved from a road widening project were destroyed in a fire here in Avinashi.

“When the state highways department widened Avinashi-Coimbatore Road two years ago, the authorities planned to chop down 180 trees. But, we intervened and found that if the design was altered, only 140 trees need to be removed. The Madras high court accepted our argument and directed the department to go with the new design,” said K Sathish Kumar of Kalam Arakattalai.

“Forty trees had to be removed. We replant 34 trees on a poramboke land on Avinashi-Erode Road. Fifteen of them got a new lease of life and the rest died. But on April 11, a fire destroyed all trees, except two. We believe that someone could have set them on fire, which has dented our efforts of giving life to replanted trees,” he said. TNN
