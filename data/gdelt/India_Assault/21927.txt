Adventures with biryani

This time around it is the Biryani, the piece de resistance of the mouth-watering Deccani cuisine. But then Biryani, as it has come to stay put, is no more a Hyderabad exclusive. Even as this Twitterati crossfire was dying, incredible as may be, media recently reported, how a Biryani vendor in Noida, Ghaziabad was assaulted for selling biryani by three youths. So rice and mutton cooked together with few local ingredients from across Kashmir to Kanya Kumari is now conveniently christened Biryani. Kolkata Biryani, Kerala Biryani, Bangalore Biryani, Bihari Biryani, and the established Bombay and Sindhi Biryani.
