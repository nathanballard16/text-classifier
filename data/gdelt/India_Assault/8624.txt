Pak appoints new High Commissioner to India

Islamabad: Pakistan has appointed diplomat Moeen-ul-Haq as the new High Commissioner to India, the media reported on Tuesday.

The position in Delhi had fallen vacant after High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood was elevated as Foreign Secretary, reports Dawn news.

Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Monday announced the appointment of 18 ambassadors and consul generals.

“Today I met Prime Minister Imran Khan and after a detailed discussion he gave approval for the fresh appointments keeping in view new challenges,” Qureshi told the media here.

Talking about Haq’s appointment, Qureshi said it was an important posting as the election process in India was almost over and a new engagement between Islamabad and New Delhi could be started.

The term of Haq, who is presently posted as Ambassador to France, has been linked with the installation of the next government in India.

The post of High Commissioner to India fell vacant after Sohail Mehmood was appointed Pakistan’s new foreign secretary in April. The relationship between the two neighbouring nations currently is at all-time low after a Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber attacked a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14 that killed 40 soldiers.
