LUCKNOW: Raising doubts over the approach of special investigation team towards her case, the law student who has levelled charges of rape against former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand, has asked why there is a delay in booking Swami Chinmayanand under rape charges and taking a subsequent action against him.

Interacting with media persons, the law student who was in Bareilly on Tuesday in connection with her admission in Rohilkhand University, said even after 24hours of getting her statement recorded under Section 164 of CrPc in front of a judicial magistrate, the SIT had not proceeded with a suitable action against Chinmayanand.

The law student asked SIT what it was waiting for despite her reiteration of rape charges against the Swami. "Neither the SIT has arrested Chinmayanand not its officials responding to our queries and not even answering our calls, " she complained.
