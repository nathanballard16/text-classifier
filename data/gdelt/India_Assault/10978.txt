RAIPUR: A counselling session with a Class IX girl in Chhattisgarh 's Balod district , to see why she failed her exams, revealed a shocker - the 15-year-old was being raped by two married men of her village for the past four years.She opened up before her principal while being counselled on why her grades were dropping. The school informed police, who immediately arrested the two accused. One of them has already served prison time for rape and his wife had committed suicide out of shame.The principal and teachers of this child's school had noticed that she was one of the brightest and most chirpy kids till Class VI, when she suddenly started faring poorly in exams, finally failing in Class IX. "She had become quiet and lost interest in studies and activities that would excite her earlier," said a teacher.Whenever someone asked her, she would find a way to escape the conversation. But after she failed her exam, her principal sat her down and started counselling her. She was hesitant, but the principal persisted. Finally, she broke down and revealed the horrifying truth.She was in Class VI when a 35-year-old neighbor lured her with chocolates, beat and raped her. She said she "couldn't understand what had happened". All that she knew, was she was scared. And in pain.The rapes continued. He would wait for her to return from school, when her parents were still away at work, and rape her. Soon, he called a second man, a 30-year-old, and the gangrapes began.She told police that she was too scared to say anything because the duo had threatened to kill her. Also, she was in trauma and didn't know who to turn to. She says it started "affecting her mental balance", her behaviour and studies. The principal consoled her, informed her parents first and then called police. An FIR was lodged on Sunday, and the suspects arrested under POCSCO Act within hours.
