Accountant’s kin refuse to accept body

The kin of an accountant, who used to work for lottery king Santiago Martin’s company and was found dead in a pond on Friday, refused to accept the body after autopsy at the Coimbatore Medical College Hospital (CMCH) on Sunday. They said they would receive the body only after the police arrest those responsible for his death. Suspecting it to be a case of suicide, the Karamadai police registered a case.

The son of the accountant told The Hindu that he had doubts about the death of his father. “We will approach the National Human Rights Commissioner and the SC/ST Commission for justice,” he said. The family will accept the body only after the investigation finds out the truth behind his father's demise. In a petition to the District Collector on Saturday, he alleged that Income Tax sleuths subjected his father to “third degree torture” during the raids on properties and institutions attached to Mr. Martin’s Future Gaming and Hotel Services Private Limited last week.

The autopsy was done by a panel of surgeons in the presence of Prabhakaran P.N., Adi Dravidar Welfare Officer of Coimbatore and Revenue Divisional Officer in-charge. The procedure was videographed.

Apart from the police investigation being conducted by Periyanaickenpalayam DSP Mani, Mr. Prabhakaran will conduct an inquiry and submit his report to the District Collector.

Meanwhile, Mr. Martin's wife Leema Rose Martin, the correspondent of the Martin Homeopathy Medical College and Hospital, where the deceased was employed, said the company would extend all possible support to his family. It said that Mr. Martin was admitted in a hospital in Kolkata due to health issues.
