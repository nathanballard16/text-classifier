Two killed in fire at ONGC Ahmedabad well

A late evening fire at a well of the ONGC Ahmedabad asset on Wednesday claimed the lives of two contractual workers while four others sustained severe burn injuries, official sources said on Thursday.

"A fire broke out around 2030 hours in an ONGC well at Nandej (Well #6) near Ahmedabad while workover (repair and maintenance) operations were being carried out," the Oil & Natural Gas Corp said in a statement.

While the company drafted a team of officials to provide medical aid and four fire tenders to control the fire, five fire tenders from district fire services were deployed.

While one of the deceased was charred in the fire, another worker succumbed to injuries early on Thursday morning.

"Four other contractual workers who were afflicted with severe burn injuries are being treated at a hospital in Ahmedabad," the release said.

Ahmedabad asset has over 2,500 wells, of which half are operational currently. The ONGC was inquiring the cause of the fire.
