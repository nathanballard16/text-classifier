Chennai: Various Tamil organisations across the state took part in a human chain on Saturday seeking early release of seven individuals convicted for their involvement in the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.

Participants across the state sought early release of the seven convicts who have been in jail for 28 years now.

After the Supreme Court last year allowed the Tamil Nadu state government to take a decision on the release of the convicts, the state Cabinet passed a resolution recommending the Governor of Tamil Nadu Banwarilal Purohit to release the seven convicts by provoking Article 161 of the Constitution.

However, the Governor has not made any decision on the recommendation of the state cabinet so far.

On February 23, Nalini Sriharan, a convict, had written a letter to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami appealing to use the current political opportunity to release her and six others.

In May 1991, Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suicide bomber during an election rally at Sriperumbudur in Tamil Nadu.
