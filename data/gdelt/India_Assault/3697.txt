Why Pakistan blinked

New Delhi: When Pakistan PM Imran Khan stated that Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman will be released on Friday as a “gesture of peace and as the first step towards negotiations with India”, there was a round of applause not only in his Parliament but among some people in India too.

Was it really a gesture of peace and humanity? Did it deserve the cheering back home?

No. It was a compulsion, and didn’t deserve anything more than a curt “we knew you had to”! According to IAF's Air Vice Marshall RGK Kapoor, the release is in consonance with Geneva convention.

Geneva Convention mentions that prisoners of war must at all times be protected, particularly against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity. However, Pakistan’s record has always been dismal. It has breached the Geneva Convention several times.

During the Kargil conflict, Captain Saurabh Kalia was kidnapped, subjected to inhuman torture and killed. The highly mutilated body was later handed over to India, triggering massive outrage worldwide. Squadron Leader Ajay Ahuja’s MiG-21 was shot down by Pakistan while on a sortie in Kargil. He bailed out and his parachute drifted towards Pakistan. Ajay was shot dead as soon as he touched down.

The incidents are many. Soon after visuals surfaced showing a bloodied Abhinandan being heckled and manhandled before being interrogated surfaced; Pakistan had to hastily post another video showing a clean face and a cup of tea in his hands. And after all the diplomatic support that India got, did Pakistan have any other option?
