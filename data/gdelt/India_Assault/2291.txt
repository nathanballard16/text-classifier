Navjot Singh Sidhu gets trolled for his comment on Pulwama terror attack

New Delhi:

After the tragic terrorist attack in Pulwama which occurred on Thursday, several Bollywood celebs and politicians condemned the attack. Earlier today, writer Javed Akhtar even cancelled his trip to Karachi where he was invited to attend an art council along with his wife Shabana Azmi.

As per PTI, Navjot Singh Sidhu spoke to media outside Punjab assembly and said, "For a handful of people, can you blame the entire nation and can you blame an individual?" This statement garnered him huge criticism over the social media and some netizens even demanded the makers of the The Kapil Sharma Show to remove him from the show.

Currently, both Kapil Sharma and Siddhu are making trend over Twitter as huge number of users are criticising and demanding Sidhuâ€™s exit from the comedy show or else they are ready to boycott the chat show.Â

Meanwhile, the Punjab Assembly Friday strongly condemned the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed and passed a resolution for adjournment of the proceedings of the House for the day.

More than 2,500 Central Reserve Police Force personnel, many of them returning from leave to rejoin duty in the Valley, were travelling in the convoy of 78 vehicles when they were ambushed on the Srinagar-Jammu highway at Latoomode in Awantipora in south Kashmir around 3.15 pm. The Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group has claimed responsibility for the attack that took place about 20 km from Srinagar.Â Â Â
