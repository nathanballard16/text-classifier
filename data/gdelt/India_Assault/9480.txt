Constable repeatedly rapes colleague on pretext of marriage

A 37-year-old police constable from Solapur, working at Khar police station in Mumbai, has been accused of repeatedly raping his colleague on the pretext of marriage.

The accused, Shivananda Barachare, has been absconding since a sessions court rejected his anticipatory bail last week.

The case is been investigated by the Bhoiwada Police, who said that Shivananda Barachare, who was meant to guide the complainant, and was giving her police recruitment exam, allegedly first raped her after intoxicating her, the Mumbai Mirror reported.

The police said that Shivananda Barachare had hidden his marital status and it was only later that the victim found out that the accused was married.

The complainant said that she had aborted his child and found out about his marriage after a while. She said that the accused had promised to marry her when she confronted him about the assault.

Special Judge MA Baraliya, while rejecting the anticipatory bail application, said it was difficult to believe that a girl would have sex with a man on their first meeting in spite of knowing he was married.

He added that it would send a wrong message to society if a married police officer is allowed to walk scot-free despite establishing sexual relations with another woman on their first meeting.
