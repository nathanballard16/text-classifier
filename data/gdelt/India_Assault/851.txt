Chennai: A drunk man set fire to a vehicle in Adambakkam on Saturday morning causing a stir in the area.

The man, identified as Sairam Dharunchand, 22, resident of Nanganallur is a techie at a call centre at Tidel Park. On Friday he had gone to a bar at New Colony after work.

The incident occurred when Sairam had paid the bill for his drinks through an app but alleged that excess money was deducted from his account. During a heated argument with the bar manager Karthik, Sairam hurled abuses at him, police sources said. Upset, Sairam left from the premises. However, at around 3.30 am, still heavily inebriated, he returned to the spot and set Karthik’s two-wheeler on fire.

Karthik immediately alerted the police who rushed to the spot. After the fire was put off, a complaint was registered with the Adambakkam police. The backside of the bike was completely damaged, police sources said. Sairam was soon arrested and an inquiry is on.
