The stage is set for further confrontation with neither side of the CAA-NRC-NPR divide willing to buckle down from their positions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has sharpened his attack on anti-CAA protesters for rioting and made a strong defence of police action. Government may have climbed down from earlier positions that a National Register of Citizens would follow the Citizenship (Amendment) Act but the almost immediate sanctioning of funds for a National Population Register exercise to accompany Census 2021 will contribute to reigniting the protests.

The opposition to the new NPR is coming from the introduction of new additional data points like Aadhaar number and date and place of birth of parents which can facilitate an NRC if and when it is rolled out, though government is now saying there has been no discussion on NRC. In non-BJP ruled states, pressure is building up on state governments from their respective constituencies to oppose the NPR, as Kerala and Bengal have already done. If a large number of states were to block the NPR it would represent a sharp deterioration in Centre-State relations.

With videos of protesters pelting stones at police and police indulging in vandalism pouring out from various areas, there is a sharp polarisation on the ground. Meanwhile, IMF has again called “urgent action” to reversing India’s economic slowdown. The government’s energies must not be expended at this critical hour in a standoff with its own citizens.
