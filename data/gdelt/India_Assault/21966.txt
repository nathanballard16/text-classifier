'Leave the rapists to die a slow & painful death', Juhi Chawla

MUMBAI: Former beauty queen, 90's superstar & an active environmentalist Juhi Chawla Mehta apart from her infectious laughter, is known to not mince her words & call a spade a spade.

Last seen in Anil Kapoor, Rajkumar Rao starter Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga, Juhi Chawla will be seen next in Sharmaji Namkeen alongside her Chandni co-star Rishi Kapoor. During times when there is a national outrage with brutal gang-rapes, Juhi expresses her disgust with an important message.

The actress was in Jaisalmer recently attending a family wedding & took some time off to visit tourist locations in & around town. On visiting one of the historical sites, a 50ft deep dry well, Juhi shared on her social networking site, an idea every that every Indian will approve of.

Sharing a picture, she wrote, 'The Chhatri you see on the right, it has a 50 foot dry well. In early days they would throw traitors, criminals into the well & leave them there to die a slow and painful death. I was wondering ; what if they do that today , as punishment for rapists , and acid throwers!'

We couldn't agree more!

The actress begins shooting for her next in January!
