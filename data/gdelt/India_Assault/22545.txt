'Shameful & Horrifying': Bollywood's Swara Bhasker Reacts to Death Toll in Uttar Pradesh Protests

In a series of tweets, Bollywood actress Swara Bhasker, one among many celebrities who stood against the new law that allows citizenship to be granted to non-Muslim immigrants such as Hindus, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and Parsis from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, said that news of the rising death toll in Uttar Pradesh protests is "shameful and horrifying" and demands quick action against the Chief Minister of UP Yogi Adiutyanath.

The news from #UttarPradesh of beatings, detentions, discriminatory profiling of Muslims, torture and the rising death tolls is shameful and horrifying. Signals an utter break down of the rule of law. Ajay Bisht has turned UP police into a rogue force. #SackAdityanathGovt #Shame — Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) December 21, 2019
