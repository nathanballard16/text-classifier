Ex-fiancée of Prince Charles' godson ‘attacked her mother in cash row’

T he former fiancée of Prince Charles’s godson is accused of attacking her own mother in a row over money at their £4.6 million family home in Chelsea, a court has heard.

Emma Chaing, 31, allegedly left Maria Chaing with a bruised face after slapping her up to three times for refusing to hand over £200.

Chaing — who performs as a musician under the stage name Emma Stayhear — got engaged to Nicholas Knatchbull, the son and heir of Earl Mountbatten, in 2016 but the couple have since split up.

Eton-educated Knatchbull is the godson of Prince Charles — who was a close schoolfriend of his father Norton Knatchbull — and was a mentor to Prince William at school.

Westminster magistrates’ court heard Chaing is accused of assaulting her mother on July 16. Prosecutor Robert Simpson said: “The defendant wanted £200 from her. The mother was unwilling to give it to her.”

Chaing appeared in the dock to deny the charge of assault by beating, and is due to stand trial on October 8. Her lawyer, Ellen Wright, said a summary of the prosecution case refers to a “punch”. She told the court: “The defence is there was no punch.”

Chaing was freed on bail on condition she does not return to the family home and sleeps each night at the home of her uncle in Fulham. “She does still have a close relationship with her mother, even though they are not living together,” added Miss Wright.

Chaing’s mother, 60, who accompanied her daughter to court yesterday, will be summonsed to appear at the trial as a prosecution witness.

Knatchbull has made waves in royal circles with his unconventional lifestyle, performing hip hop music as Five Dimensional Nick and boasting of taking drugs. His great-grandfather was the 1st Earl Mountbatten, who was Prince Philip’s uncle and last viceroy of India. Knatchbull is now said to be planning a wedding with Ambre Saint-Clare, who has worked as a professional mermaid.
