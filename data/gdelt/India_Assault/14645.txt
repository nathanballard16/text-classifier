A regional President of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Women Wing [Mahila Morch] has been expelled from her role on June 27 after she called on Hindu men to gang-rape Muslim women.

In a screenshot of the now deleted Facebook post that has been shared by a Twitter user, Sunita Singh Gaur, President of the BJP’s Mahila Morch in Ramkola in Uttar Pradesh said: “There is only one solution for them (Muslims). Hindu brothers should make a group of 10 and gang rape their (Muslims) mothers and sisters openly on the streets…and then hang her in the middle of the bazaar for others to see.”

Gaur added that “if we need to protect India then Hindu men must rape Muslim women. There is no other way.”

Vijaya Rahatkar, national President of Mahila Morcha, said: “Be assured, BJP Mahila Morcha will not tolerate any hateful comments whatsoever from any karyakarta. The lady in question has been expelled even before you tweeted.”

Rahatkar acknowledged that Gaur repeatedly posted “inappropriate” content on social media.
