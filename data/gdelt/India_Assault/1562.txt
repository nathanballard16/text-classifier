Chennai: Traffic cop caught on camera taking bribe

In Tamil Nadu's Chennai, a traffic inspector was caught on camera taking money from a taxi driver, who was allegedly asked to pay a bribe for a traffic violation.

The video that surfaced showed traffic inspector Ravichandran collecting money from traffic violators, counting it and placing it in his bag.

This comes after three policemen were also caught on camera recently, bargaining for bribes for carrying illegal sand in a truck.

This clearly violates rules of Chennai Traffic Police who have provided swipe machines to traffic inspectors or the option of payment through post office to collect fines for avoiding corruption.

After the video went viral, the city commissioner suspended Ravichandran to avoid further embarrassment.

On January 5, a taxi driver committed suicide by laying on a train track near Chennai, blaming the police for harassment.

The same policeman was suspended after CCTV footage of him assaulting a subordinate surfaced earlier.

Departmental action was taken against Ravichandran back in November 2018, after the video exposed him of severely injuring his subordinate by pushing him from a motorbike.
