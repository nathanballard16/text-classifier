Set on fire, Unnao gang rape survivor to be airlifted to Delhi, green corridor created from airport to Safdarjung Hospital

Hours after the gruesome incident in which a gang rape survivor was set ablaze by five people in Unnao district of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday (December 5), the state government has decided to shift the survivor to Delhi for further treatment.

The 23-year-old gang rape survivor, who has suffered 90 per cent injuries, will be airlifted to Delhi to undergo treatment at Safdarjung Hospital. A green corridor has been created from airport to Safadrajung Hospital to transfer the survivor without any delay. Over 100 policemen have been asked to keep the green corridor free from traffic. According to the doctors treating the woman in Uttar Pradesh, the condition of the survivor was critical.

The gang rape survivor was set ablaze in Unnao by five men, including two who are accused of raping her in March this year. The rape accused and three others took the woman outside her village and into the fields and doused her in kerosene before setting her on fire. The police arrested four of the accused while the prime accused surrendered himself later.
