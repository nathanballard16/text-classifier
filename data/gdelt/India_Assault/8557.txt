Delhi Police sub-inspector dies after assault, BJP demands probe

New Delhi: Delhi Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Manoj Tiwari has demanded probe into the death of a Delhi Police sub-inspector, who was allegedly assaulted following a quarrel with a suspected criminal in Shahdara's Vivek Vihar area on Sunday.

The sub-inspector, identified as Raj Kumar, was apparently filming a video of the criminal on his phone when he was allegedly assaulted, the police said, adding that the victim later succumbed.

Condoling the death of Kumar, Tiwari on Monday night tweeted that "society has no place for goondaism and urban naxalism" and a proper enquiry should be conducted.
