ISLAMABAD: Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry on Saturday slammed Bollywood actors for advocating war on social media and "poking their nose" in "issues beyond their understanding".

As tensions escalated between India and Pakistan, several Bollywood celebrities had taken to their social media pages to laud the Indian Air Force and added to war hysteria.

Quoting Bollywood actor Preity Zinta's tweet regarding Pakistan's release of captured Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, the information minister wrote, "Best thing Bollywood walas can do is stop poking nose in issues beyond their understanding."

"Majority of them haven’t even finished their school, they lack ken of very basic issues. Wars are too serious a business to be discussed by jokers who became celebrities by stroke of luck," he added.

Pakistan on Friday released captured Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman as a "gesture of peace" towards New Delhi and an effort to de-escalate tensions between the two countries.



Wing Commander Abhinandan was captured when his MiG-21 among two Indian military aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force after they ventured into the Pakistani airspace.



India and Pakistan are amidst their biggest stand-off in many years, with the United States and other global powers mediating to de-escalate tensions between arch-foes who have fought three wars since their independence from British colonial rule in 1947.
