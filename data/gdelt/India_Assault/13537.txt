A Delhi court today framed charges against Kuldeep Sengar, accused in the Unnao rape case.

The court has framed charges under various sections of IPC and other relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.

District Judge Dharmesh Sharma also framed charges against Sengar’s accomplice Shashi Singh for allegedly kidnapping the minor girl, who is presently admitted in AIIMS, Delhi.

The CBI had yesterday told the court that Sengar and his brother assaulted the father of the girl and framed him in an Arms Act case, in collusion with three state police officials and five others.
