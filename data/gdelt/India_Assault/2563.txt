Stop attacks on Kashmiris: CPI(M)

Srinagar

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) CPI(M) on Sunday expresses serious concern at the attacks on students and people belonging to Kashmir which have taken place in different parts of the country.

The CPIM statement said that students were beaten up in Dehradun by Bajrang Dal and VHP men. Threats and attacks on Kashmiri students and traders have occurred in other places too. Jammu is under curfew after attacks on Kashmiri residents there.

“It is natural that people are aggrieved and saddened by the killing of the 40 CRPF jawans in Pulwama. But to utilize this occasion to target innocent Kashmiris is reprehensible,” said the statement.

The Polit Bureau demands that the Central government and state governments take all steps to protect Kashmiri residents.

“Firm action must be taken against those resorting to hate campaign and violence,” said the CPI(M party spokesman in a statement.
