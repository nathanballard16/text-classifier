People set on fire bike of snatchers

SURAT: An autorickshaw driver rammed his vehicle into the motorcycle of two unidentified robbers trying to escape after snatching a mobile phone from a person on Bamroli Road in the city on Thursday. Bewildered by the daring shown by the autorickshaw driver, the snatchers thought it best to run away from the spot leaving the motorcycle behind which was later torched by local people. This follows the recent incident wherein BJP MLA Mukesh Patel when targeted by two robbers on a motorcycle not only saved his mobile, but took help of a passerby to nab the culprits who were thrashed before being handed over to the cops.Questioned about the incident, police officials said an offence has been registered in this regard at Udhna police station.“As of now, we don’t have complete detail of the incident. We have busted many gangs and arrested several individuals involved in snatching and recovered valuables from them. The drive is continuing. There is considerable drop in snatching incidents,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.Meanwhile, Pratibha Sonavane, a resident of Nashik , was going in an autorickshaw on Udhna main road when two robbers on a motorcycle snatched her bag containing valuables worth Rs 2 lakh at around 6.15am on Wednesday.
