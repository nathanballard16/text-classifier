Akshay Kumar Finally Reacts To Unnao Rape Case! Here Is What He Has To Say

Akshay Kumar’s schedule is as packed as a Mumbai local train on a Monday morning. Believe it or not but he’s on a roll with signing back to back movies like Laxmmi Bomb, Bachchan Pandey and Sooryavanshi. When Akshay announced Mission Mangal, he mentioned that he did this film for his daughter, Nitara and we have often seen him doing movies based on social causes or breaking taboos.

In an interview with Mumbai Mirror, Akshay was asked about his reaction on Unnao rape case which has garnered the attention of many celebrities including Jaya Bachchan who was trolled for laughing during the protest rally. Akshay reacted on the rape case said, “I speak when I feel the need to express myself. And it’s not only about tweeting and speaking but doing something for a cause I believe in. My films like Toilet: Ek Prem Katha and PadMan are also a medium to express myself even if they bring in less investment than a Rowdy Rathore or Singh Is Kinng sequel from the distributors. I’m not blaming anyone, people are here to do business. If I can donate for a cause, I will. If I can address an issue through a film, I will do that too.”

On the work front, Akshay is shooting simultaneously for Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi opposite Katrina and Good News opposite Kareena Kapoor Khan, Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh.
