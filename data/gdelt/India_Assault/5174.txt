Brothers, uncle rape and behead minor girl in India

A minor girl in Madhya Pradesh was beheaded by her family after they allegedly raped her and dumped her body in a nearby field.

As per reports, the 12-year-old, student of grade six was missing last week on March 13 with her dead body and cut off head getting recovered the following day in a field.

Police had charged the victim’s family members including her three brothers, uncle and aunt: “Four of the accused have been arrested and one is absconding. One of the accused is a minor.”

Reports citing the police superintendent revealed that while the victim’s aunt Amit Sanghi, was aware of the act, she provided false information to the police and wrongfully accused a neighbor instead as the suspects.

It was further revealed that the girl’s aunt also threatened the family’s men to inform the police but they strangled the girl to death and beheaded her in response.

The police had later received a tip-off that the girl’s 20-year-old brother may be involved in the crime but due to him fleeing the area, avoiding his probable arrest, the younger one had come clean amidst interrogation.
