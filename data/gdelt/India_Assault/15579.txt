BJP Has "Anti-Woman" Mindset, Protecting Criminals Now Part Of Its DNA: Congress

She alleged that the victim in the Chinmayanand rape case is being subjected to harassment, while the accused is roaming free. An FIR was registered against him only after she wrote a "heart-wrenching" letter to the Chief Justice of India, she said.

The Congress on Tuesday questioned the government why former BJP MP Swami Chinmayanand was not arrested in the rape case against him and alleged that colluding with criminals and protecting them have become a part of the ruling party's DNA. Congress spokesperson Ragini Naik accused the BJP of having an "anti-woman" mindset and said it has not taken action against its leaders accused of rape, especially in Uttar Pradesh. "The BJP has an 'anti-woman' mindset. Loving criminals, protecting them and colluding with them, have somewhere become a part of the BJP's DNA," she told reporters.
