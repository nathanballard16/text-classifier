Assam man thrashed in Alwar over child abduction rumours

‘We’ve told people not to trust rumours’

JAIPUR: Even as the police try to prevent child abduction rumours through pamphlets and public meetings, the menace is fast spreading across the state.Recently, a 39-year-old youth from Assam was thrashed in Thanagazi in Alwar on suspicion of abducting children. The victim, Chandrashekhar, was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be out of danger. Police have registered a case against unnamed accused in the case.After the mysterious ‘braid-chopping’ rumours triggered a wave of paranoia two years ago, fresh rumours of child-lifting gangs on the prowl have set off alarms again across the state.Additional DGP (Crime) B L Soni said that all district police have been directed to dispel rumour mongering through public meetings and creating awareness.A pamphlet distributed by Bandikui police station in Dausa district to prevent rumour mongering reads thus: “Reports of child abducting gangs operating in the region are false. These are mere rumours. If you come across any suspicious person, speak to them calmly. Don’t beat up the person and quickly alert the local police.”Bandikui SHO Rajendra Kumar, who has been part of the campaign, said that many meetings have been organised to make people aware.“We told people not trust rumours on social media. We have conducted thorough investigation and found that there are no such gangs in our area,” SHO Kumar told TOI.Sources in the Rajasthan police fear that rumours may trigger another spate of mob violence across the state. “There are several small places of worship across Rajasthan where mentally-challenged patients come to pray with their families. Sometimes they are mistaken for criminals and thrashed,” an official told TOI, adding that the problem persists in Kota, Dausa and Bharatpur areas.
