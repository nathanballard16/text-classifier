People set hospital afire in Peshawar

ISLAMABAD: Angry dissenters set on fire a hospital in Pakistan ’s northwestern district of Peshawar on Monday alleging that the anti-polio drops given to children there were infected.Around 75 children reportedly fell ill after they were administered anti-polio drops in the Basic Health Unit (BHU), a government-run facility in Mashokhel area of Peshawar. Family members of the children and area residents staged a demonstration outside the hospital before setting it on fire.Vaccination campaigns have faced opposition from militant Islamist groups in Pakistan, and Mashokhel has people who take a dim view of the current anti-polio programme of the government.Dr Shahzad Akbar, director of Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), one of the three main government-run hospitals in Peshawar, said that 75 students were brought to the hospital with complaints of headache, nausea, and abdominal pain.“They were provided first aid. Some of them have been released, and the remaining students will also be discharged soon, as none of them is in a serious condition,” Dr Akbar said. The students fell ill at a local school and were shifted to HMC by the school administration, one of the teachers said.Kamran Afridi, a coordinator of government’s Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI), said that the vaccine was among the safest in the world and doesn’t cause any reaction.“Doctors also said the children did not get a reaction from the vaccine. There are parents in Mashokhel area who do not want to administer the anti-polio drops to their children and they could have felt sick owing to other reasons,” Afridi said, adding that experts had already checked the vaccine and dismissed the suggestion that it was behind the ill health of the students.Pakistan, Afghanistan , and Nigeria are the only three countries where complete polio eradication has not been achieved yet. The case numbers in Pakistan, however, are at the lowest level ever, with only four cases being reported in 2019.Last month, Prime Minister Imran Khan ’s office had urged the country’s telecom regulator to act against misinformation on social media discouraging vaccination and directed against the polio drive in the country.Babar Bin Atta, Imran Khan’s focal person for polio eradication, said the main problem faced by the campaign was lack of access to children whose parents were reluctant to allow them to be vaccinated.“Persistently missed children provide a haven to the virus to keep on circulating in the environment,” Atta said
