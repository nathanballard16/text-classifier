Ajay Devgn’s look for Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior is already creating much buzz – Check it out

Ajay Devgn is currently busy promoting his upcoming adventure comedy Total Dhamaal. The Indra Kumar-directed comedy also stars Madhuri Dixit Nene and Anil Kapoor. But even while Ajay is actually promoting his soon-to-release film, what we couldn’t help noticing was his look. The actor has been sporting extensive side-burns and we must say that along-with the trimmed beard, the side-burns look great on him. Not just the side-burns, the actor who’ll turn 50 this year (on April 2) has been looking rather super-fit and definitely not years closer to his real age.

So, when we caught up with the actor, we couldn’t help but ask him about the new look and his superfit bod. Talking about it, Ajay revealed that the look is for his film Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior. “Yes, that’s for my look in the film,” he shared. As for the progress on the film, he added, “The film is going on as per schedule. Sixty percent of the film has been shot and we are starting our next schedule soon.” Well, that definitely explains the look and the fit-bod! Check out the look:

Meanwhile, the actor is looking forward to his comedy outing Total Dhamaal that releases on February 22. The actor shares that the film is special due to many factors. Besides, being a genre that Ajay really enjoys, the actor is reuniting with his Ishq (1997) and Masti (2004) director Indra Kumar; Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke (2001) co-star Madhuri and Masti co-actor Riteish Deshmukh. He has also reunited with his Action Jackson co-star Sonakshi Sinha for a special song Mungdaa. “It was Indra Kumar who made me dabble in comedy. And it’s always a pleasure working with Madhuri, although we are not paired opposite each other in this one,” said Ajay, adding that Riteish is forever his partner-in-crime!
