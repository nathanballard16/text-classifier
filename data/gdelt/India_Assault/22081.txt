CAA protests turn violent in Lucknow: Protesters pelt stones, police use tear gas

Protests against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act led to major violence in Uttar Pradesh's Lucknow. Protesters went on a rampage, pelting stones at the police, setting vehicles on fire and ransacking a police outpost. The police in return fired tear gas shells and resorted to lathicharge to control the unruly mob.

The violence broke out in Lucknow's old city area, a sensitive zone where police were deployed in heavy numbers following the ruckus. Protesters pelted stones at the police, set motorbikes and cars on fire and ransacked a police outpost. In return, the police fired tear gas and lathicharged protesters.

The protests in Lucknow were part of several such demonstrations that are being held in cities across the country since Thursday morning. Protests are being held in more than 10 cities including Delhi, Mumbai, Bhopal, Bengaluru, Thiruvananthapuram, Chennai and Patna.

Section 144, which restricts public gathering, has been imposed in several cities in the country and the police have detained scores of people, including prominent personalities such as historian Ramchandra Guha and activist Yogendra Yadav.

The protests, which have been taking place for the last few days, are against the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act which was recently made a law. The Act provides for expedited citizenship to refugees of non-Muslim faith from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
