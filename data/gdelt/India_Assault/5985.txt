Barricades were erected at the opening of Chunnu’s enclosure to ensure that it did not come out.The pair was kept under separation even after Dimpy delivered a baby on January eight. It is believed that Dimpy broke into the enclosure of Chunnu and attacked it sometime on Wednesday night. Chunnu was found badly injured and lying on its side in the morning.When zoo officials reached the spot, they tried make Chunnu stand. But it came to light that it was unable to use its legs.
