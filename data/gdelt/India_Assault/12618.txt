Hyderabad businessman kidnapped, freed after 'instant payment' of ransom

HYDERABAD: In a matter of just four hours on Sunday, a financier from Himayathnagar was abducted from his Mercedes, dragged into another car nearby, driven around the city and finally released after a Rs 1 crore ransom was paid. Senior Hyderabad police officers confirmed to TOI that they have cracked the case based on CCTV footage and other evidence, and already detained the abductors.The victim, Gajendra Parekh, 40, runs Maina Automobile Finance from an office in Domalguda along with his elder brother Kalmesh. At 9 pm on Sunday, Gajendra went to his office and met his friend Rahul. He was about to get into his Mercedes at around 11 pm and go home when five unidentified men suddenly surrounded him and dragged him into another car.They covered Gajendra’s face with a hood and drove around the city even as they demanded that he pay them Rs 3 crore as ransom.“Gajender haggled with them and said he could manage up to Rs 10 lakh,” deputy commissioner of police Viswa Prasad said.“The accused beat him up and threatened to kill him if did not meet their demand. As the accused were unrelenting, Gajendra agreed to pay them Rs 50 lakh and finally convinced them to accept Rs 1 crore.”Gajendra phoned Rahul and told him that he urgently needed Rs 1 crore to settle a family dispute, cops said. Following the abductors’ instructions, Rahul came with the money to Bombay Fruit Juice eatery in Abids at around 2.45 am on Monday and placed the cash bag on the bonnet of his car. Two associates of the abductors then came on a bike and collected the cash.After he was released, Gajendra was taken to a private hospital to tend to injuries inflicted by the abductors, but doctors insisted that the family inform the police given that it was a medico-legal case. It was only then that one of the family members called the police, who rushed to the hospital and collected the details.Based on the registration numbers of the vehicles and cell phone numbers of the accused, police tracked down the accused from the city and detained them. Though initially police suspected the accused to be from Mumbai, they later realised that locals had committed the crime to extort money from their rich victim.
