NEW DELHI, Nov 4 (KUNA) -- Indian police said on Monday that one person was killed while 15 others got injured following a grenade attack targeting a vegetable market in Srinagar city of Jammu and Kashmir.

The Press Trust of India said quoting police sources that militants targeted the vegetable market in Hari Singh High Street in Srinagar at 1:20 pm local time, killing one civilian and injuring 15 others. The area was cordoned off and more forces were rushed to the spot.

This is the third such attack targeting civilians in the state. In a similar attack last week, 15 people, waiting for the bus, were injured in Sopore town of north Kashmir. On October 26, militants had targeted security personnel while inspecting vehicles at a check-post in Srinagar injuring six of them.

The number of attacks on civilian targets, especially those from other states including truck drivers and labourers, increased following the central government decision to abrogate a constitutional provision ending special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. New Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting and funding the armed groups in Kashmir, claims denied by Islamabad. (end) atk.hb
