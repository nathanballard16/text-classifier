Spain requests amphibious assault vehicles

The US State Department has made a determination approving a potential foreign military sale of 11 amphibious assault vehicles (AAV) and related equipment to Spain, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency announced on 15 March.

In a package worth $107 million, Spain has requested eight AAVP7A1 Reliability, Availability, Maintainability/Rebuild to Standard (RAM/RS) personnel carriers, two AAVC7A1 RAM/RS command vehicles and one AAVR7A1 RAM/RS recovery vehicle.

Also included are Enhanced Armor Applique Kits, spare and repair parts and other related elements of logistics and programme support.

Spain currently operates 19 AAVs, and the addition of 11 new vehicles will add more flexibility to counter regional threats.

If the sale goes ahead, BAE Systems will be the prime contractor.
