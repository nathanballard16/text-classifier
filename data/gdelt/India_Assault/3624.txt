IAF pilot in Pakistan: Mohanlal and Suriya lead South celebs in saying Abhinandan My Hero

The tension between India and Pakistan is at an all-time high as IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman have been held as POW (Prisoner of War) by the Pakistan army. In fact, they have released a video of bruised pilot answering some questions.

Ever since his photos and videos found its way to the Internet, people including celebrities across the country have taken to social media to share their thoughts and prayers about Abhinandan's safe return.

Several hashtags namely #AbhinandanMyHero, #BringBackAbhinandan, #BringBackAbhi have been trending on Twitter and Facebook for over 24 hours. Many citizens have expressed their concern over the return of Wing Commander Abhinandhan. People also added that they're praying for him and his family.

As of now, there is no information on Abhinandan's return to India. The Indian Army, in an official statement, said, "Abhinandan was captured today by the Pakistan army during the ongoing conflict and he is now a POW (Prisoner of War), no matter whether it is declared war or not. He should be extended all courtesies as per the Geneva Conventions. It was made clear that Pakistan would be well advised to ensure that no harm comes to the Indian defence personnel in its custody. India also expects his immediate and safe return."

Celebrities from South Indian Film industry took to Twitter to stand in solidarity with Abhinandan.
