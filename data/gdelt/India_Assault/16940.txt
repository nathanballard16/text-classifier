Police Asked Me To Prove My Gender For Filing FIR

She also alleged the police even called woman officers to get her medically examined. Later, the victim submitted the gender certificate to the police. Two hours after she submitted proof, the police registered an FIR and arrested the accused. The victim said even though the police wanted to help, they first wanted to ascertain her gender identity.

Earlier, a 50-year-old man was arrested by the government railway police (GRP) at Mumbai Central for allegedly molesting a transgender woman. The accused has been identified as Prakash Devendra Bhatt.

However, the victim made serious allegations against the police telling that they were not cooperative in arresting the accused. According to the victim, she was "touched inappropriately" by Bhatt at Dadar station on Friday.

She was travelling from Navi Mumbai and the incident happened when she got down at the Dadar station to board the Goregaon-bound train. After the incident, she immediately raised an alarm and dragged the accused to the GRP to register a complaint.

The police said an FIR under section 354 (assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty) has been registered against Bhatt. He will soon be produced before the court, police said.
