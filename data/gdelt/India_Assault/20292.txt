A+ A-New Delhi: Senior Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) leader Brinda Karat on Saturday lashed out at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath led BJP government over the death of Unnao rape victim. “The Uttar Pradesh government should be held responsible for the incident. Where were the Uttar Pradesh government and the police when the victim wanted to file an FIR against the accused,” asked Karat. Our system is so rotten that nobody stood with the victim.”After battling for life for more than 40-hours, the Unnao rape victim died at 11:40 pm on Friday at a hospital in the national capital. The 23-year-old was set ablaze while she was on way to the court on Wednesday morning.
