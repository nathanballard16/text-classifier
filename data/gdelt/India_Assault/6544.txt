RAIPUR: Enraged with villagers who went to vote on April 11 in Bastar, Maoists went on the rampage in Koleng region on Saturday night. They singled out those with inked fingers and beat them up for eight hours. At least 10 persons are badly hurt.Bastar defied the Maoists’ poll boycott call and the shock of a BJP MLA’s assassination to vote with a vengeance. The 66% turnout was the best in about two decades. The second round of voting in three other Maoist-affected areas — Kanker, Rajnandgaon and Mahasumund is on April 18.On the night of April 13, armed Maoists of the Darbha division stormed into Chindgur village around 8pm on Saturday, and went door to door looking for voters, who were then dragged out and beaten. The Maoists called out to all the villagers to watch the brutal assault. The ordeal went on till 4am. The attackers threatened villagers not to participate in any kind of development work or “they would put a ban on their farming too”. This is the same rebel unit that assassinated BJP MLA Bhima Mandavi.On Monday, the villagers approached district administration to ask for a CRPF camp in Chindgur. The nearest security forces’ camp is 7km away, in Koleng. What’s more alarming, the villagers say, Maoists have identified 15 people as those helping the government. They are now on the rebels’ hit list.
