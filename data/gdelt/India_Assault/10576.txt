Rajiv Gandhi assassination: Madras high court permits India's longest serving woman prisoner Nalini Sriharan to argue her case in person

CHENNAI: In a reprieve to Rajiv Gandhi assassination case life convict Nalini Sriharan , who is India's longest serving woman prisoner, the Madras high court on Tuesday permitted her to appear in person in the court to argue her plea seeking six months parole to make arrangements for her daughter's marriage.A division bench of Justice M M Sundaresh and Justice M Nirmal Kumar passed the interim order as she refused to put forth her arguments through video conferencing, as suggested by the Tamil Nadu government.The bench directed the state police to escort Nalini to the appear before the court at 2.15 pm on July 5.In a recent hearing, the court made it clear that she could not be denied of her right to appear in person to argue her case.Nalini, who has been in prison for over 27 years, wanted the high court to direct the superintendent of police, Special Prison for Women in Vellore, to produce her before the court so that she could argue her case for leave as a party-in-person.According to Nalini, a life convict is entitled to one month leave once in two years and since she had never availed such ordinary leave for more than 27 years, she made a representation to the prison authorities on February 25 seeking six months leave to make arrangement for her daughter’s marriage.Subsequently, Nalini’s mother also made a similar representation on March 22. As the authorities failed to consider her representation, she moved the high court.Originally, Nalini was sentenced to death. Subsequently, her death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the Tamil Nadu government on April 24, 2000.Claiming that after commutation of her death sentence, around 3,700 life convicts -- who had served ten years of imprisonment and less -- were released by the Tamil Nadu government, she said, “My request to the state for premature release under 1994 scheme of premature release of life convicts was cleared by the council of ministers, and on September 9, 2018, the council advised the governor to release me and other six life convicts in the case. But it has been over six months and the decision of the state still remains unimplemented.”
