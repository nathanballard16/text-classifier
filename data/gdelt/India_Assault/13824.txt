Gaitonde had hinted at a possible apocalypse in 25 days

The countdown was set right from the first episode, leading Inspector Sartaj Singh (Saif Ali Khan) on a crazy race against time. Notorious crime lord Ganesh Gaitonde (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) calls Sartaj and lets him know that he has 25 days to save the city. Sartaj traces the call to a reinforced bunker in Mumbai from where Gaitonde used to ‘rule’, only to find a dead body and Gaitonde ready to shoot himself (which he does). This sends the police and RAW agents on a seemingly wild goose chase. It's important to note here that Gaitonde says that a certain ‘Trivedi' will be the only one who survives after 25 days.
