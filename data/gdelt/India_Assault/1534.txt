Moradabad: Couples from across the country have approached police in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh to adopt a newborn baby boy who was born on Saturday to a minor rape survivor. The 15-year-old girl gave birth to the child at the Meerut Medical College on February 4.

However, the girl's family has expressed its displeasure with the adoption requests. According to a report by Times of India, the survivor's brother claims that little is being done about the condition of his sister or their family who have undergone such tremendous amount of trauma in the past few months. He went further to say that family members of Naresh Saxena who is the prime accused in the case are pressurising his kin to "reach a compromise".

Meanwhile, senior sub-inspector with the Moradabad police, Jyoti Singh told the national daily that couples from Delhi, Bijnor, and Moradabad have approached the police department regarding the adoption of the newborn baby. She also said that while one of the couples who has sought the adoption does not have children of their own, another has three daughters and now wish to adopt a boy.

The official also added that the final call to put the baby up for adoption rests with the mother who is still reeling under major trauma. The 15-year-old girl also underwent surgery during the delivery of the child, said Singh. On Saturday, the survivor had used her newborn infant as evidence against her rapist in court. Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Gaud had told media outlets that the police will demand the POCSO court for a DNA test of the newborn to nail the accused in the case.
