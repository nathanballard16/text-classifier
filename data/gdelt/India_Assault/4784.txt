Atal Bihari Vajpayeeâ€™s policies set Jammu and Kashmir on fire, says Rahul Gandhi

New Delhi:

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday interacted with the students of Stella Maris College in Chennai. During his address, Rahul Gandhi touch upon various issues starting from Pulwama attack to economic policies of the Modi government. However, Rahul also sparked a major row when he said that the policies of then Atal Bihari Vajpayee government set the valley on fire.

When asked about how Congress will solve the Kashmir problem if voted to power? Rahul Gandhi said that the UPA government between 2004- 2014 managed to curb terrorism. He went on to say that there was almost no problem in Kashmir when UPA was in power.

Addressing women students at the Stella Maris College, Rahul Gandhi said the Congress will change the mood of the country and make people feel happy and empowered. Gandhi, who asked students to refer to him as Rahul, said the law must apply to everybody and not be applied selectively.

He said this in response to a question on his brother-in-law Robert Vadra. In his informal interaction with the students, he also brought up the issue of the Rafale deal and reiterated his allegations about the pricing of the aircraft and the process.

"I will be the first person to say it... investigate Robert Vadra but also investigate Prime Minister Narendra Modi," he said. Gandhi said the Congress would pass the women's reservation bill it if it comes to power.

"Don't see enough women in leadership positions. You cannot have women in power in India until attitude towards them changes," he told the cheering crowd. In response to a question, he said he had learnt the lessons of humility and love from his mother Sonia Gandhi.

He asked the gathering, "Did you like demonetisaton?" When the audience answered, "No", he said, "I think it's pretty clear the damage demonetisaton did. PM should have taken your advice."

Gandhi, who asked the students to challenge him and "make him uncomfortable", also questioned whether the prime minister could stand in a large audience and answer people's questions.

Here are the highlights of Rahul Gandhi's interaction with the students:
