Rajiv Gandhi case convict Nalini gets parole for daughter wedding

Madras high court grants 30 days leave to Rajiv Gandhi’s killer, life convict Nalini

CHENNAI: India's longest serving woman prisoner and Rajiv Gandhi assassination life convict Nalini Sriharan will be out on parole for 30 days, as the Madras high court on Friday allowed her plea seeking ordinary leave.A division bench of Justice M M Sundresh and Justice M Nirmal Kumar passed the order after hearing Nalini's submission. Nalini appeared in court in person.Though Nalini sought six months leave to make arrangements for her daughter's marriage, the bench held that as per suspension of sentence rules, only a maximum of 30 days ordinary leave could be granted.Concurring with the submissions of the state, the bench made it clear that Nalini should not interact or give interview to media or meet political leaders.The bench then directed the prison authorities to process her application within 10 days.Nalini, who has been in prison for over 28 years, wanted the high court to direct the superintendent of police, Special Prison for Women in Vellore, to produce her before the court so that she could argue her case for leave as a party-in-person.According to Nalini, a life convict is entitled to one month’s leave once in two years and since she had never availed such ordinary leave for more than 27 years, she made a representation to the prison authorities on February 25 seeking six months leave to make arrangement for her daughter’s marriage.Subsequently, Nalini’s mother also made a similar representation on March 22. As the authorities failed to consider her representation, she moved the high court.Originally, Nalini was sentenced to death. Subsequently, her death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the Tamil Nadu government on April 24, 2000.Claiming that after commutation of her death sentence, around 3,700 life convicts -- who had served ten years of imprisonment and less -- were released by the Tamil Nadu government, she said, “My request to the state for premature release under the 1994 scheme of premature release of life convicts was cleared by the council of ministers, and on September 9, 2018, the council advised the governor to release me and other six life convicts in the case. But it has been over six months and the decision of the state still remains unimplemented.”
