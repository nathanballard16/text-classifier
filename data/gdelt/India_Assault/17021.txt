'Their spade hit the pot': Baby found buried alive highlights India's battle to protect girls

Delhi: A baby girl found buried alive in India was a suspected case of attempted female infanticide, police said on Monday, the latest to highlight the preference for sons in a country where the number of girls has been declining.

A couple, who went to bury their newborn at a grave after she died in hospital, discovered the youngster inside an earthen pot buried several feet deep, said a police officer in Bareilly city in northern Uttar Pradesh state.

The baby was rushed to a nearby hospital, where she is recovering, while police are looking for her parents.

"Their spade hit the pot and they heard a baby's cries coming from it," the officer said on the condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.

"They immediately called the cemetery guard, who said that he saw the parents there earlier. It seems to be a case of female infanticide," he said, adding that the baby was about five days old.
