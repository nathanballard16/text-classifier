7 arrested for assaulting constable

Mumbai: The Amboli police on Thursday arrested seven people for allegedly assaulting an on-duty constable on Wednesday.

The incident occurred around 12.30 p.m. on Wednesday during a nakabandi opposite the Malcolm Baug police chowky in Jogeshwari. Norman Karodiya (27), a resident of Royal building, who was riding his motorcycle, was stopped by constable Sagar Kondvilkar for not wearing a helmet.

The police said Mr. Karodiya called up his relatives, Abdul Karodiya, Haroon Karodiya and Ismail Karodiya. As he charged at Mr. Kondvilkar, the keys in his hands tore into Mr. Kondvilkar’s palm, causing it to bleed.

Mr. Karodiya’s relatives reached the spot and they, along with Shaina and Sameer Sayyed, who had been penalised earlier, and a local journalist identified as Imran Siddiqui, assaulted Mr. Kondvilkar, officers said.

Alerted by Mr. Kondvilkar, some more police officials from Amboli police station reached the spot. Mr. Karodiya and Mr. Kondvilkar were taken to hospital.

“Mr. Karodiya, who had some of Mr. Kondvilkar’s blood on his clothes, later claimed that it was him who got injured. However, a complete medical check-up was conducted and not a single injury was detected on his body, and the blood was certified to be Mr. Kondvilkar’s,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone 9) Paramjit Singh Dahiya said.

The other accused were arrested on Thursday evening. All the seven accused have been charged with assault, rioting, unlawful assembly, and assaulting a police officer on duty under the Indian Penal code. They will be produced in court on Friday.
