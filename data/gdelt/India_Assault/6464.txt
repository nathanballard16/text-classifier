Police said they arrested Gopinath who got into an argument with the elderly man while the latter was seeking votes for the AIADMK-BJP alliance late Saturday.

In a fit of rage, Gopinath attacked Govindarajan, who collapsed and died on the spot, police said.

Gopinath was arrested Sunday and produced before a court which remanded him to judicial custody, they added.
