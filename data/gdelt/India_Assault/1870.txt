A Quarter of Rape Cases in India are a Result of Failure to Marry – NGO

Rape charges filed under the false pretext of marriage are very hard on men even though they may eventually be acquitted. Many have to suffer shame and seclusion. Their lives are shattered, their jobs lost, and their reputation may be permanently tarnished.

As women are becoming more confident and educated, the numbers of such casesf are on the rise, given that women today are more sexually liberated and active prior to marriage than in previous generations. When consensual relationships end some women allege rape against their partner out of spite, vengeance or extortion.

In some cases, it is the parents of girls that force their daughters to file such rape charges, as some of them believe that saying their daughter has been raped is preferable to people thinking that she is sexually active on her own accord.

Apart from the judiciary's move, there are men's rights groups which are working to help people who have been falsely implicated of rape while exiting a consensual sexual relationship. According to them, such false cases belittle genuine rapes.

These groups insist that the identity of suspects shouldn't be revealed early on, to avoid potentially unnecessary reputational damage. They contend that those who make false allegations of rape are encouraged by the fact that rape victims' identities are not revealed, thus shielding even false claimants from social embarrassment. Such procedures should be extended to men to protect innocent suspects.
