Mentally unstable

MENTAL disorders are common, nowadays especially in South Asia. Some of the more common symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases include memory loss, forgetfulness, apathy, anxiety, agitation, a loss of inhibition and severe mood changes.

To the trained medical eye, all these symptoms are to be found in abundunce in India’s former army officer, Major General S.P. Sinha, who recently spewed venom against Kashmiris in a TV interview.

Over the decades the façade of reason and logic worn by India’s Hindu extremists is gradually being eroded as the saffron brigade continues to commit human rights abuses against India’s minorities and the Dalits, who are the largest group by population in the country.

One is at a loss to understand why the extremist Hindu general’s unbecoming remarks have been ignored and he has been called a ‘loose missile’. This is a very serious matter. Why has Amnesty International not taken up the matter and issued warnings to India for unleashing terrorism in Kashmir and failing to take action against the hate-filled statements of extremist Hindus?

The retired Indian general should be tried for inciting the majority community to violence and instigating sexual assault against the Kashmiri people. At the very least this insane man must be sent to a psychiatric hospital where brain disorders are treated. One can imagine what are moral standards in India where the top brass can get away with such putrid hatred.
