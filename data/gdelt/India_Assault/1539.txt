Vijay Mallya to initiate legal process after UK Home Secretary approves extradition to India

"Vijay Mallya is accused in India of conspiracy to defraud, making false representations and money laundering offences."

A day after UK Home Secretary ordered the extradition of Vijay Mallya to India, embattled liquor baron on Monday took to Twitter and said that he will now initiate the appeal process. “After the decision was handed down on December 10,2018 by the Westminster Magistrates Court, I stated my intention to appeal. I could not initiate the appeal process before a decision by the Home Secretary. Now I will initiate the appeal process,” he tweeted. The 63-year-old businessman had lost a legal challenge against his extradition in a British court in December. Under the Extradition Treaty procedures, the Chief Magistrate's verdict was sent to the Home Secretary because only he is authorised to order Mallya's extradition. A UK Home Office spokesperson said: "On 3 February the Secretary of State, having carefully considered all relevant matters, signed the order for Vijay Mallya's extradition to India.
