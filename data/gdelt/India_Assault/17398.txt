Over 45% rise in sedition cases in 2017: NCRB Data

New Delhi: Assam recorded the highest number of sedition cases followed by Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha and Tamil Nadu, according to the 2017 National Crime Records Bureau NCRB ) data. The total number of sedition cases increased from 35 in 2016 to 51 in 2017, where 228 persons were arrested by the police, as compared to 48 in 2016. Assam, which reported no case of sedition in 2016, registered 19 cases in 2017 while Haryana recorded 13 incidents.Only four persons were convicted on charges of sedition in 2017. The NCRB data shows three juveniles and nine women were among the 228 arrested. Law Commission of India in its report last year has called for rethink on sedition laws.However, the Union home ministry in a recent reply before the Rajya Sabha had said, “There is no proposal to scrap the sedition law. There is a need to retain the provision to effectively combat anti-national , secessionist and terrorist elements.”In the run-up to the general elections, BJP and Congress were locked in war of words over sedition law. Congress in its manifesto had even announced that it will scrap the law if voted to power. The move, however, drew sharp reaction from BJP with Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticising the Congress manifesto at an election rally in Gujarat, saying, “Congress is now saying that it will repeal the sedition law. Can we expect this from a 125-year-old party?"On not including crime against journalist, RTI activists and inclidents of lynchings, home ministry said, “Crime against journalist, whistle blowers, social workers were not included in the NCRB as they constitute vague/unreliable data.Similarly, there is no data for crime committed by religious preachers, khap panchayats, and illegal migrants or on the method of crime murder such as lynchings, hate crime, rumors, fake news among others.”Officials added that data on rapes committed during communal violence and human rights violations by CAPFs and defence personnel among others also prone to misinterpretation hence not published.
