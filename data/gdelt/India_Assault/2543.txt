Stop Injuring Innocent Civilians with Pellet Guns

Target: Ram Nath Kovind, President of India

Goal: End the use of violent and dangerous pellet guns on innocent civilians.

Indian armed forces are injuring innocent men, women, and children with dangerous pellet gun attacks. The nation of India has occupied Kashmir and its citizens, subjecting them to gross human rights violations. Demand this cruelty be brought to an end.

Over 3,000 innocent civilians have sustained injuries from excessive force involving pellet guns. Even a 19-month-old baby has been injured, requiring surgery to repair her eyesight. This has resulted in public outcry that has only heightened the violence.

Activists around the world have demanded India end this violent abuse of human rights. Join them. Sign this petition to demand India stop harming innocent men, women, and children with pellet guns.

PETITION LETTER:

Dear President Kovind,

Over 3,000 innocent civilians have been injured by excessive force on the part of India’s armed forces in Kashmir. Even a 19-month-old baby has been unable to escape the violence pellet guns have posed.

This brutality violates international human rights and must be brought to an end. I demand you end the violence against the citizens of Kashmir. Restore basic human rights and safety to the area.

Sincerely,

[Your Name Here]
