No infiltrator will remain in our country: Nadda

In an apparent reference to the Register of Citizens (NRC), BJP working president JP Nadda has said that no infiltrator will remain in the country.

"In the time to come, we'll make arrangements where no infiltrator will remain in our country. Infiltrators will go out and Hindus, Jains, Sikhs, Christians who were tortured outside, will be given refuge by India. It's a country, not an inn," Nadda said addressing the Vijay Sankalp Yatra here on Friday.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das was also present at the event.

Nadda also touched on several other issues like abrogation of Article 370, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Houston visit and corruption.

"If you remember, five years back corruption used to be in full swing. Fragile governments were unable to control the situation," he said.
