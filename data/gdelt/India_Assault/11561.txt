Parth Pawar's driver alleges abduction by unidentified men

A 26-year-old man, driver of NCP leader Parth Pawar, alleged Thursday that he was abducted by two unidentified men from Mumbai last week.

Manoj Satpute, the complainant, claimed the culprits assaulted him inside a car before dropping him by the roadside in Ahmednagar district, 230 km away from Mumbai, said an official of Pune Rural Police.

Satpute, resident of Shirur in Pune district, works as driver for Parth Pawar, son of former Maharashtra deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar.

On July 5, two men approached him in the Colaba area of Mumbai and one of them asked him if he worked for Parth Pawar, he said.

When Satpute said he did, they requested him to come with them in a car and give them directions to Pawar's address in Mumbai.

They beat him up after he sat in the car, and later abandoned him somewhere in Parner tehsil of Ahmednagar in unconscious state, he told police.

A case under sections 363 (kidnapping) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC was registered at Shikrapur police station in Pune district, the police official said.

The case was transferred to Colaba police station for further investigation, he added.
