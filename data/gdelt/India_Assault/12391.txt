Man dies in NTPC plant in Nagpur, workers protest, pelt stones

A worker was crushed to death under a machine unloading coal from a wagon at the NTPC's power plant in Mouda in Nagpur on Friday, police said.

Co-workers of deceased Ajay Keshav Motghare (22) held protests and indulged in stone-pelting after the incident which took place around 5:25am, an official said.

"Motghare, a resident of Mouda, was working on contract with Sai Urja Indo Ventures, which unloads coal from wagons at the plant. He was rushed to a hospital but succumbed. About 500-600 workers protested in front of the hospital," he said.

The protesting workers demanded that Motghare's family be given Rs 50 lakh and his brother a job in the plant, the official said.

"Some of the protesters also threw stones, including at the residence of the plant's top official. Two security personnel were injured in the stone-pelting," he said.

A meeting was held between the plant's management and protesters after which it was decided that the kin of Motghare would get Rs 28.50 lakh as compensation, an official said.

A case has been registered under section 174 (non attendance in obedience to an order from public servant) of the Indian Penal Code, police said.
