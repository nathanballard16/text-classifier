Niloufer doctors protest over attack

Hyderabad: Junior doctors in Niloufer Hyderabad boycotted OP duties for a few hours on Saturday in protest against one of their colleagues being attacked. The junior doctor was allegedly attacked by the uncle of a deceased baby. The protesting doctors gathered near the office of Superintendent Dr V Murali Krishna demanding strengthening of security in hospital premises.Dr Rahul, a second-year student in MD (Paediatrics) and hailing from Karnataka was hit on his face which led to injuries to ears.

He complained of headache and dizziness and was admitted at OGH for four hours after which he returned and took rest in the hostel.According to the doctors, the 10-month-old baby Ashra Begum was suffering from protein-energy malnutrition with severe dehydration. She was being treated at the hospital for the last one week.The doctors said that they had instructed the parents not to give any liquids or solids to the baby, but the baby was fed milk which deteriorated the condition of the baby.

The milk had reached the lungs of the baby from the stomach and it caused aspiration. The baby was intubated but all efforts of the doctors were in vain and the child succumbed to death. On knowing the news, the baby's uncle reached the hospital and assaulted the junior doctor. Following the protest, Superintendent assured that he would take steps to up the security in the hospital in the next three days.

Meanwhile, TJUDA chairman Dr P S Vijayender Goud who expressed solidarity to his fellow colleagues’ stir at Niloufer said lack of proper security was one of the problems for recurrence of such incidents in hospitals. Further, he said that sad state of affairs in primary health care in the districts and increased patient load were not helping the situation either and it is the interns and junior doctors in city hospitals who are at the receiving end always.
