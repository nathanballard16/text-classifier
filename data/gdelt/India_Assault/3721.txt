Alok Nath to be seen as a judge in film based on #MeToo movement

Veteran actor Alok Nath became a controversial figure in 2018 after he was accused of rape by producer Vinta Nanda during the #MeToo India movement. Soon after that, he was expelled from Cine and TV Artistes Association (CINTAA) after a no-show at a meeting held on November 12, 2018. Alok Nath, who was often addressed as 'Sanskari Babuji' constantly denied all the reports made by Vinta Nanda. He had even filed a defamation case against her on October 15, 2018.

Alok is now a part of a film based on #MeToo movement. The actor will be seen playing the role of a judge in the film, as per reports in the tabloid. When he was asked about the film, the actor said, "I’m not doing any films at the moment. This was something I shot for a while ago. Is there a problem? You sound sad that I’m doing a film. It’s a puny role for poor producers, let it release."

The film is titled Main Bhi and is directed by Nasir Khan. It also stars Khalid Siddiqui, Shawar Ali, Imran Khan, Mukesh Khanna and Shahbaz Khan in pivotal roles. Talking about the film, Khalid revealed to the tabloid that Alok Nath will be giving a speech in the climax stating how molestation is wrong.

After Vinta Nanda, celebrities like Sandhya Mridul, Himani Shivpuri and Deepika Amin also accused Alok Nath of sexual harassment.

Alok Nath was last seen in 2018 blockbuster Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety alongside Kartik Aaryan.
