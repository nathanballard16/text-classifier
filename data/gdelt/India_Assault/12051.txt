Chandigarh: The Punjab Election Commission in its election awareness drive in Hoshiarpur district has put the face of a Nirbhya rape convict on its banners and posters along with noted celebrities with a message underlying the significance of voting. The posters have kicked up a storm and are being widely shared on social media with users expressing their shock over the administrative lapse.

The poster features the face of Mukesh Singh, who had claimed that he didn't commit the crime and was only driving the bus. Mukesh was found guilty and was convicted. He along with 4 others were sentenced to capital punishment by a Delhi court and then the Delhi High Court. His petition challenging the verdict has also been dismissed by the Supreme Court.

His face on posters put up by the EC is receiving backlash with Punjab Minister asserting that it might be a case of mistaken identity. Shyam Arora while speaking to the media said that a probe will be conducted to ascertain how it happened. "It must be a case of mistaken identity. It isn't written that he is the Nirbhaya rape-convict, so could be a case of mistaken identity, we will find out," he said.
