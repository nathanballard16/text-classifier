Innocent lookalikes face netizens’ wrath

VADODARA: After cops released sketches of Navlakhi gang rape case suspects, many a lookalike has been “identified” by fake social propagandists.In fact, two friends who looked similar to the duo’s sketches and also had pictures together, fell prey to ‘social media’s court of justice’ since Saturday.Law student Vraj Shikhaliya and his friend, Nirav Vasava , a BSc student from Dabhoi were in for surprise when suddenly their social media profiles turned ‘hot’ late on Saturday afternoon. The shocked duo found being subjected to harangue by netizens who condemned and abused them for the Navlakhi gang rape case.It later came to light that mischief-makers took screenshots of their pictures from their accounts and circulated them widely on social media as the suspect duo. Since the screenshots also had their user names, people started making comments on their social media accounts.Talking to TOI, Shikhaliya said he decided to take up the matter with the Dabhoi police. “The first sketch that was released by the police had some resemblance with me. Then this activity started on my profile and some friends and family members called me up to inquire about it. I was 40km away when the incident took place,” he said.When the city police came to know about the messages that have gone viral, they decided to clarify the matter and posted pictures of the two youths with a clarification that they were not the accused in the case.Shikhaliya said that he is still getting comments on his social media profiles, but now more of apology than negative ones. “Some comments even now are negative,” he said.Vasava pointed out that some of the messages left on his social media profile were even threats. “When we approached the police, they said that our details had already been verified and advised us to approach the Vadodara crime branch to report the matter there,” he said.
