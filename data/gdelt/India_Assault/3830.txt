Man arrested for kidnap, murder of rival gang member

Both gangs were involved in liquor smuggling in Bihar; they burnt body in Mathura before fleeing spot

A resident of Bihar has been arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of a rival gang member on February 20 in Faridabad, the police said on Friday.

Both gangs were involved in illicit liquor smuggling, they said.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Deo said Pankaj Kumar was involved in the murder and kidnapping of Amit Kumar Singh.

Twenty criminal cases

The victim has over 20 cases of murder and kidnapping registered against him.

On Wednesday, the police received a tip-off stating that the accused would be coming to Inter-State Bus Terminal (ISBT) Kashmere Gate to meet someone after which a trap was laid and he was arrested.

During interrogation, Pankaj allegedly told the police that he was an accomplice of one Chunnu Thakur who runs a gang, which supplies illicit liquor in Bihar.

February 20 incident

“Singh had his own gang involved in the same business. Pankaj said he along with two others — Ravi and Mannu — forced Singh to enter a flat in Faridabad owned by one Jitender Nagar, on February 20,” Mr. Deo said.

The next day, the accused came to the flat and saw Singh dead.

He then along with Ravi and Manny took Singh’s body to an isolated place in Mathura, poured petrol and burnt it before returning to Delhi.

The victim was murdered by Thakur, Nagar and Ravi, the police said.

Singh’s kidnapping case was registered in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur.

The murder case was registered in Mathura’s Farah police station where the body was found, the police said.

The police said Pankaj was an autorickshaw driver before he and his brother Avnish started ferrying “hawala” money of Thakur for which they were paid a handsome amount.
