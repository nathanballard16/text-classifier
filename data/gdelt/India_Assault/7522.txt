Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal assaulted under nose of 60 police officers

A senior security branch officer said Kejriwal’s security category does not involve sanitisation of every single area across the route. Two rings of protective cover involving over 60 Delhi Police officers, trained in identifying gait and catching projectiles. A Delhi Police commando unit, four CRPF officers and an emergency response vehicle was also deputed by Delhi Police. “The security branch had apprised the cavalcade about threat perception and the difficulty in controlling movement of people seeping in from the crowd. Police suggested that the inner protective ring was compromised as some AAP leaders did not allow the security branch to effectively cordon off the area.
