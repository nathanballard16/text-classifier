Congress leader writes to Modi questions his intent to win trust of minorities

AGRA: Congress leader and former MLA from Samajwadi party in Aligarh, Zameer Ullah Khan , has written a letter to the Prime Minister-elect, Narendra Modi , questioning his intent to win the trust of minorities when right-wing activists are allegedly openly assaulting and threatening people from the minority community.Khan’s statement comes a day after BJP leader and former mayor Shakuntala Bharti warned the Aligarh police to stop butchers for transporting meat in open. If the police fail to take action, people will themselves do justice and the local administration will be responsible for the consequences.Talking to media, Khan said that since the BJP came into power, minority communities have been living in fear. They have been asked to remove their skull caps, their tiffins are being checked and they are being targeted for one reason or the other. He said he is hopeful that the PM will live up to his words and some transformation will be seen on the ground.In a letter to the PM with a subject, “minority community is continuously being attacked”, Khan questioned as to why the BJP government is not able to tackle meat related issues and stop assaults on minorities.Referring the recent incident in Aligarh, when a vehicle transporting meat was stopped by right-wing activists near Railway crossing, Khan said that anything could have happened with the persons transporting meat if the police and media had not reached there in time. Khan also mentioned the Gurugram incident, where a Muslim man was told to remove his skullcap and chant Jai Shri Ram.Khan appealed to Modi to take cognisance of these incidents and punish the accused responsible for such incidents. He said that Modi should consider the problems of the minority community and follow his slogan of “Sabka Sath Sabka Vikas (solidarity with everyone, development for all) and Sabka vishvas (trust of all)”.
