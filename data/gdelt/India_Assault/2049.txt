The Opposition, comprising Aam Aadmi Party, Lok Insaaf Party and the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD), today cornered the government over the issue of police lathicharge on teachers and Ludhiana gang rape during the Question Hour and Zero Hour.

Attacking CM Capt Amarinder Singh over the “deteriorating” law and order situation in the state, LIP MLA Simarjit Singh Bains said if the CM was “too burdened with other works”, he should give the charge of Home to some other minister.

AAP Jagraon MLA Sarabjit Kaur Manuke claimed that crime against women had been rising. She said, “Had the Mullanpur Dakha police acted upon information provided by the victim’s friend, the incident could have been averted. The government must sack the erring cops.”

AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan said the government had been ignoring the issue of teachers. The SAD and AAP separately raised slogans against the government over lathicharge on teachers and later walked out of the House. AAP accused the CM of continuing the “legacy” of the SAD-BJP government, when it comes to dealing with the teachers.

CM: Will seek speedy trial in rape cases

Responding to the Opposition charge, the CM claimed that the law and order situation had in fact improved in the state and he was ready for a debate on the issue. He, however, assured the House that he would meet the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court to ensure speedy trial in rape cases. He stressed the need for prompt dispensation of justice to the victims, besides exemplary punishment to the convicts in such acts as a deterrent for others. The CM informed the House that of six accused in this heinous crime, three had been arrested and the remaining would be nabbed soon.
