Bhopal: In another case of rape reported from Bhopal, an 18-year-old girl student was allegedly raped by her 32-year-old neighbour. The incident came into light on Sunday when the victim narrated her ordeal to her parents when they counselled her after noticing changes in her behaviour.

According to a Times of India report, the incident took place nine months back when the victim was raped for the first time. He first offered her a lift and pretended that he had something important to discuss with her; took her by deceit to a friend's rental flat in Siddi Colony where he allegedly molested her. Since the survivor trusted him, she went along with him without much fuss. When the girl realised that the man had nefarious designs, she protested but to no avail. The accused threatened to kill her and thereafter repeatedly raped on several occasions. This ordeal continued till November 30, 2018.

Meanwhile, the survivor's parents noticed that she had stopped interacting with the family of the accused and counselled her about the same.
