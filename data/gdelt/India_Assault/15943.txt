Thane: For 8 months, trio picked up 7-year-old girl waiting outside school, raped her

The accused have been sent to police custody till Tuesday

KALYAN: The police on Saturday arrested two shop owners and a caterer for allegedly sexually assaulting a seven-year-old girl in a dilapidated, abandoned building near her school in Kalyan on four to five occasions over eight months.

The police said Navin Jasuja (24), Ajay Dohare (34) and Vikram Purohit (19) took advantage of the girl when she waited outside her school for the autorickshaw, hired by her parents, to take her home. Jasuja owns a garment store, Dohare runs a catering business and Purohit sells bags in his shop.

The incident has raised questions over the safety of children waiting outside the school premises. The police said they will question the school staff on Monday.

The incident came to light when the girl's grandmother noticed a change in her behaviour. She enquired with the girl, and was shocked when she told her that after school, three men would take her to an isolated spot and 'play' with her. The grandmother informed her son and daughter-in-law, who approached the Bazarpeth police late on Saturday.

"The trio was arrested and booked for gangrape as well as under the relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act," said Dilip Fulpagare, inspector, Bazarpeth police station. The police are collecting technical evidence to ensure maximum punishment for the accused .

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)
