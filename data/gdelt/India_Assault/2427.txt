Muzaffarpur shelter case: Court forwards petition blaming Nitish Kumar government of inaction to CBI

A special POCSO court in Muzaffarpur has forwarded a petition (which accuses the Bihar government of turning a blind eye into a time-based inquiry in the Muzaffarpur shelter case) to the CBI to look into it.

The petition was filed by Ashwani Kumar, an accused in the Muzaffarpur case.

Ashwani would pose as a doctor and visit the shelter home to allegedly administer sedative-laced injections to the inmates before they were subjected to sexual abuse.

The state government allegedly continued funding shelter homes even after Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS) submitted the report that brought the horrific details to light.

The case had come to light last year when a report of the social audit conducted by Mumbai-based Tata Institute of Social Sciences flagged sexual abuse of inmates at the Muzaffarpur shelter home.

An FIR was lodged in May last year and a number of persons, including Brajesh Thakur, the owner of the NGO running the shelter home, were arrested by police in connection with the scandal.

The matter was handed over to the CBI in July. Shortly afterwards, state social welfare minister Manju Verma stepped down after media reported that her husband had close links with Brajesh Thakur, the owner of the shelter home.

Thakur has been shifted to a jail in Patiala following the order of the Supreme Court even as other accused, including his close aides and some government officials, are lodged in jails at Patna and Muzaffarpur.

The apex court had recently also directed the CBI to take over the probe into allegations of sexual abuse at all such shelter homes across the state.
