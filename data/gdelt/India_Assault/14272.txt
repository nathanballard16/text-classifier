Prostitution racket busted in Hyderabad, 17-YO girl rescued

Hyderabad: A human trafficking racket was unearthed by the Rachakonda police with the arrest of three persons on Thursday. The three included a couple involved in trafficking belonging to Bangladesh and a man from the city.

Police also rescued a minor girl from the clutches of the accused. The operation was taken up following a specific input provided by Prajwala Foundation’s Dr. Sunita Krishnan to Rachakonda Police Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat on the trafficking of a minor girl from Bangladesh to Hyderabad.

Teams were formed, comprising Special Operations Group, the Kushaiguda police, and Prajwala NGO members, which conducted a ‘raid and rescue’ operation to arrest the accused.

According to the police, accused Mohd Sohail Hussain, 29, is a worker in Tech Mahindra Company who had illegally migrated to India from Bangladesh about 10 years ago. He later married Visti Hossan, 25, about four years ago. The couple lived in New Hafeezpet area of Miyapur.

Police said they came in touch with one Sigdhar, who brought the 17-year-old victim from Bangladesh by pretending to love her. He took the help of one Sujan, who used her as a dancer and later pushed her in prostitution in Bangalore. The girl was then handed over to a woman, Vijaya, in Vijayawada where she was sexually assaulted by her son Sai. She was forced to continue prostitution by Sai and his friends.

The victim was ‘purchased’ back by Sohail for prostitution in Hyderabad, police said. On the intervening night of Wednesday and Thursday, when the couple came to a place near ECIL and called up a customer, Kounsu Hari Chowdary, 28, the police team raided and caught the accused. An intensive search led the police to bust the sex racket involving traffickers from Bangladesh.
