Ahmedabad: Four molest woman sleeping on footpath, stab husband too

The complainant and her husband work as labours and live on the footpath. A 30-year-old woman lodged a complaint with the Kalupur police station on Monday that four men tried to molest her while she was sleeping on the footpath and that when her husband tried to stop them, he was stabbed by one of the accused. As she got up, four unidentified men were trying to molest her so she started shouting, which alerted her husband, who then tried to stop them. In the dispute, one of the accused pulled out a knife and stabbed her husband and then they fled from the spot. On Sunday night, after getting back from work, the couple slept on the footpath and at around 4 am, the woman woke up after she felt someone was touching her.
