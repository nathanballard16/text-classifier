Two women beaten, head shaved after resisting rape in India

Two men were arrested in India’s Bihar state after they shaved heads of two women as a punishment for resisting rape, reported by BBC News. The group of men ambushed the mother and daughter in their house with the intention of raping them, when the women resisted, they abused them and as punishment, shaved their heads and paraded them through the village.Police are searching for five other suspects linked to the horrifying incident.The mother, speaking to an Indian publication, said: “We were beaten with sticks very badly. I have injuries all over my body and my daughter also has some injuries.”“Some men entered victims home and tried to molest the daughter; the mother helped her fight off the men," said a police official and added that further action will be taken.In 2018, a teenager took her own life after being repeatedly raped for months in India.Whether it is in the capital city, Delhi, or a metropolitan, Mumbai, or in fact even a more conservative city, rape cases are being reported from everywhere almost on a daily basis.Whether arrests of the accused are made or not, the sufferers are left to deal with their emotional and physical wounds on their own. Psychological care is little, if any, and in most cases only the more affluent are able to afford it.
