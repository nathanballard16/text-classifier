Lawyer alleges assault by Bhandup cops

A 50-year-old lawyer, Reena Richard, said that officials from the Bhandup police station assaulted and detained her for two hours on Sunday. When her daughter Stephanie started a live video on Twitter from the station, tagging the commissioner and the Mumbai Police, the officials allegedly confiscated the phone and detained them.

Ms. Richard accompanied her client Noorkhan Pathan, who was summoned to the police station at 1.30 p.m. The police asked him to stop construction of a boundary wall on his land as someone had complained against him, Ms. Richard said. Though it was a civil matter, a woman official insisted that her client cannot continue with the construction. When Ms. Richard asked about the complainant, the woman official began shouting at her and recording their video on her phone. “She asked us to get outof the police station,” Ms. Richard said. Then her daughter started a Twitter video which angered the police, who surrounded them.

Senior police inspector Ramesh D. Khade said that the phone was confiscated as it is not permitted to record inside a police station. “We are looking into their other allegations,” he said.

Ms. Richard has written an application to the Mr. Khade asking him to inquire into the incident and return her daughter’s phone.
