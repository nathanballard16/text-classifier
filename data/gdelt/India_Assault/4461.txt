PM Narendra Modi on Friday called attack on Kashmiris \"work of misguided people\".

\"I would also like to request other state governments to take strict action, wherever such acts take place,\" he said.

Two Kashmiris selling dry fruit were thrashed by a group of saffron-clad men in Daliganj locality in Lucknow, following which four persons have been arrested, police said Thursday.
