RAIPUR: Raped by four men, strangled and left for dead, a 20-year-old woman dragged herself to a relative’s place in Rajnandgaon , took almost a week to recuperate from the trauma, and had them all arrested on Monday. All the four accused are 19-20-year-olds.The survivor had gone to her maternal uncle’s home in another village for a family function. On the night of December 2, she stepped out to dispose of the garbage, but the four — who seemed to be lying in wait — grabbed her and dragged her to an isolated place. She shouted for help but nobody heard her as a loudspeaker was playing at the function.The four stuffed cloth into her mouth and then took turns to rape her. Then, they tried to strangle her, says the complaint. She fell unconscious and the four, believing she was dead, fled. After she regained consciousness, she somehow made it back to her uncle’s house but did not say anything about the incident.Finally, on Sunday, she told her parents about the incident and said she was determined to bring them to justice. They immediately took her to police, who registered an FIR.
