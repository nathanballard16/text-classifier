Various assaults on Kashmiris have been reported in the country following the Pulwama attack. A suicide bomber of the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed attacked a security convoy with a vehicle laden with explosives. The attack took away the lives of 40 CRPF jawans and left the country mourning in loss.
