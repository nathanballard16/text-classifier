Law has changed, society must too

LGBTIQ

Supreme Court judgment

Navtej Singh Johar

Union of India

Alternative Law Forum

Indian Constitution

By InvitationToday, September 6, marks the first anniversary of the decriminalisation of the intimate lives ofpersons, following the landmarkin thev.case. The judgment vindicated the 17-year struggle of the community, and marked a moment of hope for a future that could be free of discrimination and violence on grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.The importance of the Navtej judgment is that it puts in place norms that LGBTIQ persons have an equal claim as citizens, and are no longer deemed criminals by law. By anchoring the rights of LGBTIQ persons to the Constitution, it dispels the notions of society that saw them as ‘perverted and criminal’.The judges, however, were well aware that a change in law is only a stepping stone to a broader, more holistic shift in social morality. An ultimate change in attitudes towards LGBTIQ will come when a social and cultural shift happens, which is both societal and institutional in its scope.One key institution in which this shift in mindset has still to take place, is the police. Recent crisis cases handled by Rahi and theindicate that the police have yet to imbibe the norms of the judgment, and still view LGBTIQ persons through the prism of a majoritarian morality. This has meant that when two consenting adults choose to live together, and disapproving parents complain to the police against this exercise of legitimate choice, the police are still prone to trying to separate them and send them back to their families. It is still an uphill battle for activists to convince the police that homosexuality is not an offence as per the Supreme Court, and the Constitution mandates that individual choice is sacrosanct. However, police stations continue to function as institutions that enforce the morality of a heterosexist and patriarchal society.The judges seemed cognisant of this, and Justice Nariman in his judgment ordered that “[the] judgment be given wide publicity” and “all government officials, including and in particular police officials, and other officers of the Union of India and the States, be given periodic sensitization and awareness training” in “the light of the observations contained in this judgment”.It’s important that the Directors General of Police issue, in their respective states, clear guidelines on the implications of the Navtej judgment for the police, with specific instructions to their personnel to treat LGBTIQ persons as full citizens, entitled to all the rights accorded to them by the. Civil society must work towards ensuring that every police station has a poster which lists, prominently, the key aspects of the Navtej Singh Johar judgment.One of the key interveners in the Navtej petition were current and former LGBTIQ students of IIT who, the judgement notes, created a support group called Pravritti. It’s important that organisations such as Pravritti proliferate and there are such support groups or queer/straight alliances not only at elite educational institutions, but in schools and colleges across the country. Schools are often the first place for LGBTIQ persons to face relentless bullying and harassment, and it’s important that all educational institutions begin to inculcate a respect for all individuals, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression or characteristics.The key question is, how does one ensure that the norms of the judgment become a part of the institutional common sense of police stations, educational institutions, workplaces and medical spaces? The issue of sexual orientation and gender identity is as much about the structural biases and prejudices of society as it is about state law or state behaviour. As such, it’s not only the responsibility of the state but also that of both civil and political society tackle this prejudicial mindset.Even as we mark this important victory, we need to do a lot more work to ensure that ‘social morality’ is transmuted into ‘constitutional morality’. And that violence and discrimination against LGBTIQ persons becomes an archival memory rather than an everyday reality.(The writer is a human rights lawyer based in Bangalore)
