Women Rap Against Rape in India

Addressing rape and misogyny in India, the BomBaebs spare no one in this rap video.

“We’re now known as the land of rapes. But did you ever wonder how this took shape?”

Few experts on violence against women have been as articulate and hard-hitting as the BomBaebs in this new video, #RapAgainstRape.

Forceful in their flow, theater artist Uppekha Jain and TV host Pankhuri Awasthi address issues of sexual assault, domestic violence and misogyny in India.

With the latest controversy over the ban on India’s Daughter, a documentary on the gang rape of a young woman in 2012, this rap video has gripped over 300,000 viewers in the past week.

“We know that our video is not going to bring massive changes on the ground,” says Jain, “but even if 10 people start thinking after watching our video, we will call it a success.”
