He was released last month and he liked to boast about himself in the area. To show off his dominance, he slapped Deepak's friend multiple times over a trivial argument, added the officer. The agency report further claimed that the friend then informed Deepak about the assault. In a bid to take revenge, Deepak found Shanu and his friend, Shivam,16, and he slapped Shanu and later stabbed him multiple times after an altercation.

However, when Shivam came to rescue Shanu, he too was attacked by Deepak. They somehow escaped the spot and Shanu and Shivam were taken to a nearby hospital where Shanu was declared brought dead.

The police said that Shivam was undergoing treatment.
