SC to hear petitions on police action against Jamia, AMU students tomorrow, asks protesters to stop violence first

The Supreme Court on Monday said it will hear petitions on the police action against student groups protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, held in Delhi’s Jamia Millia Islamia University and Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh Muslim University only when the violence stops.

“Let the rioting stop (first). Just because they happen to be students, it doesn’t mean they can take law in their own hands or destroy public properties, this has to be decided when things cool down,” said Chief Justice of India SA Bobde.

The Top Court will hear the case on Tuesday.

Senior lawyer Indira Jaising brought the matter to the notice of the court.

In a tweet Jaising said, “Hindus Muslims Christians Sikhs Buddhists Jains and Parsis ,unite to oppose CAA we are all illegal immigrants , until we prove we are citizens, oppose NRC , resist police brutality on students now.”

Earlier in the day Jaising tweeted, “Supreme Court Lawyers will gather outside Court No 1 todsy at 945 am to decide next legal course of action in defence of students whose life and liberty has been put in danger by the police.”

Protesters had set on fire four public buses on Sunday as they clashed with police in near Jamia university in south Delhi during a demonstration against the amended Citizenship Act.
