CAB Bill Protest News: Outsiders perpetrated violence in Kanpur

LUCKNOW: Two days after violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act claimed three lives in Kanpur, police on Sunday claimed that the crowd which attacked cops and set ablaze an outpost in Yateemkhana were outsiders.ADG (Kanpur zone) Prem Prakash told TOI: “Whatever happened in Kanpur was unbelievable. Cops were hit with bullets and brick-batting continued even after police used mild force to disperse the mob. Stone-pelters had covered their faces.” “The attacks were planned. We checked CCTV footages and found that no aged person was involved in attacks. Elders disappeared soon after violence began while youngsters and children fought pitched battle with police,” he said.The ADG said, “Police have identified some phone numbers which were used to form WhatsApp groups to mobilize crowd. These numbers were also used to operate social media accounts on Facebook and Twitter.”Prakash said police were probing the possible link of Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) with Kanpur violence . IG (Kanpur range) Mohit Agarwal said, “Initial probe revealed that most of the arrested persons were members of the Popular Front of India (PFI) and All-India Majlis-e-Ittehadul-Muslimeen (AIMIM).”“Many have been detained and are being quizzed. Eye-witnesses have given statements that locals were not involved in violence,” he added.
