U.S. and U.K. Issue Advisory for Women Traveling to India



The governments of the U.S. and the U.K. have issued travel advisories for women traveling to India, citing a significant increase in sexual assaults against women and young girls, including among visitors in tourist areas and populated cities.

“Many women travel safely each year without incident. However, when it comes to health and security, women travelers are more likely to be affected by religious and cultural beliefs of the foreign countries they visit,” according to the U.S. Department of State. “The truth is that women face greater obstacles, especially when travelling alone.”

“Women travelers should exercise caution when travelling in India even if travelling in a group,” according to the U.K. advisory. “British women have been the victims of sexual assault in Goa, Delhi and Rajasthan and women travelers often receive unwanted attention in the form of verbal and physical harassment by individuals or groups of men.”

Female travelers are advised to respect local dress codes and customs and avoid isolated areas, including beaches, when alone at any time of day.
