CHENNAI: In a crime executed in filmy style, a gang of men posing as fake CBI and airport Customs officers, stole Rs 27 lakh from a private forex company located at Pantheon Road, Egmore, here on Tuesday. Egmore police registered a case and are conducting an enquiry based on a complaint filed by one Amith Meeran (55), resident of Thiruvengadam Street, in Pudupet.

According to police, Amith Meeran, ran the money exchange firm at Prince Plaza shopping complex in Egmore, with his sons Kaja Moideen and Nasser. Sources said Amith had also employed two helpers Mohammed and Basheer.

On Tuesday morning, five persons in an SUV came to the shop, and introduced themselves as CBI and Customs officials. Sources said they carried out a raid and seized Rs. 78 lakh unaccounted cash from the company. They had also asked Amith Meeran and his men to come to their office in their own vehicle and sign a few documents.

To make things look real, the culprits in-between tried to work out a bargain with the firm. They told Amith Meeran that if he would give them Rs 27 lakh, then they would close the case, to which Amith Meeran agreed, and went along with the officials to sign the documents.

However, when their vehicle was near Island Grounds, the gang dropped Amith Meeran and Mohammed, and sped away. Realising that he was cheated, Amith Meeran lodged a complaint with Egmore police.

A special team headed by an Assistant Commissioner has been formed to investigate the case. Police said they have found CCTV footages from the ICF hospital, Egmore. Investigations are on.
