Explain why Unnao rape victim's letter to CJI not placed before court: SC to Secretary-General, to hear matter tomorrow

The Supreme Court on Wednesday sought a report from its secretary-general as to why a letter written by the Unnao rape victim to Chief Justice of India (CJI) Ranjan Gogoi, apprehending threat to her life, was not placed before him.

"Unfortunately, the letter is yet to see the light of the day and yet the newspapers flashed it as if I have read the letter," Justice Gogoi said. SC will now hear the matter on Thursday (tomorrow).

The observations came when senior lawyer V Giri, who is assisting the court as an amicus curiae in child rape cases, sought an urgent listing of the Unnao rape case.

Unnao rape victim had written the letter to CJI on July 12.

The Supreme Court has also sought a status report from Uttar Pradesh authorities in Unnao rape case.

The CJI has said that he will try to do something constructive in this case. However, he dismissed news reports saying that CJI failed to take any action on the letter as he said the letter was not placed before him.

The 19-year-old woman, who was allegedly raped two years ago by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar at his residence in Unnao, was critically injured in a car crash on Sunday.

She was travelling with her family when their car was hit by a speeding truck in the northern state's Rae Bareli district.

Two of her family members were killed in the accident while her lawyer also sustained serious injuries. The woman's family has filed a complaint alleging "conspiracy" behind the car crash.
