Woman sedated, gang-raped by 7 men in captivity

Jaipur: A woman held captive for the last days was subjected to gang-rape by 7 of her co-villagers after she was kidnapped in Rajasthan’s Hanumangarh district.

According to sources, the 30-year-old victim was allegedly abducted first and gang-raped for the past ten days in captivity, TOI reports.



The victim was allegedly taken to Churu’s Rajgarh area on false pretext by another woman earlier this month.

Soon after reaching the spot, she was sedated and gang-raped for 10 days according to the rape survivor’s claim.

“She has named seven men from her village. No arrests have been made so far,” Hanumangarh mahila thana SHO Bahadur Singh told news source.

“We are yet to check the veracity of her allegations, but this village is notorious and we have to check all angles in the matter,” the SHO added while the circle officer is probing the case.
