Food Drive for Neighbor Impact Happening This Coming Weekend

Don’t forget! The National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC) will conduct its 27th annual national food drive on Saturday, May 11.

Residents simply leave their donation of non-perishable goods next to their mailbox before the delivery of the mail on Saturday, May 11.

Letter carriers in the Bend and Redmond area will collect these food donations on that day as they deliver mail along their postal routes, and distribute them to NeighborImpact’s Food Bank, where they’ll be redistributed to local families and individuals in need through partner food pantries.

Most desired and helpful food items include:

Peanut butter

Canned tuna

Cereal

Canned fruit

Oats

Rice
