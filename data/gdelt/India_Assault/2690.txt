Kolkata: Levelling sensational charge against Narendra Modi-led central government, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, on Monday alleged that her phone is being tapped by the central agencies.

The Trinamool Congress chief made the statement while reacting on the terror attack on CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Thursday.

Addressing a media gathering here, she said, “The Government had inputs from intelligence agencies on Feb 8 that such attacks might happen before elections. Why no action was taken? Why 78 convoys were still allowed?...I also have intelligence reports that my phone is always taped, as you all know.”

She further claimed that some miscreants are trying to trigger violence in the state on the backdrop of the February 14 suicide bombing.

Mamata also accused several forces including RSS of hatching conspiracy in the wake of Pulwama attack to create division in the country.

On February 18, 40 security personnel lost their lives and several others were injured after a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Awantipora of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

Earlier, the chief minister had said that the terror attack took place due to “intelligence negligence” while questioning the role of the national security adviser.

"We have the right to know what had actually happened. What was the national security adviser doing? "Why did we not come to know anything before the attack? Why did so many jawans get killed? These are the questions of the people not only mine," she had said, according to news agency PTI.
