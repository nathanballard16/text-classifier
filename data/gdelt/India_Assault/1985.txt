Karnataka politics: Karnataka speaker equates himself to rape survivor

Meeting today to decide on inquiry

Karnataka speaker mocks rape victims, MLAs laugh along

BENGALURU: During the audio-clip debate in the legislative assembly on Tuesday, speaker KR Ramesh Kumar likened himself to a rape survivor who has to recount her traumatic experience many times in a court of law.During the discussion on the audio clip released by chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, BJP MLA Shivanagouda Naik is purportedly heard telling Sharanagouda, son of JD(S) MLA Nagannagouda Kandakur, that “money was paid to Kumar” to accept resignations without questions. Kumar’s name came up repeatedly during the assembly debate.Kumar said he was reminded of a rape victim in court. “If someone asks her what happened, she says the rape may have happened once, but the questions in court raped me 100 times. This appears to be my situation,” he said. The male-dominated House received the insensitive comment with laughter. The 10 women legislators present remained mute spectators.Bharati Shetty, BJP Mahila Morcha president, said in Mysuru on Tuesday that she doesn’t believe women are equal to men and contended women don’t require the freedom enjoyed by men.With the audio clip drama rocking the legislative assembly for the second day on Tuesday, speaker K R Ramesh Kumar has called a meeting on Wednesday to decide the nature of a probe into the controversy. The government has mooted an SIT probe; the BJP has demanded a House inquiry or a judicial probe.
