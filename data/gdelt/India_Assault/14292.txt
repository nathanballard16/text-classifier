Pune: A non-cognizable case was registered against a Maharashtra Navnirman Sena corporator here after he allegedly assaulted an official of a private hospital, police said on Friday.

MNS corporator Sainath Babar allegedly slapped a manager of Ruby Hall Clinic Hospital in the city on Monday. Babar apparently had had a dispute with the manager over the bill of a patient from his ward. CCTV footage from the hospital showed Babar getting up from a chair and slapping the manager.

"We have registered a non-cognizable offence against Babar under section 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC," said a senior official from Wanwadi police station.

A counter-case was also registered against the manager upon Babar's complaint that the latter abused him. In non-cognizable cases, police can not initiate probe unless ordered by a court.
