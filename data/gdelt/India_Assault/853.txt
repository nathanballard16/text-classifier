Bride rejects drunk groom, gets him arrested

Patna: A bride in Bihar refused to marry a drunk groom who roughed up wedding guests. The angry bride also called up the local police and got him arrested for breaking the law.

The incident took place in a state which has enforced total prohibition.

The wedding of Anusha Kumari, a resident of Akbarpur village in Bhagalpur district, had been fixed with a local youth Uday Rajak who works in the police department.

On Thursday night, the wedding procession reached the house of the bride as per the wedding itinerary. Soon after the groom, who was in inebriated state, picked up a quarrel with the wedding guests and beat up some of them.

Reports said soon after the news reached the bride, she got angry and refused to marry the drunk groom.

Even before the groom’s side could pacify the bride and bring the situation under control, she called up the local police and informed them about the story. Very soon, the police reached the spot and arrested the drunk groom.

“The police have arrested the drunk groom following complaint by the bride. We have sent him to jail,” a local senior police official Dilnawaj Ahmad told the media on Saturday. He added he never came across any such incident of the bride getting the groom arrested right at the wedding venue.

The bride said she decided to reject the drunk groom since he had violated the law.

“When a police man himself breaks the law, how can he expect others to follow the rules? So I thought his real place is jail, and not the wedding venue,” the bride told the media.
