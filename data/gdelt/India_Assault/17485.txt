HC dismisses appeals of accused in Kachanatham murder case

Madurai

Taking cognisance of the fact that the trial in the Kachanatham Scheduled Caste community murders in Sivaganga district was at a crucial stage, the Madurai Bench of Madras High Court on Friday dismissed the criminal appeals of 11 accused.

Justice V. Parthiban observed that the brutality with which the crime was committed by a mob from the dominant community had a telling effect on the peace and tranquillity of society at large. The vulnerable prosecution was to be protected from being harmed by remorseless killers, the court said.

During the course of the hearing, Additional Advocate General K. Chellapandian opposed the grant of bail to the accused. He submitted that the brutality of the triple murder had shocked the very conscience of society.

The motive for the murder was denial of honour for the dominant community people at a temple festival. The trial was being conducted on a day-to-day basis and was at a crucial stage. If the accused were freed on bail, it would jeopardise the prosecution, he submitted.

The court observed that it was of the opinion that individual liberty had to be relegated to the back burner and the paramount duty of the institution was to maintain law and order, public peace and tranquillity.

The accused had preferred the criminal appeal against the order of a Special Court in Sivaganga that had denied them bail. Three members of a Scheduled Caste community were hacked to death and five others grievously injured by caste Hindus in Katchanatham last year.
