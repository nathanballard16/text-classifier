New Delhi: Authorities have suspended two customs officials for allegedly sexually assaulting an Uzbek woman at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport last month. The woman visited India for the treatment of her relative on May 3.

The matter was reported by a whistleblower to senior airport authorities, who later started the probe into the matter.

According to a report in Times of India, on her arrival from Tashkent, a customs official took the victim to a room in the name of checking her baggage for any possible smuggled goods. The officer, in his 50s, sat with the woman in the room for 30 minutes and allegedly assaulted her. The room had no CCTV cameras.

The woman was in India for the treatment of her sister's child in Delhi. The victim also wrote a complaint to the revenue secretary seeking an action into the matter.

The report also suggested that during the course of the inquiry, the role of another customs officer also came under the radar in connection with the case. Both officers were later suspended pending an inquiry.

It is also said that the victim had filed a complaint with the customs department, but retracted it later following alleged threats that she would be implicated in false smuggling cases. The woman also allegedly faced a threat to her life by the accused customs officer.

The officials in the customs department at IGI airport are silent on the matter. However, they say they are still probing the matter. It is also not yet known whether the department has approached Delhi Police to report the alleged crime.
