If attacked, hit back in a big way, BJP MLA tells partymen

GUWAHATI: Assam BJP MLA Mrinal Saikia on Friday asked party workers to “retaliate” against any attack on them by anti-citizenship law protesters, saying they should “target 10 of theirs if someone touches one of ours”.“BJP workers have to come out strong. We have tolerated enough. If someone comes to burn your house, burn down their houses... We have the support of the people,” Saikia, the MLA of Khumtai in Golaghat district, told a gathering of party workers at Chabua in Dibrugarh He claimed that the anti-CAA protests had been wrongly projected as a people’s movement. “In a state with a population of 3.3 crore, not even 1 lakh people have joined the protests at a time. If such a small number of people are projected as ‘the masses’, what about those who aren’t part of the agitation? The media has to redefine the meaning of ‘people’s movement’,” he said.Saikia’s exhortation to BJP workers comes amid the crackdown on those allegedly responsible for the arson in the first few days of the unrest over the CAA. Accused of stoking violence, activist Akhil Gogoi has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and handed over to the NIA.Several others have also been arrested for allegedly inflammatory speeches and posts on social media. On December 12, miscreants had set ablaze the house of BJP MLA Binod Hazarika in Chabua and pelted stones at the houses of CM Sarbananda Sonowal and MLA Prasanta Phukan in Dibrugarh, and that of Union minister Rameshwar Teli in Duliajan.
