AAP accused of sexual assault

A public interest litigation petition filed before the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Thursday sought the removal of advocate S. Rajeswaran, practising in Tirunelveli as Additional Public Prosecutor, after allegations of sexual harassment was made against him.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and S.S. Sundar ordered notice to the respondents concerned and adjourned the hearing in the case.

It was alleged that the Additional Public Prosecutor had invited a woman advocate to his house, sedated her after giving a soft drink and sexually assaulted her. Though a complaint was made against the advocate, no action was taken, said the petitioner, advocate E. Athisayakumar from Thoothukudi. He sought the removal of the advocate from the post of Additional Public Prosecutor.
