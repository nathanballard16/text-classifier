Palanpur: A minor boy, who was in a one-sided love equation with a 19-year-old girl, has stabbed her to death in the Nandotra village of Banaskantha district of Gujarat on Monday. The boy attacked the victim with a sharp-edged weapon when she was alone at her home.

According to a report in Times of India, the minor boy used to work as a domestic help in the victim's house. Police have detained the accused and sent him to remand home for the juvenile. Police say they will soon send him for medical examination to ascertain his age.

According to police, the boy - who could not handle the fact that his feelings were unrequited - used to reside at the same home and developed one-sided love for the girl. On Monday, finding the girl alone at home, the accused sought sexual favours from the girl and when the shocked girl refused, he attacked her with a sickle, killing her on the spot.

Chhapi village jurisdiction police - Inspector MR Mohaniya - said that the police are ascertaining the age of accused and further action will be taken only after advice from the medical board.

In a similar case of violence over unrequited love in Rajasthan, a man allegedly ran over a woman and her mother and stoned them to death in Jodhpur district on May 10. While the girl died on the spot, her mother succumbed to injuries en route to the hospital.

The man took the drastic step after the girl's marriage was fixed with someone else. After committing the crime, the accused, Sukharam, jumped into a canal near Tiwari village of Osian area.
