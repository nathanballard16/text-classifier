Partial impact of doctors’ strike was witnessed at the Civil Hospital Sector 6, here, today as most of the doctors remained on leave despite the directions of the Principal Medical Officer (PMO) cancelling the leave of all staff.

The medicos have expressed solidarity with the Kolkata-based doctors who were assaulted recently.

According to information, though most of the government offices in the city remained closed in view of the Kabir Jayanti observed throughout Haryana, the PMO had issued directions that OPDs and emergency services would be functional and directed the staff to remain present in the hospital today besides cancelling the leave of doctors and other staff members.

However, the hospital wore a deserted look as the OPD services remained closed despite the fact that the number of patients at the hospital was nominal. People, who had information that the Indian Medical Association had given a call to observe a strike on Monday, refrained from visiting the hospital. People could be seen in emergency ward and labour room only.

Civil Surgeon Dr Yogesh Sharma claimed that services of 5 to 6 doctors were made available in the emergency today against the daily routine of 2 to 3 doctors. He said they had ensured that no patient faces any kind of problem. He agreed that doctors did not attend the OPD on the call given by the IMA, but they were present in the emergency and labour room.
