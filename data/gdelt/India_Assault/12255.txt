A 17-year-old girl, who was allegedly abducted from Reasi district in Jammu and Kashmir last year, was recovered from Delhi, police said on Wednesday.

The alleged kidnapper, Naimuddin Ansari (28) of Bihar, was arrested by a Special Investigation Team of Jammu's Crime Branch from Dabri Sagarpur area of Delhi, a police spokesperson said.

He said a case was registered in Katra police station on July 24 last year after the minor girl's abduction by Ansari, who hails from Ganeshpur-Baisakhawa area of West Champaran district in Bihar.
