Asaram's son convicted for raping minor girl in 2013

A sessions court in Surat on Friday convicted Narayan Sai, son of jailed self-styled godman Asaram Bapu, for raping a female follower in 2013. Four others, including two women, were also found guilty for their involvement in the case.

The court will pronounce the quantum of punishment on April 30.

Asaram himself was jailed for life last year for raping a minor girl in Rajasthan, and is serving his sentence.

Following the arrest of Asaram six years ago, two Surat-based sisters had accused the then popular 'spiritual guru' and Narayan Sai of sexual exploitation. The elder sibling said Asaram had repeatedly raped her between 1997 and 2006 when she lived at his ashram in Ahmedabad. Asaram is being tried in the case in a Gandhinagar court.

In her complaint, the younger sister accused Narayan Sai of sexual assaults between 2002 and 2005 during her stay at Asaram's ashram in Surat. This led to Narayan Sai's arrest from Delhi in December 2013, and he has been in jail since.

Lawyers said Narayan Sai's aides Dharmishtha, alias Ganga, Bhavna, alias Jamuna, and Pavan, alias Hanuman convicted for being part of a conspiracy, while his driver Rajkumar was held guilty for sheltering an offender.

Five other accused in the case were acquitted.

Narayan Sai, 47, who is in a Surat jail since his arrest in six years ago, was held guilty under IPC sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offences), 323 (assault), 506 (2) (criminal intimidation), and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) by additional sessions judge PS Gadhvi.

Ganga and Jamuna were accused of putting the victim woman in illegal confinement and thrashing her at Narayan Sai's behest, while Hanuman was accused of abetment, including taking the victim to his room where she was repeatedly raped.
