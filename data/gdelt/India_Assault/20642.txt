Centre hikes MSP for toria oilseeds

New Delhi: Providing a partial relief to the farmers in the country, the government on Monday hiked the minimum support price (MSP) of toria, an oilseed similar to rapeseed, by Rs 525 per quintal to Rs 4,425 for the current year. Toria and mustard are the third most important edible oilseed crops of the world after soybean and oil palm. The MSP of toria was fixed at Rs 3,900 per quintal for 2018-19 rabi season. “The MSP has been fixed for the toria crop grown in 2019-20 rabi season, which is underway, and to be harvested in 2020-21,” the agriculture ministry said.

“The government has taken this decision due to severe loss incurred by the farmers following heavy rains and floods in their kharif crops. Toria being a rabi crop, we have seen its sowing as slow as any other season. As this crucial rabi oilseed is sown during September-October and harvested from Febru-ary, the farmers will get better price then.”
