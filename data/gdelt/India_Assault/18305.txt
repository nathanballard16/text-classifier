The city recently saw its first leptospirosis death in October since 2015 . Experts claim it could be a result of unseasonal rain in the month, which led to flooding in various parts of the city.

Leptospirosis is an infectious disease, which generally spreads to humans through contaminated water or by animal urine containing the bacteria of the genus Leptospira. The bacteria can enter the human body through unhealed wounds.

“This year, the city recorded a high amount of unseasonal rainfall, leading to a rise in the number of leptospirosis cases. Cyclone Kyarr also led to unprecedented rainfall, pushing the number of leptospirosis cases to 29 [in October],” said a senior health officer from Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). The number of leptospirosis cases this year (till October) was 233, with 11 deaths, compared to 218 in 2018, with 12 deaths, according to data from the public health department.
