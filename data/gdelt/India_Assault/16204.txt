BSF officials have said that while nobody was injured, they are still figuring out how much damage was done to the vehicle.

Tensions have been high in the Valley over the last 54 days, ever since the government read down Article 370 of the constitution and imposed a communications and movement lockdown. Several high-profile mainstream politicians continue to be under detention.
