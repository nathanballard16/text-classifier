Mahila Congress gets transwoman as general secretary

The Congress on Tuesday appointed a transwoman as the national general secretary of the All India Mahila Congress.



Apsara Reddy, a journalist, has been involved in social activism through her college days and also has taken up high-profile cases of child rape in Tamil Nadu.



Initially, she had joined the BJP after meeting party president Amit Shah but parted ways after a month. She had called the party "regressive" and said it "has no place for free-thinking individuals".



Thereafter, Reddy had joined the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) in May 2016. She had moved to the pro-Sasikala camp of the AIADMK after party icon Jayalalithaa's death that year.



Over joining the Congress, Apsara said, "Congress is truly a party that built India and sustained us for generations with good policy and a sensitive and inclusive approach in governance." She said party president Rahul Gandhi's commitment to "fair representation of women, women-centric manifesto goals and dynamism are truly inspiring".



Sharing her plans in her new role, she said, "I will meet with a cross-section of women to address issues pertaining to their rights."



Apsara slammed the Transgender Bill. "We don't need charity, we need assistance to bridge the inequality meted out to us for far too long. They use words like rehabilitation."



She further said that the transgender community needs education and equal opportunity. "Most importantly, political recognition such as this by the Congress goes to show that Rahul Gandhi looks at us as a talent-pool and a worthy skill-set rather than a fringe group that needs pity. This is a good starting point for mainstreaming."
