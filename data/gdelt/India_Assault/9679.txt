Shamli: Journalist Amit Sharma narrates his ordeal in lockup

MEERUT: Shamli-based journalist Amit Sharma, who was assaulted by GRP station officer Rakesh Kumar and his aides on the intervening night of June 11-12, has narrated his ordeal in a video that has gone viral.Video of Sharma has been shot by other local scribes while he was illegally detained in the lockup."He (SHO) attacked my camera when I was on the spot covering story of goods train derailment. He then assaulted me. It all happened because I exposed the connivance of GRP with unregulated vendors in one of my stories," Sharma can be heard saying in the video.The story he is referring to was a month-old story on unregulated vendors and how they have been operating with immunity in connivance with the GRP officials who were allegedly getting massive cuts from vendors."He hurled filthiest of abuses at me and brutally beat me up . He has been holding grudge ever since I exposed his illicit nexus with the unregulated vendors," Sharma said.All this while, SO Kumar was sitting in a chair outside the lockup trying to reason and confront the other local journalists who had gathered at the police station in support of Amit Sharma.
