ALLAHABAD: An armed and masked gang of six entered a house in trans-Yamuna area, roughed up two members of the family held hostage for two hours and decamped with cash and jewellery worth more than Rs 1.6 lakh around midnight on Monday.

A dacoity FIR was lodged against unidentified persons on Tuesday morning. Police have formed two raid teams and are looking at CCTV camera footage to identify the gang.

According to the complaint lodged by house owner KL Kesarwani, he and his wife Savitri, son Santosh were sleeping at their Kalika ka Pura village home when noises in the living room woke them up. Santosh went to check what was wrong and was held hostage at knife-point.

Sources in police quoted the family and said the dacoity took place between 11pm and 1am. After holding the family hostage, the intruders cleaned out Rs 60,000 in cash, jewellery worth Rs 1 lakh and other valuables."

The main gate of the house was open during evening hours when the family was attending a puja on rooftop. We suspect someone entered and remained holed up in the house. Later in the night, he opened the main gate for his accomplices,” said a policeman.

Deputy inspector (Prayagraj range) KP Singh said police had registered a case based on the complaint of Kesarwani. “Two teams have been formed to crack the case,” he maintained.
