SCO Summit: PM Modi Calls For End To State-Sponsored Terrorism

"During my visit to Sri Lanka last Sunday, I visited the St Anthony's church, where I witnessed the ugly face of terrorism which claims the lives of innocents anywhere," Modi said, referring to one of the sites of the April 21 Easter Sunday attacks that killed 258 people in Sri Lanka.
