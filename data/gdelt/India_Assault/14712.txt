Rape or AIDS: Mumbai police, kin wrestle over death of 19-year-old assaulted on birthday

After her death on Wednesday, the police have refused to update the case to reflect the relevant IPC sections, and are awaiting the post mortem report. She was admitted to a hospital in Aurangabad, where the doctors said she had been sexually assaulted and pumped with drugs. On July 30, the Begumpura police managed to register the case and transfer it to the Chunabhatti police station in Mumbai. "The deceased was living with the condition for eight years and was in the last stages of the disease. "We are waiting for the postmortem report," said DCP Shashi Meena, "Then we will know the exact cause of death and will add the sections accordingly."
