Research byscholars maps the relationship between misinformation on theand incidents ofin India.More than 100 people have been lynched to death in India over rumours of, cattle theft,in the last four years. And the common factor that emereged through these cases is WhatsApp.Aqualitative study by researchers at the London School of Economics has found that “mobs of vigilantes” communicated with each other through the social media platform “to spread lies about the victims” and “used misinformation to mobilise, defend” and sometimes “to document and circulate images of the violence”.Titled WhatsApp vigilantism: An exploration of citizen reception and circulation of WhatsApp misinformation linked to mob violence in India, the study was released in London on Thursday. It sought to map the relationship between misinformation on WhatsApp and mob violence in India.The researchers argued that filming and circulation of videos of sexual and political violence via WhatsApp in a celebratory manner “rather than discouraging violence, has played a role in legitimising it as an effective political tool”.More than 100 people have been lynched to death in India over rumours of cow slaughter, cattle theft, child kidnapping and organ harvesting in the last four years. And one element bound these incidents together: WhatsApp.A qualitative study by researchers at the London School of Economics has found that “mobs of vigilantes” communicated with each other through the social media platform “to spread lies about the victims” and “used misinformation to mobilise, defend” and sometimes “to document and circulate images of the violence”.Titled, the study was released in London on Thursday. It sought to map the relationship between misinformation on WhatsApp and mob violence in India.The researchers argued that filming and circulation of videos of sexual and political violence via WhatsApp in a celebratory manner “rather than discouraging violence, has played a role in legitimising it as an effective political tool”.Additionally, the content on WhatsApp and its use is highly gendered, the study claimed. Researchers explained that “highly media-literate, upper-caste, urban Hindu men” are more likely to create and forward disinformation, and that it’s not illiteracy or ignorance rather ideology and prejudice that drives this large-scale spread of misinformation.Seeking to analyse those who fall prey to these objectionable and violent messages, the study points out that child-kidnapping related incidents largely rely on the “general mistrust of strangers”, while lynchings are linked to rumours of cow slaughter and smuggling and often target Dalits and Muslims; child-lifting forwards did not appear to “target a particular religion or caste”. In North India, rumours about the latter usually seek to identify the perpetrators from South India, the study states.“WhatsApp should recognise and protect vulnerable groups,” said Dr Shakuntala Banaji, associate professor who along with Ram Bhat PhD researcher at the LSE’s Media and Communication Department discussed their findings at the event. She also pointed out that the misinformation was being spread out of a “civic sense”.The study also highlighted that images and videos from international events were increasingly being used in context of domestic incidents. For example, a Brazilian prison riot video was shared with a false message that thousands of Rohingya Muslims were looking to kidnap children in India. Another case that finds a mention in the study is that of a 400-year-old Shiva idol in Maharashtra which was damaged by lightning, but rumours floated on WhatsApp claimed that it was vandalised by Muslim groups.The India-specific study is one of the 20 academic projects funded by WhatsApp in 2018. Over 250 users from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka were interviewed and around 1,000 WhatsApp messages were collected via anonymised forwarding and analyses for it.Although they emphasised that de-encryption was not going to solve the problem, the researchers did stress that some changes by the social media platform could help counter the spread of violence and hatred. They suggested that the service should “largely be a one-to-one sharing app” as was originally envisaged and that sharing messages on group chats be restricted to only one group at a time. They also recommended that adding users to groups without their permission be disallowed. They also batted for the need for “critical media literacy” instead of mere “functional literacy”.
