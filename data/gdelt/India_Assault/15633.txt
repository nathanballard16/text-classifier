A 30-year-old tuition teacher was stabbed to death by her Class 4 student in Mumbai, Maharashtra on Monday. The incident happened in Govandi area.

According to Shivaji Nagar police, the deceased has been identified as Aisha Aslam Husuye who gave tuition classes to primary and secondary school students at her residence in Govandi.

On Monday evening, one of her students, a 12-year-old Class 4 student, visited Ayesha's residence along with his mother. His mother had a favour to ask for. The student's mother asked Aisha if she could borrow some money for household expenses. Aisha told the student's mother that she herself is barely managing with her finances and won't be able to help.

Aisha's reply allegedly did not go down very well with the Class 4 student's mother. Quickly the conversation turned into a heated argument. The enraged mother of the student even abused Aisha.

The 12-year-old boy saw it happening right in front of him. The Class 4 student, not liking Aisha's denial to help her mother, grabbed a knife lying nearby and stabbed Aisha.

Aisha suffered serious injuries in her abdomen and eventually succumbed to death.

A case of murder has been registered in Shivaji police station.
