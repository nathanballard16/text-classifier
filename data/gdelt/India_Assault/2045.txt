DNA Edit: Google’s Hegemony - CCI should stop predatory behaviour of behemoths

Google could be in major trouble for trying to kill off competition through unfair means in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) has been reviewing a case against Alphabet Inc’s unit Google, which allegedly abuses its popular Android mobile operating system to block its rivals.

The case under consideration is similar to what the tech giant had been convicted of in Europe. The European Commission found that since 2011, Google forced phone manufacturers to pre-install Google Search and its Chrome browser, together with its Google Play app store on Android devices. It was slapped with record-breaking $5 billion fine by EU regulators for breaking antitrust laws.

The Commission had asked Google in July last year to bring its “illegal conduct to an end in an effective manner within 90 days of the decision”. Though Google had challenged the decision, it’s evident that competitors of the global tech giant feel it is not playing by the rules.

Google seems to be a habitual offender. Last year, the Indian watchdog had fined it Rs 136 crore as it was found to be indulging in “search” bias, and jeopardising the positions of its competitors and users. Like in the case of the European Commission, here, too, Google took the appellate route to bide time.

It filed an appeal at the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal and sought a stay on the penalty. All major players indulge in predatory behaviour to create a non level-playing field. Like Amazon and Walmart in e-commerce business, Google allegedly thinks it can bludgeon its way through.

CCI should immediately order a thorough probe because given the smartphone market in India, Google’s monopolistic practices will deny rivals a chance to innovate and compete on merit.
