ISLAMABAD, Pakistan: The Indian forces carried out more than 2350 ceasefire violations in 2018 along the Line of Control (LoC) and the Working Boundary, resulting in the shahadats (martyrdom) of 36 innocent civilians while injuring 142 others.

The latest incident of ceasefire violation occurred on December 31 when the Indian occupation forces again resorted to unprovoked firing in Athmuqam, Shahkot Sector along the LoC, which resulted in the martyrdom of an innocent woman Asia Bibi w/o Muhammad Haroon.

The Indian firing also caused splinter injuries to seven civilians including two women and three children.

Meanwhile, the Director General (SA & SAARC) Dr. Mohammad Faisal summoned the Indian Acting Deputy High Commissioner on Tuesday and condemned yesterday’s ceasefire violations by the Indian forces.

The director general urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 Ceasefire arrangement; investigate this and other incidents of ceasefire violations; instruct the Indian forces to respect the ceasefire, in letter and spirit and maintain peace on the LoC and the Working Boundary.

Mohammad Faisal urged that the Indian side should permit UNMOGIP to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions.

“The Indian forces along the LoC and the Working boundary are continuously targeting civilian populated areas with heavy weapons,” the Foreign Office said.

The Foreign Office said that this unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1970 ceasefire violations.

It said that the deliberate targeting of civilian populated areas is indeed deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws.

“The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation,” it said.
