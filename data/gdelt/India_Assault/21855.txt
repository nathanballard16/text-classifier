Schools, colleges and madrasas in UP’s Mau district will remain closed due to the ongoing protest against Citizen Amendment Act till further notice. The news has been confirmed by the District Magistrate of Mau. Undeclared curfew was imposed in the district after the protest took a violent turn on Monday.

Students protested against CAA in the district and set vehicles on fire, pelted stones at the police and went on the rampage. A police station was also set on fire in that area. The protest turned barbaric due to the police crackdown on students at Jamia Millia in Delhi and AMU in UP.

Nineteen people have been arrested in connection with Monday’s violence. "In connection with Monday's violence in Dakshintola area of Mau, as many as 24 persons have been identified so far. Of these 19 have been arrested. The mischief mongers are being identified through video footage and photos published in various newspapers," Additional Director General (Prosecution) Ashutosh Pandey told reporters on Tuesday.

As for now Section 144 has been imposed in the area and the official curfew had not been imposed but prohibitory orders were being strictly enforced, confirmed OP Singh, Director General of Police.
