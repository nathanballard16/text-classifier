Congress wants Supreme Court to step in; Rajya Sabha disrupted

NEW DELHI: Congress has demanded that the Supreme Court intervene in the accident involving the Unnao rape survivor and her family, alleging that there was a serious apprehension about miscarriage of justice in the crime in which a BJP MLA from UP is the accused.This came even as proceedings in the Rajya Sabha were briefly adjourned on Monday after an uproar by opposition parties over the road accident. The girl and her lawyer were critically injured and two others were killed in the accident.Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said, "We demand that the SC takes note of the incident. The miscarriage of justice taking place... and the voice of victims being suppressed will stop only when the apex court directly intervenes and takes note of the entire inquiry into the Unnao rape case."Senior Congress member Rahul Gandhi took a sarcastic jibe at the incident. "Beti Bachao-Beti Padhao: a new special education bulletin for Indian women. Don't ask questions if a BJP MLA is accused of having raped you," he posted on Twitter . Party general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra questioned, "What is the BJP waiting for? Why has this man not been expelled from their party even when his name is in the latest FIR in the Unnao rape case?"In the Upper House, SP member Ram Gopal Yadav raised the accident during zero hour. He alleged that it was an attempt to kill the girl. This led Chairman Venkiah Naidu to ask home minister Amit Shah to look into the serious matter.
