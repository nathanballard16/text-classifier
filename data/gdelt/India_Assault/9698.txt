Domestic help sexually assaults boy, mother slaps Pocso case on own family for not believing her

A Mumbai resident saw her domestic help sexually assaulting her four-and-a-half-year-old son at their Malabar Hill residence. When she raised the issue with her husband and in-laws, they refused to believe her and allowed the help to continue working at the house. Not one to let things lying, the woman reported the incident to the police and also lodged a complaint against her entire family for ignoring the matter.

According to a Times of India report, Malabar Hill Police have slapped the stringent Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, 2012 on four persons, including the accused domestic help. The three others are the victim's father and his grandparents.

The report says the woman, who is a lawyer, saw the domestic help inappropriately touching her child last week. She later spoke to her son who narrated the entire incident and then took up the matter with the family.

However, much against her expectation, the family did not take any action and disbelieved the woman and her son. The accused domestic help continued to serve at the house despite the allegations.

Later on June 4, the woman went to the police and lodged a case not only against the abuser but also the entire family.

Police have now recorded the statement of the minor boy as well to support the charges.

The Pocso Act makes it mandatory to file a case against the accused in case of sexual assault on a minor and failure to do so invites imprisonment.
