A 23-year-old Spanish woman was allegedly raped in Gurugram by a man on Friday night.

The accused has been arrested and booked under Indian Penal Code sections pertaining to rape and criminal conspiracy, said Subhash Bokan, PRO of Gurgaon police.

According to a complaint filed in the DLF Phase 1 police station, the Spanish national was raped after a party last night.

Following the complaint, the police immediately scanned the Facebook profile and mobile phone of the woman, which helped them spot the accused.

The accused, who is identified as Ajanya Nath, is a resident of Anand Vihar in Delhi and works as a production manager in a production company.

The victim had come to India for a one-year internship in an IT company and was looking for a rented accomodation.

Nath had befriended the Spanish woman over Facebook and offered her assistance in finding a rented flat.

Subhash Bokan said, "Nath invited the woman to a dinner party at a rented flat in DLF phase 3 on June 14."

"When she reached the flat, Nath allegedly raped her. The woman reached civil hospital. When she was questioned by doctors, she narrated her ordeal. The civil hospital doctors informed Gurgaon police about the incident," Bokan said.
