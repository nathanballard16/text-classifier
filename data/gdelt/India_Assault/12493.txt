Married woman raped by cousin

Ludhiana: A 36-year-old married woman has allegedly been raped by her distant relative when she had gone to her house. The woman has also alleged that the accused captured her video to blackmail her, and also asked her to keep mum by threatening to kill her husband. However, the woman told her husband about the incident, and later lodged a police complaint. On the woman’s complaint, police registered a case on Saturday against the 30-year-old accused, who is her cousin in relation.

The complainant said that on Friday (July 26), she went to meet her aunt at her house. However, she was not at home. When she asked her cousin about it, he told her she had gone out to get some medicines. When the woman was about to leave from there, the accused dragged her in the room and raped her. She further alleged that he also captured her video and warned her to keep mum by threatening to kill her husband and upload her video on social media if she revealed about the incident.

Thereafter, the woman reached back home, but was too scared to say anything that day. However, on Saturday, she narrated the incident to her husband and lodged a police complaint. Investigating officer ASI Kiran Lata said the police registered a case immediately after receiving the complaint. The accused — who is married, and has two children — is yet to be arrested. However, on Friday, he was alone at home during the woman’s visit.
