In a similar case reported from Jharkhand, a man was arrested for murdering his own mother and attempting to cover his tracks by burying her body in the backyard of the family home. The accused was taken into police custody after he confessed to his crimes.

The matter came to light over 10 days after the victim went missing from her home. A police investigation was initiated after her son-in-law filed a missing person complaint with the local police. Acting on his complaint, police officials began probing the matter. The officials suspected foul play when Rajkumar and his wife kept changing their statements to the police.
