Mumbai: A murder accused flung his slipper at a judge in the sessions court in Thane on Friday. Reports suggest that the man attempted to assault the judge as he got upset over the court's decision to appoint him a new counsel in the case.

The man identified as Ganesh Gaikward is currently undergoing trial in a murder case and is lodged in Thane Central Jail. "He was brought before the District Sessions Judge Rajesh Gupta for a hearing in the case and during the hearing he tried to assault the judge," the police said.

According to the police official, when the judge asked him about his counsel, Gaikwad told him that the counsel was not present. Hearing this the Judge said that a new counsel shall be appointed for him and this annoyed Gaikward, the official added.

"In a fit of rage, Gaikward pulled out his slipper and hurled it towards the judge and also abused him. The footwear, however, did not hit the judge as he ducked," the official told reporters.

The police have registered a new case against Gaikwad under IPC sections 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) and 504 (intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace).

Courtroom abuses and attempts to assault judges are not new. Several such incidents have come to fore in recent years. Earlier in January this year, an undertrial had hurled his slipper at a magistrate after he was convicted of theft. The accused had pleaded that his already spent time in jail should be adjusted in his sentence, however, the judge refused and the accused got angry.
