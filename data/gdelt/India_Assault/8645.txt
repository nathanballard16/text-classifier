HAZARIBAG: A man set two of his minor children on fire, killing one of them, at Punai village under Daroo police station in Hazaribag on Tuesday.

The accused, Kailash Agarwal (45) also attempted to immolate himself, but survived with burn injuries and is undergoing treatment at sadar hospital. Police have lodged an FIR on the statement of Kailash's wife Sunita Kumari (32).

Of the two children, Priyanshu (3) succumbed to burn injuries at a local government hospital while Premanshu (4) has been taken to Rajemdra Institute of Medical Sciences (Rims) in Ranchi with 80% burns.

Officer in-charge of Daroo police station NKK Das said, "The incident is a fallout of a long-standing tiff between Kailash and his wife Sunita."

The two belonged to different castes and tied the knot in 2014 after they met on Facebook. But their marriage they continue to live separately due to professional commitments. The distance widened the rift between the couple over the custody of the children, police said.

Kailash works as a sales officer at private company and lives at Hindoli in Rajasthan's Bundi district, 190km from Jaipur, while his wife is employed at a mall in Mahimpur near Delhi.

Kailash alleged his wife preferred staying in Delhi even after the birth of the second child. She kept the kids at her native village in Punai.

On May 17, Kailash brought his wife from Delhi to Punai to settle the dispute. In her statement to police, Sunita alleged the situation took a turn for the worse on Tuesday morning when Kailash first set ablaze the two infants and then set himself fire on by pouring kerosene oil. However, Sunita's relatives managed to douse the fire and took them to sadar hospital.

Bishnugarh SDPO Sahdeo Sao said, "Kailash will be produced before court after he recovers."
