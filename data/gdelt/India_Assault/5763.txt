Pioneer of organised crime in western Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand surrenders

MEERUT: Two days after western Uttar Pradesh don Badan Singh Baddo escaped from police custody in Meerut, his close associate and the region's most dreaded gangster Sushil Mooch made a surprise surrender in a Muzaffarnagar court. It was earlier believed that Mooch - pioneer of organized crime in western Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand who carries a reward of Rs 1 lakh - had helped Baddo made a Bollywood-style escape from a hotel in Meerut on Thursday.According to police, Mooch, 65-year-old son of a former Delhi Police sub-inspector, has 52 criminal cases registered against him in UP, Uttarakhand and Haryana, including 17 murder and 10 attempt to murder cases.Until mid-eighties, police did not even have his photograph and could arrest him for the first time only in 2012 - 39 years after he committed his first crime. However, in the nineties, Mooch used to turn himself in, secure bail and disappear at his own convenience, said sources.One of the many reasons attributed to his ability to evade arrest was that the old-fashioned gangster never carried a mobile phone and always travelled alone. "Even on Saturday, Mooch was not recognised in the courtroom until he identified himself and turned himself in," a source said.Additional director general (Meerut zone) Prashant Kumar said, "Considering his high-profile, we are planning to move Mooch to a different district jail away from Muzaffarnagar."
