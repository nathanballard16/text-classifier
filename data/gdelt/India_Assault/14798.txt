MUMBAI, Sept. 1 (Xinhua) -- Death toll in the chemical factory blast in Dhule district of India's western state of Maharashtra rose to 13, as 60 were injured, said an official from Shirpur police station on Sunday.

The blast took place at 9.45 a.m. local time on Saturday morning and has been brought under control. There were 100-odd workers inside the manufacturing facility when the blast took place and a few of them went missing, the official, on condition of anonymity, told Xinhua.

As per early investigations, the intensity of the blast rose due to the presence of several nitrogen gas cylinders and barrels containing chemicals in the premises of manufacturing facility, though initially the police had suspected that the blast was due to explosion of the boiler.

The injured have been admitted to the civil hospital in the district, as the death toll is likely to rise with some of the injured being in critical condition.

The manufacturing facility was a producer of active pharmaceutical ingredients, which are raw materials for manufacturing drug formulations, local sources said.

The state government announced a compensation of around 6,970 U.S. dollars to the kin of the deceased.

Indian Home Minister Amit Shah took stock of the situation after speaking with the state chief minister and tweeted, "Anguished to learn about the loss of lives due to explosion at a chemical factory in Dhule, Maharashtra. My condolences with the bereaved families. May injured recover soon."
