New Delhi: Amid widespread protests across the nation over Cyberabad rape and murder case and the uncovering of a similar case in Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao today, a UP minister’s callous comments on the state of crime against women have drawn widespread condemnation.

“Jab samaj hai, to samaj mein ye keh dena ke 100% crime nahi hoga, ye surety to mujhe nahi lagta Bhagwan Ram ne bhi de payi ho. Lekin ye surety zaroor hai agar crime hua hai to saza hogi aur vo jail jayega (In a society there can be no assurance that there would be no crime. Even Lord Ram can't give a 100 per cent guarantee that there would be no crimes in society. But you can be sure that there is wrongdoing, then justice will be served,” UP minister Ranvendra Pratap Singh said in response to a question on increasing cases of crimes against women.

The UP minister’s statement comes on a day when a rape victim was set ablaze by the accused when she was on her way to the court for the hearing of the case.

Five persons set the victim on fire in order to exact ‘revenge’ for reporting the crime to the police. As many as five persons surrounded the victim and poured kerosene oil on and set her on fire.

The 23-year-old victim sustained 90 per cent burns and was first admitted to Unnao Civil Hospital and later airlifted to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital.

She had been raped in March this year and the accused were released out on bail. In her statement to authorities, the victim had reported five men. The police officials said that three of the accused were arrested after survivor's statement was recorded. After the survivor was set ablaze, the police arrested two other accused.

The incident was reported just a week after a 27-year-old veterinary was raped and charred to death in Cyberabad.
