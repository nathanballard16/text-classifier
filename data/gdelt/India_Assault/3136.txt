NAGPUR: Yuva Sena chief Aditya Thackeray has sacked the organization’s activists who assaulted Kashmiri students in Yavatmal on Wednesday night. The main culprit Ajinkya Motke has been remanded to 15 days magisterial custody by the Yavatmal lower court while three of his associates have been granted bail.The students from the Dayabhai Patel Physical Education College were assaulted and verbally abused outside their rented accommodation by activists of Yuva Sena, youth wing of Shiv Sena , to protest the Pulwama attack.Aditya Thackeray expressed his ire on Twitter on Friday against his activists. He claimed that the party had issued a press note while taking disciplinary action on the activists on Thursday itself.“As of Thursday evening, the party has sacked those involved in the act. J & K is a part of India and no Indian, or for that matter, nobody should face the brunt of anger that is towards terrorism. We understand the angst but it must be against terror, not innocent people,” Aditya said in another tweet.The Yuva Sena activists had asked the students to vacate their rooms and return to Kashmir within four days. They were warned that if returned, they would be killed. Some residents of their colony intervened and saved them. The video of the attack had gone viral on social media causing much embarrassment to Sena.
