Jaish Chief Masood Azhar shifted to facility near Bahawalpur from Rawalpindi military hospital: Intel sources

New Delhi (India), Feb 25 (ANI): Jaish-e-Mohammed Chief Masood Azhar has been shifted from a military hospital in Rawalpindi to a highly protected facility called Kotghani near Bahawalpur in Pakistan, according to the inputs received by intelligence agencies from across the border.

“Three days after the attack on the CRPF convoy by the Jaish suicide bomber on February 14, Azhar was shifted to the facility in Kotghani where he has been kept in tight security,” the inputs received by the intelligence agencies suggest.

The agencies have also received certain inputs about a possible meeting between Hizbul Chief Sayyed Salahuddin and Azhar after the Pulwama terror attack but sources said they are probing the details further.

Jaish Chief Masood Azhar was in the Rawalpindi military hospital when the suicide bomber struck the CRPF convoy killing 44 personnel and injuring many others.

The security forces have been successful in eliminating Jaish terrorists Kamran and Ghazi, who are believed to have provided training and other logistics support to the suicide bomber in carrying out his attack.

India has exerted immense pressure on Pakistan through multiple international agencies but Pakistan is denying any complicity in the attacks or the role of Azhar and his gang in it. (ANI)
