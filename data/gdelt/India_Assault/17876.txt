Nigerian killed by fellow national in Bengaluru after fight over tiffin box

A Nigerian man was allegedly stabbed to death by a fellow national in Bengaluru after a fight over a tiffin box.

The incident took place in Hennur, East Bengaluru during the early hours of Sunday. According to the police, the victim identified as a 39-year-old Morado was stabbed at his residence by his friend Samuel (30), a student of KNS College, Hebbal.

Narrating the incident, Bengaluru police said Morado, who was without a job, had slapped Samuel for misplacing his tiffin box in a food joint Saturday afternoon. The police also added that Morado was frustrated for staying unemployed for a long time which is believed to have contributed to him being short-tempered.

“Samuel had taken Morado’s lunch box to buy chicken from a food joint in Hennur on Saturday afternoon after which he forgot the same there. Morado, who was drunk, on realising his tiffin box was missing slapped and abused Samuel after which other friends intervened to pacify them,” the police said.

According to the FIR filed, Samuel returned to Morado’s residence in Janakiram Layout in Hennur at around 3 am with a kitchen knife. However, Morado did not open the door at first questioning why he came. “Samuel was later allowed to enter on saying he wanted to apologise for his behaviour after which he stabbed Morado on his chest and stomach. Neighbours have stated that the men were heard shouting fiercely at each other until at least 3.30 am,” the police added.

Some of the neighbours alerted the police of the commotion but Morado had died by the time police arrived at the spot. “Samuel was arrested from the place of crime in Morado’s residence after which he later confessed the incident on inquiry,” the police said.

A thorough investigation and verification of statements are now underway.
