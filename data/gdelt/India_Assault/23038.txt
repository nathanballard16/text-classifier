SIT to probe violent protests in Ghaziabad

GHAZIABAD: A special investigation team ( SIT ) has been formed by Ghaziabad police to probe cases of rioting that were registered during protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act ( CAA ) across the district.The move follows an order by the director-general of police, OP Singh, who had asked for SITs to be formed to probe such cases across the state. According to the SSP, the SIT for Ghaziabad will have in it a circle officer, two inspectors and one officer of the level of a sub-inspector. The team will be headed by SP (crime). SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh said the officers in the SIT would be from the crime branch as they are better equipped to handle such cases, especially since social media had played a role in inciting violence in many parts. “Till now, 122 people have been arrested and over 2,500 identified for taking part in the violent protests in Muradnagar, Kaila Bhatta and Pasonda village on December 20,” Singh said.The SSP said the SIT would need to extensively coordinate with the local police stations of areas where protests had turned violent. “The SIT would be given access to all data from areas under the jurisdiction of police stations where the violent protests had taken place. Initial investigation by local police has revealed that the protesters had been mobilised in the three villages through WhatsApp groups. Each of these groups had 4-5 administrators. They would be tracked down and charged for inciting violence,” he added.Despite an internet shutdown on December 20, protests against the CAA had turned violent. Police teams were attacked with stones hurled from rooftops and at least 25 officers were injured. Wary of a repeat on December 27, around 5,000 cops were deployed in the three villages and drones were engaged to keep an eye on protesters. In connection with the December 20 clash, seven FIRs for attempt to murder and violence have been lodged against rioters across five police stations.
