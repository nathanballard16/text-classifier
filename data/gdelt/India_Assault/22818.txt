FIR Filed Against Shiv Sena Corporator On Charges Of Assaulting Private Contractor, Extorting Money

A Shiv Sena contractor from Kalyan named Mahesh Gaikwad has been booked on charges of assaulting a private contractor and attempting to extort Rs 1 lakh from him, Times of India has reported.

As per a complaint filed by the supervisor of the contractor, he and his men were working on installing cables for a private telecom company, when the Shiv Sena corporator and his staff allegedly threatened them and ordered the work to stop.

The supervisor also alleged that the corporator and his men demanded that they be paid Rs 1 lakh otherwise work will be forcibly stopped.

Following this incident the supervisor filed a complaint against the corporator and his five associates at the Kolsewadi police station.

The corporator on the other hand has alleged that the police filed the FIR after being pressurised by the local BJP MLA. The BJP MLA has responded by asserting that the Shiv Sena corporator already has various cases filed against him and had no authority to stop work.
