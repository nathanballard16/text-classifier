Sanskrit ‘shlokas’ dissuade people from rape: Bhagat Singh Koshyari Maharashtra governor

NAGPUR: Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari on Thursday asked Nagpur University (NU) authorities to teach their students Sanskrit ‘ shlokas ’ (verses) to prevent rapes which are “brutally being committed in the country every other day”.While speaking at the inaugural ceremony of NU’s Jamnalal Bajaj administrative bhavan, Koshyari was explaining the difference between good and evil people, and how they use or abuse knowledge, power and money when he made the remarks on preventing crime against women.Addressing the managing director of Bajaj Electricals, Shekhar Bajaj, who was present on the occasion, Koshyari said: “There was a time when ‘kanya puja’ would be held at homes. You (Bajaj), too, are from a religious family and must be doing it. But, what is happening in the country now. ‘Dushtas’ (the evil) are committing rapes and murder of women. Is power meant for abusing or protecting? Hence, students should be taught Sanskrit ‘shlokas’ so that such events don’t take place,” Koshyari said.The Maharashtra governor, who is chancellor of state universities, also equated the Bajaj family with saints for making the donation from their CSR funds for the Rs 26-crore new building off Ambazari bypass. Bajaj Group ’s chairman Rahul Bajaj has contributed Rs 10 crore under the corporate social responsibility for the new administrative block.“The devotion of saints towards society in unmatched. When an industrialist is saintly then it helps education,” Koshyari said.The appreciation for Bajajs from Koshyari, a former BJP MP and former CM, comes close on the heels of saffron leaders launching a scathing attack against Rahul Bajaj following his comments on ‘fear psychosis in the industry during an event in Mumbai earlier this month’.
