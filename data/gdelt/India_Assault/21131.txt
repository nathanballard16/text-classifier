MUMBAI: Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil on Friday slammed Union minister Smriti Irani for seeking apology from Rahul Gandhi over the Congress leader's "rape in India" barb.Using the "ShamelessSmriti" hashtag, Patil, who is also Maharashtra NCP chief, said fundamental issues should be prioritised to take the country forward.Speaking at a public meeting in Jharkhand, Gandhi had said Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised 'Make in India', but "wherever you see now, you find rape in India".When Irani and other BJP leaders took objection to his statement and sought his apology, Gandhi on Friday said he would never apologise.Gandhi instead demanded that Modi should apologise for an old speech, where he is heard saying that Delhi has turned into a "rape capital" under the UPA rule.Replying to Gandhi's tweet, Patil said "#ShamelessSmriti Saw your speech in the LS, will you still be asking for an apology? Let's not digress and prioritise the fundamental issues to take this country forward as promised."
