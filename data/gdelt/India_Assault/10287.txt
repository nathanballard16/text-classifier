Bhopal: In an appalling case reported from Madhya Pradesh's Sagar district, a journalist working for a Hindi news daily succumbed to his injuries after sustaining 90 per cent burns. The deceased's brother has alleged that he was set ablaze by the additional agriculture extension officer and one another man.

Reportedly, the officer Aman Chowdhary and the deceased journalist Chakresh Jain were involved in a legal dispute. In 2017, a case under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act was registered against Jain after Chowdhary lodged a police complaint.

According to a report by NDTV, Chowdhary claimed that Jain reached his house in Sagar district's Shahgarh in the morning and set himself on fire. Meanwhile, senior police officer Amit Sanghi told NDTV that Chowdhary in his statement before the magistrate claimed that Jain reached his house in the morning for discussing the case. But he poured petrol on himself and set himself ablaze.

Sanghi further added that Jain was found badly burnt inside a hut by his brother Rajkumar Jain. He was immediately rushed to a local hospital but the hospital staff declared him brought dead. Reportedly, the deceased's brother alleged that he was burnt by Chowdhary and one other man as his brother told him when he was alive.

However, the police are probing the case and the matters have been registered under Section 174 of the Code of Crimical Procedure. Further probe is underway.
