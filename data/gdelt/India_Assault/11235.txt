Anti-lynching rally turns violent, Cong man, five others detained

SURAT: Police lobbed 15 teargas shells and fired a round in the air on Friday to disperse a mob pelting them with stones during a rally by a city-based outfit to protest against mob lynchings in different parts of the country.Five policemen were injured by the mob, which also damaged two city buses.The rally was organised by Versatile Minorities Forum. Thousands of Muslims took part in it. Deputy commissioner of police Vidhi Chaudhary said, “The rally didn’t have permission to go beyond Makkai Pool and hence was stopped there.” This angered a section of the crowd and it started pelting stones at the police.The outfit’s president Ishtiaque Pathan, Congress councillor Aslam Cyclewala and four others were detained by the police. The outfit’s leader Firoz Malek said, “We had announced that the rally didn’t have permission to go beyond Makkai Pool, yet some miscreants belonging to another group went ahead and indulged in violence with an aim to spread panic among people in the area.”
