In Ahmedabad, man bites girls over barking dog

AHMEDABAD: In a bizarre case, a 25-year-old man allegedly bit two girls, aged 16 and 17, over a tiff over the barking of a stray dog that the girls cared for in the Isanpur area of the city on Monday evening.The accused, Maharufkhan Pathan, as alleged in the FIR with Isanpur police, on Monday rushed to the complainant, Qamarjahan Banu Pathan (50) and asked her why they feed a particular stray dog, which barks at passersby. Pathan also said that the dog had bit him. Qamarjahan Banu got angry and told him to behave properly. This made Maharuf angry and he allegedly started abusing her and on seeing her two daughters, he rushed to them, hit them and bit them on their wrists so hard that it caused wounds.Their victims’ neighbours gathered around and rescued the two girls and the middle-aged woman from Maharuf, the FIR states.On the other hand, Maharuf’s father Javedkhan Pathan, filed a cross complaint with Isanpur police, stating that Qamarjahan Banu’s family attacked them with an iron pipe when they objected to the family raising a stray dog in the residential colony.“When I asked Qamarjahan Banu to keep their pet dog, which is a stray, at her home as it was barking at me and my family, she started abusing me. Her son later came with an iron pipe and beat me and my family severely,” said Javedkhan Pathan.Later, three members of Javedkhan’s family and Qamarjahan Bano’s two daughters were rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment. Police registered a case of assault against four members of Javedkhan’s family and same number of persons from Qamarjahan Bano’s family were charged with the same offence.
