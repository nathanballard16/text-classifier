The villagers refuse to speak as they are shocked by the sordid incidents, he said.“Thirunavukkarasu met with an accident two years ago and was admitted in Kovai Medical Center and Hospital . I visited him in the hospital. His family, engaged in moneylending business, did not mingle with neighbours. Four days ago, his mother Latha visited my shop to buy milk and curd. But she stopped after CB-CID started to investigate the case,” he told TOI.CB-CID sleuths had searched the house and seized five mobile phones, memory cards, SIM cards and documents related to the moneylending business.Following the arrest of her son, the village has ostracised the family, Latha said. “Some women verbally abused me and tried to attack me. Even my relatives have stopped to talk fearing that police would question them also.”
