32 arrested for beating a man to death in Patna

Patna: The police have arrested 32 people, including 6 women, in connection with mob-lynching of a man here on Saturday on suspicion of being a child lifter and appealed people to refrain from breaking the law.



According to the police, the victim was a mentally retarded man. He was beaten to death by a mob at Chulhaichak under the Rupaspur police station.



Amid the swirling rumour about the rise in child lifting incidents in Bihar, Director General of Police (DGP) Gupteshwar Pandey appealed the people not to take law in their hands. The people must inform the police instead of thrashing someone over some suspicion, he said.



Bihar has witnessed over a dozen incidents of mob violence in the past five days.



Two Sikhs on Saturday were assaulted by a mob on suspicion of being child lifters in Patna, before being rescued by the police. Same day in Danapur, near Patna, two youths were thrashed by a mob on Saturday on suspicion of being child abductors.
