13 killed, dozen hurt in Bhadohi explosion

Lucknow, Feb 23 : As many as 13 people were killed and a dozen others injured in a blast at Rothaan village, 30 km from Bhadohi district headquarters, on Saturday, the police said.

Thirteen bodies have been pulled out of the debris, a district official told IANS and added a National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) team has reached the site.

The explosion occurred at a house, owned by Akhtar Ali. It razed the building and forced cracks in the neighbouring houses and shattered glass panes of homes around it, a police officer said.

Prima facie, it appears the explosion was caused by a fire in a stockpile of firecrackers kept in the house, the officer said.

According to neighbours, the house was used for weaving carpets, but the owner could be using it for making illegal firecrackers.

The Varanasi-Bhadohi road was cordoned off following the incident and JCB machines were pressed into action to clear debris, the officer said.

Mourning the loss of lives, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has asked the district authorities to ensure prompt treatment for the injured.

Adityanath prayed for the departed souls and extended his sympathies to the bereaved families, said a spokesperson.
