Court can take action against convicts for delaying justice: Nirbhaya's advocate

New Delhi [India], Dec 13 (ANI): The Patiala House Court can take a decision on carrying out the death sentence to the four convicts for their "malafide intention" of delaying justice to the Nirbhaya victim, her lawyer Seema Kushwaha said on Friday.



"The execution petition was filed in this court exactly a year ago. Since last year, the court has been issuing notice to them (convicts). They are deliberately delaying justice to the victim. To avoid the delay, we will request the court that the death sentence should be executed," Kushwaha told ANI.

Asked whether the court would make such a decision without further hearing, the advocate said, "The court can take a decision on carrying out the death sentence based on the malafide intention (by the convicts) of delaying the matter."

Kushwaha's statement came ahead of the four convicts before produced before the court today. Following today's hearing, Additional Sessions Judge Satish Kumar Arora has adjourned the hearing on plea of Nirbhaya's parents seeking issuance of death warrant and execution of all convicts, till 18th December

The victim, a 23-year-old paramedic student was gang-raped and murdered on December 16, 2012, by six men on a moving bus in south Delhi. All the six accused were arrested and charged with sexual assault and murder.

One of the accused was a minor and appeared before a juvenile justice court, while another accused committed suicide in Tihar jail. The rest of the convicts are facing the gallows.

The Supreme Court had confirmed capital punishment for the four men in 2017. (ANI)
