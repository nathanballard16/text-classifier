Dutch authorities unable to question abducted Amsterdam girl's father

The Dutch judiciary failed ot question Shehzad Hemani, the father of abducted Amsterdam toddler Insiya, as a witness in India, the Public Prosecutor said on Tuesday. In October the court in Amsterdam postponed the criminal case against the six suspects in the 2016 abduction to give the Prosecutor a last chance to speak to Hemani, NU.nl reports.

Insiya was forcibly abducted from her grandmother's Amsterdam apartment in September 2016. The then 2-year-old girl was handed over to her father, who spirited her away to Mumbai. She is still with her father in India. Hemani is considered a suspect in her abduction in the Netherlands, but India refuses to extradite him.

The trial against the six suspects - one woman and five men, including Hemani - will continue on Monday, according to NU.nl.

In March a Dutch court revoked Hemani's custody of his now 5-year-old daughter. The court shared the opinion of the Child Protection Board, which raised concerns about Insiya's development. There are "major concerns about her emotional development", the court said in its ruling. "Apart from her father, nobody knows how the minor is doing, what she is being told and what all this is doing to her."
