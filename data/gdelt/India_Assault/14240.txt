New Delhi: A Delhi court commenced on Thursday trial in the death of the Unnao rape survivor's father in judicial custody.

District Judge Dharmesh Sharma recorded statements of two prosecution witnesses -- a senior police official and the district magistrate of Unnao. The court then put up the matter for further hearing on August 23.

The court has framed murder and other charges against expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, his brother Atul Sengar, three former Uttar Pradesh police officials and five others in the case.

It has clubbed two cases -- the alleged murder of the rape survivor's father and the another allegedly framing him in a case of possession of illegal arms. The accused persons in these two cases had denied the charges and claimed trial.

The rape survivor's father was arrested on April 3, 2018, and died in judicial custody on April 9, 2018.

The woman, allegedly raped by Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor, is battling for life after a truck rammed into her car in Uttar Pradesh's Rae Bareli on July 28, killing two of her aunts. Her lawyer was also injured in the accident. Sengar has also been booked in the rape case.
