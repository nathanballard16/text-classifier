SC puts in abeyance transfer of Unnao rape victim’s accident case to Delhi

AGENCIES / NEW DELHI

The Supreme Court today kept in abeyance its earlier order by which it had transferred the accident case of the Unnao rape victim from Rae Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.

A bench, comprising Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Deepak Gupta, took note of the submission of Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the CBI that the accident took place last Sunday and the investigation is in progress.

Mehta said since the probe in the accident is still pending, the case cannot be transferred under the provisions of law and sought indulgence of the bench that its transfer be kept in abeyance till the conclusion of the probe.

The Apex Court today said that the Unnao rape victim’s family is at liberty to take a call on shifting her to AIIMS in New Delhi.

It accepted the suggestion made by senior advocate V Giri that she is unconscious and on ventilator, and her family has expressed that she be treated in a Lucknow hospital for the time being.

In an accident involving victim’s car and a truck, the girl and her lawyer were severely injured. Two aunts of the victim had died in the accident.
