Chennai: A chilling murder of an old couple was reported from a village near Erode and the entire locality is stunned by the brutality of the crime. The couple was murdered by unidentified persons in a farmhouse and family dispute is suspected to be the motive behind the killings.

Duraisami and his wife Thulasimani have been engaged in farming in a Sennimalai village, Erode district. They had a house within their farm and both were senior citizens. It is said that they own a 25-acre property close to the Noyyal river. The couple has three daughters and a son. The daughters are married and their son Venkatesan lived with them.

It is learnt that a dispute arose during the wedding of their third daughter and a case was filed demanding that the properties be divided among the three daughters. It is reported that last year, their eldest son-in-law had entered the house and had carried away some utensils.

Even as the court case is pending, the second daughter had come visiting her parents on February 19. Their son Venkatesan was not at home then. He had gone to visit the Bhagawati Amman temple in Kerala for offering prayers.

Under the circumstances, on the morning of Wednesday, neighbours were alerted when the cattle tied in the farm started bleating for a very long time. They then went to Duraisami’s house and found their bodies with blood all over.

Police were informed and they have summoned the police dog and forensic experts to investigate and collect fingerprints. The couple had been attacked with iron rods and cut with a sickle as well, according to the police. They have further said that nothing has been stolen from the house and that they are confident of apprehending the culprits soon.
