Devasis Chattopadhyay

Mumbai: Devasis Chattopadhyay a well-respected person as a writer, journalist, communication specialist said that he will stand with the woman who was a victim of deceit.

Devasis’s name started to appear in newspapers in Kerala after he stood up for the Bihar woman who filed a rape case against Binoy Kodiyeri. Devasis met the complainant woman for compiling his book titled ‘Without Prejudice’ which discusses the lives of girls working in dance bars.

While speaking to Mathrubhumi, he said that he was only a catalyst in the issue. “When I heard her story, I understood that Binoy deceived her. And I wanted to stand with her in the fight. Because, her opponents are big shots and have influence of money and political power,” the writer said.

Countering the case as an attempt of blackmail is a blunder. Influential people do it always and Binoy too did the same. The complainant woman has no political motives. Because she had informed the matter to CPM leadership even before Lok Sabha election. And political interests have not influenced the case.

“I have so many criticisms to raise against CPM. But this is not the time for that. Values are gradually fading out from the main leaders of CPM”, said Devasis.

He further said he is confident about the case. Because she is a courageous woman. Society should support and respect her. She is an amazing mother and a personality. In case of Binoy, he is destroying the lives of two women and three children.

Devasis also said Mumbai police are handling the case efficiently and with prudence.
