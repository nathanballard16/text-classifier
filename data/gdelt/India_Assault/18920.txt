Government okays Rs 23k crore defence buy but trims Navy's wishlist

NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday gave preliminary approval to defence procurement projects worth Rs 22,800 crore, but slashed the Navy’s long-standing proposal to acquire 10 more Poseidon-8I “submarine-hunting” aircraft to just six planes amidst the severe fund crunch being faced by the armed forces.Apart from the six P-8I aircraft, the Rajnath Singh-led defence acquisitions council (DAC) also gave the nod for the indigenous design, development and manufacture of “thermal imaging night sights” for assault rifles of the Army and 14 twin-engine heavy-duty helicopters for the Coast Guard.It also revalidated the “acceptance of necessity (AoN)” for the procurement of two indigenously-developed Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) aircraft, which were first approved at a cost of Rs 5,113 crore way back in March 2015.TOI was the first to report on Tuesday that the cash-strapped armed forces had been directed to curtail their operational requirements due to budgetary constraints, which included the Navy being told to halve its requirement for the 10 Boeing-manufactured P-8I aircraft at a cost of over $3 billion from the US.Sources said the DAC had now decided the Navy will get only six more P-8Is for around $1.8 billion to add to the 12 such long-range maritime patrol aircraft, which are packed with radars and weapons for anti-submarine warfare, already ordered from the US at a cost of over $3.1 billion. Of the earlier dozen P-8Is, eight have been inducted at the naval air station INS Rajali at Arakkonam (Tamil Nadu), while the next four are slated for delivery by 2021-2022.As for the two AWACS, under which 360-degree coverage indigenous AESA (active electronically scanned array) radars will be mounted on Airbus A-330 wide-body jets, the fresh DAC approval was taken to resolve funding issues. IAF and DRDO will now almost equally share the costs, said sources.India currently has just three “Phalcon” AWACS and one “Netra” AEW&C aircraft, which act as “eyes in the sky” in detecting and tracking hostile fighters, cruise missiles and drones much before ground-based radars. In sharp contrast, Pakistan already has seven such aircraft, including Chinese Karakoram Eagle ZDK-03 and Swedish Saab-2000, with another three on the way. “Pakistan effectively used such aircraft during the aerial skirmish along the LoC a day after the Balakot bombing on February 26,” said a source.MoD officials said the 14 helicopters cleared for the Coast Guard will help the force “undertake missions to prevent maritime terrorism, infiltration of terrorists by sea routes as well as search and rescue operations”.The Coast Guard’s earlier attempt to get such choppers, equipped with the requisite weather-cum-surveillance radars, electro-optical/infrared devices, rescue hoists and the like, was scrapped amid allegations of wrongdoings and leak of classified information.The MoD said the thermal imaging sights will be manufactured under “Make in India” by the Indian private industry. “Assault rifles equipped with these night sights will enable troops deployed on the frontline to undertake long-range accurate engagements in dark and all weather conditions, thereby enhancing their night-fighting capabilities,” he said.
