Doctors, hospitals face action if they turn down rape survivors

“None of the private hospitals or doctors follows them. The state should be asked if its own doctors do so.” The panel should comprise a district surgeon, medical superintendent, gynaecologist or paediatrician and a medical officer.A health activist said central guidelines in this regard had been issued in 2013. MUMBAI: Doctors refusing first aid or treatment to survivors of sexual violence and acid attack are liable to face imprisonment.New guidelines issued by the state government on Thursday for medico-legal care further state no hospital—private or government—can deny treatment to victims of rape, acid attack or minor victims of sexual assault.The Government Resolution states: “No medical practitioner (registered under CRPC 164 A) can deny treatment to a rape victim or acid attack victim or victim of POCSO (minor child). He should start treating the patient immediately and should prepare medical report without delay.”It further states hospitals registered under CRPC 357 C—public, private, central government, state run, local self-government—or even an individual are liable to face stringent action if they deny treatment.A police case can be registered against hospitals, which allows for punishment with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to one year and a fine, or both.Medical practitioners or hospitals are required to send samples for medico-legal examination within 96 hours of the attack.The state has also made it mandatory to set up a panel to permit examination of female victims of sexual attacks, acid attacks or mentally disturbed female patients.
