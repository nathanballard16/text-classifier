Uproar in RS over Northeast violence; House adjourns till 1pm

The Rajya Sabha was adjourned for the second time on Friday after the Congress, TMC, DMK and the Left created an uproar over violence in northeastern states over the amended citizenship law.

No sooner the House met at noon after the first adjournment, TMC MP Derek O'Brien raised the issue of violence in the Northeast, but Chairman Venkaiah Naidu did not allow him and proceeded with the listed questions.

In the meanwhile, Congress MPs too came in support of the TMC leader and soon other Opposition parties started raising slogans against the amended Citizenship Act, violence in the northeastern states, including Tripura.

As ministers were replying to questions, some TMC members, including Derek O'Brien, trooped into the well of the House and some Congress MPs were seen standing in the aisle raising slogans against the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

TMC member Dola Sen even tore a piece of paper while standing in the well.

The chairman tried to pacify the protesting members. But as his efforts did not bring order in the House, he adjourned it till 1pm.

Earlier, in the morning session, the House was adjourned as members from the treasury benches protested over a remark by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on the issue of rapes in India.
