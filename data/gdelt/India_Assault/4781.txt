Arms Loot From MLA's Residence: NIA Arrests 3 Shopian Native...

(MENAFN- Kashmir Observer) NEW DELHI —The National Investigation Agency on Tuesday arrested three persons in Jammu and Kashmir for alleged theft of seven AK series assault rifles of security personnel posted at the residence of former PDP MLA Aijaz Ahmad Mir in Srinagar last year, officials said.

Those arrested were identified as Parveez Ahmad Wani (35) of Thokarpora, Javid Yousuf Dar (21) of Gundi Darvesh and Subzar Ahmad Kumar (20) of Shermal, said a spokesman of NIA, in a statement.

"The case relates to theft of weapons from the guard room of official residence of Aijaz Ahmad Mir, former MLA of Wachi, at Jawahar Nagar in Srinagar. SPO Adil Bashir Sheikh was attached with him at his official residence," he said.

Sheikh had fled with seven AK rifles issued to the security personnel attached with Mir and also a personal pistol of the MLA, he said.

"During investigation, it emerged that Sheikh and his associates namely Yawar Ahmad Dar (now active militant of Hizbul Mujahideen) and Rafique Ahmad Bhat had taken away the above mentioned weapons as part of a conspiracy hatched by Kashmir-based top leadership of the militant organisation," he said.

The officer said the NIA had earlier arrested accused Rafique Ahmad Bhat in the instant case, but accused Sheikh and Yawar Ahmad Dar are still absconding.

"During investigation, it has also emerged that Parveez Ahmad Wani, Javid Yousuf Dar and Subzar Ahmad Kumar had provided logistical support to the above mentioned accused persons as a part of the conspiracy," he said.
