3 more held for Alwar gang rape case, protests across Rajasthan

The Rajasthan police have arrested the remaining three accused in the April 26 gang rape of a 19-year-old woman in Alwar, inspector general of police (Jaipur range) S Sengathir said on Thursday.

Five men had allegedly raped the woman in presence of her husband for two hours, filmed the crime, and later circulated its video on social media. Sengathir identified the three as Chhote Lal Gurjar, Mahesh Gurjar and Hansraj Gurjar. He said Mahesh Gurjar was arrested from Jaipur district’s Shahpura on Wednesday and Hansraj Gurjar from Uttar Pradesh’s Mathura on Thursday. It was immediately unclear where the third accused was arrested from.

An unidentified person from Jaipur was booked on charges of posting the video of the gang rape on messaging application WhatsApp. The 19-year-old woman separately recorded her statement before a magistrate in Alwar’s Thana Gazi town on Thursday.

The Rajasthan government has removed Alwar’s police superintendent, Rajeev Pachar, and suspended Thana Gazi police station in charge, Sardar Singh, for their alleged negligence in handling the case. Five other police officers have been also been transferred.

The Opposition BJP held protest demonstrations at district headquarters across the state on Thursday and submitted a memorandum to governor Kalyan Singh demanding action against police officers accused of inaction and security for the woman’s family. In Jaipur, BJP state president, Madan Lal Saini, said Rajasthan’s law and order situation was deteriorating and women were forced to confine themselves to their homes. Ruling Congress’s Rajasthan unit vice president, Archana Sharma, rejected the BJP’s criticism as baseless.
