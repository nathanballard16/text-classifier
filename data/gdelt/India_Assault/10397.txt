Kolkata: Class 10 girl found dead in school washroom with wrist slit, face wrapped in plastic bag

New Delhi:

A class 10 student of a reputed girl's school in Kolkata was found dead on Friday in a washroom of the institution with injury marks on her left wrist, the police said. The girl was found lying "lifeless" with her face wrapped in a plastic bag on Friday inside a washroom of the school located in Ranikuthi area of the city, a police officer said.

"There are also some marks of injuries on her left wrist. We are looking into it. The girl's parents have been informed. The body has been sent for post mortem," the officer said.

Asked whether it was a case of suicide or murder, the officer said, "At the moment it is under investigation. Our forensic experts are collecting evidence from the spot. We are also looking into CCTV footage from the school."

When contacted, the school authorities refused to comment on the matter.

NDTV quoting sources reported that the girl had gone to the toilet around 1.40 pm and it was around 20 minutes later that people started looking for her.

The girl may have put the plastic bag on her head to stop her screams from being heard.

Incidentally, in December 2017, two physical training instructors of the same school were arrested following allegations of sexually assaulting a four-year-old girl inside the premises, which led to a massive agitation by the guardians.

The incident came almost two years after a seven-year-old student of Gurugram’s Ryan International School was found murdered inside the ground floor of the school’s washroom under mysterious circumstances on September 8, 2017.
