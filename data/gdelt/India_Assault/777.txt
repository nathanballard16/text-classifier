Omar questions Army officials boasting about number of terrorists killed in J&K

SRINAGAR: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah Thursday questioned Army officials boasting about the number of terrorists killed in the state last year, saying it would have been a "great year" if no youth had joined militancy."I beg to differ, a great year would be one in which no young man would join militancy, no terrorists would be killed & no security personnel would lose their lives in encounters. The compulsion of killing militants/terrorists shouldn't be treated as a cause for celebration," Omar wrote on Twitter He was responding to the remarks of Northern Army Command chief Lt Gen Ranbir Singh in which he reportedly said that 2018 has been a great year for the security forces as more than 250 terrorists were killed, 54 were caught alive and four surrendered to the forces.
