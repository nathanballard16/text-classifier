Follow us on Bhopal: 21-year-old woman raped by tantrik in name of nikah halala after husband gives her triple talaq

In yet another shocking incident, a 21-year-old woman in Madhya Pradesh's Bhopal was raped by a 'tantrik' citing the custom of 'Nikah Halala' after her husband gave her triple talaq and wished to remarry her. The Bhopal police on Wednesday arrested the woman's husband and the tantrik who allegedly raped her.

According to the woman, her husband divorced her by giving her triple talaq (which is now illegal) on November 23 after the couple had a fight.

Later, the husband had a change of heart and wished to remarry her and it is when the tantrik who was part of the marriage raped her.

Anwar Baba (50), who was the woman's ''nikahi baap'' (one who offers the bride's hand to the groom during the wedding), told the couple that if they wished to remarry, the woman will have to first marry someone else, consummate the marriage and then remarry her first husband as per the custom of Nikah Halala.

Baba, who is a tantrik, then allegedly took the victim to his flat in Ashbagh area and raped her.

When the woman returned to her husband's house, he refused to take her in, following which she lodged a complaint against him as well as the tantrik, SSP Khan said.

"We have arrested the husband under the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act (which bans triple talaq) and Anwar Baba for raping her," the official added.
