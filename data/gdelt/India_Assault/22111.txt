Anti-CAA Stir: Violent Protests Erupt In Lucknow As Mob Torches Police Check Posts, Vans And Media Vehicles

Clashes with the police were also reported from Hussainabad, Daliganj and Teele Wali Masjid and protestors at the Chhota Imambara pelted stones.

People started coming out from lanes leaving the police dumbfounded. What made it even more difficult for the police was the fact that women were leading protests from the front. The police force did not have female cops in ample measure.

Director General of Police O P Singh took to the streets to monitor the situation along with District Magistrate Abhishek Prakash and SSP Kalanidhi Naithani.

Even as the police focused on protests by Samajwadi Party workers, common people came out on large numbers in old city areas like Khadra and pelted stones at the police.

Police carried out a baton charge at the Parivartan Chowk where a large number of Congress workers were taken into custody.

A bus was also set on fire at Parivartan Chowk and the iconic Begum Hazrat Mahal Park was taken over by the protestors. The Metro station at the K D Singh Babu Stadium was shut down. Shops in Hazratganj were also closed as trouble spread.

This is the first time in recent years that Lucknow has witnessed violence of this scale. It clearly points to a major intelligence failure since the protests were well orchestrated and strategised.

Tension continues to prevail in the state capital.
