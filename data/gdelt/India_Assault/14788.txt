Issewal gang-rape case to be heard on Sept 7

Ludhiana: A local court on Saturday adjourned the Issewal gang-rape case. The next date of hearing of the case in the court of Additional Sessions Judge Rashmi Sharma is on September 7.

On February 9, a group of miscreants had allegedly gang raped a 20-year-old student after holding her and her friend hostage as they had gone to Issewal area to celebrate chocolate day. Police had initially booked 10 unidentified accused in the case and had arrested seven accused, including a juvenile.

Special public prosecutor for state B D Gupta said the case wasn’t heard as the judge was on leave. He said in the next hearing, the defence is expected to cross examine the rape survivor and eyewitness of the case.

Gupta said they have already got the testimony of the girl, eyewitness and medical officers. He said they are yet to get the testimony of the investigating officer of the case recorded in the court.
