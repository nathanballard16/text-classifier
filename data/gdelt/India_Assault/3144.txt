Maharashtra: Shiv Sena sacks youth wing workers who assaulted two Kashmiri students

As per the reports, the two Kashmiri students of the Dahyabhai Patel Sharirik Shikshan Mahavidyalaya were returning to their accommodation from when they were confronted by the Yuv Sena workers. They were reportedly asked to chant Vande Mataram and prove their patriotism.

In the wake of an assault on two Kashmiri students by some activists of Shiv Sena’s youth wing in Yavatmal on Wednesday night, the party leadership sacked the eight accused party workers on Friday. The accused men were affiliated to the party’s youth wing Yuva Sena which had come under stern criticisms after a video clip of the attack was widely shared on the social media. The attack took place in Maharashtra’s Yavatmal on Wednesday night and is the latest addition to the series of similar incidents that have occurred as an after effect of the Pulwama attack.
