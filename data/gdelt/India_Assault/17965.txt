Submit report on larger plot in Rajiv killing case: SC to CBI

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought response from CBI-led multidisciplinary monitoring agency (MDMA) on progress of its probe into larger conspiracy behind the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi and directed it to file status report within four weeks.A bench of Justices of L Nageswara Rao and Hemant Gupta said the last status report was filed one year ago and asked additional solicitor general Pinki Anand to file fresh report on the progress made thereafter.The MDMA, set up in 1998 on the recommendations of Justice M C Jain Commission of Inquiry which had probed the conspiracy aspect of Gandhi’s assassination, is headed by a CBI official and comprises officers from IB, RAW, revenue intelligence and other agencies.The court was hearing a plea of one of the convicts in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case A G Perarivalan who sought suspension of his life sentence till the completion of the probe by MDMA. The court had earlier dismissed Perarivalan’s plea seeking recall of the May 11, 1999 verdict upholding his conviction.Perarivalam was about 20 years old when he was arrested and has spent 27 years behind the bars. He was granted parole in August last year for the first time since his arrest in mid-1991.
