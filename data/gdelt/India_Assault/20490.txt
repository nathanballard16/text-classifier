No Judiciary Can Touch Me, I am Param Shiva: Nithyananda

A video has been doing the rounds on Twitter since 22 November, where self-styled Godman Nithyananda can be heard challenging the Indian judiciary. Nithyananda has been accused of child abuse and kidnapping by Gujarat Police after three minor children (a boy and two girls) were rescued from his ashram in the outskirts of Ahmedabad last month. He is said to have established a country ‘Kailaasa’ on an island near Ecuador. However, on Friday, 6 December, the Embassy of Ecuador denied the allegations.
