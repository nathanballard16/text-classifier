A 33-year-old Mountain View man who was the subject of a police wanted bulletin is in custody and charged with numerous offenses stemming from an incident on June 24.

Robert K. Pahio is charged with two counts each of of first-degree assault and auto theft, plus kidnapping, first-degree terroristic threatening, first-degree property damage, leaving the scene of an accident involving serious bodily injury, resisting an order to stop and driving without a license.

On June 24, officers responded to a reported traffic collision on Ohai Street in Hilo. According to police, it was later determined that Pahio, who fled the scene before police arrived, had assaulted an acquaintance with a pipe at a Hawaiian Acres home in Puna. Police say Pahio then abducted the man and drove to Hilo in a vehicle that didn’t belong to him.

According to police, the victim was able to escape the vehicle, but Pahio then drove toward him and another man. Both victims were taken to Hilo Medical Center for treatment.

Pahio is in custody at the Hilo police cellblock in lieu of $71,000.00 bail pending his initial appearance Wednesday in Hilo District Court.
