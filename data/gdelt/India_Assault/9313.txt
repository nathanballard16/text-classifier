#MenToo: Karan Oberoi’s bail plea to be heard today

Almost a month after television actor Karan Oberoi was sent to judicial custody over rape and extortion charges levelled by a tantrik-cum-healer, his bail plea was presented before the Bombay High Court on Thursday. However, the hearing was postponed after the public prosecutor (PP) asked for more time to go through the papers.Karan’s lawyer, Dinesh Tiwari, told BT, “The public prosecutor has asked for time, saying that he wants to go through the papers. We objected to it on the grounds that Karan is in custody without there being a prima facie case against him. The judge has postponed the case for Friday.”He added, “We have written a number of letters and also filed an application in the magistrate court, requesting them to seize the complainant’s mobile phone and produce the said video (which she claims to have been recorded by Karan while he raped her) and chats. What is preventing them from looking into it?”Earlier last month, Karan’s bail plea was rejected by the Dindoshi Sessions Court. Since then, the case has witnessed several twists. It began with the complainant filing another FIR on May 25, stating that she was attacked by two unknown bikers in Lokhandwala, while she was going for her morning walk. According to the complaint, the men attacked her with a sharp object and threatened to throw acid on her face. She added that the attackers hurled a chit with the message, ‘Take the case back’. However, during investigation, the police reportedly found the complainant’s lawyer Ali Kaashif Khan’s allegedly involvement in the attack, following which he was arrested by Oshiwara police on Monday. It has been revealed that at least one of the accused is related to Khan.
