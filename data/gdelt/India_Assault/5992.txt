AINRC drops Modi’s photo from pamphlets distributed in minority neighbourhoods

The publicity material had pictures of former T.N. CM Jayalalitha and AINRC chief Rangasamy

The disappearance of the photograph of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in pamphlets distributed by the All India N R Congress seeking votes for its Lok Sabha candidate K. Narayanasamy has kicked up a row as campaigning is at its peak in the city.

The pamphlets distributed by the party in Assembly constituencies where minorities have a seizable presence did not carry the picture of Mr. Modi.

The AINRC had entered into an alliance with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Bharatiya Janata Party, Pattali Makkal Katchi and Desiya Murpokku Dravida Kazhagm for the Lok Sabha elections.

The pamphlets distributed in Uppalam, Muthialpet, Orleanpet and Villianur areas did not contain the photographs of Mr. Modi. The publicity material had only larger pictures of former Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalitha and AINRC chief Rangasamy, besides respective leaders of AINRC and AIADMK.

The Congress was quick to seize the opportunity by questioning whether Mr. Rangasamy endorsed the candidature of Mr. Narendra Modi as Prime Minister.

“Is he supporting Mr. Modi or Rahul Gandhi,” asked Chief Minister V. Narayanasamy at a press conference on Thursday.

Clarification sought

PCC chief A. Namassivayam said the election campaign material did not even carry the pictures of PMK founder Ramadoss.

“Why are they (AINRC) shying away from carrying the picture of Mr. Modi. The AINRC should explain whether they accept the leadership of Mr. Modi,” he added.
