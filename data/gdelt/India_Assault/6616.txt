A person was left critically injured after a clash broke out between several Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers on Thursday in Karnataka's KR Puram. According to reports, the person was hit on the head while he was embroiled in the fight. He was rushed to a nearby hospital where he is currently undergoing treatment.

Reportedly, both the Congress and BJP workers were sitting outside a polling booth in KR Puram, Bengaluru in order to ensure the voters get their serials numbers right. It was during the process that the two sides began quarreling and it quickly turned into a full-blown violent fight.

Krishnarajapuram, or KR Puram, is an outlying neighbourhood of the Bangalore North parliamentary constituency. The current sitting MP from the seat is senior BJP leader and former Chief Minister of Karnataka DV Sadananda Gowda, who is contesting from the seat yet again. Bangalore North has over time turned into a BJP bastion as the saffron party has not lost from the seat since 2004.

The second phase of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections is being held in Karnataka's 14 parliamentary constituencies, which includes Bangalore North, on April 18. Nearly 39.72 per cent was recorded in the constituency by 5pm on the voting day.
