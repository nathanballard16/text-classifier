Chandigarh, July 1

Two doctors told a special CBI court today that Suraj Singh, the Kotkhai minor’s rape accused, died in the police custody.

Dr Piyush Kapila from Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, Shimla, and Dr Abhishek Sharma from AIIMS, Delhi, appeared before the court and presented medical reports. They deposed in the court that there were injuries on his body when he was in the custody.

Now, the case will be heard on July 24 and more witnesses will record their statements. The Supreme Court had ordered the transfer of the case from Shimla to Chandigarh to start the trial afresh against nine police officials, including Inspector General of Police (IGP) Zahur Haider Zaidi, SP DW Negi, Theog DSP Manoj Joshi and others.

Zaidi and others were arrested by the CBI for the custodial death of Suraj, who was found dead in the Kotkhai police station on July 18, 2017.

A 16-year-old girl went missing in Kotkhai on July 4, 2017, and her body was found from the Halaila forest two days later. After the registration of a case, the SIT had arrested Suraj and four others. Suraj was allegedly tortured in order to extract confession of the crime till his death. After his alleged custodial death, the High Court had handed over the investigation of both cases to the CBI.
