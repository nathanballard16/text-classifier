A resident of Chennai’s Madhavaram has filed a police complaint against a man for allegedly sexually assaulting the puppies in her area. Ilavarasi, the complainant, has been feeding the 15-day-old puppies in her area. She alleges that a man sexually asaulted the puppies on Thursday.

Speaking to TNM, she says, “There is an empty plot of land next to my house and the stray dog has given birth to new puppies. I give them food every day. I was watching a man walk towards them and pick them up. I was immediately happy as I thought he would adopt them. Then I saw him unzip his pants. I assumed he was going to pee. But he picked up the puppies one by one and started kissing them on the mouth. He sat down and put the puppies inside his pants, between his legs. I immediately ran downstairs. But he had already left by then.”

Ilavarasi then recalled having seen the man earlier as well. She says that while she has given a complaint to the police, the latter have been lax in their approach towards the case. “They were asking repeatedly how it happened. I have even provided the CCTV footage from my home which captured the entire incident. But they kept saying, ‘Oh but we can’t see it clearly’,” says Ilavarasi.

When TNM contacted the local police station, the inspector said that the delay was on account of them seeking a legal opinion. “We have given the complainant a CSR acknowledgement of their complaint. We are seeking a legal opinion on what sections of the law are applicable in this particular case. After the sections are made out, we will file an FIR,” the cop stated.
