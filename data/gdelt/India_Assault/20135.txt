Mumbai: A day after the Telangana Police killed four persons who were accused in the brutal gang-rape and murder of a lady veterinarian, the Shiv Sena hailed the extra-judicial act, calling it ‘justice served’.

“The Hyderabad Police chose a shortcut in the case by bypassing investigation, chargesheet, hearing, and court dates,” the Shiv Sena said in an editorial in its mouthpiece Saamana on Saturday.

While the editorial refused to believe that it was possible for the four accused to have tried to escape the police custody, the party said that the decision to execute the alleged culprits “should be welcomed as it was in keeping in line with public sentiments”.

The Cyberabad Police on Friday morning took the accused to the sit of crime to recreate the scene and shot them dead around 100 metres from the spot where the victim’s charred body was found when they tried to allegedly escape. The woman’s body was found the day after she went missing on November 27 near Tondupally toll plaza. The accused were arrested on November 29.

Later on, the bodies of all four accused were taken to the Mahbubnagar district hospital for post-mortem but were not cremated following a stay order by the Telangana High Court. The 27-year-old woman was gang-raped and murdered and following that, the perpetrators burnt her body to destroy all evidences that could have drawn attention towards them.
