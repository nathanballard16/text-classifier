New Delhi: Guests at a wedding in Jharkhand witnessed a most unusual site, that of the groom being held hostage by the bride's family. It was later discovered that the man being held captive was the groom's brother who had been sent as a 'proxy' to marry the to-be bride. Meanwhile, the man slated to get married, Karim, is in police custody following a complaint by his two wives.

Officer-in-charge (OC), Kiriburu women's police station, Ponam Kujur told Hindustan Times that two women who claim to be Karim's wife objected to him getting married to a third woman. Karim told police officers who arrested him while on his way to the wedding venue that he was marrying the third woman owing to pressure from his mother.

In an attempt to get ahead of the situation, a Karim being detained by the police instructed his brother Rahim to take his place at the wedding. However, Rahim's arrival at the wedding as a proxy for his brother angered the bride's kin to the extent that they decided to hold him hostage demanding that his family compensate them for expenses incurred by them. A report by the national daily asserted that the bride's kin also held the wedding party accompanying Rahim captive at the venue demanding that the Karim pay a sum of Rs 2 lakh back to them.

An official familiar with the case said that Karim's two wives lived with him and had told police that they have no qualms with the living arrangement. When warned about the legal consequences of him getting married for the third time, Karim who has been living with his two wives for over six years now, agreed to go back to the living arrangement and take care of his two wives.
