It can be noted here that although the rape case has been registered against Aditya Pancholi as of now but the police feels it will be difficult to prove the charges considering the allegations are made on the basis of what happened 10 years back.

Back on June 1, 2019, Aditya Pancholi had approached Mumbai Police fearing a 'fake' rape case by this actress. As per reports, the actor had written to the police saying that the actress' lawyer was asking him to withdraw the defamation case against the actress to avoid a rape case.Â

However, the actress' lawyer, Rizwan Siddiquee, had tweeted on May 17 that Pancholi filed the case only after his client spoke about him on a public platform. ''Pancholi can prove his innocence in court and not by misusing our silence or my misrepresenting facts to the media. The investigation is on by the police, he should have respected that,'' said Siddiquee. He also pointed out that he was making a sincere effort to mediate in the matter, but it failed and ''twisting facts for public sympathy may not help'' Pancholi.
