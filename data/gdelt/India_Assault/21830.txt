Ducsu Vice President Nurul Haque Nur and 14 other people were injured when a section of activists of Muktijuddho Moncho intercepted a protest programme at Dhaka University today.

Bangladesh Sadharan Chhatra Adhikar Sangrakkhan Parishad led by Nur gathered at Raju Memorial Sculpture premises around 4:00 pm to stage demonstration protesting India’s Citizenship Amendment Bill.

At that time, around 15 to 20 activists of Muktijuddho Moncho, a platform comprising offspring of freedom fighters, led by its president Aminul Islam Bulbul and general Secretary Al Mamun asked the protesters not to hold the programme.

As the Parishad activists did not pay heed to them, they locked into an altercation and at one stage, Bulbul started beating Nur and his followers, triggering a clash that left 15 people including Nur injured.

All the injured took primary treatment at Dhaka Medical College Hospital, reports our DU correspondent.

Contacted, Al Mamun, general secretary of Muktijuddho Moncho, said, “We only resisted the group led by Nur when they came to attack us. Citizenship Amendment Bill is an internal issue of India and Ducsu VP has no right to protest over it. Besides he could not clarify his stance on his illegal monetary transactions, that why we resisted him.”

Talking to The Daily Star, Ducsu VP Nurul Haque Nur alleged that a finger of his left hand was broken in the attack and Muktijuddho Moncho activists attacked them for raising voice against Indian aggression.
