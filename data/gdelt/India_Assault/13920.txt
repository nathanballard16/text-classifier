Rape accused Kuldeep Sengar features in Independence Day advertisement

A photograph of Uttar Pradesh MLA and rape accused Kuldeep Sengar was seen in an Independence Day greetings published in a local newspaper.

In the advertisement on Thursday, Sengar's photo appeared alongside Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath in the local edition of a Hindi daily.

The advertisement wishing the local people on Independence Day and Raksha Bandhan was given by the Ugu Panchayat chairman and advocate Anuj Kumar Dikshit. It also carried a photograph of Sengar's wife who is the Zila panchayat chairperson.

As the controversy over Sengar's photograph surrounded the political circles, Dikshit said: "Sengar is an MLA of our area that is why his photo is there. Till the time he is our MLA his photo can be put up. I am not a member of any political party and what they say, does not concern me. I have not mentioned any party in the advertisement."

Sengar had been charged with the rape of a minor girl in 2018 and is presently in Tihar Jail in Delhi.

A Delhi court had framed charges against Sengar in the rape case. He has also been named in the case pertaining to the death of the victim's father. Another case was registered against the former BJP leader after the victim met with a deadly accident last month. He was later expelled from the party.
