New Delhi, July 10

The Cabinet today cleared a Bill providing for death penalty for aggravated sexual assault on children besides setting a minimum sentence of 20 years for penetrative sexual assault on children below 16 years of age.

Aggravated sexual assault has been defined as assault by people in positions of trust like doctors, Army personnel, school principals and shelter homes managers.

The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Amendment Bill, 2019, changes the Act of 2015 to make punishments for sex crimes against children stringent.

The landmark feature of the Bill cleared at the Cabinet meeting chaired by PM Narendra Modi is that it acknowledges the need for capital punishment to penalise the rarest of rare sexual crimes against children besides extending jail terms for a range of sex crimes against them.

Section 9 of the Bill says aggravated sexual assault on children will be punished with not less than 20-year rigorous imprisonment that can extend to the rest of natural life of the convict or death penalty plus fine.

Further, Section 9 of POCSO Act presently protects children displaced due to communal and sectarian violence. The Bill extends this protection to children displaced and orphaned by natural calamities. The addition stems from evidence of children displaced by Kedarnath floods facing sexual crimes.

At present, penetrative sexual assault on children is punishable under Section 5 of the Act with not less than 7-year RI extendable to life imprisonment and fine. The Bill raises minimum punishment to 10-year RI that may be extended to life imprisonment and fine. The Bill also raises punishment for child pornography from “up to five years and fine” to “not less than five years”. — TNS
