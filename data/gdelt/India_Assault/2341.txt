Need new counter-radicalisation steps: CRPF DG at tribute for Pulwama victims

Day after Kashmir was rocked by the most violent terror attack in the state's history, CRPF DG Rajeev Rai Bhatnagar told India Today TV that the forces need counter-radicalisation measures and it will hunt down the terrorists who plotted the Pulwama attack.

"A new dimension was added to terror in Kashmir. An explosive-laden vehicle was used to target a convoy for the first time. To tackle this, new counter measures are being put in place," Bhatnagar told India Today TV at the tributes ceremony in Delhi where the PM and other top leaders of the country laid wreaths on the coffins of slain jawans.

Bhatnagar added, "Police will hunt down the terrorists who plotted this. We need effective counter-radicalisation measures for these new terror methods."

Suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar drove an explosive-laden SUV into a CRPF bus carrying over 40 personnel in Pulwama on Thursday, killing 40 jawans, an unprecedented modus operandi to target security forces convoys.

Jaish-e-Ahmad claimed responsibility for the attack and shared a video of Dar.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Rajeev Rai, Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other top leaders paid tributes to the 40 martyrs at the Palam air force area on Friday.

With his hands folded and head bowed, Prime Minister Narendra Modi walked around 40 coffins draped in tricolour on Friday evening as he led the nation in paying last respects to the CRPF personnel killed in the Pulwama terror attack.

The bodies of the slain troopers reached Delhi's Palam air force area on Friday evening.

Two minutes of silence was observed at the tribute ceremony. Earlier, Home Minister Rajnath Singh shouldered one of the 40 coffins when they were being moved to be handed over to their respective families.
