Students learn to read ancient inscriptions

Government Museum holds one-day training in deciphering Brahmi script

It was another day filled with nice experience for a group of students of DKM College for Women, Sainathapuram, Vellore, on Saturday.

They were part of the one-day “Education Programme on Epigraphy” offered by the Government Museum, Vellore.

Thirty students doing B.A. Tamil Studies (III Year) were keen to learn the art of reading ancient inscriptions on stones and palm leaves.

Appetite for reading

They posed a number of questions on the inscriptions and their antiquity, and showed an appetite for reading inscriptions.

They were taught the process of reading Brahmi inscriptions and taking copies of them on paper as well as in digital format.

Brahmi is the earliest writing system developed in India after the Indus script. It is one of the most influential writing systems. Several hundreds of Brahmi scripts were found in South East and East Asia, according to epigraphists.

A demonstration was conducted for the students during the afternoon session and the learners were allowed to experiment their learning skills later in the day.

All the participants were given certificates.

Tracing the history

“The workshop went well with these young learners and earlier we had similar workshops to students from other colleges too,” said K. Saravanan, Curator, Government Museum, Vellore. He said that the students were given lectures on development of scripts from the days of poet Thiruvalluvar and services of epigraphists from Krishnagiri were sought to teach the nuances of handling these scripts to students once they get practical studies after completing their college level, Mr. Saravanan added.
