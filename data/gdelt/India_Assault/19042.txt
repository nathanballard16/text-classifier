Jalandhar, November 29

More than seven months after the Kerala Police SIT filed a chargesheet against Bishop Franco Mulakkal for allegedly raping a nun, trial in the case will begin in the court of Additional District and Sessions Judge, Kottayam, from Saturday.

Bishop Franco, who was learnt to be in Delhi for the past few days, has left for Kerala. Twenty priests from Jalandhar too have left for Kerala to assist him during the court proceedings. The Bishop was relieved of his administrative duties as head of the Jalandhar diocese by Pope Francis last year.

The chargesheet, filed against him on April 9, runs into over 1,000 pages with statements of 84 witnesses, including that of three Bishops, 11 priests and 24 nuns. The Bishop has been charged under Sections 342 (wrongful confinement), 376 (rape of a woman incapable of giving consent), 376 (causing grievous bodily harm during rape), 376 and 377 (unnatural offence) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The nun had lodged an FIR against the Bishop on June 28, 2018 following which the Kerala police conducted an inquiry that lasted 87 days. The Bishop was interrogated for nine hours on August 14-15 last year. He was called for further interrogation by the Kerala police and arrested on September 28, 2018.

Let off on bail on October 15, he returned to Jalandhar to a grand reception. — TNS
