KPCC to issue second notice to four Congress MLAs

The State Congress has decided to serve another show-cause notice to party MLAs Ramesh Jarkiholi, Umesh Jadhav, Mahesh Kumathalli, and B. Nagendra for failing to present themselves before Congress Legislature Party (CLP) leader Siddaramaiah and provide a proper explanation for their absence from the CLP meeting on January 18.

All four legislators have already replied to an earlier notice but have not met senior leaders. In their replies, they had reportedly expressed loyalty to the party.

To a question at a press conference on Tuesday, Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee president Dinesh Gundu Rao said another notice would be issued to the four MLAs, asking them to present themselves before the CLP leader. “All four will be asked to explain why they were not available, even on the phone,” Mr. Rao said. “They have been skipping all party meetings. All of them have to explain to our CLP leader the reason for their absence during this critical period. If people are not there for one, two or three days, it is okay, but if they disappear for weeks, there is an issue and that issue has to be sorted out,” the KPCC chief said.

The four had remained incommunicado even as the other 77 legislators were holed up at Eagleton resort, on the outskirts of Bengaluru, amid alleged attempts of poaching by the BJP.

During the legislators’ stay at Eagleton resort, Ballari MLAs J.N. Ganesh and Anand Singh had a brawl, with the former allegedly assaulting Mr. Singh. Mr. Ganesh, who is facing attempt to murder charges, is allegedly absconding.

An internal committee of the party headed by Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara, which is probing the reasons for the brawl, called on Mr. Singh at the hospital on Monday. The committee is yet to submit its report to the party.
