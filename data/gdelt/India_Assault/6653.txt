Stray dog menace: Man lands in hospital, RTI activist moves human rights panel

Ludhiana: Two days after a man was seriously injured after he was attacked by stray dogs, a city-based RTI activist on Thursday lodged a complaint with the Punjab Human Rights Commission (PHRC) against the failure of Ludhiana municipal corporation in tackling the menace, which has become a nightmare for residents.

On April 16, Barewal resident Jagraj Singh, 35, had to be hospitalised when stray dogs attacked him and he lost balance while driving a scooter. He fractured both his elbows and received injuries on his knees.

Describing the incident, Jagraj Singh said, “On April 16, I was coming back from my duty, when I saw a group of 7 to 8 stray dogs near new Krishna Mandir in Model Town. Before I could understand anything, the dogs started barking and attacked me. In order to save my life, I picked up speed, but in the process lost control over my scooter and I fell down.”

He said luckily a passerby saw him and he requested him to drop till the hospital, where he worked.

He said civic authorities have failed to tackle the menace of stray dogs.

He said he is the sole bread earner of his family and if something major had happened to him, who would have taken the responsibility.

Meanwhile, RTI activist Arvind Sharma filed a complaint against MC officials in PHRC, saying it has become impossible for city residents to walk or drive freely on roads in view of stray dog attacks. He also gave reference of a recent RTI reply from the civil hospital which had revealed that 7,619 people had become victims of dog bite in the past 15 months. Sharma demanded action against the “careless” officials of the MC for safety of residents.

Senior veterinary officer of MC Dr Y P Singh showed ignorance about any such incident and claimed that MC is doing sterilisation of stray dogs, and it will start showing results in the coming years.
