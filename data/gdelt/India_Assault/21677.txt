Day after high violence, Jamia remains on edge

A day after violent clashes between students and police, the situation remained tense on Monday with over 5,000 protesters coming on Jamia Millia Islamia road and agitating over the attack.

The agitators claimed that the way Delhi police entered the university campus and resorted to lathicharge and tear gas on students in classrooms, lab and toilets is unacceptable.

Second-year BSc student Junaid Ali Khan said: "The situation was such that many students took shelters in toilets and classrooms to save themselves from the police.

On the other hand, police personnel fired tear gas in the bathrooms to evacuate students. Is this the way to identify miscreants?"

Another student Tarik Jamal Mozahid, a resident of Batla House, said: "Implementing CAA in our country is an attack of the Modi-Shah government on the Constitution. We are saving the Constitution through this protest but no one wants to listen to us."

Third-year BCom student Sameera Khan of JMI said: "With such a situation, students like me who live in PG in adjoining Sukhdev Vihar is frightened now. I am avoiding burqa these days every time I visit religious places like Jama Masjid or market places. I just use dupatta to cover my face."

Meanwhile, Delhi police appealed to local residents to avoid rumours and stay calm. Mandeep Singh Randhawa, Delhi police PRO, said: "We have calmly negotiated with protesters and pushed them back from Julena Chowk to Holy Family Hospital and further towards the university campus. At Holy Family Hospital, the protesters pelted police with stones and bottles. We have registered two FIRs so far."
