Bhopal: A 21-year-old girl was hospitalised in Gwalior after she was shot at by her father when she tried to resist his attempt to rape her. The woman is now said to be out of danger. The accused, who was drunk, tried to force himself on the girl when she was asleep.

The accused has retired as subedar from the army. The girl told police that her father barged into her room and tried to rape her. Shocked by her father's behaviour, the girl ran into her mother's room in a bid to save herself.

According to a report in Times of India, the accused took out his licensed gun and fired two shots, the pellets from which hit the girl, after she rebuffed his sexual advances.

Alerted by the gunshots, the victim's mother came out and shouted for help from neighbours, who overpowered him and called the police.

"The Gwalior police have arrested the accused and seized his 12-bore gun," the report quoted Gwalior SP Navneet Bhasin as saying.

In a similar incident in April this year, a man was arrested for allegedly raping his eight-year-old daughter for over two months in Gurugram. The accused reportedly abused his daughter after his wife had died.

According to a report in India Today, the victim's neighbours told police that she was acting abnormally after the incident. The neighbours took her for counselling to regain her confidence and learnt of the shocking things that had befallen her.
