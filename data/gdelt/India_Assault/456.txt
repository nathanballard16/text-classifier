Mumbai: A woman who was cheated of Rs 10,000 by a 36-year-old man at an ATM near Bandra station succeeded in catching the conman by laying a trap for him. She visited the same ATM for around 17 days and waited for him to cross the area.

The woman, Rehana Shaikh (35), deboarded a train at Bandra station to go to her office at Pali Hill on December 18, according to a report. She went to a nearby ATM to withdraw money. However, she was unable to do so due to some technical fault. Bhupendra Mishra, the accused, who was waiting outside the door, offered to help Shaikh. Though she could not withdraw money, Mishra got all the details of Shaikh's debit card.
