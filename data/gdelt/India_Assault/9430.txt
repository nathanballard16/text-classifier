Farmer hacked to death in Lodhika village

RAJKOT: A 35-year-old farmer was hacked to death by some assailants whose numbers and identities could not be ascertained in Devala village of Lodhika taluka in Rajkot district on Friday night.Police said the crime was committed while the deceased, identified as Vipul Sankharwa, was sleeping inside the cabin of his farm.“Sankharwa’s body was found lying in a pool of blood by the farm labourers on Saturday morning. They informed us. The motive of the crime doesn’t appear to have been robbery as all the articles in the cabin as well as cash from the deceased’s pocket remained untouched. It seems to be a case of revenge killing,” said an official from Lodhika police station.“We have sought details of call records of the deceased’s cellphone to zero in on the suspects,” added the official.
