“Rapists must be imprisoned for life, not killed,”

Expressing anguish over the gangrape and murder of a woman veterinary doctor, veteran actor Waheeda Rehman has said rape is a horrific and unforgivable crime, even as she believes the guilty deserve life imprisonment, not death. All four accused in the rape-and-murder of the 25-year-old woman were killed in an encounter with police in Hyderabad last week. The Cyberabad Police had said its personnel resorted to “retaliatory” firing after two of the accused, who were taken to the scene of the crime, opened fire at police after snatching their weapons besides attacking the latter with stones and sticks, resulting in injuries to two policemen.

Asked about the same, Rehman shared with media, “Horrific crimes like rapes are unforgivable. But still, I feel, it’s not in our hands to kill someone. A rapist must be imprisoned for life. Make them rot for lifetime.” The 81-year-old actor said no case should be filed against the accused if they are “caught red-handed”. “If you’re caught red-handed, why should there be a case? You’re wasting public money,” she reasoned.

Rehman was speaking at the launch of musician Roopkumar Rathod’s first book “Wild Voyage” at the opening preview of photography exhibition Meraki.
