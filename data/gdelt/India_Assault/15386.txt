Sengar brought to ‘court’ at AIIMS; Unnao survivor’s statement recorded

NEW DELHI: Amid tight security, sacked BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar and the other accused in the Unnao rape case, were on Wednesday brought to the ‘temporary court’ set up at Delhi’s AIIMS in connection with the deposition of the survivor.Special Judge Dharmesh Sharma presided over the court which recorded the statement of the survivor. The court also started her cross-examination. Judge Sharma had on Saturday ordered the AIIMS management to place a stand with curtains at a designated spot. The accused were asked to remain behind curtains, which prevented them from coming face-to-face with her. The accused and the survivor were at least 75 metres apart, sources said. Only the parties involved in the case and their lawyers were allowed to the proceedings.The court, which is currently recording the statement of the survivor’s uncle, also said summoning the survivor to court might expose her to some medical complications as she could be brought only on a stretcher or a trolley. “And it is but expedient that while under examination there should be available timely medical aid,” it said.
