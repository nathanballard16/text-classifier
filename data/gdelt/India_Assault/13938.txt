The accused, Ajit Vishwakarma (20), a resident of Hirabaug locality in Surat was arrested from his house, where he had sexually assaulted the girl on Thursday, police said.

"On August 15 evening, the accused lured the girl to his house on the pretext of giving a chocolate to her and after she went to his place, he raped her there," inspector of Kapodra police station, M K Gurjar, said.

The girl's mother later came to know about the sexual assault on her daughter and lodged a complaint against Vishwakarma, police said.
