Priest sentenced to 10-year jail term for raping minor girl in Hyderabad

A temple priest from Bowenpally was sentenced to 10-year jail and asked to pay Rs 30,000 fine on Thursday by a court for raping an 11-year-old girl at her residence in 2014.

According to the inquiries revealed by additional public prosecutor Pratap Reddy, Ramji Maharaj who performed Satyanarayana puja at the girl's house at Hasmathpet in Old Bowenpally had approached the family again to perform a Shanti Homam the very next month. After completing the puja, the priest asked the parents to go out to feed the offerings for a cow. Following the instructions, the parents left their child at the priest and went out.

The priest then sexually assaulted the girl in her home. However, the parents noticed the priest leaving their home in a hurry when they returned. Later, the girl told their parents that the priest touched her inappropriately following which they lodged a complaint with the police.
