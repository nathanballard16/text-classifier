The relatives of Indian pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, captured by Pakistan after an air combat, has expressed relief and happiness after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s announcement on Thursday that the pilot would be released on Thursday.

Parents of Abhinandan - Air Marshal (retd) S Varthaman and Dr Shoba – took a flight to New Delhi on Thursday late evening to receive their son who is likely to be brought back via Wagah border in Punjab.

Immediately after the news of Pakistan’s announcement of Abhinandan flashed on the news channels, a large number of people who gathered outside the Jal Vayu Vihar, a gated community, at suburban Madambakkam near Tambaram expressed their happiness by raising slogans and distributing sweets.

Prabhu Gandhi, a relative of Abhinandan told reporters that prayer of Indian people and goodwill of Pakistan PM helped the return of his cousin. “We are very happy to hear the news of his release. The prayer of Indian people and goodwill of Pakistan Prime Minister helped in the return of Abhinandan. I think not only us and Tamil Nadu people, but the whole of India will also be happy hearing the news,” he said.

Abinandan, 38, is married and has a son. His wife is a retired Squadron leader of the IAF.

Earlier in the day, Abhinandan’s father Varthaman, in a statement, said he was proud of his son’s bravery and hoped for his safe return home, as he thanked citizens for their support and good wishes. He said that his son talked (in purported videos circulating on social media) like a “true soldier” despite being in captivity and that he was praying he would not get tortured in the neighbouring country and return home “safe and sound”.
