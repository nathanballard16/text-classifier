Much awaited 3-lane flyover inaugurated in Mayur Vihar

The much awaited three-lane flyover in Mayur Vihar was thrown open to the public by Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday. The newly inaugurated three-lane flyover with one kilometre long is an extension of the Barapullah Phase III flyover is expected to decongest traffic from Noida to Akshardham.

“I congratulate all the staffs and workers of PWD and Larsen and Tourbo (L&T) who put their 100 percent effort to complete this project. Now, travel will be easy and people will save their time. In the past 70 years, no Government has done work and created facilities for the welfare of the people as the present Government did,” said Arvind Kejriwal.

The inauguration was also attended by the Deputy Chief Minister and local MLA Manish Sisodia and Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Satyendar Jain.

Mayur Vihar flyover is the part of Barapullah elevated road corridor under phase III extension from Mayur Vihar to Sarai Kale Khan in Delhi. This three lane flyover was an essential project of Delhi Government which was planned and executed by PWD Delhi. The cost of the project is approximately Rs Rs. 45 crores.

“Commuters will also save time as earlier it took one hour but now the travel between Noida and Akshardam will be just 15-20 minutes. The project was proposed in 2015 and has been constructed and was expected to start in 2017.

But there was so much hurdles from the Opposition and the Lieutenant Governor but then also we faced challenges and completed the project,” said Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia.

The New Flyover will facilitate signal free movement in the area. Further, two loops connect the flyover in the middle part to facilitate the traffic movement for Mayur Vihar. The deck width of flyover is 12 m at the approaches and at the merging part (with loops), the width is 15.5 m.

In order to overcome the bottlenecks caused by traffic coming from NOIDA and Mayur Vihar, will be solved now.
