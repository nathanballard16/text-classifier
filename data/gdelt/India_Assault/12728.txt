A 30-year-old resident doctor of Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital was found dead on Tuesday morning in his room at a rented accommodation in southeast Delhi's Lajpat Nagar area, police said.

The doctor has been identified as Sudhanshu, they said.

"We received the information on Tuesday at around 9 am. Police rushed to the spot where one Rudra Nayak (27), the flatmate of the deceased, said some foul smell was coming from the room of Sudhanshu," Deputy Commissioner of Police (Southeast) Chinmoy Biswal said.

Police broke open the door and found Sudhanshu lying on a mattress with an intravenous drip in his arm, officials said.

The victim was rushed to a hospital, where he was declared brought dead, Mr Biswal said.

According to the police, Sudhanshu and Nayak have been staying at the rented accommodation in Lajpat Nagar since May 2018.

Nayak told police that he had gone to his native place in Panaji, Goa, on July 19 and returned at around 2 am on Tuesday.

"On Tuesday morning at around 8 am, when Nayak woke up, he saw Sudhanshu's room locked from inside and a foul smell emanating from it. He asked the maid about Sudhanshu but she was clueless," Mr Biswal said.

Later, he called police at around 9 am. Police broke open the door and found the body, the DCP said, adding that no suicide note was recovered from the room.

Sudhanshu, a native of Mughalsarai in Uttar Pradesh, was pursuing a post-graduation in Anesthesia from Safdarjung Hospital and Nayak is pursuing PG from LNJP Hospital.

Both Nayak and Sudhanshu's sister Shwetleen, who lives in Gurgaon, said the victim never mentioned any issue that was bothering him. They claimed that he was not depressed, police said.

The post-mortem examination will be conducted on Wednesday, officials said.
