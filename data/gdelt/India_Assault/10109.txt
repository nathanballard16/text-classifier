Pregnancy of rape victim terminated: AIIMS to HC

New Delhi, June 17The All-India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) told the Delhi High Court on Monday that it had terminated the over-22-week pregnancy of a minor rape victim as continuing with it would have had a severe impact on the girl’s physical and mental health. “The submission was made before Justice Najmi Waziri, who, thereafter, disposed of the plea moved on behalf of the rape victim, seeking permission to medically terminate her pregnancy. The HC had, on June 14, asked the AIIMS to set up a medical board to examine whether or not it was necessary to end the pregnancy of the 14-year-old rape victim and to carry out the procedure expeditiously, if required. On Monday, advocate Aldanish Rein, appearing for the AIIMS, told the court about the decision taken by the hospital and submitted its report. Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971, a foetus cannot be aborted if the gestation period is more than 20 weeks.
