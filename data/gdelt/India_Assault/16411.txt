14-yr-old rape survivor delivers stillborn child

Ludhiana: A 14-year-old rape survivor gave birth to a stillborn child at civil hospital on Monday. Her rapist, a 28-year-old father of three, was arrested a day before.

Her rape had come to light on Sunday after her parents learned that she was six-month pregnant.

The minor’s father told the police that the accused first raped his daughter around Holi this year, when he and his wife were not at home. “Thereafter, whenever my daughter was alone at home, the accused, who is our neighbour, would barge in, rape her and threaten her against speaking about the incident,” he added.

As the minor gained weight, her parents took her to a doctor, who told that she was six months pregnant. She was admitted to civil hospital on Sunday night.

Investigating officer inspector Vijay Kumar said, “The accused, a labourer, was arrested late on Sunday night. He has confessed to have raped the minor several times when her daily-wager parents were at work.”
