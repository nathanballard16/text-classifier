Ahmedabad: Wife knocks to get in, man hits her for waking him up

AHMEDABAD: A woman from Thaltej on Monday filed a complaint with city police, alleging that her husband had assaulted her simply because she woke him up when she knocked on the door, to be let in, at 11pm.In her FIR with Vastrapur police, Bhavna Chauhan, 45, a resident of Takshshila Apartments in Thaltej, said she had gone to her parents place in Vadnagar for a few days last week.On Sunday night, she returned home to Thaltej at around 11pm and knocked on the door.Her husband, Ghanshyam Chauhan, 48, didn’t open the door immediately, so she kept knocking. This apparently infuriated him.“He did not open the door but kept blabbering in his sleep from inside. As she shouted at him to open the door, he began abusing her loudly from his bed. As she persisted, as it was biting cold outside, he finally got up and opened the door. He then began hitting her, for disturbing him from his slumber,” states the FIR.When Bhavna resisted, Ghanshyam dared her to do whatever she could. He threatened her and dared her to file a complaint if she had the courage.Some neighbours rescued her from Ghanshyam and took her to a nearby hospital.Bhavna later approached Vastrapur police and filed a complaint for causing hurt, criminal intimidation and verbal abuse against her husband.A Vastrapur police official said they had never come across such a case where a man hit his wife for waking him up.
