UP police handling rape cases with full sensitivity, acting

Amid a spate of rape incidents involving minors reported from Uttar Pradesh recently, the state police Monday said it was dealing with such cases with



"full sensitivity" and "acting promptly".

"There are two factors in these recent incidents. Firstly, they have taken place in rural areas, and secondly, the crime was committed by those who were known to the victims," Uttar Pradesh DGP O P Singh told reporters here.

His remarks come against the backdrop of recent reports of alleged rape of minors in Aligarh, Kushinagar, Hamirpur, Kanpur and Meerut.

"We are dealing with such cases with full sensitivity and acting promptly. We will be fast-tracking these cases," the top cop said.

Singh said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has taken a serious note of such incidents and has called a meeting wherein the issue will be discussed threadbare.

In Aligarh, a toddler was strangulated to death after her father failed to repay a loan of Rs 10,000. The body of the girl was found in a garbage dump, days after she was reported missing.

A 12-year-old girl was dragged from her house and allegedly gang raped in Kushinagar, while a 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a teacher inside a seminary in Kanpur.

In another incident, the naked body of a girl (10) was found in a field in Hamirpur.

In Meerut, a 9-year-old girl was allegedly raped and strangled to death and her body dumped in a sewer. The girl went missing on June 4 and her body was found two days later.
