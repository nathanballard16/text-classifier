Jewellery shop owners torture employee, police rescue him

Salem: Police on Wednesday rescued a 20-year-old man from the clutches of a city-based jewellery shop owners, who held him captive and tortured him for two days for allegedly stealing a gold chain weighing five sovereigns.

According to an investigation officer, A Vignesh, of Thandavan Nagar in Ponnammapet in the city, was employed as a salesman with the Oviya Jewellery shop in Chinna Kadai Veethi area.

Quoting Vignesh, the officer said a colleague had given him a gold chain on Monday, asking him to pledge the same in a private finance company. Vignesh subsequently pledged the gold chain for Rs 87,000.

“When I returned to the jewellery shop, its owners asked me about the gold chain. I narrated the entire episode, but they were not ready to believe me,” Vignesh said.

The shop owners then locked him up in a room and tortured him. When his father Anandhan, 50, came know about this, he went to the city police commissioner’s office on Tuesday evening and sought help to rescue his son. In the petition, Anandhan said Oviya jewellery shop owners were keeping Vignesh in illegal confinement and thrashing him. “They suspect my son to have stolen the gold chain from the shop.”

The city police commissioner formed a special team led by deputy commissioner P Thangadurai, who rescued Vignesh on Wednesday early morning from the shop. “There are injury marks in his body. We have sent him to the Salem Government Mohan Kumaramangalam Medical College and Hospital,” the officer said.
