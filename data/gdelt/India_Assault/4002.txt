NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said that the AK-203 rifles to be manufactured in the newly-launched Kalashnikov rifles unit in Uttar Pradesh's Amethi will give an edge to our troops in their fight against terrorists and Maoists.Addressing a large gathering in Amethi on Sunday, the parliamentary constituency of Congress president Rahul Gandhi , Modi said that AK-203, one of world's most modern guns, will be made in the Korwa Ordnance Factory in a joint venture between India and Russia.Expressing gratitude to his "friend" Russian President Vladimir Putin , Modi said the venture was made possible in such a short span of time due to his support.Taking on Gandhi on his home turf, Modi said that the Congress chief had laid the foundation stone of the factory back in 2007 and said that work will begin in 2010, but the then government could not decide what kind of weapon will be built at the unit."Some people have the habit of forgetting the public after getting votes. They want to keep the poor in poverty so they can say 'gareebi hatao' generation after generation. We are giving strength to the poor to bring them out of poverty," the Prime Minister said."In future, Amethi will not be known by the leaders who come here, but by the developmental projects undertaken here," he added.The 7.62x39 mm caliber AK-203 guns are the latest derivative of the legendary AK-47 rifle. India has signed a deal with a Russian firm to manufacture 750,000 of these assault rifles which would be given to the Army's infantry troops.According to officials, the guns would replace the existing India-made INSAS assault rifles in the Army, Air Force and Navy.(With inputs from agencies)
