Fawad Chaudhry responding to these celebraties and said that majority of them haven’t even finished their school, they lack knowledge of very basic issues. He added that wars are not a joke it’s a serious a business and the jokers should not talk about it who became celebrities by stroke of luck.

Earlier on Friday, Pakistan released captured Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman as a “gesture of peace” towards New Delhi and an effort to de-escalate tensions between the two countries.

Wing Commander Abhinandan was captured when his MiG-21 among two Indian military aircraft was shot down by Pakistan Air Force after they ventured into the Pakistani airspace.
