Hyderabad (Telangana) [India], Nov 29 (ANI): Women activist and doctors from the city have demanded strictest action against the murder of a veterinary doctor who was burnt to death after suspected sexual assault.



On Thursday, the burnt body of the doctor was found at Shadnagar outskirts in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district.

Women rights activist Vara Laxmi also called for increased security measures to avoid such incidents and demanded the culprits to be brought to justice.

"We are very shocked to hear about the doctor. This shows the absence of strict vigilance. The lorry, road transport should be given more supervision.

As per the preliminary probe, the police suspect that the doctor was sexually assaulted.

A case has been registered under relevant sections and further probe into the matter is underway.

"We received a complaint in Shamshabad Rural Police Station from her sister.
