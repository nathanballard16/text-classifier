Indian woman set on fire while heading to testify against accused rapists

An Indian woman was fighting for life Thursday after being set on fire as she headed to testify against two men she accused of raping her, according to reports.

The unidentified 23-year-old woman was beaten up, stabbed, and suffered burns over 90 percent of her body when she was set on fire in Unnao while on her way to court, according to India Today.

She had to walk more than half a mile to get help — and was still partially ablaze when she found local villagers, according to the report.

Five men had attacked her, she told police — including the two men out on bail for the alleged rape whom she was due to give evidence against in court that day, the outlet said.

“She has sustained 90% burn injuries all over her body,” a doctor told the Times of India.

“The next 48 to 72 hours are critical for the survivor as she has to be saved from a state of shock.”

Police arrested five men for the attack Thursday, including the two who were accused of her alleged rape in March, the reports said.

One of the men tricked her into thinking he was going to propose marriage, just to rape her with one of his friends, the Times of India said, citing local police.
