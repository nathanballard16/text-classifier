Rape: Factory worker held, jobless youth, 18, booked

Ludhiana: Two rape cases were reported in the city on Tuesday.

In the first case, a 28-year-old woman accused her neighbour of raping her after threatening to kill her daughter.

She said in her police complaint, “The accused, a factory worker, barged into my house on Tuesday afternoon. I was alone at home with my two-year-old daughter. Hanging my daughter from a ceiling fan, he threatened to kill her if I did not give in to his demands. He then sexually assaulted me and escaped.” When her husband reached home, she apprised him of the incident. They then approached the police.

Investigating officer ASI Sadhu Singh said, “A manhunt has been launched to nab the accused, who has been booked under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.”

The other case, too, involves a neighbour wherein a minor has lodged a case against an 18-year-old.

In her police complaint, the 16-year-old said, “The accused, who lives near my house and is a friend, took me along on the pretext of marriage on August 20. At a rented accommodation, he raped me and threatened me of dire consequences if I spoke about the incident. He then dropped me home.”

On Tuesday, the girl mustered courage and told her parents about it.

Investigating officer ASI Sukhwinder Singh said the accused, who was unemployed and at large, has been booked under sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC and the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act.
