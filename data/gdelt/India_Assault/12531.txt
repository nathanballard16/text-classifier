Unnao gang rape survivor’s uncle seeks CBI probe into road accident

The uncle of the Unnao alleged gang rape survivor on Monday requested the Uttar Pradesh government to transfer the case of the Rae Bareli accident, in which two of his relatives died, to the CBI.

An FIR was being registered on a complaint of the uncle, who is lodged in the Rae Bareli jail, said ADG Lucknow, Rajeev Krishna.

The CBI is already probing the gang rape case and ‘custodial death’ of the survivor's father.

BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, now jailed, is the main accused in the entire case.

Mr. Krishna told reporters that the police were awaiting the government's report on the request to transfer the accident case to the CBI. “As soon as that report comes it’ll be recommended to the CBI,” he said.

One of the two deceased persons, the aunt of the survivor, was a CBI witness in the Unnao case, he noted.
