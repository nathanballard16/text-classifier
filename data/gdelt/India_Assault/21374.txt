A Delhi Fire Services official said four fire tenders were rushed to the spot.

One fire tender was completely damaged and two personnel were injured in the violence by the protesters.

A Jamia Millia Islamia students' group said they had nothing to do with the arson and violence. They alleged that "local elements" joined the protest and "disrupted" it.

They said they returned to campus as the protest turned violent and were protesting on the campus peacefully.

Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that no one should indulge in violence.

Some of the protesters claimed that the police baton charged them when they were holding a peaceful agitation.
