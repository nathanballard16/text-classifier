Bhopal: In a shocking and ghastly incident, a ten-year-old girl in a Madhya Pradesh village was raped and then strangulated to death. Her body was later dumped in an abandoned biogas tank, police said on Sunday.

Though the horrific incident took place in the village of Bariha in Katni district on February 28, it came to light late on Saturday night when a local spotted the body in the biogas tank.

“A local farmer spotted the legs of the victim protruding from the abandoned biogas tank in the village,” a senior district police officer said.

According to him, the girl was last seen being accompanied by her uncle, her neighbour, in the afternoon of February 28.
