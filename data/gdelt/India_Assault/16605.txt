3 Men Kidnapped And Raped 17-Year-Old Girl Days After She Was Raped By A Politician In India

3 Indian men have been charged with gang-raping a 17-year-old girl days after she was reportedly raped by a party leader in India.

The CBI (Central Bureau of Investigation) has named Naresh Tiwari, Brijesh Yadav Singh and Shubham Singh for raping the 17-year-old girl.

According to the CBI, the 17-year-old girl was raped on June 11, 2017, after she was raped on June 4 by Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a member and a politician of the Bharatiya Janata Party.

The politician who raped the 17-year-old girl is currently in prison and is awaiting trial.

Naresh Tiwari, Brijesh Yadav Singh and Shubham Singh, the three rapists, are out on bail.

The three men are facing kidnapping and raping the 17-year-old girl.

The father of the victim was also assaulted and framed with illegal possession of firearms after the politician was accused of rape.

On April 9, 2018, the father of the girl passed away, just a day after the victim committed suicide when she was in the hospital.

Also in April 2018, the girl tried to set herself on fire outside the house of Yogi Dityanath, a politician in Uttar Pradesh.

Earlier this year, the girl, who is now 19-years-old, got involved in a car crash.

A lorry truck struck the vehicle she was traveling in on a highway in Uttar Pradesh on the 28 of June this year.

The girl and her family claim the accident was planned by the government to stop the rape case from going into trial.

Her lawyer was critically ill and her 2 relatives were dead.

The mother of the girl said, “It was not an accident but a conspiracy to eliminate all of us. The son of a co-accused in the case, Shahi Singh, and another youth of the village had threatened us. They said that they will deal with us.”

The girl was traveling with her lawyer and 2 aunts when the accident happened.
