‘AAP govt. fulfilled half per cent of poll promise’

BJP slams Delhi govt. for praising itself

The BJP on Tuesday attacked Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal for “praising himself” over the induction of 25 buses under the cluster scheme.

Reacting to the launch of 25 new cluster buses, , Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi Assembly Vijender Gupta “congratulated” Mr. Kejriwal for “at last fulfilling half per cent of his party’s promise” made in its 2015 election manifesto.

“At least 5,000 new buses were to be inducted during the period of five years... achieving half per cent of the target is a ‘great achievement’ for the Delhi government,” Mr. Gupta said.

Massive propaganda

“Though the government has been able to press into service only 25 buses, it is falsely boasting of launching 1,000 buses through massive propaganda. Moreover, these are not DTC buses but privately owned cluster buses,” Mr. Gupta argued.

Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari Kejriwal alleged that the AAP government had issued advertisements at the cost of the public exchequer for praising itself on the launch of new buses.

Criticising the move, Mr. Tiwari alleged that the AAP government was “misleading the people of Delhi by issuing advertisements for 1,000 buses” even as he reiterated the BJP’s promise of increasing the number of State-run buses after coming to power post the upcoming Assembly elections.

“Only 3,000 buses are left in the fleet of DTC. There is need of 20,000 new buses to make the services reliable in Delhi...The number of buses in Delhi is very negligible and announcement of free rides is a fraud,” Mr. Tiwari alleged.
