A rape case turns into a political firestorm in India

KOLKATA: A young woman who accused a prominent Indian politician of rape had received dozens of death threats against her and her family.

This week, a truck smashed into her car head on, killing her two aunts and leaving her in critical condition.

Her family and women’s rights advocates say that the man accused of rape, Kuldeep Singh Sengar – a state-level politician and member of India’s governing party – is trying to kill his accuser, and that the crash was a deliberate attempt on her life.

The saga has become a test case for the abuse of power, prompting walkouts in Parliament and a homicide investigation.

“This girl made 33 complaints in the past one year to authorities, but no action was taken against anybody,’’ said the head of the Delhi Commission for Women.

“In our country, a girl is raped by a man once and then the entire system is raping her.”
