Another Hindu girl has reportedly been kidnapped in Pakistan after a spate of alleged abductions, forced marriages and conversions to Islam in the country in recent weeks. This case would bring the total number to seven.

The latest incident involved 16-year-old Male Kumari Meghwar, who was kidnapped. An unnamed local Hindu leader told the Times of India that local police had refused to launch an investigation into the incident.

According to the complaint filed by the girl's father, on the night she was taken, four men broke into her home at roughly 3am local time and dragged her outside to a waiting vehicle and sped off into the night.

“The girls appeared before Islamabad High Court on Tuesday morning,” Farrukh Ali, a police official in their home district of Gothki, said. “The court has directed the deputy commissioner to take their custody.”

Some 10 people, including the cleric who officiated the wedding, have been detained in connection with the case of alleged kidnapping and robbery.
