He also announced that his government will give a financial assistance of Rs 10 lakh to the family and will arrange the best lawyer to bring the culprit to book.



After meeting the victim, Kejriwal said, "I met the little girl. I also met the doctors treating her. They said that her condition was serious when she arrived at the hospital. However, she is now stable after her operation and other treatments. There is nothing to worry; the doctors are taking good care of her. I also met her father, he is daily wage worker. I have promised her father of all kind of support."

Kejriwal also said that he was shaken by the plight of the victim. He said, "I am shaken after seeing plight of the minor rape victim. If children are not safe even in the national capital, we should all hang our heads in shame. CCTV cameras helped in nabbing the accused. We are installing cameras across Delhi. We are also ready to cooperate with the Centre to make Delhi safe."

He further added, "We want to make this an example by getting the culprit the harshest punishment so that no one dares to commit such monstrous acts in future. Several such incidents are being reported in Delhi."
