Speaking about the role of the police, the NCW chairperson said, "My Committee members went to meet the family of the victim in the morning. They categorically said the role of the police was very negative."

Sharma said, "They (police) did not listen to the family and they were making fun of them. The police were saying she must have eloped and after that, they were fighting on the jurisdiction that under whose jurisdiction it comes in and that is how the delay happened."

"The two and a half-hour delay was most crucial as they could have saved a life," she added.

The burnt body of the veterinary doctor was found at Shadnagar outskirts in Telangana's Ranga Reddy district on Thursday.
