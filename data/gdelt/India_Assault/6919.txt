Indian woman awarded £50,000 compensation over Gujarat gang rape after 17-year legal battle

A landmark ruling has granted a woman who was gang-raped and left for dead during the 2002 Gujarat riots five million rupees (£55,300) in compensation.

Bilkis Yakoob Rasool Bano, 36, is the first woman to receive direct financial redress from India’s Supreme Court for crimes committed during the riots.

The sum comes after a 17-year legal fight during which Ms Bano received death threats for trying to bring her attackers to justice. The court also ruled that Gujarati authorities must offer Ms Bano a government job and a house in the area of her choice.

The riots were sparked when a train carrying Hindu pilgrims was set on fire, resulting in 58 deaths. In the three days that followed, a spate of violent revenge attacks were carried out against the state’s minority Muslim population.

Around 1,900 people died, according to The Concerned Citizens Tribunal Report.

Like many Muslims, Ms Bano and her family attempted to flee the violence.

However, the truck they were traveling in was stopped by around 30 rioters near the city of Ahmedabad.
