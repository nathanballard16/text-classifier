Aditya Pancholi booked for rape by Mumbai Police

Actor and producer Aditya Pancholi has been booked for rape by the Mumbai Police. Mumbai Police filed an FIR (First Information Report) against the Bollywood actor-producer based on the complaint of an actress at the Versova Police Station.

Versova Police Station has registered a case vide CR no 198/2019 U/s 376, 328, 384, 341, 342, 323, 506 IPC.

The police, however, said that it would be difficult to prove the case and gather evidence since the case is almost 10 years old. An FIR has been registered and investigations have started.

In her complaint, the actress said that she was raped on several occasions by Aditya Pancholi. She said she was in a forced relationship with Aditya Pancholi and that he used to harass her sexually as well as mentally.

Earlier, the actress had filed a written complaint against Pancholi.

The actress has, in the past, gone on record to say that Aditya Pancholi abused her when she was 17 years old. The actress had said that she went to the police when she was abused, but Aditya was apparently let off with just a warning.

Aditya Pancholi's last major role in a Bollywood film was in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Bajirao Mastani in 2015.
