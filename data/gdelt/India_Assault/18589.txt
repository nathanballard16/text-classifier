Two lions captured by cameras near Chotila

RAJKOT: The possibilities of a lion pride finding a permanent home in a sprawling grassland near temple town Chotila grew stronger with forest department trackers spotting two more sub-adult lions early on Wednesday.The lions were captured in the cameras set up by the forest department on the outskirts of Rampara Chobari village, which is barely 2 km from Dhedhuki where a lioness and a sub-adult cub were seen on Tuesday. The lioness and cub have been spotted in many villages in the 25-30 km periphery of Chotila in Surendranagar district.Forest officials are now assessing the number of lions that are present in this area. A team of lion trackers from Sasan has joined the 60-member forest team to keep a track on the felines in various villages.Chief conservator of forest, Junagadh , SK Srivastava said, “We are not certain but it’s possible that there could be more than two lions moving in this area. What’s captured in camera is an evidence that these are two males. The staff which sighted the lions earlier are equally confident that one of them was female.”However, the forest department is awaiting scientific evidence to confirm that there are four or three lions including one female moving in these areas. The officials confirmed that the pug marks found in Hingolgadh were that of a lioness. Hingolgadh falls on the route from where it’s believed lions have travelled to here from Babra in Amreli district.Cameras have been set up on the locations where the herbivorous have been hunted.Deputy conservator of forest, Morbi, Sandeep Kumar said, “We are trying ascertain whether the lions captured in the camera on Wednesday and those spotted on Tuesday are from the same pride or some other group. It is possible that the sub-adult captured in the camera is the same which was sighted earlier, so only scientific evidence can give us the confirmation.”The forest officials on Tuesday had sighted a female and a sub-adult in the torch light, however the pug marks indicate that one female is also moving in this area.On Wednesday, forest team held meetings with villagers and sensitized them on co-existence with lions. According to forest department, the villagers are excited with the lion presence in their area, but are equally scared.
