Hyderabad veterinary doctor raped and killed: Villager spotted burning body

HYDERABAD: For S Satyam, it is an every day affair to see people light small fires to keep warm early in the morning when he walks to an agriculture field at Chatanpally to get milk.But he stopped dead in his tracks on seeing a fire at the underpass of NH-44 on Thursday. Something in the flames looked like an arm. Sathyam walked closer and his fear turned out to be true: There lay a body almost entirely consumed by fire."We recovered only a scarf and the buckle of a belt or handbag from the scene of offence. Even the scarf, which was recovered almost 10 metres from the location of the burnt body seemed to have been discarded by the accused,'' Cyberabad police said. On either sides of the underpass are extremely narrow gravel roads used by locals to get on to NH-44.Around 6 pm, Cyberabad police recovered the girl's identify proof, footwear, undergarments and a few other items from the isolated spot at Thondapalli toll plaza.
