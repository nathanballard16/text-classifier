At around 3.30 am, Shah and his son Rajiv reached the police station and allegedly tried to put pressure on police personnel to release Mehta, who was later placed under arrest, he said.

Mehta has been charged with assaulting police personnel, police had said.

The father-son duo applied for anticipatory bail and court has given them interim protection from arrest till December 3.
