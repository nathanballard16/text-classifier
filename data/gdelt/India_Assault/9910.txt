New Delhi: Amid country-wide protests by doctors in solidarity with the striking doctors of West Bengal, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday wrote to all chief ministers urging them to take strict action against any person who assaults doctors. He also asked them to consider enacting laws for protecting doctors from violence.

Reports suggest that the Union minister sent a copy of the draft act provided by Indian Medical Association - the Protection of Medical Service Persons and Medical Service Institutions (Prevention of Violence and Damage or Loss of Property) Act, 2017 along with the letter to provide some ideas regarding the laws.

On Friday, Harsh Vardhan had demanded that a law be passed that makes any attack on doctors a non-bailable offence with minimum 12-year jail. "Draconian Clinical Establishment Act that treats docs as criminals must be withdrawn," he said.

This has come amid a standoff between junior doctors and state government in West Bengal. In solidarity, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) has also announced a four-day nationwide protest, starting Friday, and a strike on June 17 with the withdrawal of non-essential health services.

In West Bengal, more than 300 doctors have resigned from the government hospitals. The doctors' body has also rejected Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee offered to talk at Nabanna, the state secretariat, demanding an "unconditional apology" first for her remarks against the agitation and action against those who assaulted their colleague.

Earlier Harsh Vardhan had slammed CM Mamata Banerjee for failing to resolve the issue. "Instead of taking action against the attackers, she gave the doctors an ultimatum, warned and threatened them because of which doctors of West Bengal and across the country are angry," Harsh Vardhan said.
