Delhi: No arrest yet in murder of 25-year-old doctor

Two days after a 25-year-old doctor was found dead with her throat slit at her rented room in Central Delhi, police are yet to make any arrests. Apart from the third flatmate, Khurana too claimed that he’s been giving inputs to the police about Verma. On Wednesday morning, he left for his relative’s house in Delhi,” said landlord Gautam Khurana (28). AdvertisingWhen her body was discovered, the third flatmate was in his room, and was detained for a few hours by police. The prime suspect in the murder of Garima Mishra — her flatmate and former colleague at a government hospital in Karol Bagh, Chandra Prakash Verma (30) — is still missing.
