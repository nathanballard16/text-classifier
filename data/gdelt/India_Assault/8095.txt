'At least they won't rape me now that I am burnt': Rape survivor's tragic story will make you question humanity

The woman is now admitted to a Ghaziabad hospital with 80 per cent burn injuries.

A widow in Muradabad set herself on fire last month after she was gang-raped and sold for Rs 10,000 by her parents and later allegedly turned away by Hapur Police. With more than 80 per cent burns, the victim is struggling for life at a hospital in Delhi.

The victim has been identified as a resident of a village under Babugarh police jurisdiction in Hapur. She was allegedly gang-raped in 2016.

Disgruntled after Babugarh Police allegedly refused to pay heed to her complaints, the woman shifted to Muraradabad city out of shame, and set her ablaze last month, the police said.

The woman is now admitted to a Ghaziabad hospital with 80 per cent burn injuries.

The victim told a leading daily: "I wish I was dead. Nobody wants to go through this torture. But at least people will not rape me now that I am burnt."
