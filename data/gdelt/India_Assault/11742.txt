High Court orders protection for MLA’s daughter

High drama on the High Court’s premises in Allahabad

The Allahabad High Court was at the centre of high drama on Monday after an unidentified couple were allegedly ‘abducted’ from outside its premises just hours before it was to hear the case of BJP MLA Rajesh Mishra’s daughter seeking police protection from her father for marrying a Dalit against his wishes.

Meanwhile, the HC granted police protection to Mr. Mishra’s daughter Sakshi Mishra and her husband Ajitesh, who had last week created a sensation after alleging their lives were under threat from her legislator father over their inter-caste marriage.

The court directed the police and the administration to ensure that the family of the woman “shall not interfere in the married lives” of the couple. The police should see that “counsel for the petitioners and also the family members of the petitioners are not brought to any harm in any manner whatsoever”, a Bench of Justice Siddhartha Varma said in his order.

The court also directed Ms. Mishra and Mr. Ajitesh to get their marriage registered under the U.P. Marriage Registration Rules, 2017 within two weeks.

There were also reports that while appearing in court, Mr. Ajitesh was roughed up by unknown persons. However, there was no police confirmation.

Much of the attention, however, was drawn by the unidentified couple who were allegedly abducted from outside the HC in a black SUV bearing the tag ‘chairman’ on its rear wind shield. The couple turned out to be a Muslim youth and a Muslim minor girl from Moradabad and Amroha district.
