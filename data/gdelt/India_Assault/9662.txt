Doctors In Kolkata Go On Strike After Colleagues Attacked By Violent Mob Of Patient’s Relatives

Medical staff at Nil Ratan Sircar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata were violently attacked on Monday (9 June) by family members of a 75-year-old patient, Mohammed Shahid, who had died while admitted there, reports Business Standard.

The relatives of the deceased accused the junior doctors and interns at the hospital of negligence which led to the death. They also said that there had been a delay in handing over his body to them.

The family members called more people to back them up from their neighbourhood, and the group is accused of throwing bricks and stones at the hospital staff. The situation was brought in control once policemen lathicharged the angry mob.

One of the interns who was a victim of the assault is said to be in a critical condition. Doctors conducted a sit-in at the hospital to protest the incident and have refused to return to work without better security.

Other doctors from around Kolkata have also expressed support for their colleagues at the hospital and a number of sit-ins by them have also been held over the incident.

The government is trying to calm the situation down and is trying to get the doctors to withdraw their strike but early attempt at reconciliation have failed.
