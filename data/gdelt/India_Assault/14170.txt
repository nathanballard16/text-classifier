Former Indian Minister on the Run After Evading Arrest in Corruption, Money Laundering Cases

Two Indian investigative agencies – the Central Bureau of Investigation and the economic intelligence agency - Enforcement Directorate, had sought to take Chidambaram into custody for questioning on Tuesday. Since they weren't able to find him, the investigative agencies posted a notice outside his home.

Chidambaram is facing charges for allegedly facilitating foreign investment in a media company while he was Finance Minister in the former Congress Party-lead coalition government, when he provided his son with financial favours.

The former cabinet minister had approached the High Court of Delhi for anticipatory bail, but the court rejected his plea, saying “the petitioner is the kingpin or key conspirator in the case,” leaving it open for the investigative agencies to take him into custody.
