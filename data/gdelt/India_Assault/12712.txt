UDF to broad-base stir against Centre, State

Four-day ‘public trial’ against ‘misrule’ from Aug. 19

The United Democratic Front (UDF) has decided to launch broad-based agitations in the coming days by organising a four-day ‘public trial’ from August 19 to 22 against the misrule of the Central and State governments. The trial will be led by UDF chairpersons and conveners of various districts.

Announcing the details of the programme, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala and UDF convener Benny Behanan said here on Tuesday that district UDF committees will meet on August 3 to discuss ways to make the programme a major movement. Mr. Chennithala expressed serious concern at the State government’s decision to impose a flood cess, which has come on top of a steep hike in petrol and diesel prices, triggering a price rise and making life miserable for the people.

Police raj

He said a ‘police raj’ was in force in the State, which has witnessed eight custodial deaths and 32 murders. The State government has virtually set loose the police force. In crucial issues, the State government’s approach to various cases, including the Nedumkandam custodial death case or the university-Public Service Commission probe, were intended to let the accused off the hook.

Custody deaths were on the rise because of the protection given by the State administration to erring police officers. In the case of the university answer sheet and PSC controversy, the Chief Minister had ordered an end to the investigation.

The UDF stands by its demand for a CBI probe into the answer sheet case and the PSC recruitment case.

Flays CPI

In a resolution, the UDF came down heavily on the Communist Party of India and its State secretary Kanam Rajendran for their silence on the police assault on party workers in Kochi the other day.

“The CPI is savouring the taste of power and, therefore, is unable to react to police high-handedness,” the resolution said.
