Jafrabad and Seelampur are both situated within national capital region. Both the cities were major flashpoints of violence soon after the incident at Jamia Millia Islamia University in New Delhi.

On December 17, angry protesters demanding scrapping of the amended citizenship law clashed with police, pelted stones at them and damaged several buses in Northeast Delhi's Seelampur area.

Police resorted to baton charges and fired tear gas shells on the protesters who were marching from Seelampur towards Jafrabad. Clashes erupted between police and protesters at Seelampur Chowk when the security personnel tried to stop them from moving ahead. The protests had begun at around 12 pm. The protesters had raised slogans against the new law as well as the National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The clashes erupted two days after violence broke out in the New Friends area in South Delhi.
