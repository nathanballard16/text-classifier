Narendra Modi: Ticket to Pragya a 'symbol' to answer those who demean great civilisation: PM Narendra Modi

PM Narendra Modi defends BJP's decision to field Sadhvi Pragya from Bhopal

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday defended BJP's decision to field Malegaon blast accused Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat."A civilisation, a tradition that has promoted the idea of 'Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam' (the world is one family) for the last 5,000 years was branded as terrorists by some. Sadhvi Pragya's candidature from Bhopal is a symbol to answer all those who did this and this symbol will prove costly to the Congress," PM Modi said in an interview to TimesNow."One woman, that too a saint, was subjected to such heinous torture," the PM added.He referred to the Samjhauta case judgment to accuse that people have been punished without any evidence.The Prime Minister cited the 1984 riots to say that the Congress, which rewarded those who had been accused of complicity in the killing of thousands of Sikhs, had no moral right to preach."The Congress leaders who have been accused of terror in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots were made MPs, they were appointed cabinet ministers at Centre and one of them was even made the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh," the PM said.Slamming those who were raising questions on the fact that Sadhvi Pragya was out on bail, PM Modi said why are questions not being raised against Congress candidates from Amethi and Rae Bareli who are also out on bail."If Amethi and Rae Bareli candidates are on bail, there is no discussion around that. But if Bhopal's candidate is out on bail, they are creating a storm. How can this happen?" he said.PM Modi slammed the Congress for creating false narratives and spreading lies."I come from Gujarat. I know the modus operandi of the Congress, how it weaves a web of lies just like the script of a movie. There are a lot of examples. It was this modus operandi of the Congress that tried to portray the natural death of Justice Loya as a murder case," the PM said.Referring to RJD leader Lalu Prasad, who has been jailed in fodder scam cases and is currently lodged in a hospital in Ranchi, the PM said: “Those who have been convicted by the courts, people go and hug them, meet them in jail, meet them when they are shifted to hospitals. Can they preach?”
