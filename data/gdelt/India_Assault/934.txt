Parties, rights groups seekjustice for rape victim’s kin

Angul: The alleged rape and murder of a 12-year-old girl has sparked a public outcry in Angul district with various human rights organisations and political workers demanding justice for the victim’s family.Though the minor girl was raped and murdered in broad daylight at a village, police have failed to nab the culprit, who is a resident of same locality, said a villager.The BJP, the Congress, the Socialist Unity Centre of India and several other organizations held demonstrations and took out rallies on Monday, demanding action against the culprit.The ghastly crime was committed at a secluded place under Angul police station at 2pm on Sunday. The body was found near a bush close to a nullah after her family members and villagers launched a search.The deceased was going to give her father food, who has a shop one km away from his home in the village. The accused, seeing her alone, took her to a secluded place. It is suspected he raped and brutally murdered her, police said. After murdering her, the accused fled the scene.The accused, a 23-year-old youth, allegedly stoned her to death, police said.Narasingha Bhola, DIG, north-central range, told TOI, “We have formed seven police teams, out of which five teams have been conducting raids outside the district while two teams are searching the accused in Angul district.”The DIG added, “We are awaiting the autopsy report. It is a clear case of murder. But we can’t say about rape. It could have been an attempt to rape during which the accused murdered her in order to cover up the matter. After the postmortem report comes we can tell clearly whether the girl was raped.”Meanwhile, several political parties held dharna and demonstrations, demanding immediate arrest of the accused. While BJP workers staged a road blockade at the girl’s village, Congress workers submitted a memorandum to chief minister through Angul district SP for stringent action against the culprit.
