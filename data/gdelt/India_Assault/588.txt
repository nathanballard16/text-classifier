New Delhi: Two men were allegedly abducted near Press Enclave Road in Delhi on January 8 and confined in a room where they were beaten up with sticks and belts for two days. A case has been registered against the accused at Malviya Nagar police station and the police is trying to nab the culprits.

The men had borrowed Rs 30,000 from the accused about four-five years ago, according to a report in The Indian Express. Even after having paid the principal amount with interest, the accused kept on demanding more money from them.

They were taken to a room, kicked and beaten up with sticks and belts. They were dropped off in an isolated area at around 11 pm on January 10 from where they managed to return home.

A police official said that no arrests have been made so far and they are trying to catch the accused.
