Modi wants to destroy secular Kerala: Kodiyeri

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The mysterious Hindutva agenda in the mind of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been exposed by his continuous assault on Kerala , alleged CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan “Modi and Sangh Parivar want to destroy secular Kerala which is ruled by the LDF. They purposely resort to speeches and campaigns nationwide to create an air conducive to that mysterious agenda,” he said in a statement issued here.Balakrishnan was referring to Modi’s speech in Varanasi on Friday when he claimed that BJP workers in Kerala was conducting political work in life-threatening situations. “His statements on the safety of BJP workers in Kerala were huge lies. It is a blemish to the office of the Prime Minister that its occupant is lying and issuing fake statements unashamedly,” he said.Balakrishnan said the election process peacefully concluded in Kerala and there is not a single case of BJP worker getting attacked on polling day. “Even the election commission congratulated the state for the peaceful conduct of polls. By telling lies like this, Modi has stooped to the level of an RSS pracharak”, he added.“The same Modi had earlier compared Kerala to Somalia. Later, he had also said that people who chanted Lord Ayyappa’s names were arrested here. No honest and decent leader will lie like this. The only provocation is the effective alternative the LDF has posed against Hindutva forces,” said CPM state secretary.According to Balakrishnan, RSS had been the nerve centre of political violence in state and 235 CPM workers were killed in Kerala. Among the victims were an 8-yeard old and a 63-year old woman. “The leader of a party which had led such a heinous, violent act is now preaching peace and trying to taint Kerala,” he said. Kodiyeri asked Modi to respond on the widespread political violence and booth capturing in Tripura and other north Indian states where BJP is the dominant force.
