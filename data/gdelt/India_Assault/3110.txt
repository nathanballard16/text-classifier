Baseless allegations, shocking how Congress can do politics at this time: Rajnath Singh on chai-samosa jibe

Rajnath Singh slammed Congress for targeting PM Narendra Modi over Pulwama terror attack and called it "shameful and baseless".

Union minister Rajnath Singh said the Congress is "playing dirty politics" over Pulwama terror attack where 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

Rajnath Singh slammed Congress for targeting Prime Minister Narendra Modi over Pulwama terror attack and called it "shameful and baseless".

On Thursday, the Congress, citing media reports, claimed that Prime Minister Modi continued shooting for a film in the Corbett National Park for his "propaganda and publicity" in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls on the February 14 when Pulwama terror attack took place.

Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala claimed that the prime minister continued to "have tea, samosas, at seven o'clock in a PWD guest house" that evening.

Rajnath Singh, reacting to Congress' chai-samosa remark, said it is "shocking" how the Opposition "can play politics" at this time.

""Politics should not be done on the brave soldiers who were martyred in the Pulwama terror attack. It is shocking how they (Congress) can play politics at a time like this," Singh told India Today TV.

Earlier, BJP president Amit Shah said it was condemnable that the Congress has "politicised" the Pulwama attack and the people have full trust in Modi's commitment of ending terrorism.
