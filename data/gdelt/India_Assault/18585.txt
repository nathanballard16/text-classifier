Bengaluru: A Bengaluru court has sentenced a 70-year-old man to just three years in jail and a fine of Rs 1,000 for raping a child.

The accused raped the seven-year-old child in September 2017. The convict identified as Rajanna alias Rajkumar was known to the girl.

According to a report, the convict violated the girl when she was alone at her home. Rajkumar, a resident of Vijayanagar, lured the victim by promising her chocolates if she would accompany him.

The victim's father is a daily-wage labourer and her mother works as household help.

According to prosecution, Rajanna took the victim to an isolated place and raped her. "Evidence including forensic reports and the girl's statement proved crucial in the conviction of the accused," the report quoted a police officer as saying.

In a similar incident in July this year, a 70-year-old man attempted to rape a mentally-unstable minor girl in Andhra Pradesh. The accused was caught red-handed and was brutally thrashed by the locals.

The incident took place in the Anantapur district. The locals noticed the heinous act and caught hold of the elderly accused and began thrashing him for attempting sexual abuse on the victim. The locals then handed him over to the cops for further investigation.

The police later booked the accused under sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The minor girl was admitted to a local hospital where she underwent treatment.
