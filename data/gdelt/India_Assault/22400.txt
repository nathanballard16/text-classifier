Karnataka: Unrest raises questions on police, government preparedness

BENGALURU: The violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in Mangaluru, where two people died on Thursday, have raised questions about the preparedness of the Karnataka police and administration.Authorities in charge of the security situation also underestimated the size of crowds in Bengaluru and failed to foresee the fallout of breaking up peaceful demonstrations and detaining participants, some current and former IPS officers said.Before Thursday’s protests in parts of Karnataka, police officials had declared that the force was well prepared to maintain order, citing measures such as imposition of Section 144.But a senior administrative official said police authorities made a miscalculation in Mangaluru. “They believed that people would not turn up in big numbers because of heavy deployment of force. They realised the situation was far more serious when hundreds of protesters, equipped with stones, reached the crossing and resorted to violence,” the official said, adding videos and photographs from the scene showed protesters hurling stones and petrol bombs at vehicles.In Bengaluru, the detainment of historian Ramachandra Guha was particularly a pain point that fuelled anger among protesters. Guha had been demonstrating peacefully with college students outside Town Hall and the action against him sparked an outcry on social media.Authorities in the country’s tech capital had said only peaceful protests by small groups would be allowed at specific venues and at a particular time. But thousands of protestors from different corners of the city quickly assembled outside Town Hall. Some troublemakers among them reportedly threw stones at police personnel.A senior IPS officer, who currently doesn’t hold an official post, said this lapse occurred because incharge officers were overconfident and didn’t update themselves about the realities on the ground.“The mobilisation for the protest couldn’t have happened overnight. Police were clueless about the plans; it’s a serious intelligence failure,” the officer, who didn’t want to be named, said.Reacting to the violence in Mangaluru, another officer questioned the role of that city’s police commissioner, PS Harsha. “He could have controlled the situation effectively had he understood the factors on the ground,” the officer said.Opposition parties also questioned the response of the BS Yediyurappa government. They pointed out that home minister Basavaraj Bommai was in Delhi when police were grappling with violent episodes.—With inputs from Rajiv Kalkod
