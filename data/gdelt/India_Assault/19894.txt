Smriti Irani slams opposition for politicising rape

New Delhi, Dec 6 : Union Minister for Women and Child Development Smriti Irani on Friday came out heavily on the Opposition in Parliament, accusing them of politicising rape.

Speaking in the Lok Sabha, the Minister said that "people who used rape as political weapon in West Bengal panchayat elections are giving sermons," adding "this is not a political issue. I thought that you should have commented when Adhir Ranjan was speaking." Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Congress MP from Berhampore in West Bengal, had, during a debate in the House, had commented on the Unnao rape case, connecting the matter with the BJP's governance in Uttar Pradesh.

He had said: "The Unnao victim has 95 per cent burns, what is going on in the country? On the one hand Lord Ram's temple is being built, while on the other Sita is being set ablaze." Irani also said politicising rape does not help women in any manner.

"The fact that you shout here today, means you do not want a woman to stand up and talk about issues. You were quiet when in West Bengal panchayat polls, rape was used as a political weapon," she said.

"Nothing can be more unfortunate for the dignity of women than politicising rape. The Hyderabad case was an atrocity on women but making it a political issue will not help." she added.
