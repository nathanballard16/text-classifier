New Delhi:

A grenade was hurled at a polling station at Rohmoo village in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama. However, no injuries were reported in the incident. Earlier, two school buildings that were designated as polling booths were set on fire in Shopian district. The fifth phase of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 is being held today. Voters in 51 constituencies spread over nine states across India will be exercising their franchise today. The states which are going to polls are Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar. In Jammu and Kashmir, polling is taking place in Ladakh constituency and Pulwama and Shopian districts of Anantnag seat.



On Friday, at least three terrorists were killed on Friday morning in south Kashmir's Shopian district. Acting on a specific input, security forces had launched a cordon and search operation in Adkhara area of Imam Sahib of Shopian district. As the search party reached, security forces received bullets from the terrorists ensuing into the encounter. Immediately security forces retaliated heavily and eliminated three hardcore terrorists. The three slain terrorists were identified as Lateef Ahmad Dar, Tariq Moulvi and Shariq Ahmad Negroo.

Interestingly, with the end of Lateef Ahmad Dar – all 11 out of 12 Hizbul Mujahideen terrorists led by Burhan Wani are now eliminated. Only of the remaining 12, Tariq Pandit, was arrested by the security forces in 2016. So, officially one can say that so-called ‘Burhan Brigade’ has been wiped. Also, with an end of Lateef, it is an end to the ‘pioneers’ of new-age terrorism in Kashmir valley.

Earlier, a BJP worker, identified as Gul Mohammed Mir, was on Saturday shot dead by terrorists in Verinag area of South Kashmir's Nowgam village. The official said Mir was rushed to a hospital in a critical condition where he succumbed to injuries.
