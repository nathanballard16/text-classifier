Cop booked for caste slur at kin of AIDS victim

A policeman probing into the alleged gang rape of an Aurangabad teen who died of complications due to AIDS has been booked under the SC/ST Atrocities Act for disrespecting her father and humiliating her brother.

While officials confirmed the case against Dipak Surve, no action had been taken against him at the time of going to print.

While an autopsy done at an Aurangabad hospital has ruled out sexual assault, sources said the 19-year-old woman's family have maintained that she was drugged and raped by four men when she visited her brother in Mumbai last month.

The woman's brother has alleged that Surve passed casteist remarks and stressed that people from the complainant's community were "known for making up allegations". Advocate Nitin Satpute, who is helping the woman's brother in this case, said, "Two more are yet to be booked. One is inspector Mansi Shire and the other is Dr Joshi, from Ghati hospital in Aurangabad."

Meanwhile, the case has been transferred to the crime branch to look into the allegations of gang rape.
