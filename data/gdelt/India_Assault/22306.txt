Anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) violence across India claimed lives of eight people in the past two days.

On Friday, five people died during violent anti-CAA protests in Uttar Pradesh.

The anti-CAA violence on Friday killed two people in Bijnor, one in Kanpur, one in Firozabad and another one in Sambhal.

On Thursday, three people died during the anti-Citizenship Amendment Act violent protests. Two persons died in Karnataka's Mangaluru and another one died in UP's Lucknow.

Five people and a policeman were also left injured on Friday in the ruckus caused by the miscreants in Babupurwa in Kanpur, UP.

Kanpur SSP Anant Dev Tiwari said that the situation is normal in the city now but the SSP said that earlier in Babu Purwa the protest was so fierce that it resulted in stone pelting at the police personnel.

Kanpur SSP Anant Dev Tiwari said that 25 people were arrested.

ANTI-CAA STIR: VIOLENCE ROCK MULTIPLE UP CITIES

Violent clashes with police rocked Uttar Pradesh from Gorakhpur to Bulandshahr on Friday while thousands rallied in the national capital with tricolour and 'Save Constitution' banners as protests raged across states against the amended citizenship law and the proposed NRC, prompting the government to indicate it was ready to accept suggestions.

Sporadic violence was reported from other parts of Delhi, Maharashtra and Karnataka-Kerala border areas as well, while authorities resorted to curbs on mobile internet and SMS services in various regions, including in parts of UP, Karnataka and the national capital.

Some groups, however, offered roses to the police to underline peaceful nature of their protest.
