Kanpur: Police put petrol on man's private parts, set him on fire

Kanpur police, reportedly, set a man on fire by pouring petrol on the victim's private part. The victim, along with his friend, was arrested on murder charges on Monday.

According to reports, police found a body on Bithoor railway station on March 29 and took two men, identified as Sonu and Monu, into custody on Monday in connection to the murder.

The victim's friend narrated that the police first beat them up and then poured petrol on the victim's private part and subjected him to electric shock. His clothes suddenly caught fire due to the sparks. Seeing this, the police let the other man (Sonu) run.

Monu, in his statement, told that while questioning the police "beat us up first and then poured petrol on my private part. I was on fire. I couldn't remember what happened next."

However, police have a different story for this. They said that the youth set himself on fire to escape from the murder charge.

According to SSP Anant Kumar, "Sonu and Monu were brought to the police station for questioning. To avoid questioning, Monu set his clothes on fire. He is in a serious state. Monu already had a matchbox in his pocket."

Kumar further added that Bithoor SHO Sudhir Pawar has been suspended in this case. The case has been now handed over to CO Kalyanpur.
