Officer investigating Jaipur rape case suspended

The investigating officer of a rape case was suspended on Wednesday, two days after the death of victim who set herself on fire in front of a police station demanding the arrest of the accused.

Sanjay Godara, who was the station house officer of Vaishali Nagar police station of Jaipur, was initially removed from posting and put under awaiting posting orders (APO), DCP Vikas Sharma said on Wednesday.

Now, Godara has been placed under suspension on Tuesday night, Sharma said.

Godara had investigated the case registered by the woman on June 5. After the suicide, the case has been transferred to the CID-CB.

The suicide incident was raised by the opposition BJP in the assembly on Tuesday and the parliamentary affairs minister had later told reporters that the police inspector will be suspended.

The victim was demanding the arrest of accused Ravindra Singh, her distant brother-in-law.

The 36-year-old poured some inflammable on her on Sunday in the police station premises and set herself on fire.

She succumbed to the injuries on Monday morning.

While referring to the investigation conducted by Godara, the police had said that the woman and the accused were in a consensual physical relationship since 2015 but the woman got disappointed after Ravindra got engaged in April this year.

According to Godara, this led her to file a complaint against him.
