SURAT: Lalgate police arrested a 19-year-old youth for alleged sexual assault by him on a nine-year-old girl in his house here on Thursday. The accused lured her with money and took her to his house in Ved Darwaja area where he sexually assaulted her, police said, adding that he later let her go after some time.

Sultan Khan Pathan was arrested after the girl’s mother lodged a complaint at Lalgate police station against him. The minor girl informed her mother about the incident and she along with other family members approached police. The accused has been booked under various sections of Indian Penal Code and POCSO Act for the sexual assault.

The minor was taken to hospital for medical examination. She has not suffered any injury. “The minor has not been raped but he has booked under various sections for the crime. This is because sexual assault on a victim younger than 12-year-old is considered rape under the law,” said a police officer of Lalgate police station.

Parents of the accused were not present at home. The accused is unemployed and spends time hanging out with friends.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)
