Argentine leader’s setback jolts markets

Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri lost Sunday’s primary vote by a landslide, foreshadowing a defeat in October’s presidential election and a possible return to the policies of his predecessor, Cristina Kirchner.

Argentina’s international bonds and stocks tumbled in London and New York trading Monday after the vote. Alberto Fernandez, the main opposition candidate who has Kirchner as his running mate, took almost 48% of the vote to 32% for Macri.

Investors fear voters are losing patience with the market-friendly policies adopted by Macri and are prepared to gamble on a return of the type of interventionist measures, such as currency controls, that Kirchner employed.
