PATNA: Bihar Police on Friday recovered an AK-47 assault rifle during a raid from the residence of Mokama MLA and strongman Anant Kumar Singh. According to reports, several live bullets and a magazine have also been recovered from the legislator's ancestral home in Nadawan village in Patna district. Singh is an Independent MLA who represents the Mokama Assembly constituency. Last month, Singh was summed by the police to appear before it on August one for giving his voice sample to match it with an audio clip related to a murder case conspiracy. In the notice, Singh had been asked to give his voice sample for matching the same with an audio clip that has gone viral. In the clip appeared to be a telephonic conversation, a voice, allegedly of Singh, is heard plotting to kill Bhola Singh, a contractor, and his brother Mukesh Singh. Anant Singh's elder brother Dilip Singh had been a history-sheeter and had served as a minister during the tenure of RJD government headed by Rabri Devi. Anant Singh made his electoral debut in 2005, wresting Mokama back from another gangster-turned-politician Suraj Bhan Singh with whom his family has had a running feud.
