12k women rally against Maoists in Gadchiroli on Intl Women’s Day

Nagpur: A history of sorts was created in Gadchiroli on Friday when nearly 12,000 women of different age groups formed an 8km-long human chain by joining hands on International Women’s Day. The Maoists, who too observe Women’s Day, had to take a back seat.The human chain began with a two-minute silence and was the second protest launched by tribal women against the killing of Bebi. In another couple of years, I feel the existing support too would be gone,” he said.The SP said that the police’s efforts on International Women’s Day was a befitting reply to the Maoists. Honey collection centres and an allied processing industry are being considered.The women’s day programme is now being viewed as a major victory of the police department which is headed by DIG Ankush Shinde and SP Shailesh Balkawade. Bebi, a resident of remote Irapnar village in Bhamragarh tehsil, was abducted from her home on September 28 last year and killed.
