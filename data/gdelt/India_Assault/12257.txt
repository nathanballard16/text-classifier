BHPian SILVERWOOD injured in pothole-related accident

According to a media report, BHPian SILVERWOOD (Waseem Memon), who successfully fought against the Karnataka government to abolish lifetime tax for out-of-state cars in Karnataka for 1 year, has been injured in a pothole-related accident.

It is said that it is because of his efforts that the central government is considering uniform road tax across the country. In 2017, he had petitioned the Karnataka High Court seeking directions to the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Commissioner to ensure that the city's roads are free of potholes. The petition said that despite the high number of pothole-related accidents, no action was taken.

On July 6, 2019, Waseem met with an accident when the rear wheel of his two-wheeler got stuck in a pothole. It is reported that the resulting back pain from the accident was too much to bear and he underwent spinal surgery for dislocation of two of his discs. The medical bill is said to be close to Rs. 2 lakh.
