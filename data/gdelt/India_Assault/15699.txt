New Delhi: A Delhi court is likely to start hearing final arguments in the Muzaffarpur shelter home sexual assault case from September 23. Additional Sessions Judge Saurabh Kulshreshtha has directed the CBI as well as the lawyers of the accused persons to conclude their arguments by September 21.

The court has put up the matter for further hearing on Thursday. It had earlier framed various charges, including criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault, against 21 persons in the case.

Brajesh Thakur, the prime accused in the case, was charged under provisions of the POCSO Act, including Section 6 (aggravated sexual assault).

The offence carries a punishment of minimum 10 years and maximum of life imprisonment. The accused, including Thakur, employees of his shelter home and Bihar department of social welfare officials, were charged with criminal conspiracy to commit rape and penetrative sexual assault against minors.

They have pleaded innocence and claimed trial. On February 7, the Supreme Court had ordered authorities to transfer the case from Bihar to a Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) court in Saket District Court complex in Delhi.

Several girls were allegedly raped and sexually abused at an NGO-run shelter home in Muzaffarpur, Bihar. The issue had come to light following a report by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences
