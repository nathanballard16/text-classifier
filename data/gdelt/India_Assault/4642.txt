Delhi Crime trailer out. Netflix series on Nirbhaya rape case will send shivers down your spine

Netflix has unveiled the trailer of its seven-part anthology series Delhi Crime directed by Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta. The series stars Shefali Shah, Rasika Dugal, Rajesh Tailang, Adil Hussain, Gopal Datt, and Vinod Sherawat in important roles.

It revolves around the investigation of the heinous crime that enraged the entire country in 2012. Nirbhaya and her friend were attacked by six men inside a bus and the former was brutally tortured, beaten and gang-raped. The rape case shook the country's psyche and led to never-seen-before nation-wide protests.

The Netflix series is based on the case files of the Delhi Police and the story follows the unfailing determination of Varthika Chaturvedi (Shefali Shah), the investigating officer, to find the perpetrators of the crime.

The trailer begins with Varthika Chaturvedi receiving the call about the heinous crime. Shaken by the brutality of it, Varthika resolves to leave no stone unturned to nab the culprits. The clip brings back the horrific memories of the crime that happened on a cold December night in Munirka. In the trailer, as Nirbhaya is being carried to a hospital, she requests the cops to not tell her father about the incident.

More such poignant moments are in store for the viewers as the series will explore the emotions, politics and outrage surrounding the case from the eye of an investigation officer.

The series premiered at the Sundance film festival 2019 and has received rave reviews from critics across the world. Delhi Crime will begin streaming from March 22, 2019 on Netflix.
