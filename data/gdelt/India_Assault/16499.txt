Sena irked with Bhosari seat allocation, senior member assaults female colleague

A senior Shiv Sena party member from Pimpri-Chinchwad allegedly slapped a female colleague during the party meeting held on Wednesday.

According to Sena leaders, who requested anonymity, the victim along with her supporters took the accused to Yamunanagar police station in order to register a complaint.

Shiv Sena local unit in Pimpri-Chinchwad called a meeting in Bhosari at 10.30 am on Wednesday, post the declaration of the Sena-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) seat sharing and announcement of names. As the picture became clear that the BJP will be fielding its nominee Mahesh Langde from Bhosari, Sena aspirants and their supporters from the Bhosari constituency were agitated.

Bhosari is predominantly a Sena bastion, but the supporters claimed that due to former Sena MP Shivaji Adhalrao Patil, who lost the Shirur Lok Sabha seat in 2019 and his followers, they failed to regain the seat in upcoming assembly polls in Sena-BJP alliance. The verbal disputes later turned to physical dispute, described, the party activists.
