New Delhi:

The Narendra Modi Government has cleared one more step to get Vijay Mallya extradited while Opposition rallies around the Saradha Scamsters, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley tweeted, barely moments after UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid approved the extradition of the 63-year-old business tycoon on the charges of conspiracy to defraud and money laundering offences.

"Modi Government clears one more step to get Mallya extradited while Opposition rallies around the Saradha Scamsters," Jaitley wrote on Twitter.

The UK Home Office confirmed the news on Mallya's extradiiton case this evening and said, "On February 3 the Secretary of State, having carefully considered all relevant matters, signed the order for Vijay Mallya's extradition to India".

"Vijay Mallya is accused in India of conspiracy to defraud, making false representations and money laundering offences," a Home Office spokesperson added.

Mallya is on bail on an extradition warrant executed by Scotland Yard in April 2017 after the Indian authorities brought fraud and money laundering charges amounting to Rs 9,000 crores against the former Kingfisher Airlines boss.

However, Mallya has now 14 days time starting from February 4 to apply for leave to appeal to the UK High Court.
