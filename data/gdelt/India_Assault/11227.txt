Defence Budget: Insufficient allocation for modernisation of forces

Modernisation of armed forces could be crippled as the allocation for capital expenditure in the defence budget meant for big ticket procurement has not increased to match the requirements to transform the forces with modern equipment.

The capital allocation will only take care of the committed liabilities, which in effect means making payments towards purchases already finalised. This means the amount will not be enough to make new purchases.

While the Air Force needs to replace its ageing fleet of fighter jets and is looking for 114 aircraft beyond the 36 Rafale jets, the Navy needs to enhance its capabilities by adding more submarines and aircraft carriers. The army is struggling to get the most basic requiremena modern assault rifle.

Out of Rs 3,18,931.22 crore allocated for the financial year 2019-20, Rs 2,10,682.42 crore for revenue expenditure and Rs 1,08,248.80 crore for capital expenditure for the defence services and the organisations/departments under Ministry of Defence.

There was little change for defence allocation from the interim budget presented earlier as Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman presented the Union Budget for 2019-20.

However, the government is hopeful of augmenting the defence budget by approximately Rs 25,000 crore over the next five years on account saving on custom duty as defence equipment not manufactured in India that will be imported has been exempted from basic customs duty.

Out of a total outlay of Rs 27,86,349 crore Rs 3,18,931.22 crore has been earmarked for defence. This does not include defence pensions that account for a high percentage of expenditure for the Ministry of Defence. An amount of Rs 1,12,079.57 crore has been provided in Budget Estimate separately.

Total Defence Allocation (Rs 4,31,010.79 crore), including Defence Pension, accounts for 15.47 per cent of the total Central Government expenditure for the Financial Year 2019-20, the MoD said in a statement.

The allocation of Rs 3,18,931.22 crore represents a growth of 7.93 per cent over Budget Estimates (2,95,511.41 crore) and 6.87 per cent over Revised Estimates (Rs 2,98,418.72 crore), respectively for the Financial Year 2018-19.
