New Delhi: A 17-year-old youth was strangled to death for allegedly not returning Rs 200 he borrowed from his friends in the national capital. Police have detained two juveniles in connection with the murder.

The youth was first strangled with a nylon rope and later his face was disfigured with a heavy stone in an attempt to hide his identity.

According to a report in The Times of India, the victim's body was found by a rag picker near a garbage dump in Anand Vihar. The youth's body was identified from the clothes he was wearing. His body has been sent for post-mortem.

The victim went missing from his home on Wednesday. His parents lodged a missing person complaint at the Anand Vihar Police station on Friday.

During the course of the investigation, police came to know that the victim met two minors over an issue. Later, the police apprehended the two accused from their home.

When police questioned the juveniles, they told police that the victim had borrowed Rs 200 from his friends and when they asked him to return the money, he refused. When the accused confronted the victim for returning the money, a fight broke out between them and the youth was strangled with a rope lying at the spot.

In a similar case in November 2018, a man was killed by his friend after he demanded him to return Rs 500. The deceased was identified as 19-year-old Deepak Chauhan, who used to sell scrap for a living. Deepak was a resident in Sonarpada area of Dombivli, Mumbai. The accused was caught with the help of a CCTV camera.
