The murder of the Pakistani prisoner identified as Shakirullah at Rajasthan’s Jaipur Central Jail, was confirmed by inspector general of police in-charge of prisons Rupinder Singh, who revealed that he was stoned to death by other captives subsequent to a row between them.

Rights activist Jibran Nasir amongst others has condemned the murder of the Pakistani inmate on Twitter saying: “Strongly condemn this act. This is the result of the hate the Modi Government and Indian media is feeding it's populace. From instigating mobs which beat and harassed Kashmiri muslims to now leaving the most vulnerable in their jails to die."

The news has come following the already tense relations between India and Pakistan following the terror attack in Pulwama that took the lives of 44 Indian soldiers.
