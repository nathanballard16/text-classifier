HC sets aside order to recover monetary benefits

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court has set aside an order passed by the Collector of Thoothukudi enabling Station Officers of the Fire and Rescue Services, Thoothukudi, to recover certain monetary benefits from 12 firemen.

The 12 firemen had challenged the order to recover the monetary benefits from them after their salary was re-fixed. The petitioners had said that the order of recovery was arbitrary and was issued without any notice. They were not given any opportunity to be heard.

They had said that the pay scale fixed earlier could not be cancelled arbitrarily. The court took note of the fact that no documents were produced by the respondent to show that the order was passed based on valid proceedings initiated.

Justice S.S. Sundar observed that the respondent could not reduce the pay scale without giving an opportunity to the petitioners. Reasonable opportunity should have been provided to the petitioners before they were asked to part with certain amount by way of recovery.

Since the order was in violation of the principles of natural justice, the court had no hesitation to allow the writ petition filed by the 12 firemen. The order was unsustainable and, therefore, set aside, the court said.
