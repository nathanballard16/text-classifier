Parliament Winter Session 2019 Highlights: Both Houses adjourned sine die amid uproar over Rahul Gandhi’s ‘rape in India’ remark

Parliament Winter Session 2019 Highlights: The Winter Session of both Houses, the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha, concluded on Friday after the proceedings were adjourned sine die amid ruckus over Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s ‘rape in India’ remark. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s remarks on rape were at the centre of furious protests in the Lok Sabha on the last day of the winter session on Friday with leaders of the ruling BJP protesting and demanding an apology from him.

As soon as Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla paid tributes to those who lost their lives in the 2001 Parliament attack, Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said several BJP members had given notices of adjournment against Rahul Gandhi’s remarks and they be allowed to speak.

Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said at a rally in Jharkhand, “Narendra Modi had said ‘Make in India’ but nowadays wherever you look, it is ‘Rape in India’. In Uttar Pradesh Narendra Modi’s MLA raped a woman, then she met with an accident but Narendra Modi did not utter a word.” Gandhi was referring to the Unnao rape case where BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar is an accused.
