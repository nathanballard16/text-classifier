LUDHIANA: Several parents gathered outside a city-based school on Friday after the news of the alleged rape attempt on a 4-year-old girl.

The worried parents remained there for a few hours asking the school authorities to show them the CCTV recording.

Initially, the school authorities did not allow them to enter the school campus, following which the police reached on the spot.

The police pacified the parents and took their representatives inside the school to check the CCTV recording but found nothing.

On other hand, commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal constituted a Special Investigation Team (SIT), comprising assistant commissioner of police (Industrial Area- A) Vaibhav Sehgal, SHO concerned and a woman cop.

Meanwhile, the medical examination of the 4-year-old girl was conducted by a board of doctors at the Civil Hospital on Friday. The doctors have sent the swab for chemical examination at Kharar-based laboratory.

Investigating officer ASI Rajinder Singh said the police did not find anything suspicious in the footage. The minor was not seen going anywhere in the CCTV grab. However, more CCTV grabs were being scanned.
