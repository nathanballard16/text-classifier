Criminalising marital rape will disintegrate Hindu society, says S L Bhyrappa

Bengaluru: Novelist S L Bhyrappa said that a day would come when a husband must literally get a signature from his wife before having sex with her, if marital rape is criminalised.

At a book release event here, Bhyrappa said, “Apparently, this law (criminalisation of rape) is only for Hindus. The Union Home Minister has said the concept of marital rape cannot be applied in India as Marriage is treated as a sacrament or sacred in our society.”

“Such moves will dent the dignity of our society, family system and marital life. This the ploy to disintegrate Hindu society,” said Byrappa.

Undermining our culture and heritage, courts here draw inspiration from the judgements and the observations made by the judges from the United States and Britain, he lamented.

On the Supreme Court’s order on lifting the ban on women entry into Sabarimala temple, he said, “When women are not allowed inside the temple, everyone calls it discrimination. But they are allowed before puberty and after the menopause, aren’t they?”

“When the male Gods could not destroy the demons, they sought the help of Goddess Chamundeshwari. She took the initiation and destroyed the demons. The women are more powerful compared to men in Hindu mythology. What if someone moves the court saying that this is demeaning the dignity of men,” he wondered.
