Watch: Indian school children perform on Pakistan military song on Republic Day

LAHORE – A video of Indian school children performing on a song produced and released by Pakistan’s army media wing in 2015, has gone viral on social media.

The song was prepared to pay tributes to the martyrs of 2014 Taliban attack on Army Public School in Peshawar, Pakistan.

In the 4-minute video, the school kids wearing their national flags can be seen performing on the song at an event held to mark the Indian Republic Day on January 26 (Saturday).

However, it could not be immediately known if the song was played deliberately or accidentally.

Lyrics of the hypnotically infectious track titled “Mujhay Dushman Kay Bachon Ko Parhana Hai” seeks retribution for the barbaric attack by educating the children of the enemy.

Pakistan military had released the sequel of ‘Bara Dushman Bana Phirta Hai’ in December 2015 on the first anniversary of the heinous attack on Peshawar’s Army Public School (APS).

The video, as well as the song, has a powerful message regarding the tragic event.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was also strongly condemned this attack by Taliban militants and branded the act “a senseless act of unspeakable brutality” and said India shares rival Pakistan's pain.
