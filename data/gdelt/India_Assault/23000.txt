Cops at crime site

RAJKOT: A woman was arrested on Saturday late evening for allegedly murdering her three-year-old nephew whose body was found wrapped in a gunny bag in Rajkot's Bhaktinagar area.

Police said the accused, identified as Parul Haki, had strangled Khushal with a handkerchief and wrapped his body in the gunny bag, before throwing it in a open gutter.

"Haki said she had abducted Khushal from the anganwadi. She was jealous of Khushal as he was getting more attention than her own son and so she had decided to bump him off," said V K Gadhvi, inspector with Bhaktinagar police station.
