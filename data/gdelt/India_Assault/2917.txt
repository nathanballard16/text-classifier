Amid mounting India-Pak tension, Pak prisoner found dead in Jaipur jail

Even as the tension between India and Pakistan has escalated following the deadly terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama last week, a Pakistani national lodged in the central jail in Jaipur was found dead on Wednesday.

Officials said Shakar Ullah was killed following a quarrel with other inmates. He was serving life sentence under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act.

Senior administrative and police officials have rushed to the jail after learning about the incident. Rajasthan Director General of Police Kapil Garg said the matter would be investigated by a judicial magistrate and also by the police.

"Ullah has been lodged here since 2011 and died following a brawl with other inmates,” Jaipur Jail IG Rupinder Singh said.

Forty jawans were killed after a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus on February 14. Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad has claimed responsibility.
