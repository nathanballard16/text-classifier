A Kerala man accused of sexually assaulting a woman at the Cherpulassery area committee office of CPI(M) in Palakkad district was arrested by Cherupilassery police on Saturday. The alleged sexual assault had taken place last year and came to light when the survivor gave birth to a child.

The accused, identified as 29-year-old Prakashan from Thattarathodi, was arrested after the survivor recorded her statement before a judge under Section 164 (examination of witness) of the CrPC.

The accused has been charged under Section 376 (Rape) of the Indian Penal Code and has been taken to Palakkad district hospital for medical tests, reports the Times of India. A blood sample of the accused has been collected for a DNA and a potency test.

The case came to light after a baby was found abandoned at Nagaripuram in Mannur gram panchayat on March 16. The police identified the mother and questioned her, which is when the alleged sexual assault came to light.

The woman had told the police that she had gone to the CPI(M) officer last year with some work for her college magazine. The accused, who was inside the office, allegedly sexually assaulted her after promising her that he will marry her. The survivor reportedly gave birth to the child on March 15.

Cherpulassery police are likely to take the accused to the crime scene to collect evidence, inspector P Pramod told TOI. The police will also be interrogating the woman, who has also been admitted to a hospital for a medical checkup.

The infant who was found abandoned has been sent to a hospital for a checkup. The police have also registered a case against the woman for abandoning the baby.
