2 thrashed for attacking bus conductor

Tirupur: Two men, who attacked the conductor of a Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation bus in an inebriated state, were thrashed by passengers in the city on Sunday.

The state-run bus plying between Erode and Tirupur was about to enter the Old Bus Stand in the city in the afternoon when the incident happened. Finding two men loitering on the middle of the road, driver Thangavelu and conductor Ramasamy asked them to make way for the vehicle. But the duo began to quarrel with the bus employees and hurled abuses. They soon barged into the vehicle and attacked Ramasamy, said a police officer. The passengers did not take it lightly. They pounced on the duo, thrashed them and handed them over to the Tirupur south police.

Police identified the men as Ravi and Surya of Chidambaram. “They were working in knitwear units,” a police officer said.TNN
