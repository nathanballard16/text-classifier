The check-up was done on November 21, but the shocking issue came to light on Saturday when a child rights activist alerted the authorities about the girls’ plight.

During a preliminary enquiry, the girls said that a person, who lived close to their houses, had sexually assaulted them. A police complaint is yet to be filed by the college.

Child rights activist Ch Achyuta Rao demanded a highlevel probe into the incident.
