Members of the Full Gospel Evangelical Church had gathered in a church-goer’s house at around 7am local time on March 20, in the village of Paschim Bardhaman, West Bengal, in India. Reverend Anand Hari had been leading the prayer meeting for about 15 minutes when a mob of 20 alleged Hindu radicals broke into the house, according to Asia News. Many people were injured, but Rev Hari took the brunt of the assault as the attackers used sticks.

He was taken to a local government hospital and is said to be still recovering.

Shibu Thomas, who saw the assault, told Asia News even women were attacked.

He said: “People suddenly broke into the house and started hitting everyone present with fists, kicks and sticks.

“They then fled, leaving the wounded on the ground.

“The attackers did not spare even the women.”

Many Christians have claimed there has been a recent increase in violence on their places of worship.

They say it is a result of Hindu radicals following the ideology of the current right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).

It is one of the leading political parties in India, along with the Indian National Congress.
