The rape victim from Unnao, who was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to a city hospital, died of cardiac arrest around Friday midnight. She was in an extremely critical condition and on ventilator, doctors attending to her said.

“Despite our best efforts, she did not survive. Her condition deteriorated towards the evening. She had a cardiac arrest at around 11:10 pm. We tried to resuscitate her, but she passed away around 11:40 pm,” a doctor working at the hospital was quoted as saying by PTI.

The rape victim suffered 90 per cent burns after five men, including two of the rape accused, allegedly set her on fire while she was on her way to court, police said.

The other man had been on the run. All the five men involved in Thursday morning’s attack were arrested within hours and the victim airlifted in the evening from Lucknow to Delhi.
