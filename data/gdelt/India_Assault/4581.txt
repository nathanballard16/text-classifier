A 30-year-old Delhi man has been arrested after it was discovered that he strangled his wife to death and slept next to her corpse, following an altercation over his drinking habit.

The man, Prem Singh, killed his wife on the intervening night of Tuesday and Wednesday after he came home drunk to their rented house in Delhi's Nihar Vihar, reported The Hindustan Times quoting police officers.

Prem Singh reportedly slept the night close to his wife's dead body and fled the crime scene on Wednesday morning. He was arrested later in the day from Rajasthan, added the report.

His wife, identified as Babli, 28, used to work in a beauty parlour while he used to work with a private satellite TV service provider firm, said police.

Commenting on the incident, a senior police officer said Singh was booked under charges of murder and a case has been registered against him at the Nihal Vihar police station.

He has been sent to jail after his court appearance following the episode.

Police said that details of the crime came to light on Wednesday morning when the body was discovered and moved to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital's mortuary for autopsy.

Singh became the prime suspect in the case as soon as he fled and some neighbours also informed the police about his drinking problems which led to the fight in the first place.

In his statement to the police, Singh revealed that he killed his wife after he returned home in an inebriated state on Tuesday, following which he got an altercation with his wife.
