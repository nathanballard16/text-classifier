Hyderabad woman techie abducts harasser to teach him a lesson, arrested

A case of kidnapping and attempt to murder has been registered against the woman and her five friends.

A woman software engineer was arrested on charges of kidnapping a carpenter in Hyderabad. The carpenter in question had allegedly been harassing her and she wanted to teach him a lesson, police said.

The woman, who works at a leading MNC in the city, resorted to this extreme step with the help of five of her friends.

The carpenter, 23-year-old V Sai Kumar, first saw the woman when he was out for some work weeks ago. He had since allegedly been stalking her.

He often used to call her and plead her to meet him.

The women, agitated with this behaviour, hatched a plan with five of her friends and called this man over to an unknown place in Secunderabad.

The six accused then thrashed the carpenter and abducted him.

"They [the woman and her friends], the victim alleges, wanted to kill him. He somehow managed to escape and got himself admitted to a hospital. The woman and her friends have been arrested," ACP Gopalpuram told India Today.

Furthermore, a case of kidnapping and attempt to murder has been registered against the woman and her five friends.

It is still not clear if the woman had approached the police before resorting to this action.
