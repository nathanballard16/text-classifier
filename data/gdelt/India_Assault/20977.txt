Smuggling attempt

MASSENA, N.Y. — Four people are facing charges after U.S. Border Patrol agents from the Massena station stopped a taxi on State Route 37 on Sunday.

The agents alleged two of the people in the vehicle were citizens of India who’d entered the U.S. illegally, not at a designated port of entry. Those two people were each charged with improper entry by alien. The driver, a naturalized U.S. citizen of Indian origin, and a passenger who is a lawful permanent resident from India, were each charged with alien smuggling.

No information was released by the border patrol on whether the suspects were held in custody or regarding any upcoming court appearances.
