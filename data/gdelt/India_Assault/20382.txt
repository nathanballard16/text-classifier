Law and order has broken down but Modi is 'mute': Cong on Unnao rape case

The Congress on Sunday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over rape incidents in various parts of the country, alleging that rule of law has broken down but the PM is "mute" and has not said a word on it.

Congress' chief spokesperson also tagged a video of Prime Minister Modi attacking the then Congress government over rape incidents in Delhi.

"Unnao, Etawah, Hyderabad, Palwal-Faridabad, the horror continues! Rape victims cry out for justice as soul of India hurts!" Surjewala said in a tweet.

"Criminals roam free as rule of law breaks down! But 'Modiji' is 'mute'...No remorse, No outrage, Not a word. And no one will question the PM? Why? he asked in a tweet.

Unnao, Etawah, Hyderabad, Palwal-Faridabad, the horror continues!

Citing the increasing number of rape cases, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Saturday had said the international community was ridiculing the country and India was now known as the 'rape capital' of the world.
