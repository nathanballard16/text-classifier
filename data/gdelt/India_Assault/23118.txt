13 people trapped in private hospital lift, rescued

Pune: Thirteen people who got stuck in a lift at a private hospital in Pune on Tuesday morning, were successfully rescued by the fire brigade personnel, Pune fire brigade sources said. Overloading is believed to have caused the accident.



Prashant Ranpise, chief fire officer, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), told Mirror Online that stranded people were evacuated from the lift without any injury suffered by anyone of them. "It was a successful rescue operation," Ranpise said.



The fire bridage was alerted at around 9:22 am that some people had been stuck in the lift in between two floors of the Noble Hospital at Hadapsar Road. Ranpise said that the fire brigade control room started receiving a stream of calls from the people who had been stranded in the lift. "Those who could avail the network started calling us," he said.



The fire brigade immediately dispatched three fire tenders and around 15 fire personnel for the rescue operations. "The hospital had, by then, summoned technicians to facilitate the fire brigade personnel in the rescue work," he said. After struggling for over an hour, the lift was brought to the level of one floor and the stranded people were brought out, he said.



The stranded people included visitors to the hospital and relatives of the patients.



Ranpise said though an inquiry has been launched by the concerned department of the Municipal corporation into the accident, it is assumed that it was caused due to overloading. "Perhaps the lift stopped mid-way because of carrying load beyond it's capacity," he said.
