Ahmedabad: In a shocking incident reported from Bavla village in Ahmedabad, a 42-year-old woman was brutally assaulted by her husband just because she had asked for some pocket money to buy shampoo. The couple has been married for 15 years and the accused works with Western Railway as a clerk.

The incident took place on Sunday morning when the victim approached her husband and asked for some money. The accused then became angry and started abusing her and despite her trying to calm him down as she was earlier too assaulted by him on petty issues, he pulled her hair and banged her head on a wall.

As per a report by The Times of India, the victim filed a complaint of domestic violence at Viramgam town police station stating that the accused often used to assault her over petty issues. However, before registering an FIR, the woman called 181 Abhayamn Helpline from where a counsellor came to her house in Bavla and tried to make her husband understand about his erring ways and unacceptable behaviour.

While talking to TOI, the victim stated that since their marriage, she was in a constant state of peril that was fuelled by the vicious behaviour of her husband's elder brother and sister-in-law. Even after the couple shifted to Bavla, their intervention in her life continued and her husband, provoked by them continued to torture her.

Cases of crime against women are truly shocking and in another incident, a case of assault and domestic violence was filed against a 45-year-old man who lives near Vaishyasabha in Raikhand area of the Ahmedabad who blistered his wife's private parts with a hot iron box.
