Women not safe under BJP rule in Uttar Pradesh: BSP

Lashing out at the BJP-led government in Uttar Pradesh over the Unnao rape case, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) Spokesperson Sudhindra Bhadoria on Thursday said women are not safe in the state.

Speaking to ANI, Bhadoria said: "Under Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, women are not safe and it has become a routine that women are being victimised in every part of the state and Unnao rape case is another burning example of how law and order collapsed in Uttar Pradesh."

Alleging that the BJP government is "shameless", he said: "The BJP is taking no effective steps to protect women's rights and dignity. Only 'Jungleraj' and 'Gundaraj' is active in Uttar Pradesh."

"I can say that women are unsafe in Uttar Pradesh under Yogi Adityanath government. Also, common people are also being harassed by the state administration. Yogi government has totally failed to protect the right of the common men," Bhadoria added.
