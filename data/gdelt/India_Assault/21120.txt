Sexual violence pandemic in India: Rape cases doubled in last 17 years

A 23-year-old girl, a rape victim, was set ablaze when she was on her way to court to attend a hearing. She had trudged nearly a kilometre striving for help after being set on fire and had called the police herself before collapsing. She died a few days later in Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital. Her alleged rapist stands accused of dousing her with kerosene and setting her on fire. Sadly, she was the second victim within a fortnight of growing sexual violence in India.

The rape vulnerability for girls or women is almost twice today to what it was 17 years ago, according to data provided by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

According to the NCRB data, 4,15,786 rape cases were reported across India between 2001 and 2017. On average, 67 women were raped every day across the country during these 17 years, or, in other words, about three women had been raped every hour.

While 16,075 cases of rape were reported in 2001 across India, this number rose drastically to 32,559 in 2017 - an increase of nearly 103 per cent.

Goa witnessed the largest percentage increase in rape cases in comparison to other states. The figure rose 533 per cent with 12 incidents in 2001 to 76 in 2017. It is followed by Uttarakhand, with 405 per cent increase in the same period.

However, in terms of absolute numbers, Madhya Pradesh was the worst state in the country with 5,562 reported cases in 2017, a jump of 2,711 cases compared to 2,851 rape cases reported in 2001. Uttar Pradesh ranks second in this list, with 4,246 rape cases reported in 2017, followed by Rajasthan (3,305) and Kerala (2,003).

Bihar is one of the fewer states where reported rape cases declined (a fall of 283 cases) in 2017 compared to how many were reported in 2001. Tamil Nadu, Mizoram, Tripura and Nagaland are the other states where the absolute number of rape cases has gone down.

After the brutal gang-rape of Nirbhaya in 2012, the government had taken many important steps. "The 2012 protests tried to set reality right-side-up, and for the first time ever, won significant visibility and support for women's assertion of unconditional autonomy and protests against victim-blaming," Kavita Krishnan, secretary of the All India Progressive Women's Association, said to India Today.

After the Nirbhaya case, the government amended the existing law and made it more stringent, including doubling the prison term for rapists to 20 years. The expansion of the Criminal Amendment Act, 2013 has also had an impact on rape reporting cases.

However, experts have raised the question on the NCRB's data quality. As a government crime-related data repository, NCRB collects these data from police stations.

Women rights activist allege that rape cases are not reported appropriately. "Police, politicians, judges, and campus administrators in India tend to understand sexual violence as a loss of "honour" rather than as the violation of consent. This allows consensual inter-caste or inter-faith relationships to be conflated with 'rape', and as a result, 'honour' crimes and patriarchal restrictions hide in plain sight, disguised as 'protecting women from rape," Krishnan added.
