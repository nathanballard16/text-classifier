DGP is monitoring Alwar gang-rape case, culprits will be punished: Ashok Gehlot

New Delhi [India], May 7 (ANI): Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Tuesday said that Director General of Police (DGP) Kapil Garg is himself monitoring the investigation into Alwar gang-rape case and that the culprits would be brought to book.

Speaking to media persons here, Chief Minister Gehlot said: “I'm taking this case seriously. State DGP (Kapil Garg) himself is monitoring the case. The culprits will be punished.”

DGP Garg also said that 14 teams have been deployed to work on the case. "A case has been registered against 5 people, one person has been arrested out of those five," he said.

A woman was allegedly gang-raped and thrashed while her husband was beaten up by a group of five men in Alwar on Tuesday.

Police said a case under Sections 147, 149, 323, 341, 354B, 376(D) and 506 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as well as Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Amendment Act, 2015, has been registered. A probe has been initiated.

Gehlot also took a swipe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for calling Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s father Rajiv Gandhi “Bhrashtachari number 1.”

“PM Modi says anything these days, as he is afraid that he is going to lose the Lok Sabha elections. This is to divert the people's attention from the Rafale case,” he said.

His comments come days after Prime Minister Modi while addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh, had said that “Your (Rahul Gandhi) father (Rajiv Gandhi) was termed 'Mr Clean' by his courtiers, but his life ended as 'Bhrashtachari No. 1."

There are 25 Lok Sabha seats in Rajasthan. The polling on 13 and 12 constituencies was held on April 29 and May 6 respectively. The counting of votes will take place on May 23. (ANI)
