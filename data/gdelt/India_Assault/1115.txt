The gunfight comes on the day India is celebrating its 70th Republic Day Saturday. The J-K police have claimed that the trapped militants had serious plans of a “terrorist act” today.

Today’s encounter has come a day after militants lobbed grenades and attacked at five different places in the Kashmir valley, including camps and posts of the CRPF on Friday.

A senior police official said on Saturday morning that a cordon and search operation was launched earlier Saturday morning in the area, following inputs about the presence of militants in the area. As the search was underway, the militants fired at the security forces, triggering an encounter.
