Maulana Masood Azhar is alive, says Pakistani Minister

Maulana Masood Azhar is alive, confirmed the incumbent Provincial Minister of Punjab for Information and Culture in Pakistan on Monday.

"He is alive, Maulana Masood Azhar is alive, we have no information of his death," Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan told ANI, without elaborating on Azhar's current state of health.

Social media has been abuzz with speculations regarding death of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief, with many alleging liver cancer as the reason behind his supposed demise.

Pakistan-based JeM has claimed responsibility for the February 14 ghastly terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, which killed over 40 Indian CRPF personnel.

Following this, the international community has thrown its weight behind India in its fight against terrorism, with the United States telling Pakistan to stop providing support to terror outfits and terrorists in the immediate aftermath of the terror attack.
