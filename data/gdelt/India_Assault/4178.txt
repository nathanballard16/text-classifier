The subcontinent was just a heartbeat away from nuclear war

If you don’t bother paying much attention to the foreign pages you could easily have missed it, but the interesting thing is that the world was just a heartbeat away from a nuclear war last week.

As with all the most dangerous conflicts, it was a tiny spark that ignited what could have become a hugely dangerous bonfire – another war (there have been two major wars and innumerable incidents and skirmishes) between India and Pakistan. The combustible materials just kept accumulating on the heap the British began in 1947.

It was the inept viceroy, Louis Mountbatten, who decided (against advice) to partition the subcontinent, and it was he who ceded Kashmir – a majority-Muslim area – to India. Seemingly perpetual violence has resulted.

On February 14, Valentine's Day, a young suicide bomber drove his car into a police bus and exploded it, killing 40. The terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility. Twelve days later Indian jets screamed a dozen kilometres across the Line of Control into Pakistan-administered Kashmir and bombed the network’s training camp. One jet crashed and its downed pilot was beaten by civilians until being rescued by Pakistani soldiers.
