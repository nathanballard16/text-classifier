'He lived and died for his dream,they have kept their words': Syama Prasad Mukherjee's nephew hails Article 370 decision

Syama Prasad Mukherjee's nephew former Justice Chittatosh Mukherjee has hailed the decision to scrap Article 370 ending the special status of Jammu and Kashmir. Syama Prasad Mukherjee founder of Jana Sangh was a strident opponent of Article 370 and even gave his life protesting against this provision in the Constitution.

Hailing the decision, Chittatosh Mukherjee, an eminent jurist by his own rights said he is very happy as his uncle lived this dream and gave his life for that cause. Nirmala Sitharaman too hailed the decision on Rajya Sabha and said that Syama Prasad's dream of 'Ek Rashtra, Ek Vidhan' has finally been fulfilled.

VHP too hailed the decision and said Syama Prasad Mukherjee's long-cherished dream has finally come to fruition.

he Centre on Monday repealed Article 370 which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir and a resolution in this regard was moved in the Rajya Sabha by Union Home Minister Amit Shah, amidst uproar by the opposition in the Upper House.

"All clauses of Article 370 of the Constitution, which gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir, will not be applicable in the state," Shah said while moving the resolution and added that it will come into effect after the President signs giving his assent and the central government notifies it.

Soon after Shah moved the resolution, a gazette notification in this regard was issued by the President.

Asserting that Article 370 did not allow proper integration of Jammu and Kashmir with India and should have been removed without delay, Shah said that the BJP-led government had the "political will" to take decisions concerning the "temporary" provision in the constitution.
