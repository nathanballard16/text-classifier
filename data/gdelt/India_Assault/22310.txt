India’s Main Opposition Party Chief Blames Ruling BJP for Carrying Out ‘Divisive Agenda’

Expressing “anguish and concern” over the “brute repression” unleashed by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led government on citizens, Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Friday accused the BJP of following “a divisive agenda” and labelled the Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) discriminatory.

In a televised address on Friday, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi said: “There have been spontaneous protests at universities, the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Indian Institute of Management (IIM) and other leading academic institutions against the divisive agenda and the anti-people policies of the BJP government. In a democracy, people have the right to raise their voices against the wrong decision of the government, and register their concerns.”

Gandhi said the BJP government has shown utter disregard for people’s voices and has chosen to use brute force to suppress dissent. “This is unacceptable in a democracy. The congress party condemns the actions of the BJP government and expresses solidarity with the people, Gandhi added.

The statement holds significance as it came on a day when Muslim protests were witnessed across the country against the Act. Also, it comes a day after the city saw sporadic protests in various parts, despite prohibitory orders by the administration.
