Why ‘award wapsi’ brigade silent on Alwar rape: PM Modi

GHAZIPUR: PM Narendra Modi on Sunday attacked the ‘award wapsi’ brigade, questioning their silence on the recent gang rape of a Dalit woman in Rajasthan’s Alwar. Modi, who was here to campaign for his cabinet colleague and Union telecom minister Manoj Sinha, was referring to a section of intellectuals who, in 2015, returned their national awards, alleging intolerance in the country over cattle trade, beef and lynching.“The crime was hushed up by the Congress government as Rajasthan was going to polls. This is the truth of the Congress’s ‘nyay’ (justice),” he said, in an apparent jibe at the income support scheme — NYAY — promised by Congress if it came to power. He escalated the attack on Congress, referring to it as a “mahamilawat” party that has, for last 60 years, worked on the principle of “hua toh hua”.He said this with reference to Congress chief Rahul Gandhi ’s tech guru Sam Pitroda ’s remarks on 1984 anti-Sikh riots. “Unka toh yeh mantra hi hai… hua toh hua. Desh mein garibon ka kharch badta raha, yeh mahamilavati kehte rahe hua toh hua,” the PM said. Modi also took a dig at BSP and SP leaders who questioned his caste, saying he was proud to have been born in OBC.“SP and BSP are attacking me over my caste. I was born in an OBC caste. I am burning the midnight oil to bring all those in the bottom of the pyramid in economic strata to find livelihood. Those who ask for my caste certificate, I have one answer for them: my caste is poverty and yet I am working to bring development,” he said. The PM said he owned no property in his 15-year tenure as Gujarat CM. “Neither have I made money for myself nor for my family. My record shows I never bought a property like some of these CMs”.
