Impose president's rule in WB: BJP

DHARWAD: BJP leaders and workers on Tuesday took out a protest rally in front of the deputy commissioner's office condemning the ‘dictatorial’ rule of West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and demanded imposition of President’s rule in that state.The protesters burnt a portrait of Banerjee and raised slogans against the WB government. They stated that the entire nation was watching the misrule and atrocities by the West Bengal government.“Mamata Banerjee is acting like a dictator and it seems like a dictatorship has been imposed on West Bengal as post-poll violence continues,” they alleged.During the Lok Sabha election, Mamata Banerjee had provoked her party cadre to target BJP leaders. After the election, atrocities on BJP workers and leaders have continued following a poor show by the TMC ,” the BJP workers charged.“This year a BJP leader’s wife was raped only because she was creating awareness among women to become self-employed. TMC workers assaulted her and then raped her,” said a protester.“The people in West Bengal are living in constant fear of attack by TMC workers if they perform any religious rituals. Doing pooja at home is the biggest crime in West Bengal and house owners are attacked by TMC workers,” the protestors charged.“On polling day, several booths were captured and vehicles of BJP leaders and candidates were vandalised. Continuing their violent behaviour against BJP workers, five BJP workers were killed in the last two days and scores of them have sustained injuries,” they said.“Even chanting Jai Sri Ram has become a crime in West Bengal and people are being arrested. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has become intolerant to Jai Sri Ram chant and is openly threatening people of filing FIRs,” they added.The BJP leaders urged the President to closely monitor the developments in West Bengal and to maintain law and order. The TMC government should be dismissed and president’s rule should be imposed, they urged.
