TikTok encourages pornography, want to ban it: State Commission for Women head, Telecom News, ET Telecom

There is an ongoing debate on whether the mobile video app TikTok should be banned in India. While the Tamil Nadu High Court banned it, there is a similar demand in Karnataka . The Karnataka State Commission for Women (KSCW) is planning to submit a writ appeal to the Supreme Court to ban the usage of the app.Nagalakshmi Bai, the head of the Commission, says, “TikTok is used by everyone and it encourages pornography . The videos that children using the app make are overtly sexual in nature, which is a reason for concern. We are worried about the ill-effects the app could have on young minds. Recently, there were incidents in Bengaluru and Mumbai involving children, where a teenaged boy sexually assaulted his younger sister. Apps like these are a reason that women are objectified.”A poll conducted by a news app revealed that 80% of its millennial users want apps like TikTok to be banned. The poll saw participation of 30,000 respondents, majorly from Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, belonging to the age group of 18-35 years across the country.
