Vanthali BJP leader killed over land dispute

Rajkot: General secretary of Vanthali BJP and former president of Vanthali municipality was stabbed to death by three assailants over a land dispute on the outskirts of Vanthli in Junagadh district on Friday evening.

Police said the two unidentified accused led by Bhupat Sutreja had allegedly stabbed Hitesh Vadariya (45) to death.

"It was while Vadariya was driving his scooter that the accused arrived on their two bikes, waylaid him near Kalwa river bridge and dealt him a dozen stabbing wounds, killing him on the spot," said M K Odedara, sub-inspector with Vanthali police station.

Sutreja was booked on the complaint of Vadariya's brother Bharat. Bharat told the cops that he had seen Sutreja waiting for Vadariya near his house and had alerted Vadariya about it. Once Vadariya started his scooter, Sutreja started his bike and went after him.

Meanwhile, the police investigation has revealed that Vadariya's elder brother Suresh had sold off their ancestral land to Sutreja and his partner Gaurav Ruparaliya. However, Sutreja and Ruparaliya were unable to secure the possession of the land as the land was possessed by Vadariya's mother Kanta.

When Vadariya came to know about the selling of the land, he filed a court case against Sutreja and Ruparaliya on behalf of Kanta. This angered Sutreja who started sending threat messages to Vadariya on WhatsApp and giving him threat calls, asking him to withdraw the case and hand over the possession of the land.
