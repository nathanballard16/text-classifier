New Delhi, Jan 31: The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has released country-wise statistics on rape crime rates (incidents per 100,000 population).

India fares well in a comparison of all countries by number of rape crimes per 100,000 population in the last decade. In fact, India performs much better than even advanced countries such as the US and many countries in Western Europe in terms of the crime rate of rapes. The number of rape cases in a country are a factor of its population size. This is why rape incidences or number of rapes per 100,000 population is a more accurate measure to understand which countries fare worst.
