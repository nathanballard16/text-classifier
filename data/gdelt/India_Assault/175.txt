Says ‘anguish’ from the pregnancy could affect her mental health.Theon Thursday allowed a 14-year-oldto terminate herA division bench of Justices BP Dharmadhikari and Revati Mohite-Dere said the pregnancy was allegedly the result of a rape, and hence the anguish caused by such a pregnancy may lead to a grave injury on the girl’s mental health.The girl had approached the court in December last year seeking permission to terminate her pregnancy. The HC had on December 26 ordered that a panel of doctors from theexamine her and submit a report on whether the termination of pregnancy was advisable.Passing its order on Thursday, the court took note of the medical report, which said that the pregnancy could be terminated.The girl had lodged a complaint with the Mankhurd police on December 1last year, alleging that she had been raped by a neighbour. The man was arrested.Under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, abortion beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy is prohibited. The Act provides for constitution of committees to look into cases where the pregnancy beyond this period is sought to be terminated. However, as the state has not formed these committees so far, women have to move court in such cases.
