Kulbhushan Jadhav Verdict Out Soon: Will Pak Propaganda Affect It?

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) will deliver its decision on 17 July on India’s petition in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. Jadhav is a retired Indian Navy officer who was abducted by Pakistan from Iran in March 2016. He was tried in secret by a military court and sentenced to death.

The Pakistan Army chief confirmed the sentence in April 2017, soon after one of its retired army officers disappeared from Nepal. There has been no report that he has been located. Obviously the Pakistan Army thought that Indian secret agencies were behind this act.
