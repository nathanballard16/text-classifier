Pakistan not to participate in meeting of FMs of OIC member-states

Baku, Azerbaijan, March 1

By Rufiz Hafizoglu - Trend:

Pakistan will not participate in the meeting of foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member-states, to be held in Abu Dhabi on March 1, Trend reports referring to the Arabic media.

Reportedly, the reason for Pakistan’s refusal is the UAE’s official invitation of India to attend the meeting as an honored guest.

The meeting of foreign ministers will be held on March 1-2, 2019 in Abu Dhabi and will be the 46th meeting in a row.

On Feb. 26 morning, Indian Air Force fighter jets attacked a big training camp of the Islamist group Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistani part of Kashmir. As a result of the air raid, many militants were eliminated, their vehicles, weapons and ammunition were completely destroyed.

Indian First Deputy Foreign Minister Vijay Gokhale said that a preemptive strike was "absolutely necessary" because the group was preparing suicide attacks in various parts of India.

Moreover, according to New Delhi’s opinion, Pakistan has not yet taken any practical steps to eliminate the infrastructure of terrorists on its territory.

The crisis in relations between India and Pakistan sharply worsened after Feb. 14, when a suicide bomber blew himself up near paramilitary policemen in Jammu and Kashmir in northern India. Forty-five people were killed as a result of the attack.

According to New Delhi, responsibility for the attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed.

India accused Pakistan of supporting terrorist groups. Islamabad dismissed the allegations as “unsubstantiated,” suggesting New Delhi to conduct joint investigation into the incident.
