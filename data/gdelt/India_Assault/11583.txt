'Suicidal' affair: ASI, constable found dead in room at Rajkot

An assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and constable of surveillance squad, posted with the Rajkot University police station were found dead inside a room on Thursday morning. Primary investigation revealed that the duo, who the police suspect was in a relationship, have committed suicide by shooting themselves with a service revolver.

The deceased have been identified as Raviraj Sinh Jadeja, a constable of 2011 batch and Khushboo Kanabar, ASI of 2016 batch. They were found dead inside Kanabar's apartment located near Rajkot 150 Feet Ring road.

As per police officials, Jadeja's father Ashok Jadeja, also a police officer, is posted with Rajkot police department. Jadeja was married and has a two-month-old daughter and lived with his father in Mavdi police headquarters.

When Jadeja did not return home on Wednesday, his father tried calling him but in vain. He then asked his son's friends to search for him.

Jadeja's friends, who knew about the affair, went straight to her apartment in search of Jadeja. When nobody opened the door, they broke into the house and found the duo lying in a pool of blood, with a pistol next to them.

After the police were informed, a team with FSL experts reached the spot to investigate. "Investigations have revealed that both have died of bullet shots, but we are yet to draw a conclusion about what had actually happened," said Manoj Agrawal, Commissioner of Rajkot police.

Cops suspect that both must have shot themselves using the revolver allotted to Kushboo or Khushboo must have shot Jadeja first after she came to know of his marital status before shooting herself.

"No third person was involved in the crime, as the house was locked from inside. We can reach to a conclusion once we get FSL reports," said Agrawal.
