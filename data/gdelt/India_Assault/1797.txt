Investigation revealed that the accused used to watch chain snatching videos on YouTube and used to practice them before eventually implementing them. Satish Mane, a senior police inspector of Wakad police station told HT that the accused used to attack elderly women wearing chains and managalsutras and used to snatch them.

After similar cases and the increasing menace created by the chain snatchers, the Gurugram police has come up with a new strategy. The Gurugram police has drafted a new plan under which female cops will stand at areas where chain snatching is common wearing artificial jewellery.

The idea is to tempt the criminals into committing the crime and catching them red-handed. Gurugram police has begun training 200 female police officers who will be deployed at these areas to catch the snatchers. The female police officers will pretend to be commoners and will wear artificial jewellery to entice the criminals. However, they will be backed with a team so that when the snatchers come, they can easily be caught.
