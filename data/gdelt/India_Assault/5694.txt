The Madras High Court had in 2009 sentenced the accused to life imprisonment.

The convicts had appealed the sentence in the Supreme Court which had granted them bail the same year, the report said.

Santhakumar joined Saravana Bhavan in 1999. In October 2001, the couple had filed a police complaint against Rajagopal and his gang, saying they had been abducted and intimidated, the report said.

Santhakumar was abducted from Chennai the same month.

His body was found by forest officials at Perumalmalai in Kodaikanal, according to The Hindu’s report.
