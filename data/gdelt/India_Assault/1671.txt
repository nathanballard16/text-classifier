Woman in India arrested for recreating Gandhi's assassination

A leader of a fringe Hindu right-wing group in India has been arrested after a video of her shooting an effigy of Mahatma Gandhi went viral.



The Hindu Mahasabha had organised an event to "celebrate" the 71st anniversary of Gandhi's assassination.



In the video, Pooja Pandey shoots the effigy with an air pistol after garlanding a picture of Nathuram Godse, who shot the independence leader.



Gandhi has long been seen as too moderate by some right-wing Hindus.



Police had been seeking Ms Pandey's arrest since the video, believed to have been released by her group, emerged last week.



Two police teams were deployed to track her and her husband, who also features prominently in the footage.



They had already made several other arrests in connection with the video which was shot on 30 January - the day Gandhi was killed.



"We arrested nine people within a week and are searching for two more suspects in the case," police officer Neeraj Jadaun told the BBC.
