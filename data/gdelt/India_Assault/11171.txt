Irish Human Rights Lawyer Who Abused Air India Crew With Racist Expletives Found Dead In England

Simone Burns, the 50-year old Irish international human rights lawyer whose racist rant against Air India crew had gone viral on social media, has been found dead in a case of alleged suicide.

As per a Gulf News report, the body was found at the foot of cliffs in East Sussex on 1 June, 13 days after she was released from prison on 20 May.

East Sussex police have now released the following statement, “The body of a woman found at Beachy Head on 1 June has been identified as 50-year-old Simone Burns from Hove. The death is not being treated as suspicious and the next of kin have been informed. The matter has been passed to the coroner's officer."

Burns had been sentenced to six months in prison for being drunk on the plane and two months for assault.

After being denied a fourth bottle of wine, Burns had erupted into an abusive rant while flying with Air India from Mumbai to Heathrow last November. Calling Air India staff as ‘Indian money grabbers’ Burns demanded that they be grateful to her for her work for India and Pakistan.

She continued on her racist tirade despite being served a written warning by the plane’s captain as she spat in the face of one the crew members while abusing other crew members and co-passengers.
