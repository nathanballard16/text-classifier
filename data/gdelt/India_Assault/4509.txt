New Delhi: The defence ministry on Saturday morning rejected the reports of abduction of a soldier in Jammu and Kashmir’s Budgam district, adding that the “individual is safe”.

“Media reports of the abduction of a serving Army soldier (Mohammad Yaseen) on leave from Qazipora, Chadoora, Budgam(J&K) are incorrect. Individual is safe. Speculations may please be avoided,” said the defence ministry statement.

On Friday, several reports emerged saying that unknown gunmen kidnapped Yaseen from his home in Qazipora Chadoora.

Yaseen, who is from the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAKLI), has been on leave from February 26 till March 30.

In June, an Army soldier Aurangzeb of 44 Rashtriya Rifles posted in south Kashmir’s Shopian district was abducted by militants and his bullet-riddled body was found 10 kilometres away from the place of kidnapping.
