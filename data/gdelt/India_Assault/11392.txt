For the first time since a rape complaint was filed against him, Binoy Kodiyeri has appeared before the Oshiwara police in Mumbai. Binoy is the son of CPI(M) Kerala state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. Dindoshi branch of the City Civil and Sessions Court in Mumbai had granted him anticipatory bail in the case on July 3.

The Oshiwara police in Mumbai has booked Binoy under IPC sections 376 (rape) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property on the complaint) on a complaint filed by a Mumabi based woman.

Binoy had been absconding ever since the police began a probe into the case, and the investigating team couldn’t trace him for several days. On July 3, he was granted bail on a personal bond of Rs 25,000, and on the condition that he would present himself before the police every Monday between 10 am and 1 pm, for a month, for investigation. He also will have to appear for medical examination as and when asked for by the investigating officers.

The complainant is a native of Bihar, and had filed a rape case against Binoy on June 13. She alleged that he had raped her for years on the promise of marriage, and that she has an 8-year-old child with him. Binoy denied the allegations, and claimed the woman was blackmailing him and that he had lodged a complaint with the Kannur Range IG in this regard.

The CPI(M) in general and Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in particular took the stand that Binoy has to face the case individually. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan in a press meet on Friday also said that it was an issue related to an individual and won’t affect the party.
