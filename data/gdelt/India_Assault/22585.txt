VADODARA: A special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) court sentenced a 22-year-old man to 10 years rigorous imprisonment for sodomizing a nine-year-old boy in Angadh village in March 2015.

The court of special Pocso judge fined the convict Pravin alias Dhamo Gohil of Rs 11,000 and ordered to pay compensation of Rs 50,000 to the boy, who was studying in Class III then.

According to the details of the case, Gohil committed the crime when the boy had gone to his house to watch television after coming from school. The boy’s mother’s complaint stated that he used to go to Gohil’s house daily to watch the television.

However, on March 31, 2015, Gohil lured the boy by offering Rs 10 and then sodomized him. When the boy shouted for help, Gohil threatened to beat him up.

On returning home, the boy did not tell his mother about the ordeal, but on the same evening when she made him sit to have tea, he cried in pain and narrated the trauma. By then, Gohil had fled the village, but he was nabbed after the boy’s mother lodged a complaint with Chhani police station.

During the trial, the additional public prosecutor H R Joshi submitted forensic and medical evidence and the boy and his mother also testified in the court. The court upheld the evidence and testimony and turned down Gohil’s arguments that a false case was registered against him as the boy’s family and his family were involved in a feud over a road in the village.
