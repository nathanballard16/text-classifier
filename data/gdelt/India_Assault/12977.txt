New Delhi, August 1

The Lok Sabha today passed a Bill providing stringent punishment, including death penalty, for aggravated sexual assault on children.

The Bill was earlier passed by the Rajya Sabha and will now go for a formal nod to the President before it becomes an Act. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, 2019, was passed with near unanimity in the Lower House. It also provides for fines and imprisonment to curb child pornography.

WCD Minister Smriti Irani, replying to queries by members, said she would make a provision for including the word “morphing” the images of children for use in pornography. Irani said it was decided that no clause for “consent” be allowed for children less than 18 years of age. “It is a matter of concern that the number of child sex offenders is increasing and conviction rate declining.” — TNS
