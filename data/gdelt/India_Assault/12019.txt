Aditya Pancholi gets interim protection from arrest in rape case

Actor Aditya Pancholi was on Friday granted interim protection till August 3 by a Mumbai court in a rape case filed against him by a Bollywood actor. The Dindoshi Sessions court granted relief to the actor as the public prosecutor sought time to go through the papers of investigating agencies.

Earlier this month Pancholi was granted with interim relief till July 19, a day after he filed for an anticipatory bail in the session court.

In June, the Mumbai Police filed an FIR under charges of rape against Pancholi on the complaint of a renowned Bollywood actor.
