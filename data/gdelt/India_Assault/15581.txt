Shahjahanpur sexual harassment case: UP set to file case against Chinmayanand

New Delhi: Swami Chinmayanand is set to face rape charges after a young woman employed in the former BJP MP and Union minister’s college in Shahjahanpur reiterated her charges before a magistrate on Monday.A case under Sections 375 and 376 of Indian Penal Code may be lodged against Chinmayanand, as he was in a “position of power and authority” and the woman’s judicial confession that she was forced into sexual acts owing to fear and blackmail is crucial evidence, said a person aware of the matter.The seer-cum-politician has been questioned twice by a special investigation team (SIT) set up by the Uttar Pradesh government. The SIT has also received a copy of a complaint of rape lodged by the woman in a Delhi police station after she was found in Rajasthan.The BJP has kept itself at arm’s length from the matter and senior state party leaders have refrained from any making any comments backing Chinmayanand. This comes after the rape case against the BJP’s Unnao MLA, Kuldeep Singh Sengar , had brought the party much flak, prompting it to first suspend and then expel Sengar from the party. However, the party has taken no such action against Chinmayanand so far.“Let the SIT complete its job first. We are under clear instructions not to speak on this matter till then,” a senior state BJP functionary told ET. The party is, however, still under attack as questions have been raised by opposition parties on why the SIT had not lodged a rape case so far despite the girl in her police statement making the rape charge and her father submitting as many as 43 videos of the alleged sexual harassment to the SIT last week.A senior UP government functionary however said “there was no reason to doubt the investigation” since the SIT headed by an inspector general-level officer was doing so on orders of the Supreme Court and under the supervision of the Allahabad High Court.
