KOLKATA: Officers probing the bomb and bullet attack on Trinamool Youth Congress leader Biswajit Prasad (32) arrested two persons on Saturday. Police said Surajit Mondal and Badal Chowdhury had attacked Prasad, a building material supplier, over business rivalry on Friday.

“The two persons were arrested on the basis of statement provided by the victim, as well as footage captured on the CCTV

cameras in the Dum Dum Park neighbourhood where the attack took place. The men were charged under multiple sections of IPC and Arms and Explosives Act,” said an officer.

Prasad was having a chat at a tea stall outside Dum Dum Tarun Sangha Park in Lake Town when six men on two bikes hurled bombs at him. Prasad suffered splinter injuries in his legs. “While fleeing the area, the men fired, but no one was shot at,” a police officer said.

Police said Prasad had developed a rivalry with the two, who were also in the real estate business. The two men allegedly also wanted control over a club, where Prasad is the president.
