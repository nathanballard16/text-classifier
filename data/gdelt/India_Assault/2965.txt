India withdraws security for Kashmir separatist leaders

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Jammu and Kashmir state withdrew the security details for 18 separatist leaders and 155 other opposition figures on Wednesday after an Islamist suicide bomber killed 40 paramilitary troopers last week.

The restive mountain state is currently administered by India's federal government after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party walked out a coalition with a major Kashmiri party.
