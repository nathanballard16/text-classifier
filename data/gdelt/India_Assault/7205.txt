CB-CID SP to probe death of boy

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday was informed that S. Rajeswari, Superintendent of Police-CB-CID, has been nominated as investigating officer to probe the custodial torture and resultant death of a 17 year-old boy from Madurai.

Justice N. Seshasayee directed the CB-CID to file a status report of thes case on June 6. The court had earlier transferred the case to the CB-CID expressing its displeasure over how it was handled by the police. It observed that the police, the Government Rajaji Hospital and the Juvenile Justice Board had not acted fairly.

The court questioned why a post mortem was not conducted after the boy’s death. It also asked why no action was taken even after a complaint of custodial torture was brought to the notice of the judicial magistrate. The judge observed serious lapses in investigation.

The mother of the boy had moved the court seeking post mortem and a CB-CID probe in March. She had complained that the S.S. Colony police took her son for inquiry regarding a jewel theft. The boy, who was initially let off, was picked up again a week later, kept in illegal custody for three days and was subjected to torture. Later he was admitted to Government Rajaji Hospital for treatment where he succumbed to his injuries on January 24.
