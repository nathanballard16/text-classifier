Not afraid of arrest: Kamal Haasan on Godse remark

CHENNAI: Makkal Needhi Maiam president Kamal Haasan remained firm about his ‘ Hindu extremism’ remark and said it was not the first time he had made it.“There was nothing wrong in what I said and this was not the first time the issue (Hindu extremism) is being spoken about. It has been there for years. Even I mentioned it 15 days ago at a Marina beach venue in Chennai on the last day of campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls. But, no one seemed to have noticed it,” Kamal told reporters in Chennai on Friday.“May be those who feel hurt now were confident of winning then. They would have now realised they are losing and hence grabbing at the issue,” the actor said on his return to the city.On Thursday night, while he was winding up his campaign in Aravakurichi , miscreants hurled stones, slippers and eggs at him. Haasan said he was not afraid of being arrested, even as the Madras high court posted the hearing on his anticipatory bail for May 20. He, however, warned any such action against him will escalate violence.
