New Delhi:

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Thursday visit Rajasthan’s Alwar district and met the woman, who was allegedly gang-raped in front of her husband. The Congress president assured the woman that her culprits will be brought to justice. "Soon after I heard about the incident (Alwar gang rape) I spoke to Ashok Gehlot Ji. This is not a political issue for me. I met the victim's family and they have sought justice which will be done. Action will be taken against culprits," Rahul Gandhi said after meeting the victims.

Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, Deputy CM Sachin Pilot and Congress national general secretary Avinash Pandey also accompanied the Congress president, who was earlier scheduled to meet the victim on Wednesday.

On April 26, six people allegedly gang raped the woman in front of her husband on the Thanagazi-Alwar bypass. While the accused took their turn to outrage the modesty of the woman, one of them shot the incident in his mobile phone and distributed the video on social media.

The victims alleged police negligence and claimed that they were told to wait till the elections are over. Rajasthan went on poll in fourth and fifth phase on April 29 and May 6. After the matter came to light on May 6, the Rajasthan government suspended Always SP Rajiv Pachar and Thanagazi SHO. Subsequently, five accused, who allegedly raped the woman, and the one who shot and circulated the video clip, have been arrested.

The incident triggered widespread protests in Alwar, Jaipur, Dausa and nearby areas. Protests demanding justice for the Alwar gang rape victims in Rajasthan’s Dausa district turned violent on Tuesday with at least five policemen injured by stone pelting.

The Opposition BJP has been demanding CM Ashok Gehlot's resgination over the incident, which was also condemned by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BSP supremo Mayawati and other leaders.
