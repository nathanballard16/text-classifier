Garbage set on fire near Shaniwar Wada

Locals have complained of civic staffers violating the norms; PMC claims it was unaware of this issue so far



The area surrounding Shaniwar Wada is shrouded in smoke due to burning of dry leaves and garbage, much to the annoyance of locals. They have already made complaints in this regard to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), which is yet to come up with a solution for the ordeal. The residents claim that the burning is not only posing a health risk, but is also soiling the beauty of the historic monument.



“On one hand, our country is doing its best to combat pollution, on the other hand, waste — dry leaves and garbage — is routinely set on fire at Shaniwar Wada,” said Santosh Narlikar, an area resident.



The staffers gather dry leaves and garbage on the rear side of the monument and set it on fire. The smoke from this activity engulfs the entire area, due to which families have claimed to be suffering. “People become uneasy due to the smoke and the stench from the dump. Many asthma patients are suffering the most,” Narlikar added.



The law prohibits burning and instead dictates that dry leaves and grass from public spaces are to be put in compost pits and later be used as manure. “Whoever violates these norms must face action,” he asserted.



Dnyaneshwar Molak, head of PMC’s solid waste management department, said he was unaware about the burning at this location. “I will look into this. There is a specific set of instructions to be followed by workers assigned by the state archaeology department at the wada, during maintenance and cleaning. What they are doing is illegal and unacceptable. I have issued a warning saying that if they are found repeating their actions, PMC will escalate the matter,” he said.
