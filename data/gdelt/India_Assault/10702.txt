Mumbai court to give verdict on Binoy Kodiyeri’s anticipatory bail plea today

Mumbai: The verdict on the anticipatory bail plea filed by Binoy Kodiyeri in connection with a rape case will be given by Mumbai Dindoshi Sessions Court on Thursday at 3 pm. Mumbai police made it clear that Binoy will be arrested immediately, if he is not granted bail.

Earlier, Binoy’s lawyer had pointed out in the court that the woman’s statements are contradictory. The woman had said in the complaint sent to Binoy that he married her and she wanted Rs 5 crore as compensation. But according to the statement given to the police, she was raped on false promise of marriage.

Binoy’s lawyer emphasised on the point that rape charge cannot be imposed if he married the woman. He also argued that the case was fabricated for blackmailing. Meanwhile, the prosecution argued that Binoy should be taken into custody in order to conduct a DNA test to determine the child’s paternity.

If the court is convinced that rape charges cannot be imposed, Binoy is likely to be granted anticipatory bail. The plea was filed last Friday and the verdict postponed to Thursday. The Bihar woman lodged the complaint with Oshiwara police against Binoy on June 13.
