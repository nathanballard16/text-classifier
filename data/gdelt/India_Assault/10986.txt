Lucknow: A man who was about to be buried, after being declared dead by a private hospital in Lucknow turned out to be actually alive and is not on ventilator life support.

The 20-year-old Mohammad Furqan was admitted to a private hospital on June 21 after an accident. He was declared dead on Monday and his body arrived at his home in an ambulance.

His elder brother Mohammad Irfan told IANS, "Devastated, we were preparing for the burial when some of us saw movement in his limbs. We immediately took Furqan to the Ram Manohar Lohia hospital where the doctors said he was alive and have put him on ventilator support."

"We had paid Rs. 7 lakh to the private hospital earlier and when we told them that we had run out of money, they had declared Furqan dead on Monday," Irfan said.

Lucknow Chief Medical Officer (CMO) Narendra Agarwal said, "We have taken cognizance of the incident and the matter will be thoroughly probed."

"The patient is in critical condition but definitely not brain dead. He has pulse, blood pressure and his reflexes are working. He has been put on ventilator support," the doctor treating Furqan said.
