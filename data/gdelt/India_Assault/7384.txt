Bigg Boss star Ajaz Khan booked for assaulting model, director at fashion event

Former Bigg Boss contestant Ajaz Khan has landed in trouble after being accused of bashing up a model and the director of a fashion event in Mumbai. The Vashi police registered an FIR (first information report) against the actor and his bodyguards and they have been booked for rioting and assault.

Ajaz Khan was supposed to walk the ramp as a showstopper for a designer at India Design Week at the CIDCO Exhibition Centre in Vashi.

"Mr. Khan was asked to arrive at the venue at 9 p.m., but showed up at 7.30 p.m. When he was made to sit with the audience in the front row, Mr. Khan and his bodyguards picked a fight with the organisers. They wanted to know they were not given a special room," a police officer told The Hindu.

The reality TV star and his bodyguards reportedly attacked Sam Abdul Shikur Khan, the director of the show, after an argument. Pankajkumar Rajendrakumar, a model, who tried to intervene also got bashed up. Ajaz Khan reportedly left after the fight and his show was cancelled.

The complainants also accused Ajaz Khan of filming women models and singing vulgar songs.

Ajaz Khan denies the allegations and told Hindustan Times: "It was a badly organised event, and the models were not provided food, water or AC. I heard some people arguing over the payments as well. The organisers then called bouncers and a fight broke out between them and the models. I tried to stop them. I don’t think my name is in the FIR or else they [police] would have called me. It is irresponsible... to blame me. I am a punching bag. A model has taken a video of the incident and I have proof I was not involved."
