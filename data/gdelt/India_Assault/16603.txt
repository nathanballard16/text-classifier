25 cases solved with arrest of 3 snatchers

Ludhiana: The police on Friday claimed to have busted a gang of snatchers, with the arrest of three, including a juvenile.

With their arrest, the cops claimed to have solved at least 25 cases of snatching. As many as 21 stolen cellphones and two motorcycles used to execute the crime were recovered from Binderpal Singh of Lohara, Lal Bihari of Shimlapuri and the 16-year-old juvenile.

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “The gang has been active in the city since 2012. They mostly struck on Gill Road, in Daba and Lohara, among other areas. Commuters and pedestrians were their targets.”

Even as 21 cellphones were recovered from their possession, FIRs were lodged only in three cases. At times, they struck thrice in a day, he added.

Additional deputy commissioner of police-1 Gurpreet Singh Sikand said, “Binderpal is the kingpin of the gang and the juvenile an expert in snatching. After coming out on bail 10 days ago, the juvenile again took to the crime. Binderpal and Lal Bihari were also lodged in jail and came out on bail a few months ago.”

The gang had tied up with a mobile shop owner, who helped them unlock the stolen cellphones. “They would then sell each phone for Rs 2,500 to Rs 3,000,” he added.

Inspector Rajwant Singh said, “While looking for a prey, the juvenile would ride pillion. And after snatching his cellphone, he would swiftly change the seat with the driver on the moving bike to avoid getting caught. We are trying to trace the mobile shop owner, who helped unlock snatched cellphones. The gang confessed to have executed six snatchings in Daba, two in division 2, 10 in Shimlapuri, two in division 6 and one in Daresi.”

The three were arrested from near Local Adda, close to railway station, on a tip-off.
