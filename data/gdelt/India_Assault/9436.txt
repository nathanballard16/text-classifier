Clashes between TMC and BJP workers/supporters have continued unabated even after the conclusion of Lok Sabha election 2019. During polling, there was widespread violence which had prompted the Election Commission to replace state police with central forces at polling stations. This, however, could not guarantee peace and order and while most of the central forces' companies have since left the state, incidents of violence have continued nonetheless.
