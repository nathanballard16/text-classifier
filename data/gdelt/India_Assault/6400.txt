Special court nixes Prajapati's bail plea in gangrape case

ALLAHABAD: Special court (MP and MLA) on Friday rejected the bail application of former UP cabinet minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati in a gang rape case wherein he is the main accused.Rejecting the bail application of Prajapati, special judge Pawan Kumar Tiwari said that the petitioner is the main accused in the matter. “The evidence of some witnesses are still to be taken up. The petitioner may influence the trial. Hence, taking into the gravity of the offence, the bail cannot be granted to him,” the court added.District government counsel (criminal) Gulab Chandra Agrahri said that earlier at one stage during the trial proceedings, the cross-examination of the survivor girl had taken place. The evidence of other witnesses would also be taken up during the course of trial, he added.Earlier, a special POCSO court had framed charges against Prajapati and six other co-accused in the gang rape case. The court had charged Gayatri and co-accused Vikas, Ashish, Ashok Amrendra, Chandrapal and Rupeshwar under sections 376 (D), 354A(1), 509, 504 and 506 of IPC. Gayatri, Vikas, Ashish and Ashok have also been charged under section 5(G) read with section 6 of the POSCO Act.The girl had lodged an FIR with Gautampalli police of Lucknow on February 18, 2017, on the direction of the Supreme Court. Later, the investigating officer filed a chargesheet against the accused persons, including Prajapati.Subsequently, after the setting up of the special court (MP and MLA), as per the direction of the apex court, the matter was shifted here.This court exclusively deals with criminal cases pending against members of state legislature and Parliament.
