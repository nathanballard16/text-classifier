India’s bellicosity a threat to peace: Qureshi

Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Sunday said Pakistan had responded to India’s threatening posture with extreme caution and responsibility.“We have asked India to share actionable evidence with us in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack so that the matter could be pursued,” he said.The foreign minister made the remarks during telephonic conversations with his German counterpart Heiko Maas and Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.Qureshi took the two foreign diplomats into confidence over India’s belligerence and the threat it posed to regional peace in his efforts to highlight Pakistan’s stance to the international community.“We have extended full cooperation to India in investigating the Pulwama attack,” the foreign minister told them.The EU representative assured the foreign minister of full support in Pakistan’s effort to de-escalate tensions with India.Qureshi, while briefing the EU representative about baseless Indian allegations and aggressive threats, said “Pakistan responded to the incident with extreme caution and responsibility”.The German foreign minister and the EU representative expressed satisfaction over their bilateral relations.In addition to the Kashmir issue, the foreign minister also held discussions with them over key regional and international issues.The EU representative lauded Pakistan’s stance and stressed the need to peacefully resolve all outstanding disputes between the two countries through dialogue.Meanwhile, talking to the media, Qureshi said “India is mistaken to think that it can put Pakistan under pressure by creating war hysteria”, while reiterating the government's desire for peace.“Pakistan is a peace-loving nation and making efforts to reduce tensions in the region,” he said.However, the foreign minister reminded India that Pakistan would retaliate in equal measure to any aggression from across the border.Qureshi said India had replied to Pakistan’s efforts for peace by deploying an additional 10,000 troops in occupied Kashmir.The foreign minister demanded that the murder of innocent civilians be stopped immediately as the Kashmiris were embroiled in an atmosphere of fear.“Properties are being attacked while search operations are being conducted. Dozens of arrests are being made and the Hurriyat leadership is being shifted to unknown location,” he said while quoting former puppet chief minister of IOK Mehbooba Mufti as saying that “it cannot eliminate the ideology or enthusiasm of Kashmiris through arrests”.He said a new 'spring' was being witnessed among the youth of Indian Occupied Kashmir.Earlier in the day, the foreign minister met former foreign secretaries and envoys in order to formulate a strategy to navigate developments on the foreign affairs front in the wake of the Pulwama attack.The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, quoting Qureshi, tweeted that the consultation was held to discuss the hostile ambitions of India and the deteriorating situation in Kashmir.Qureshi said that the consultations with former diplomats were held in order to get their input so that a comprehensive and effective response could be devised to tackle emerging developments.The foreign minister, after the meeting, said that the discussion with former secretaries over issues pertaining to foreign policy, including the situation in occupied Kashmir, was helpful, adding that the ministry would try to continue the consultations in the future as well.
