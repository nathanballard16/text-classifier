Accused Threatens Rape Survivor with Repercussions Worse than in Unnao Gang-Rape, if She Testifies

Days, after a gang-rape survivor was set on fire, allegedly by some men in Unnao district of India’s Uttar Pradesh state, a woman who had reportedly been raped last year in Delhi, has been threatened with a fate worse than that.

On 6 December, in a separate case, the 23-year-old Unnao rape victim succumbed to her 90 per cent burns injuries at a Delhi hospital, days after being attacked with sharp objects and set ablaze while on her way to court. The attack was allegedly carried out by the same men that were accused of raping her.

In the latest incident, a pamphlet has been placed outside the house of a Delhi rape survivor in her hometown Bhaghpat in Uttar Pradesh, reading: “If you (rape survivor) testify on 13 December in court then the consequences will be horrific. And the consequences will be worse than in Unnao”, the pamphlet pasted on the house read.
