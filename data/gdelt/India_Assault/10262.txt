Jalna: A man was killed allegedly by his sister's boyfriend in Maharashtra's Jalna district after he opposed their relationship. The incident occurred on Wednesday at Parath village of Bhokardan tehsil in Jalna.

The victim has been identified as 22-year-old Swapnil Bhutte. The police have arrested the main accused Kumar Anup Sonwane and his friend Karan Shelke.



According to a report in PTI, the victim got to know about his sister's affair with the accused Anup Sonwane and warned him to stay away from his cousin sister citing bad reputation it will bring to the girl's family.

According to police, the victim's body was found on June 14 at a field in Parath. His face was smashed with a heavy object.

During the course of investigation, police found that Bhutte's sister was in love with Sonwane.

Bhutte had also informed the girl's family about the love affair. The girl subsequently told Sonwane to end the relationship as his family was against it.

Angry with Bhutte, Sonwane alongwith his friend cornered the victim and killed him. The police have booked the duo for murder. Police said Sonwane was arrested from his relative's house in Aurangabad, while his friend was held from Buldana.
