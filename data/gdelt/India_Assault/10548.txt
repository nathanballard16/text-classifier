PD Act invoked against Nayeem’s associates

For resorting to organised crime, says Police Commissioner

The Rachakonda police on Monday invoked the Preventive Detention Act against three associates of slain gangster Mohammed Nayeemuddin and his wife Haseena Begum.

Besides being history-sheeters, they have resorted to their ‘organised crime’ of threatening land owners, settling disputes, and buying land at cheaper rates, Police Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said. Invoking the PD Act against them is aimed at preserving public order and preventing them from committing such crimes in future, he added.

It may be recalled that the Bhongir police had arrested Pasham Srinivas, Mohammed Abdul Faheem, Mohammed Abdul Nasir and Ms. Begum on March 11, almost three years after Nayeem’s killing, when similar complaints surfaced in the town.

Criminal intimidation

According to the police, Nayeem’s close associate Srinu was involved in as many as 105 cases, Nasir in 87 cases and Ms. Begum in 29 cases relating to criminal intimidation, kidnaps and extortion.

They were all detained under the PD Act earlier, but they resumed their activities after being released from jail, the Police Commissioner said.

The three men are now sent to the Cherlapally central prison and Ms. Begum sent to Special Prison for Women at Chanchalguda in Hyderabad.
