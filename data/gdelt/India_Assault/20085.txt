Civic body in quandary over lighting up Navlakhi Ground

VADODARA: ‘How do we light up a ground like Navlakhi?’ — a dilemma that has put Vadodara Municipal Corporation (VMC) in quasi-legal quandary after the gang-rape on November 28.The only feasible solution, according to officials, was installing solar lights in the compound.While the issue of illuminating the ground has been discussed by the civic body officials and the city police ever since the infamous incident took place, there is no clarity regarding the commencement of work.The issue was also discussed during the visit of minister of state for home Pradeepsinh Jadeja However, VMC officials are yet to receive any clear instructions regarding the work.The Navlakhi land is divided between royal scions Samarjitsinh Gaekwad and his uncle Sangramsinh Gaekwad.“The area is a private property. We will need a nod from the standing committee as well as the owners of the property for conducting work on lighting up the ground,” said officials, also expressing concern regarding the expenses for the work.VMC says the open land and some roads inside it could be illuminated, but it would be difficult to illuminate the entire forest-like land. High mast lamps have been suggested for this, but it would require many such lamps.The engineers are not sure if these masts with high voltage lights could be solar powered.They said that they would examine options once a decision was finalized on illuminating the land.
