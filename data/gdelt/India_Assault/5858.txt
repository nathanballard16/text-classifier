Three Pakistan Army soldiers have been killed and one injured in Rakhchikri sector of Rawalkot as Indian Army retaliated strongly to unprovoked shelling by Pakistani troops in Poonch of the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir that had on Monday claimed three lives, including a 5-years old girl.

Quoting Pakistan Army's ISPR, Radio Pakistan confirmed that Pakistani troops Subedar Muhammad Riaz, Lance Hawaldar Azizullah and Sepoy Shahid Mansab have been killed due to cross-LOC shelling. Rawalkot is across Poonch in Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir (PoJK).

Pakistani troops for past 4 days have been raining mortars in civilian areas of Poonch and Rajouri districts of Jammu and the Indian Army was retaliating strongly.

A BSF officer, a 5-year-old girl Sobia Shafiq, and a woman were killed and about 20 others, including six Army and four BSF personnel, were injured on Monday when Pakistani troops indulged in unprovoked heavy shelling at several civilian areas and Indian Army positions in Poonch district.

The martyred BSF Inspector was identified as T Alex Lalminlun.

Several houses were destroyed in different villages as the Pakistani troops targeted the civilian areas in Bandichachian, Gulpur, Digwar, Dingla and Banpat and at least 10 civilians were injured.

The day-long shelling by Pakistani troops has created panic in the villages along the LoC in Poonch and Rajouri districts of the Jammu division as several children and women were among the injured.
