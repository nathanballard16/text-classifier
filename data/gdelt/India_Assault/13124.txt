Police in Gujarat’s Godra arrested six people on Friday for assaulting three minor boys.

According to a complaint filed by the father of one of the boys, his son and his two friends were out on Thursday night when the attack happened. The complaint says that the three were thrashed for not chanting ‘Shri Ram’.

However, Panchmahals SP Leena Patil told The Indian Express, “(The) boys had been involved in an altercation and the attack didn’t happen because of not chanting Shri Ram.”
