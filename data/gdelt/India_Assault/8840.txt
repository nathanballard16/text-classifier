A youth opened fire in a hotel in Robertsganj in Uttar Pradesh’s Sonbhadra district on Saturday, injuring a man. He was stalking a Bhojpuri actress who was staying at the hotel.

The youth was identified as Pankaj Yadav. He was stalking Bhojpuri film actress Ritu Singh and broke into her room at the hotel with a pistol. He held the actress hostage and threatened her to marry him, according to media reports.

Crew members of the Bhojpuri film unit from Mumbai were staying at the hotel for a film shoot when the incident took place.

After a local youth named Ashok intervened, the accused fired at him. Ashok was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital.

On hearing the gunshot, hotel staffers informed the police. A police team headed by the SP reached the spot immediately.

SP Patil was also injured while trying to engage with Yadav and asking him to surrender his pistol. Yadav opened fire at the SP and a bullet passed by his ear.

Police then overpowered Yadav and arrested him. The police investigation is underway.

"Pankaj continued pointing pistol at Ritu and me. He was adamant to marry her," SP Patil was quoted saying to the media.

According to media reports, the youth was stalking the actress for a long time now.
