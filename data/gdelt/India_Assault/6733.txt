NOIDA: The manager of a software company was allegedly abducted at gunpoint by at least six assailants who barged into the office of Metro Info Solutions in Sector 63 on Friday. The gang allegedly pulled Paritosh Gaurav into a car and fled the spot after asking the owner of the firm to hand over Rs 10 lakh if they wanted to see him alive, the FIR said.

Circle Officer II Piyush Singh, however, said the FIR was under scrutiny and the contents were being verified to ascertain the sequence of events. As the owner informed police, the car was given a chase by a team from Phase III police station. The abductors allegedly pushed Paritosh out of the car and fled.

In the FIR filed on the complaint of Akash Srivastava, who identified himself as director in Metro Info Solutions, it is mentioned that Paritosh has around 20-25 people working under him. “As many as six-seven people who arrived armed with guns entered the company and then his (Paritosh’s) cabin. As soon as they entered, they demanded Rs 10 lakh from him. When Paritosh expressed inability in giving the amount, they pushed him inside the car and forcefully took him away. I called up the 100 number after which police arrived. Demands for money were being continuously made on my mobile and on the mobile of Vaibhav Singhal,” reads the FIR lodged at Phase III police station. It added that as police started chasing the accused, they left Paritosh on the way to Delhi around 4.30am.

Interestingly, while police confirmed that an FIR had been lodged, the complainant refused to speak anything on it. Inspector Harinandan Sharma said the cops had chased the car till AIIMS. “We are examining the details. We are trying to verify the identities of the accused,” he said.
