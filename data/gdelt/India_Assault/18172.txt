Couple With 2 Kids Stoned To Death For Inter-Caste Marriage In Karnataka, India

Many consider India as the land of the most horrific crimes, and as a matter of fact, it is right. Even after living in the 21st century, India has seen a lot of horrific crimes, ones that other countries end up calling “fake news” when news agencies publish them.

In the most recent tragic case, a couple in Karnataka were victims of honor killing as they got stoned to death for their inter-caste marriage.

The couple was on their way home in Gadag District Karnataka, for the first time in 4 years when the villagers killed them.

Ramesh Madar, a Dalit man, married Gangamma, who belongs to a Lambani Community, 4 years ago and flew away from the village as their family members didn’t agree to their love.

When Ramesh and Gangamma decided to return to their house in Gadag, Karnataka, they ended up being stoned to death.

4-years-ago, the family fled their village, which is Lakkalakatti near Gajendragad town, and went to Karnataka and worked as laborers. They went back to their house in Gadag on November 6, 2019, for the first time in 4 years.

When they were on their way to the village, a bunch of people that belong to the Lambani Community saw the couple and started to throw stones at them.

The attack went so severe that the couple ended up dying.

The couple also has 2 children, who are now homeless.

The Gajendragad Police Station said they have launched an investigation for the said honor killing.

When asked about if any arrests have been made, they said they cannot share any information yet, but there have been progress made.
