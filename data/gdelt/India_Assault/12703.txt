India’s Population of Tigers Increases Dramatically

In what amounts to good news for tigers but bad news for residents of India, the population of the country’s wild tigers has increased by 33 percent over the last four years.

Figures released Monday by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reveal the number of wild tigers has risen to 2,967 — which makes up about 80 percent of the tiger population in the entire world. The revelation was made as part of International Tiger Day festivities, during which officials vowed to double the number of tigers by 2022.

In spite of the efforts to help the wild tiger population thrive, Modi also warned residents to keep their distance from the jungle cats. Earlier this month, a group of Indian villagers attacked and beat a tiger to death after it attacked nine people. A video of the beating went viral.
