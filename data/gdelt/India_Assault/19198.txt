The nation has been expressing outrage over the shocking rape cases in the past few days. Several celebrities have also condemned the brutal acts, urged for stricter laws and demanded justice. And recently, it was Gabriella Demetriades who took to social media to express her rage against rape.In a lengthy post on Instagram Gabriella wrote, “This is the only news we need to worry about today. If you’re a man, a woman, this is the only conversation you should be having today because if our basic human rights aren’t met – there is nothing else to discuss. No one has the right to take anyone’s life and all rapists need to be executed. The punishment does not fit the crime. Castration and hanging is all they deserve.”Earlier, Akshay Kumar had expressed his anger and shared on Twitter , “Whether it is #PriyankaReddy in Hyderabad, #Roja in Tamil Nadu or the law student gangraped in Ranchi,we seem to be losing it as a society. It has been 7 yrs to the gut-wrenching #Nirbhaya case & our moral fabric continues to be in pieces.We need stricter laws.This needs to STOP!”.Farhan Akhtar, Rakul Preet and other celebrities had also expressed outrage on social media.
