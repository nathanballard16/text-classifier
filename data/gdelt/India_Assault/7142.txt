Attack on passengers: Bus staff taken to Kallada office

The seven workers of Suresh Kallada Travels, who were arrested by the police on the charge of brutally attacking passengers of a Bengaluru-bound bus here a week ago, were taken to the firm’s Vyttila branch office on Sunday as part of gathering evidence.

They are among the gang of 12 workers attached to the firm who attacked two students and another passenger of the bus at Vyttila, for protesting against inordinate delay in arranging an alternative bus instead of one which broke down at Haripad. Trikkakara ACP Stuart Keeler, who is leading the probe, said that the seven workers were identified on the basis of footage from three videos, including CCTVs at Vyttila.

Sources said that efforts are being made to nab the others. The police have not given a clean chit to K.R. Suresh, owner of Kallada Travels, in connection with the attack. He had been summoned to the ACP office on Friday and his statement recorded.

In the meantime, the MVD continued its inspection of inter-State buses at different parts of Kerala, to nab buses which carried cargo in violation of rules and also failed to remit fines, road tax, etc.
