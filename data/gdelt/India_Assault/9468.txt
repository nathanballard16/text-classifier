Akal Takht wants parliament to apologise for Operation Bluestar

On the 35th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, the Akal Takht shas ought an apology from the Centre for carrying out an “Army assault” on the Darbar Sahib, Akal Takht and simultaneous attack on various other gurdwaras.

Seeking to assuage the sentiments of Sikhs, Akal Takht acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said Parliament should accept that the attack conducted on the directions of the ‘Indian’ government was a blunder and should submit an official apology for it. “The Indian Parliament should bring ‘maafi da matta’ (a resolution of apology) for the execution of “Ghallughara” (Operation Bluestar) in 1984,” he said. Recently, Delhi BJP MLA and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa had also demanded a similar apology from the Centre. In August 2005, then PM Manmohan Singh had apologised in Parliament for the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, saying he was not standing on any ‘false prestige’ and bowed his head in shame.
