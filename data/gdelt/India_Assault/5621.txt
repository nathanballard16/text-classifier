Kalighat death: 2nd arrest exposes 5-hr torture

KOLKATA: A night guard, Krishna Lal, was arrested on Wednesday for allegedly assaulting Shankar Mondal, 25, at Kalighat last Sunday. “We suspect Mondal was assaulted yet again between 6am and 10am when the men failed to recover the phone. The questioning of two of the arrested men — Kanai Patra, 55, and Lal, 48 — has thrown up details of how Mondal was virtually tortured for over five hours before he lost consciousness. For the next three hours — between 3am and 6am — four to five men took Mondal to several local addresses as Patra claimed Mondal kept telling them he had deposited the stolen phone with different people. Not once did they contact the police,” said the source.
