Police arrest two, solve 25 chain snatching cases

According to the police, at 11.15 a.m. on September 13, a patrolling party noticed two suspicious persons on a black motorcycle approaching a gym in the sector 8 of Rohini. On being intercepted, one of them fired upon the police party. But the police team escaped injury and succeeded in overpowering them.

The accused have been identified as Mahesh Khatri (24) and Mohit Bhardwaj (23).

One pistol, four live cartridges, 10 gold chains and one stolen bike were recovered from them, said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Rohini) S.D. Mishra.

During interrogation, Khatri said he had snatched more than 150 chains in Delhi and the NCR region in the last few months. The goldsmith in Bawana to whom he would sell the chains is being traced.

Khatri, a 'bad character' of the Narela police station, had been involved in 29 criminal cases, including murder, sexual assault, robbery and snatching, the officer said.

Khatri paid Rs 10,000 to Bhardwaj a day, depending on the number and quality of gold chains snatched, the police said.
