When I reached there at around 7 pm, Navkiran was already waiting for me in his car. He offered me a drink laced with sedative and I soon fell unconscious,” she said.

“When I regained my consciousness, I found myself in an abandoned room with the accused. I learnt that the accused had raped me while I was unconscious. Later, he dropped me at Majitha Road. On reaching home, I narrated the incident to my parents and lodged a complaint against the accused the next day,” she added.
