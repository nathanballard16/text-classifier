He had also shot pictures for coffee table books of the Delhi Police and CBI.Sharma, a resident of Delhi’s East of Kailash, was waiting for a bus near the Sector 37 flyover when a Swift stopped near him at 7.30am. “Four men aged between 25 and 30 years were inside the car and asked me if I wanted to go to Pari Chowk. I said yes and sat inside. However, instead of getting on to the expressway, the car soon took the service lane. One of them punched me in the face and snatched my mobile phone,” Sharma said.In the time he was in the car, the gang allegedly took away Sharma’s phone, about Rs 4,000 in cash, two gold rings and two cameras. They also took his lunch box and bag of medicines.
