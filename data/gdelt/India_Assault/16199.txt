New Delhi: A senior official on Friday confirmed that another Pakistani drone used to drop weapons for terrorists was found in Punjab's Attari, near the border with Pakistan, reported NDTV.

Punjab Police's counter-intelligence unit found the drone after a terror accused, Akashdeep, took them to the location where the drone had gone down.

Balbir Singh, a senior police official said, “This drone couldn't return to Pakistan due to a malfunction, so the accused hid it at a village near the Attari border.”

The drone was kept hidden beneath the undergrowth of a paddy field at the village. Last week, the Punjab Police announced intrusion by heavy-lifting Pakistani drones to drop AK-47 assault rifles and grenades in Amritsar. The weapons were meant for terrorists to create trouble in Jammu and Kashmir.
