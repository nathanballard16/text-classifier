Indian soldier kills 3 colleagues in IHK

SRINAGAR, India: Paramilitary trooper in Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) shot dead three of his comrades early Thursday, officials said, as fresh violence raged in the restive territory where 40 troops died in a bombing last month.

Separately, an Indian soldier was killed in the latest exchange of fire with Pakistani forces across the Line of Control (LoC) since the two nations launched tit-for-tat air strikes last month.

Police said the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper opened fire on his colleagues with his service rifle at a camp in Udhampur, some 200 kilometres (125 miles) south of the main city--Srinagar.

“He shot himself too and is in a critical condition at a hospital,” Jammu police official MK Sinha told AFP, saying the man “may have been under the influence of drugs”.

Separately on Thursday morning, a soldier was killed when India and Pakistan again exchanged fire across the LoC near the southern area of Sundarbani in held Kashmir, army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand told this news agency.
