Government hiding another shelter home rape case, alleges CPI-ML

The CPI (ML) has alleged that the Nitish government is again trying to hush up a case of sexual abuse of girls at a shelter home at Muzaffarpur in 2013.

Citing a report published in a vernacular daily, CPI (ML) politburo member Kavita Krishnan said here on Monday that during an investigation of infamous Muzaffarpur shelter home rape case, former superintendent of police, Harpreet Kaur, had stumbled upon sexual exploitation of girls at a short stay home.

“Strangely, on November 19, 2013 three FIRS were lodged in this connection. It was alleged that three girls were raped. Eight persons, barring government officials, were made accused in it,” she said. At that time 18-19 girls stayed in the shelter home.

Krishnan said six persons were arrested but two could not be traced. “The shelter home was closed and the girls were first shifted to Patna then to Muzaffarpur. However, there is no record of how many girls out of 19 were shifted to which place,” she alleged.

The CPI politburo member said the incident took place when Nitish Kumar was the CM and Sushil Kumar Modi was deputy chief minister. “Now, both are talking of protecting the girls, but they are not safe in Bihar,” she said, adding in election they were raising the issue and after polls they would take it up in a big way.
