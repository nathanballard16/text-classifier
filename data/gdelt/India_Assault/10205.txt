SURAT: A local court sentenced a 39-year-old man to seven years imprisonment on Tuesday for sexually assaulting a five-year-old girl in Limbayat in 2015.

Arif Mohammad Ansari, who was given maximum sentence, was booked on November 9, 2015 after the girl’s mother filed a complaint against him.

He lived on upper floor of the same building where the girl stayed with her parents. She was playing on the stairs outside her house when Ansari took her to his room and sexually assaulted her. He threatened to thrash her again if she complained to anyone.

The girl identified Ansari in the court. She also answered all the questions of lawyers in the court.
