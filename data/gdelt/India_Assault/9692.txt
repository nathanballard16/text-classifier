J&K: 5 die as CRPF under attack again in Anantnag

Five CRPF personnel were killed and five other injured in a terror attack during a Road Opening Party of the CRPF late on Wednesday evening, in South Kashmir's Anantnag.

A police officer said that five CRPF personnel were killed in the attack as bodies of two soldiers were retrieved near the site of the attack, at KP Road near Oxford School. After sanitising the area, three CRPF troopers were declared brought dead in hospital.

Station House Officer (SHO) Irshad Ahmad, Sadder Police Station, was also injured in the attack. Meanwhile, a senior police officer told India Today TV that body of a militant was also retrieved from the site.

Ahmad said that it is believed that the militant was a foreigner, adding that a search operation in the area is underway. The slain CRPF personnel were identified as ASI Neeru Sharma, ASI Ramesh Kumar, constables Santinder Kumar, MK Kushwa and Mahesh Kumar. Militant outfit Al Umar has claimed responsibility for the terror attack.

Spokesman of Al Umar claimed responsibility for the attack by calling a local news agency in Srinagar, reports said. The attack took place at KP Road, Pahalgam, which is main route for Amarnath yatra which is scheduled on July 1 this year. Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik asked militants to give up arms and invited them to hold talks, saying dialogue is the only way through which they can get what they want within the ambit of the Constitution.

"Take everything from us, we will give our life, but through love and dialogue. For that [PM] Narendra Modi is ready, we are ready. Come to the dialogue table and take it forward. Whatever you want can be achieved through talks and dialogue. You cannot make India to bow through violence." The Governor also exhorted the youth of Kashmir to give up arms.
