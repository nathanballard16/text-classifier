Sharad Pawar praises Gandhi family at rally for Udayanraje

KOLHAPUR: Showering praises on the Gandhi family, NCP chief Sharad Pawar appreciated Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi for carrying on the family’s legacy despite two assassinations.Addressing an election rally in Satara on Saturday for NCP candidate Udayanraje Bhosale, Pawar lambasted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for continuously raising questions about the contribution of the Gandhi family. “Sonia Gandhi did not leave the country after the assassination of Rajiv Gandhi. She decided to stay here. Rahul Gandhi is making the same attempt. It is shameful that Modi is questioning the Gandhi-Nehru family’s credentials despite so many sacrifices,” said Pawar.Pawar said, “Indira Gandhi not only made history but changed geography by creating Bangladesh. Rajiv Gandhi took the country into the modern era by introducing new technology. Modi, instead of telling his achievements, is doubting the family”.Pawar continued to target Modi saying the BJP should feel ashamed about fielding Sadhvi Pradnya, who is an accused in the Malegaon blast case. “She has made some remarks about Hemant Karkare. It shows the real feelings of BJP towards martyrs”, he said.The NCP leader also condemned Modi for taking advantage of the post-Balakot situation. “How did the attack take place in the first place. Modi has not done anything personally. It was because of our brave jawans”, he said adding that India was not safe in Modi’s hands. He said wing commander Abhinandan was released by Pakistan because of the Geneva Accord and not because of Modi.Pawar came down heavily on Modi on agriculture policy. He said the Modi government had brought down prices of all agriculture produces, because of which farmers lives had become miserable. “More than 12,000 farmers had committed suicide in two years. We have waived off loan of farmers. What is Modi doing?”, he asked.
