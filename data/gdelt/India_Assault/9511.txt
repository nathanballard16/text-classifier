Men who raped and tortured girl, 8, before fatal stoning could face execution

Six men who drugged an eight-year-old girl then raped her in a temple before stoning her to death in India could face the death penalty.

The men were today convicted for the rape and murder of Asifa Bano in January 2018.

The case sparked outrage and protests across India with people calling for justice for the child and calls for rapists to get the death penalty.

Asifa, who was from a nomadic Muslim community that roams the forests of Kashmir, was kidnapped and drugged on January 10 before she was held captive in a Kathua district temple and sexually assaulted for a week.
