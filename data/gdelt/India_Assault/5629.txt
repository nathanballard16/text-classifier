Trump Says Mueller Probe Was ‘Attempted Takeover of Government’

Mueller's investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential elections has not revealed any conspiracy between Russia and Trump or any of his associates, according to a four-page review made by Attorney General William Barr.

"If the Republican Party had done this to the Democrats, if we had done this to President Obama, you'd have 100 people in jail right now and it would be treason. It would be considered treason and they'd be in jail for the rest of their lives".

In his comments, Donald Trump accused disgraced former FBI employees Lisa Page and Peter Strzok, who have been proven to have had a biased approach to the investigation, as well as "hundreds of others" of treason, hinting they can be punished for it.

"In 50 years from now, in 100 years from now, if someone tries the same thing, they have to know that the penalty will be very, very great, if and when they get caught".
