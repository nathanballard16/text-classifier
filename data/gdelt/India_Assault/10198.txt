Indian forces skirmished with militants in the village of Waghama in Kashmir's Anantnag district early on Tuesday, local media reported, citing sources.

A least one Indian serviceman was killed while another was injured during a fierce fight between militants and government forces in southern Kashmir, local media reported, adding that a military operation was ongoing.

According to the Brighter Kashmir media outlet, the Indian forces trapped at least 3 militants following the skirmish.

There are no further details on the operation.

In February, a Kashmiri militant targeted a paramilitary convoy with a car bomb and killed 40 Indian soldiers. The deadliest suicide car bombing in the region's history against Indian soldiers reportedly brought India and Pakistan close to war.

India has repeatedly accused Pakistan of supporting militants and having a "direct hand" in the February incident. Pakistan has rejected accusations that it was involved in the deadly attack.

Both India and Pakistan claim the divided territory of Kashmir in its entirety. Jammu and Kashmir is a region that has been disputed by India and Pakistan since 1947, after both countries gained independence from the former British Empire. The two countries have seen three wars over the region, and the conflict has not been resolved. The unstable region has seen the emergence of extremist groups.
