Jaipur: A woman student of Jaipur Dental College was suspended by college authorities on Monday after she updated her WhatsApp status to ‘Miss You Bhai’ in support of Aadil Ahmad Dar, the suicide bomber behind the Pulwama CRPF attack, which went viral, confirmed college authorities.

Dr Manohar Bhatt, a college official, told IANS: “We have informed the matter to police and they are looking into it. Such activities can never be tolerated in our college. We have suspended the student, Saniya, who also belongs to Pulwama where the attack took place.”
