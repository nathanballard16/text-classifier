Sunita Singh Gaur, the president of the BJP’s Mahila Morcha in Ramkola in Uttar Pradesh, has been expelled from the organisation over a Facebook post, in which she said that Hindu men should gang-rape Muslim women.

In a screenshot of the post that has been shared by a Twitter user, Gaur said: “There is only one solution for them (Muslims). Hindu brothers should make a group of 10 and gang rape their (Muslims) mothers and sisters openly on the streets…and then hang her in the middle of the bazaar for others to see.”

Gaur added that “if we need to protect India” then Hindu men must rape Muslim women.

“There is no other way,” she added.

Gaur has now deleted the post.
