Kerala Police extradites absconding rape accused from Saudi Arabia

A team of Kerala Police officials on Wednesday brought a Keralite to India who allegedly raped a minor girl in 2017 and fled to Saudi Arabia. The accused had been on the run for over two years. Sunil Kumar Bhadran, 38, was taken into custody by the Saudi police four months ago and handed over to the Kerala Police team on Wednesday.

Sunil Kumar had allegedly raped the 13-year-old girl, belonging to the scheduled caste community, in 2017 when he had come to Kerala from the Middle East for a holiday, police said.

The incident came to light after the victim spoke to her classmates about her ordeal. By the time the incident came to light, Sunil had already returned to Saudi Arabia. Sunil was a friend of the victim's paternal uncle.

The victim was shifted to the government care home but she allegedly committed suicide by hanging, police said. The victim's uncle, too, committed suicide a few months after the incident.

Following the suicide of the victim, the local police intensified their efforts to nab the accused. They sought the help of Interpol with the help of central agencies. The Interpol issued a red collar notice against Sunil Kumar in 2018.

Kollam police commissioner Merin Joseph noticed this case and decided to bring track the accused and bring him before the law.

Speaking to India Today TV, Joseph said that she noticed this case while reviewing pending case files in the office when she assumed charge.

"That is when I noticed this case. This seemed to be a very serious offence to me. Our international investigation wing has already been following up on many cases including this one. On June 20, the CBI team informed us that the Saudi police arrested Sunil Kumar," she said.

Sunil Kumar was presented before the magistrate on Wednesday late evening. The investigation team will soon move a custody application in the court to take the investigation forward.
