Five Indian officers killed in Kashmir days after worst militant attack in decades

D.S. Hooda, a general who commanded the Indian army forces in Kashmir until his retirement in 2016, said he hoped that last week’s attack was not the start of a trend. Security forces will have to exercise vigilance in keeping track of explosives, he said, and improve intelligence-gathering. But “it’s very, very difficult to try to counter somebody who wants to carry out a suicide attack.”
