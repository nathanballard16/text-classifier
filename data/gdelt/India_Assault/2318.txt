Anguish, anger in Gurugram over Pulwama attack

Gurugram, Feb 15 : Students, teachers, lawyers and various organisations on Friday took to the streets in different parts of this Millennium City to express their anguish and anger and lodge a strong protest against the Pulwama terror attack that claimed lives of close to 50 CRPF troopers in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday.

Over a thousand students and teachers from Government College for Girls here on Friday organised a protest march, demanding that India take a stringent action against Pakistan, separatists and their supporters, militants and terrorist outfits.

They also observed a two-minute silence as a mark of respect to the slain troopers.

The Gurugram Bar Association, largest in the state, with over 2,000 registered members, suspended the work for the day to pay tributes to the martyrs.

Lawyers protested, burnt national flag of Pakistan and handed over memorandum to Deputy Commissioner Amit Khatri for the President of India seeking strongest action against terror trainers, funders, supporter of Pakistan and leaders and sympathisers of militants in India.

Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based terrorist outfit, claimed responsibility for the attack in which a suicide bomber on Thursday afternoon rammed his SUV packed with explosives into a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) bus that was part of a large convoy of the force on the Jammu-Srinagar highway, killing over 45 troopers.
