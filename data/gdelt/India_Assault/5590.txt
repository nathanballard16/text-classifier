Pakistan Police Schemed with Criminal Gang in Bitcoin Ransom Kidnapping

A Pakistani crime ring that extorted a partial Bitcoin ransom has been busted.

All the news of a stand-off between Pakistan and India has shrouded earlier reports of an IT professor who was kidnapped and held for 20 million rupees. Shahid Naseer was kidnapped March 19th, according to a local media outlet. Faisal Yousuf, a student of Naseer’s, is named as the primary suspect.

Police Involved in Plot to Extort Over 60 BTC

Three police officials were involved with the ransom. One of them worked in a higher office, managing telephones for the city’s Deputy Commissioner. His name is Mazhar Abbas. He was arrested March 23rd. Two other police officials, both guards of a high court judge, were also arrested – Mohsin Abbas and Mohammad Arif.

A Lahore man called Mohammad Tahir is allegedly a Bitcoin money exchanger in the area. Together with Abdul Rauf, he is accused of helping the kidnappers have an outlet for the Bitcoin ransom they were demanding.

The kidnappers apparently placed a green license plate on a rental car while executing the kidnapping. Green license plates signify two types of official in Pakistan.

Naseer’s family paid out 2.5 million rupees worth of Bitcoin in an effort to bring him home. Police told Dawn, a local media outlet, that this is how they caught the kidnappers, “using digital technology.”
