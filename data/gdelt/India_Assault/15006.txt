The victim is employed as a domestic help in a house in H-block of the upscale DLF phase-1. The house owner had levelled allegations of theft against her and two other domestic helps on Tuesday.

"Following her complaint, the investigating officer Madhubala (ASI) called her to appear in police station. When she reached the police station, the cops took her to a room and removed all clothes from her body and beat her brutally with belts and batons. They forced her to accept the crime which she did not commit," said her husband.
