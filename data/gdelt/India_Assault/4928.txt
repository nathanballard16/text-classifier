Arrested police personnel bailed out

Dhangadi, March 14

Six police personnel who were charged with destroying incriminating evidence and torturing innocent people while investigating the rape and murder of Nirmala Panta in Kanchanpur were freed on bail today following Kanchanpur District Court’s order.

A single bench of Judge Rajendra Kumar Acharya ordered their release after furnishing bail bond of Rs 2.5 lakh to Rs 9 lakh.

“While DSP Gyan Bahadur Sethi and Inspector Ekendra Khadka, who have been suspended, were released on a bail of Rs 9 lakh each, suspended sub-inspectors Harisingh Dhami and Ramsingh Dhami posted bail of Rs 3.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh, respectively,” said Kanchanpur District Police Office DSP Krishnaraj Ojha. “Sacked inspector Jagadish Bhatta and suspended constable Chandani Saud were told to pay Rs 4 lakh and Rs 2.5 lakh, respectively, as bail,” added the DSP.

The cops are required to present themselves at the court whenever deemed necessary.

Earlier, Nirmala’s mother had filed a case against eight police officers, including sacked superintendent of police Dilli Raj Bista, accusing them of destroying evidence.

Separately, Khadka Bista, brother of Dilip Singh Bista of Bhimdatta Municipality-10, had also filed a case against four cops, including the sacked SP, for torturing Dilip Singh, who was projected as the main suspect before releasing him after a negative DNA test report.

While sacked SP Bista and suspended CIB DSP Angoor GC are still at large, trial against other policemen began at Kanchanpur District Court on Tuesday.
