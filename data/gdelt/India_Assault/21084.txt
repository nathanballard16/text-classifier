Who Has Said What

# West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee: "In BJP manifesto, instead of development issues, you have put in promise to divide the country. Why will citizenship be on the basis of religion? I will not accept this. We dare you... You can pass laws in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha forcefully because you have the number. But we will not let you divide the country."

# Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan: "An anti-constitutional law will have no place in Kerala"

# Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh: "The act is a direct assault on India's secular character. My government will not let the legislation to be implemented. We have a majority in the assembly, and will block the bill."

# Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel: "The act is clearly unconstitutional. Whatever decision is made at the Congress party forum on the bill, will be applied in Chhattisgarh."

# Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath: "Whatever stand the Congress party has taken on Citizenship Amendment Act, we will follow that. Do we want to be a part of a process that sows seeds of divisiveness?"
