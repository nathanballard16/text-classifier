MP, MLA visit wife of Vivekanandakumar

‘She should be given a government job’

Su. Venkatesan, MP, and P.T.R. Palanivel Thiagarajan, MLA, demanded a CB-CID investigation into the death of T. Vivekanandakumar, who died after a policeman assaulted him. The woman attempted suicide two days after his death.

V. Gajapriya, who is recuperating in Government Rajaji Hospital, and her family members requested support of politicians in the matter.

Speaking at the GRH, the leaders said the reason for the death seemed unsure and lent themselves to suspicion. “There is a need for trust between people and police. At present, there is distrust. This needs to change,” said Mr. Thiagarajan.

Mr. Venkatesan said Ms. Gajapriya should be given a government job.

“We came here to ensure she is given the best treatment,” he said.

The MP spoke on poor availability of drinking water in Madurai and stressed the need to release funds at the earliest for the construction of All India Institutes of Medical Sciences here.
