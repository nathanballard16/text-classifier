Hyderabad: It seems Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao aka KCR has got his priorities completely wrong. As the nation boils over the gruesome gang-rape and murder case of a woman veterinarian in the state last week, KCR is busy attending high-profile weddings.

While there was no let-up in protests over the horrific incident that sent shivers down the spine, it is being reported that the Telangana CM is attending the third wedding this week. Rao has not met the family of the victim as yet.

The Telangana CM was in New Delhi two days ago to attend a marriage. Today, the CM will go to Nagole, Hyderbad, to mark his presence at yet another wedding ceremony.

While speaking to Times Now on Tuesday, the father of the victim had said that politicians belonging to almost all political parties have visited his residence but wondered why the Telangana CM had not found the time to meet the grieving family. "He (KCR) had no even telephoned them," said the father, adding the CM's visit would have given the justice-seeking family some assurance.
