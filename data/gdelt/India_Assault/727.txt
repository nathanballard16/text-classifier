Indian Villagers Hurl Bombs At Elephants for Damaging Crops (PHOTOS)

In 2017, Biplab Hazra won the Sanctuary Wildlife Photography Award 2017 Certificate for a photograph showing an elephant and her calf trying to escape tar bombs hurled by villagers in the same region.

"Some years ago we were forced to leave our villages because elephants used to attack our houses and agriculture land on daily basis. We had to stop growing ginger and other crops. Now three of our brothers have shifted to the nearby town of Siliguri. However, my father is still living in the village. He lives thus because he is not dependent on farming for survival", Suman Kalyan Pradhan, a resident of the area told Sputnik.

Data presented by India's Ministry of Environment in the Parliament last December shows that since 2015, some 107 elephants have lost their lives in accidents while crossing railway tracks. As many as 2,330 elephants in India have died due to unnatural causes in the last five years.

In 2012 there were around 30,000 elephants in the country, which has been reduced to 27,312 in 2017.
