Bengaluru: As fear and shock have gripped the nation following the brutal rape and murder of a woman veterinarian, the Police Commissioner, Bhaskar Rao, on Monday, December 2 said that any distress call would be responded within seven seconds.

“After the Telangana rape and murder case, we assure all Bengalureans and anyone who visits the city that they shouldn’t fear for their safety,” Bhaskar Rao was quoted speaking to ANI.

He further assured that women safety will be their top most priority and any distress call would be responded within seven seconds.

“Even if a prank call comes, we will not complain about it and we will come to you. Your safety is our priority. We have appointed a separate wing for the safety of the woman in the city. The exclusive women’s wing will be completely dedicated to women’s safety,” he informed.

The burnt body of the veterinary doctor was found at Shadnagar outskirts in Telangana’s Ranga Reddy district last week. As per the preliminary probe, the police suspect that the doctor was sexually assaulted before being charred to death.
