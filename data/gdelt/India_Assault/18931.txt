Court asks for status of guilty in 2012 Delhi gang rape case

The Patiala House Court has issued a notice to the Tihar Jail on Thursday. The notice has demanded the status of the four found guilty in the case in a bid to conclude the date of their hanging. The notice was issued based on a plea by the parents of Nirbhaya.

Nirbhaya's parent claimed in their plea to the court that, none of the four guilty in the case have any clemency or curative application pending before the Supreme Court.

However, the defence side has argued that one of the four found guilty has one curative application pending before the Supreme Court, and two of them are planning to file the same. The Patiala House court said that the Tihar Jail authorities must clarify about the status of the all four found guilty by Friday.
