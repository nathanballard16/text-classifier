Mumbai: 27-year-old man held for rape of teenager three years ago

The Mumbai crime branch has arrested a 27-year-old bank employee, Mohammad Nisar Khan, from New Delhi for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl in Mumbai three years ago, police said Tuesday. “Based on technical intelligence, we traced Khan to Delhi, where he was working in a bank and had been recently fired. The accused, who was on the run, had reportedly changed his appearance to hoodwink the police, police said. Taking advantage of her absence, Khan sexually exploited the girl on three occasions in 2016, police said. AdvertisingKhan, who hails from UP, had moved to Mumbai in 2015 in search of employment and was eventually recruited as a sales executive at a bank, police said.
