Three held for abducting toddler over car loan dispute

Three persons, including a couple, were arrested by Navi Mumbai police for allegedly abducting a toddler over a car loan dispute with his mother, police said Sunday.

A police official said the complainant Hasina Abdul Hamid Shaikh's son was allegedly abducted from Ulwe by Saroj Rao (27) whose husband Jinnat had purchased a car from Shaikh.

Shaikh had lodged a complaint with the NRI police station against the couple, he said, adding that the police found that the Raos and another accused have left for Rajasthan with the boy.

The car was intercepted at Bharuch in Gujarat and the trio were apprehended Saturday night, he said.

A team of Navi Mumvai police then arrested Jinnat Bacharsingh Rao (28), Saroj Rao (25) and Arjun Bacharsingh Rao (25), he said.

The official said the Raos and Shaikh fell out over a dispute over transfer of the car loan.

Further investigation is underway.
