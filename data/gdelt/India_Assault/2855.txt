AC repairman from Kolkata booked for sexual assault of 13-year-old girl

A 25-year-old technician from Kolkata has been booked by cops for sexually assaulting a 13-year-old girl residing in Yerwada. An FIR was lodged by the girl’s parents at Yerwada police station on Tuesday.



The accused, Noor Mandal, showed obscene videos to the minor before committing the crime. Her parents found out about it after she experienced medical issues and was taken to a doctor.



The complaint details that the girl lives with her mother and grandmother. The accused regularly interacted with the family as he takes a tiffin service from the grandparent.



A police official told Mirror, “Mandal began troubling the girl between October and December last year. He showed the child obscene videos and continued doing so against here will. In December, when nobody was home, he went to her home and sexually assaulted her. He threatened to kill her if she revealed the act to anyone.” Last week, the girl had pains in her stomach and was taken to a doctor by her parents, where the whole incident emerged, leading her mother to approach police.



Mandal has worked here as an air-conditioner repair technician for the last few years, said cops.



Probing officer police-sub inspector Swapna Waghmare said, “The accused has been booked under section 376 (rape) and 354 (outraging modesty) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), besides relevant sections of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, as the girl is a minor. The complainants knew nothing about the accused other than his name. Since he learnt of the complaint, he has switched off both his phones and absconded. We are searching for him and will soon arrest him.” — PMB
