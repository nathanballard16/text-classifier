BJP leader moves Delhi HC over Kamal Haasan's 'first Hindu terrorist' remark

New Delhi [India], May 14 (ANI): BJP leader Ashwini Upadhyay on Tuesday moved the Delhi High Court seeking direction from Election Commission (EC) to take action against actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan, who stoked controversy by referring Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse as the "first Hindu terrorist in independent India."

In a plea, Upadhyay stated that Haasan's comment was made deliberately in the presence of a Muslim-majority crowd for electoral gain, which is a corrupt practice under Section 123(3) the Representation of the People Act 1951.

"Mr. Kamal Haasan is deliberately promoting enmity between different groups on the grounds of religion and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony and brotherhood, which is an offence under Section 153A of the IPC," the plea said.

"It is a deliberate and malicious act intended to outrage the sentiments of millions of Hindus, which is an offence under Section 295A IPC," it added.

The court is likely to hear the matter on Wednesday (May 15).

Haasan, the chief of Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) had stirred a controversy by saying that the "first terrorist in independent India was a Hindu", referring to Godse, the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.

"I am not saying this because many Muslims are here. I am saying this in front of Mahatma Gandhi's statue. The first terrorist in independent India is a Hindu. His name is Nathuram Godse," Haasan said while campaigning in Tamil Nadu's Aravakurichi assembly constituency on Sunday.

Haasan's comments drew flak from BJP leaders and Hindu outfits. (ANI)
