World News: Man causes panic at Delhi airport with hoax bomb call as he tries to stop wife from leaving for Middle East





The Special Cell of the Delhi Police has arrested a man who they say made a hoax call on August 8 saying his wife was on her way to set off a bomb in a plane. He claimed that she would set off the bomb on a Dubai or Saudi-bound flight and that she was flying to the Gulf from Delhi airport.



Delhi police tweeted about the incident and the arrest. They added that investigations revealed that the man did this to prevent his wife from leaving the country.



The accused, Nasiruddin (29), was arrested from Bawana area in New Delhi.



Following his call on August 8, authorities at the Indira Gandhi International Airport, New Delhi, had to temporarily suspend operations of international flights.



Police say the man's wife, Rafiya, was taking a flight to the Middle East and he wanted to stop her. He had allegedly said that his wife was a bomber who would blow up a flight headed for Dubai or Saudi Arabia.



Police have registered a criminal case against Nasiruddin.



The accused reportedly owns a bag manufacturing factory in Chennai. He had married Rafiya, his employee, who was now planning to leave India to work in the Gulf.



When his attempts to stop Rafiya from leaving India failed, he came up with the idea of hoax call alleging his wife to be a bomber.
