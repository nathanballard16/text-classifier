Muzaffarpur shelter home case: POCSO court orders CBI probe against Bihar CM Nitish Kumar

A special court on the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) in Muzaffarnagar has ordered a CBI probe against Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar in connection with the Bihar shelter home rape case.

Moreover, the court ordered an inquiry against Muzaffarpur district magistrate Dharmendra Singh and principal secretary of Social Welfare Atul.

The special POCSO court passed the order on an application filed by an accused, Ashwani, a self-styled medical practitioner who allegedly used to inject the home’s inmates with sedatives before they were subject to sexual abuse.

Ashwani had alleged in his petition that the CBI was “suppressing facts” in course of the investigation which would come to light if the roles of Dharmendra Singh, Atul and CM Nitish Kumar were probed.

POCSO judge Manoj Kumar directed the CBI to conduct an investigation against the aforesaid people.

The trial in the high-profile case was this month transferred to the Special POCSO court at Saket in Delhi.

The case came to light in May last year when a report of the social audit of the Muzaffarpur shelter home was conducted by Mumbai based Tata Institute of Social Sciences.

Brajesh Thakur, a journalist-turned-social activist heading the NGO which ran the shelter home, and other accused were arrested.
