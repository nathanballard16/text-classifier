India on Wednesday summoned a Pakistan High Commission official to lodge a “strong protest” at the death of an innocent civilian in unprovoked ceasefire violation by Pakistani security forces on January 11 in Sunderbani sector.

“Our strong concerns were also shared at continued unprovoked firing and ceasefire violations across the Line of Control and the International Boundary,” said a Ministry of External Affairs statement.

Pakistan blames Indian security forces for having carried out more than 2350 ceasefire violations along the LoC and International Boundary in 2018 resulting in loss of 36 civilian lives while 142 were injured in 2018.

According to India, Pakistan Army carried out over 1962 incidents of unprovoked ceasefire violations in which 50 Indians lost their lives last year.

We also protested Pakistan’s continued support to cross border terrorist infiltration into India, including supporting cover fire provided by Pakistan forces, the MEA statement added.
