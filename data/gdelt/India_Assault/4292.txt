Lawyer convicted of assault after racist rant on Air India flight

(CNN) A lawyer who subjected aircraft crew to "prolonged" racist abuse on a November flight from Mumbai to London was convicted of assault Wednesday.

Uxbridge Magistrates' Court heard that Simone Burns, who goes by Simone O'Broin, also spat at a crew member and grabbed her by the arm after staff refused to serve her more alcohol, the UK's Press Association news agency reported

Burns, from Hove, England, began her racist rant on the Air India flight when flight attendants declined to sell her a fourth bottle of wine. Prosecutor Lauren Smith told Uxbridge Magistrates' Court that Burns, who is 50, began "swearing and shouting," calling the flight crew "f***ing Indian money-grabbing c***s."

When a cabin supervisor attempted to intervene, Burns spat in her face, swore at her, and "grabbed her by her right upper arm and squeezed it," Smith said.

Burns ignored a written warning from the flight's captain and was also caught smoking in the plane bathroom.
