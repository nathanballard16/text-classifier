UP leaders laud IAF action

Lucknow, Feb 26 : Uttar Pradesh political leaders from across party lines lauded the Indian Air Force (IAF) for its operation conducted in Pakistan-administered Kashmir early on Tuesday.

Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma said it was a great moment for the country as the "final assault against the terror groups has begun".

He also pointed out that Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the wake of the Pulwama attack on a CRPF convoy that left 40 troopers dead, had made it clear that those who carried it out, committed the biggest mistake of their lives and would be paid back with interest.

"Traditionally we are a nation who never strikes first but when meddled with does not allow the enemy to get off scot-free," he said.

Former Chief Minister and Samajwadi Party (SP) chief Akhilesh Yadav lauded the IAF personnel for the air strikes but heaped no praise on the political leadership.

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati welcomed the action but said that had this been done much earlier, sad incidents like Uri and Pulwama would not have happened.

Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief spokesperson in Uttar Pradesh, Vaibhav Maheshwari also greeted the IAF personnel and applauded their action.
