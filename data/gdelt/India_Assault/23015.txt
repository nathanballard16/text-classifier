As his pet cuddled next to him, Juan, known as The Can Man, wept. He managed to pat Cheeto goodbye.

Tammy Ramos had known Juan for 10 years. She gave him food and cut his hair when he was on the streets.

Talking about the incident to Wink News she said, “He never regained consciousness. But still, I kind of thought he was there because I would talk to him and he would squeeze my hand and his blood pressure would shoot up.”

Recalling his last moments she said, “They brought the dog up to hospital. And we laid him on the bed. Cheeto laid his head on Juan's hand it was the weirdest thing because tears started coming out of Juan's eyes."

Juan was a known personality in his homeless community and people recognised him with his shopping trolley filled with cans and Cheeto.

His murderer is still at large and Tammy said, “If they’re not caught, it will happen again. Because the homeless community, the ones that I deal with, they’re mostly senior citizens and they’re vulnerable and it will happen again."

Cheeto has been adopted by a woman who chose to be anonymous.
