In a rare personal attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, BSP chief Mayawati today said he could not be expected to respect others’ sisters and wives as he had abandoned his own wife for political gains.

Mayawati’s scathing personal attack comes as the Lok Sabha poll gets into the final and fiercest phase where Modi himself is in the fray from Varanasi.

In an interview to a news agency, she accused Modi of “playing dirty politics” on the Alwar rape case, saying that he was silent till she spoke on it. She said the PM wanted to benefit from a rape case too in the poll season, which was shameful.

She said: “Mujhe toh yeh bhi maloom chala hai ke BJP mein, khas kar vivahit mahilayen, apne aadmiyon ko Shri Modi ke nazdeek jate dekh kar yeh soch kar bhi kafi zyada ghabrati rehti hain ke kahin yeh Modi apni aurat ki tarah humein bhi apne pati se alag na karwa de (I have also come to know that in BJP, married women get nervous when their husbands go near Modi fearing that like him their husbands too may leave them).”

Her attack comes a day after Modi, during two rallies in Kushinagar and Deoria on Sunday, had accused Mayawati of shedding crocodile tears over the Alwar rape case and had not withdrawn support from the Rajasthan Government.

She said the PM’s show of sympathy for Dalits rang hollow as he would have acted against those responsible for Dalit atrocities like Una in his state and against people responsible for the death of Rohith Vemula, she said.

According to Mayawati, Modi has been cleverly trying to break the alliance. She said earlier he always addressed her as ‘Behenji’ but when he realised that the alliance was not falling apart, he started addressing her as ‘bua’.

“‘Sanskari’ people in the country address me as ‘Behenji’. Even my parents address me as ‘Behenji’ and so does Akhilesh Yadav,” she pointed out.
