Arputhammal appeals to Tamil Nadu Governor to expedite release of Rajiv Gandhi assassination case convicts

Arputhammal, mother of A.G. Perarivalan, one of the life convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has appealed to Governor Banwarilal Purohit to expedite the release of the seven convicts in the case as recommended by the Tamil Nadu Cabinet.

Talking to reporters in Chennai on February 20, she said the file seeking the release of the seven convicts was pending with the Governor for almost six months now. Her son who was arrested at the age of 19 years had served 28 years in jail so far. After the Supreme Court ordered that the State of Tamil Nadu could take a decision on the release of the seven convicts, the State Cabinet passed a resolution and sent it to the Governor for his approval.

“The wait has become indefinite now. I have visited 18 districts in the last few days and people whom I met are of the view that the seven convicts have suffered enough should be set free. I appeal to the Governor to immediately order their release,” she said.

On March 9, a human chain agitation would be organised at seven places, including Chennai, Madurai and Salem, seeking the release of the convicts.

Ms. Arputhammal said she would meet leaders of various political parties and seek their support to the protest. “I will also meet students, advocates, journalists and others to gather support. When I met the Governor he assured me that he will do it. I hope he will sign the release order before March 9,” she added.
