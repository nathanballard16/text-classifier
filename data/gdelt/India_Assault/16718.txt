Dussehra 2019: This Village In Maharashtra Worships Ravana Instead Of Lord Rama With Fervour

Lakhade said several generations of his family have been worshiping Ravana in the village. "The happiness, peace and contentment in the village is because of the great king Ravan," he said.

For most of us, the festival of Dussehra symbolises as a day when good wins over the evil which in turn is equivalent to the victory Lord Rama over Ravana. In several part of the country you will see people burning effigies of Ravana, his brother Kumbhkaran and son Meghnada. However, this place in the country follows a rather opposite culture that symbolises the exact opposite of the above-mentioned belief. In Maharashtra's Akola district does not believe the same and worship Ravana not Rama on the occasion of Dussehra. A lot can be read about Ravana being an ardent believer of Lord Shiva and is still being worshiped in several parts of Sri Lanka but Akola district has an enormous black statue of Ravana, with 10 heads and 20 arms, situation in a small Sangola village, where the Lanka king is being worshiped from the past 200 years. While rest of the country burns effigies of Ravana on Dussehra, the demon king is worshiped in Sangola village for this intelligence and ascetic qualities, a local priest of the village said while speaking to news agency PTI. Several residents of the village also believe that formidable scholar.
