HYDERABAD: The Telangana high court on Friday directed the state government to preserve the bodies of the four accused in the Hyderabad rape and murder case till 6pm on December 9.The court also asked the government to hand over the video of the post-mortem in CD or pen-drive to the principal district judge, Mahabubnagar, after completion of the autopsy.The four accused were killed in an encounter with the police early on Friday.The order was passed by a two-judge bench, headed by Justice M S Ramachandra Rao, following a representation filed by the members of the National Alliance of People’s Movements (NAPM) along with activists from the human rights forum and other women's groups. Rao sat along with Justice K Lakshman.The letter was converted into a public interest litigation (PIL) by justice MS Ramachandra Rao, who heard it as a house motion at his residence late in the evening. "Record the video of the post-mortem and furnish a copy of the same in the form of CD or pen drive to the district judge of Mahabubnagar," said Rao.In the representation, the social and civil rights activists appealed to the court to immediately direct the formation of a special team of autopsy surgeons — other than from Telangana and Andhra Pradesh — to conduct an independent video-graphing of the post-mortem.They also sought the formation of a special forensic team to undertake an independent examination. "It would be a fallacy to even think that some kind of justice has been served by abandoning all due process and committing such killings," the letter read raising questions over the policemen's inability to nab four unarmed accused/suspects.Terming the killings as "uncivilized and brutal", the activists requested the high court to send its own observer to examine the facts on the ground, surrounding the encounter. They also urged the court to order handing over of the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).The next hearing in the matter has been posted for December 9.
