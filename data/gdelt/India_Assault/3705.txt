The body of a 25-year-old woman with strangle marks was found dumped in a sack near a railway line in southeast Delhi, police said Thursday.

The woman has been identified as Nisha Kumari, a resident of Dakshinpuri. Her body was found on the Sarita Vihar-Noida road on Wednesday, they said.

A passerby who spotted the body had informed the Sarita Vihar police station.

Investigations revealed that the woman had left home on February 25 at around 3 pm and later went missing, a senior police officer said.

Nisha had told her mother that she was going for a job interview with a friend. However, when she did not return, her parents filed a missing report at the Ambedkar Nagar police station the next day, he said.

In the police complaint, her father said Nisha had received a call from a friend regarding an interview with a company. She left for the same in the afternoon. At around 4.30 pm, when her parents tried contacting her, the phone was found switched off, the officer said.
