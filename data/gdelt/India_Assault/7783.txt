TV actor Karan Oberoi arrested for rape

Mumbai: Television actor Karan Oberoi, arrested on charges of raping and blackmailing a woman in suburban Oshiwara, was Thursday remanded in 14-day judicial custody by a Mumbai court.

Oberoi, 40, who acted in some TV serials and appeared in commercials, was arrested Sunday after the woman, who was in a relationship with him since 2016, complained to the Oshiwara Police that he allegedly raped her on the pretext of marrying her.

The woman also alleged that he shot some objectionable videos of her and demanded money from her while threatening to release the clips, a police official said.

Oberoi was produced before the court of metropolitan magistrate Imran Marchiya in suburban Andheri which remanded him in judicial custody for 14 days.

Oberoi’s lawyer Dinesh Tiwari said the allegations levelled by the woman were ‘false’ and that they will file a bail application before the court Friday.

Following the woman’s complaint, Oberoi was booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 376 (rape) and 384 (extortion).

Oberoi acted in some popular television serials like ‘Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin’ and ‘Inside Edge’, and appeared in various advertisements of cars, bikes and apparel. He was also a member of an Indipop musical group ‘A Band of Boys’.
