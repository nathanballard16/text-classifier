Mumbai's Versova police station has booked Pancholi under Section 376 (for rape), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison), 384 (extortion), 341 and 342 (wrongful confinement), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), The Asian Age has reported.

In 2017, the female actor had gone public saying Pancholi had harassed her physically and mentally.

In response to her complaint, Pancholi had filed a defamation suit, saying that the actor is trying to malign his image.
