ISLAMABAD: The world must seriously consider the safety and security of India’s nuclear arsenal in the control of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government, Pakistan ’s PM Imran Khan said on Sunday.Khan’s statement comes close on the heels of defence minister Rajnath Singh ’s statement on the possible change in India’s long-standing “no first use” policy regarding nuclear weapons depending on future circumstances.“The world must also seriously consider the safety & security of India’s nuclear arsenal in the control of the fascist, racist Hindu Supremacist Modi Govt. This is an issue that impacts not just the region but the world,” the Pakistan premier said in a tweet on Sunday.Singh’s statement appeared to have rattled Pakistan, which has never adopted the “no first use” policy itself, despite most of the countries in the world, including China, abiding by it.In a series of tweets, Imran repeated what he has been stating for the past two weeks: “India has been captured, as Germany had been captured by Nazis, by a fascist, racist Hindu Supremacist ideology & leadership. This threatens 9 million Kashmiris under siege in IOK for over 2 weeks which should have sent alarm bells ringing across the world with UN Observers being sent there.”
