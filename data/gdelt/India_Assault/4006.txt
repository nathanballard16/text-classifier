Lady doctor found dead at a private hospital in West Delhi

New Delhi (India) Mar 3 (ANI): A young female doctor was found dead in her cabin at a private hospital in West Delhi, the police said on Sunday.

The deceased, identified as 28-year-old Dr. Astha Munjal, was working with Maharaja Agrasen Hospital - where her body was found earlier today - for almost a year.

Munjal resided at Panchsheel Park area along with her husband, who is also a doctor.

"A PCR call was received at 5:50 am. On the first floor of Dr. Cabin of Neuro ICU, the aluminium door was locked from inside and was forcibly opened. A syringe was found lying on the floor near the dead body, the injection was taken on left arm, her bag and mobile phone were found," Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Monika Bhardwaj told ANI.

Police said guards knocked on Munjal's door at 4:30 AM but there was no response from inside. Less than an hour later, guards broke open the door and found the young doctor lying dead.

Prima facie it appears that the deceased doctor committed suicide by injecting some substance as a syringe was recovered from the crime scene. A CCTV footage of the hospital shows her attending to a patient at 12.15 AM and later entering her cabin at 12.18 AM.

The police said the body has been sent for autopsy and further investigation is being carried out. “Since it's been one year of marriage, a magisterial inquiry has also been initiated,” the police said.

Although police said preliminary investigation revealed suicide as the cause of death, the family of the deceased doctor alleged foul play and demanded a thorough investigation in the case.

Dr. Astha’s father told ANI that her daughter was killed in a planned manner, adding that she was not happy working in the hospital because of internal politics at her workplace.

He further expressed anguish as no one from the hospital has spoken to the aggrieved family. (ANI)
