7 Arrested For Being Involved In Gang-Rape And Public Shaming Of A 15-Year-Old Girl In India

The Bihar Police have arrested 7 people for being involved in an alleged public shaming and gang-rape of a 15-year-old girl in Gaya, a district in Bihar, India.

The 15-year-old girl, whose identity was not shared with the public due to a Law in India, was allegedly attacked by 6 men while she was on a walk.

The incident happened on August 14, 2019, in Gaya District.

According to Raviranjana Kumari, a police officer who is investigating the case, the 15-year-old girl was in a relationship with one of the 7 men that were arrested by the police.

The girl agreed to join the man and his friends for a walk before she was attacked and gang-raped.

After the incident happened, the mother of the 15-year-old girl went to the head of the village (Panchayat) to ask for help.

Instead of helping her and the victim, the village seniors said that she made up the entire story to destroy the names of the men.

The villagers then shaved the head of the girl and paraded her around the village for making false accusations.

The mother and the 15-year-old girl then asked help from a district officer, who launched an investigation into the case.

The police then arrested 7 people who are involved in the case.

3 people who are allegedly involved in the gang rape have been arrested by the police, and the 4 people who shaved her head have been arrested too.

Officer Raviranjana Kumari said an investigation is going on, and the other 3 men who were involved in the gang-rape are being hunted.
