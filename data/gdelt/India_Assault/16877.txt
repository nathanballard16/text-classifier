Child panel orders probe into bus mishap

Four students fell off a moving bus

The Kerala State Commission for Protection of Child Rights has registered a suo moto case in connection with the incident in which four school students were injured after falling off a moving KSRTC bus a day ago.

The students of the Government Higher Secondary School for Girls were injured in the mishap that had occurred near the All India Radio campus, Vazhuthacaud. The incident bore similarities with another that had taken place in Kovalam last month when the front door of a moving KSRTC bus gave way, resulting in two students of the Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, who stood on the footboard, sustaining injuries.

Commission chairman P. Suresh said that such incidents highlighted the apathy of officials concerned in ensuring the security of passengers, especially youngsters. The right to safe travel of children came under the ambit of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, he pointed out.

The Commission has sought inquiry reports from the State Police Chief, Transport Commissioner, Managing Director of KSRTC and the District Child Protection Officer on the incident.
