Nithyananda Sets Up Own 'Hindu Sovereign Nation' Kailaasa

Swami Premananda: Originally from Sri Lanka, the now-deceased guru was convicted of multiple counts of rape and murder in 1997. He moved to India with his followers in 1984 to escape the Sri Lankan Civil War, bringing with him undocumented Sri Lankan orphans who had been in his care. The case of murder and rape against him first came to light in 1994; one of the girls living in the ashram, Arul Jyothi, escaped and reported that she had been raped and was pregnant.
