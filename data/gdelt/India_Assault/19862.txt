AMBALA: In an apparent gang war, seven-to-eight motorcyclists fired upon a Maruti Alto car at Topkhana in Ambala Cantonment on Wednesday night, injuring its three passengers.The injured-Jeetu 'Divakar', Manish, and Sachin Verma 'Sonu'-who are all from Ambala Cantonment, were moved to the civil hospital of their city, where doctors referred Jeetu and Manish to the PGIMER (Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research) and Government Medical College and Hospital in Sector 32, Chandigarh, because of their serious injuries. This is the week's second open shooting in the constituency of Haryana home minister Anil Vij.On the complaint of injured Sachin Verma, the Ambala police on Thursday booked five local people-Saurav 'Mau', Arjan 'Ajju', Pandit 'Shammi', Randhir of Tundla, and Aman 'Appu' of Kishan Colony-besides two or three other unfamiliar accomplices he claims to have seen with them. Sachin is a coolie at the Ambala Cantonment railway station.He told police that: "On Wednesday night, four of us-my friends Jeetu and Manish, a buddy of Manish, and I-were on way to Kalarheri village from Topkhana in a Maruti Alto car. Jeetu and Manish were in the rear and I was in front with the driver. On the bend of Street Number 3, the shooters ambushed us from three motorcycles. I also took a bullet. Five of those men have an old rivalry with us. We drove away towards the Army area to save our lives."On Wednesday, injured Jeetu 'Divakar' had come out on bail. He is charged with kidnapping Saurav, who is now accused of shooting at his group for revenge.The Wednesday-night shooting was recorded on several CCTV cameras installed in the market area.
