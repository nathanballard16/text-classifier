15 months later, District Magistrate finally cans Kuldeep Singh Sengar's three arms licenses

The District Magistrate of Unnao in Uttar Pradesh has ordered the cancellation of license of arms and weapons that are owned by Unnao rape accused, Kuldeep Singh Sengar. Earlier in the week, he was also expelled from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). An order in this regard has already been issued by District Magistrate Devender Kumar Pandey.



Incidentally, on Friday, Pandey had said that the license was yet to be suspended as the administration was awaiting orders from court. He had said that since suspension of arms license was a judicial action, certain procedure needed to be followed.



Sengar has three arm licenses in his name, one each for a single barrel gun, a rifle and a revolver.



This comes a day after the CBI inspected the site of the accident as it began a probe into the incident. They investigation by the agency at the accident site continued on Saturday as well.



The Supreme Court has transferred all cases related to the Unnao rape incident, barring the accident near Raebareli, to the national capital. The top court has said that a final decision on transfer of the accident case to New Delhi will be taken after the investigation is completed by the central agency. The CBI has been given 7-14 days to investigate the accident.



The mother of the rape survivor, meanwhile, has expressed her apprehension in shifting her daughter to the national capital for further treatment. The girl is currently in a critical condition and had been put on ventilator.
