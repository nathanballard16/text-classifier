Well-known Telugu writer and noted columnist Pusarla Jagaddhatri was found dead in her apartment in Visakhapatnam's Venkojipalem area on Saturday. The MVP police, who are investigating the case, said that as per their preliminary investigation, it seemed that the writer had taken her own life.

According to media reports, the police also found two letters purportedly written by her. While one stated that no one was responsible for her death, the other was an informal will, which spoke about the distribution of her belongings.

Those close to Pusarla said that she had been depressed for a while, due to ongoing issues in her personal life. She had moved in with writer and poet Ramateertha, who had passed away in May this year after a cardiac arrest. Ever since her partner's demise, Pusarla's friends said that she had been lonely.

"She stopped writing. One day when I called her to enquire how she was, she replied that she is unable to decide to be or not to be… I have never seen her without a smile on her face. But after Ramateertha's demise, I never saw her smile," Srinivas Ganjivarapu, an activist and a close associate of Pusarla, was quoted as saying.

Pusarla's estranged husband, Shiv Prasad, has reportedly agreed to perform her last rites.

According to media reports, Pusarla had worked as a lecturer when she started her career, but was always an avid writer. She was known for translating several books from Telugu to English and vice versa. She also wrote for the Telugu daily, Andhra Bhoomi.
