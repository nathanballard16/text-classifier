Ludhiana: Not your servant to take your call, SHO tells 'assault victim'

He further introduced me to his four friends stating that I am an RSS worker following which those men started saying bad things about RSS and used derogatory language. Then I went back home and called SHO Gurbachan Singh, who said that this was not the time to call him. He said he was not a servant, to which I replied that he was a public servant. "When asked about his statement of 'not being a servant', the inspector said, "I already told him to meet Munshi but he was not listening." SHO again asked me to go to police station and was not ready to listen that nobody was opening the gate of police station.
