Cong’s jibe: From ‘Make in India’ to ‘rape in India’

NEW DELHI: Raising the Unnao rape case in Lok Sabha , Congress MP Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury Tuesday warned that the country was moving from “Make in India” to “rape in India”.Chowdhury said India was registering 106 rape cases daily and has faced the ignominy of ghastly gangrape and murder cases from Kathua to Unnao. He said it was a matter of shame for all that the Unnao rape victim died after being set ablaze by the five accused. Chowdhury claimed that no senior leader from the BJP government has spoken on the ghastly incident. “We are gradually moving towards ‘rape in India’ from ‘make in India’,” he said.
