Harvey Weinstein escapes after crashing car into tree

Harvey Weinstein crashed his 2017 Jeep earlier this week in Westchester County.

The disgraced Hollywood executive was reportedly driving along Bedford Center Road when he crashed into a tree. According to Page Six, Weinstein swerved to avoid a deer and the car flipped over on its side, leaving the 67-year-old to "kick his way out" -- escaping all injuries.

The outlet also noted that his ex-wife and Marchesa designer, Georgina Chapman, recently purchased land in Bedford and Weinstein has been "renting a small home nearby so he can be close to their kids."

The exes share daughter India Pearl, 9, and son Dashiell, 5. Weinstein has three other daughters with his ex-wife Eve Chilton.

The former film producer recently pleaded not guilty to two new counts of sexual assault. In October 2017, major outlets reported that more than a dozen women came forward with sexual assault accusations against Weinstein. He was charged by the NYPD with "rape" in May 2018 and was arrested after surrendering to police.

Weinstein is currently awaiting trial on further sexual abuse claims.
