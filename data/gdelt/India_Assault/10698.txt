COIMBATORE: Police on Wednesday arrested the 26-year-old maternal uncle of the two-and-a-half-year-old toddler, who was found dead in a well near her grandmother's house in Vilankurichi on Monday.

K Ragunathan had tried to sexually assault Arumpatha, daughter of Kanagaraj and Kanchana of Dhanalakhsmi Nagar on Vilankurichi Road, police sources said. "When she started screaming, he smothered the girl and threw the body into the well," an officer said.

According to police, after Kanagaraj left for his native place near Annur, Kanchana visited her maternal house at Palaniappagounder Thottam along with Arumpatha. Around 3am on Monday, she noticed that the child was missing from the house.

After a frantic search, the girl's body was found in a well near the house. A police team visited the crime scene and interrogated all those present in the house, including Ragunathan, son of Kanchana's father Kuppusamy's first wife.

During the inquiry, Ragunathan gave contradictory answers. Upon further interrogation, he confessed to have murdered the girl. "Ragunathan was drunk on the night of the murder. Around 3am, he carried the toddler, who was asleep, to the well, where he attempted to sexually assault her. When she started crying, he gagged her mouth, eventually smothering her. He threw the body into the well and sneaked back into the house. When the family started searching for the baby, Ragunathan also joined them,'' the officer told TOI.
