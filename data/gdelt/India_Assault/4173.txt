Pakistan detains relatives of Jaish-e-Mohammed leader, dozens of militant suspects

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan has detained two close relatives of the leader of militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), Masood Azhar, as part of a new crackdown against militant groups, the interior ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.

JeM last month carried out a suicide bombing in the disputed Kashmir region that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police, leading to a stand off between India and Pakistan.
