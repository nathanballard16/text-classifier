After the incident, the police registered two separate offences, he said.

In case of the pub brawl, an offence was registered against three persons, including Shah's grandson Yash, who were arrested, he said.

With regards to the incident at the police station, Shah, Rajiv and Yash have been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Maharashtra Police Act, the official added.
