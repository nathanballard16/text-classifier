SC seeks report from its secy-general on Unnao rape victim’s letter

The Supreme Court sought a report from its secretary-general as to why a letter written by the Unnao rape victim to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi was not placed before him.

In the letter, the woman feared threat to her life and sought direction for registration of an FIR against those who allegedly intimidated the family.



The bench, also comprising justices Deepak Gupta and Aniruddha Bose lamented that newspapers gave the impression that no action was taken by the CJI.

The observations came when senior lawyer V Giri, who is assisting the court as an amicus curiae in child rape cases, sought an urgent listing of the Unnao rape case.

The court also asked the Uttar Pradesh authorities to file a status report by tomorrow on the accident of the Unnao rape case victim.



A copy of the letter, written by the survivor and two of her family members, was also sent to the Allahabad High Court and Uttar Pradesh government authorities.
