Several TV celebs have voiced their opinion on the amended Citizenship Act CAA ) and the countrywide tension it has led to. It has triggered violent clashes between the police and students of Jamia Millia Islamia in southeast Delhi and more than 70 people, including cops have been injured, and at least four buses and two motorcycles got burnt. As soon as videos of the violent incident started doing the rounds on social media, TV celebs took to social media to raise their concerns against the police violence.A look at the tweets by some TV celebs:The bill that is now an Act makes it easier for the non-Muslim immigrants from India's neighbours - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan - to become citizens of India. Though the Bill doesn't spell it out clearly, but the fact that it entitles Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians facing religious persecution in the three nations, to seek Indian citizenship, highlights the exclusion of Muslims.The Act says the refugees of the six communities will be given Indian citizenship after residing in India for five five years, instead of 11 years earlier.
