A woman poured petrol on her minor daughter on Saturday afternoon while protesting outside Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi demanding justice for the Unnao rape victim, police said.

The six-year-old girl was rescued by police and taken to the hospital's emergency ward. The woman who threw the inflammable liquid at her daughter has been taken into police custody.

The incident occurred nearly an hour after the Unnao gang rape-and-murder victim's body was taken to her village in Uttar Pradesh from Delhi after a post-mortem.

She was airlifted to Delhi and admitted to the hospital with 90 per cent burns after she was set on fire by five persons. She died on Friday night after battling for her life for almost 40 hours.

The woman was set afire by five men, including two of her alleged rapists, on Thursday morning when she was going to Rae Bareli to attend a court hearing in the rape case filed by her.

"All the accused persons have been arrested. The case will be taken to a fast-track court, and punishment will be given," Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said.
