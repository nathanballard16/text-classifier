The counting of votes will take place on October 24, the Election Commission of India announced Saturday. The term of Haryana assembly ends on November 9 whereas, for Maharashtra, it ends on November 2.

Maharashtra has a total of 288 seats which will witness a tough contest between the ruling BJP-Shiv Sena alliance and Congress-NCP combine. Meanwhile, in the 90-member Haryana assembly, BJP aims to retain its foothold for a second term.

Raj Thackeray’s Maharashtra Navnirman Sena fared poorly in 2014 by securing merely one seat. Other parties such as Bahujan Vikas Aghadi and AIMIM won three and two seats, respectively. BJP’s victory saw Devendra Fadnavis taking over as the Chief Minister in the state.

BJP and Shiv Sena, which had not formed a pre-poll alliance had joined hands after the results. On the other hand, Congress and NCP had contested the state elections separately. NCP’s Sharad Pawar had ended the 15-year alliance after the two parties had been unable to reach a seat-sharing arrangement.
