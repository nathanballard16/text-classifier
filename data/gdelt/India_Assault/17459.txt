Accused absconding; victims discharged after treatment

Four Delhi University students were injured after they were hit allegedly by bouncers over the volume of music at a cafe lounge in north-west Delhi’s GTB Nagar on Wednesday evening, the police said on Thursday.

No arrests have been made so far, they said. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North-West) Vijayanta Arya said a PCR call was received at 8.30 p.m. regarding the incident.

On reaching the spot, the officers were told that a fight had broken out between some students and a few bouncers.

Birthday celebration

The incident happened when a 24-year-old student, Samar Singh, was celebrating his birthday with 30-35 friends at Housefull Cafe Lounge. The students had asked the staff to increase the volume of music to which the latter disagreed, the police said. This is when the bouncers intervened.

“An argument broke out between the two groups which turned into a physical fight. The students claimed that they were thrashed by the bouncers outside the lounge,” Ms. Arya said, adding that the four injured students were taken to a nearby hospital where they were discharged after treatment.

Mr. Singh had called the police and submitted a complaint at GTB Nagar police station after which a case under Sections 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt), 341 (punishment for wrongful restraint) and 34 (Common intention) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered.

“Two bouncers have been identified but are absconding. Teams are working to nab them. Further investigation is under way,” Ms. Arya added.
