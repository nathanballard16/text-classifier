500 protests have taken place in held Kashmir

SRINAGAR: At least 500 incidents of protest have broken out in occupied Kashmir since New Delhi revoked its autonomy more than three weeks ago, a senior government source said on Wednesday.

The disputed Himalayan valley is under a strict lockdown, imposed hours before India’s decision to bring Jammu and Kashmir under its direct rule. Movement is restricted and phone and internet services have been cut.

The lockdown, as well as the deployment of tens of thousands of additional troops to reinforce the 500,000 already based in the restive region, was ordered amid fears of unrest there. But protests have broken out, including in the main city of Srinagar, with police using pellet guns and tear gas to disperse the crowds.

A senior government source said at least 500 protests and incidents of stone throwing have occurred since Aug 5, with more than half taking place in Srinagar.

Nearly 100 civilians have been injured so far, with a further 300 policemen and more than 100 paramilitary personnel hurt, the official added.

“The number of protests could be much higher and bigger without the blockade in force,” the official said, adding that “anger and public defiance is constantly rising”. “Efforts for easing the conditions are made all the time but nothing seems to be working for now. There is nervousness spreading in the security establishment.”
