Bigg Boss 7 winner Gauahar Khan is currently not in Mumbai but has come out in support of the protest against CAA . She has posted a video on Twitter showing her support for the protest in Mumbai. She also expressed that though she is not in Mumbai to join the protest which is happening today but her spirit is with everyone.The actress tweeted, "Not in mumbai ! But my spirit with u ! In solidarity n support ! #PeacefulProtests #CitizenshipAmmendmentAct #BaN ! India for all ! No to #Bhedbhav NO to #Division ! HinduMuslimSikhIsaai #BhaiBhai."Kaisi Yeh Yaariyan actor Ayaz Ahmed attended the rally in Mumbai and shared a picture from the venue.Previously, several TV celebs have voiced their opinion on the amended Citizenship Act (CAA) and the countrywide tension it has led to. It had triggered violent clashes between the police and students of Jamia Millia Islamia in southeast Delhi and more than 70 people, including cops were injured, and at least four buses and two motorcycles got burnt.As soon as videos of the violent incident started doing the rounds on social media, TV celebs took to social media to raise their concerns against the police violence.The bill that is now an Act makes it easier for the non-Musllim immigrants from India's neighbours - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan - to become citizens of India. Though the Bill doesn't spell it out clearly, but the fact that it entitles Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians facing religious persecution in the three nations, to seek Indian citizenship, highlights the exclusion of Muslims.The Act says the refugees of the six communities will be given Indian citizenship after residing in India for five five years, instead of 11 years earlier.
