Day after gang rape, it was work as usual for 6 accused

LUDHIANA: After raping the 20-year-old student in Issewal, all six accused were unrepentant and went back to work like any other day, said a cop who was part of the team investigating the gang-rape case.Police have arrested all the six accused — Jagroop Singh , a resident of Jaspal Bangar who worked as a driver with a factory owner; Ajay of Tibba, also a driver with a petrol pump; a juvenile from Jammu and Kashmir and three of his relatives from Nawanshahar and Ludhiana.The accused told during interrogation that they were confident police would not be able to track them, said sources.“After raping the student, Jagroop went back home. After a good night sleep, he reported back to work. Ajay, too, went to his workplace on Gill Road and from there to Sangrur to get fuel supply. The juvenile went along with his three relatives,” the cop added.After one of the accused was rounded up, his two relatives, including the juvenile, fled to Jammu and Kashmir. “Following pressure on their families, Jagroop and a kin of the juvenile surrendered. Ajay and another relative of the minor were arrested on a tip-off from Talwandi Naubad village in Sidhwan Bet. The duo were moving from one place in the district to the other to evade arrest. And the juvenile was nabbed from New Basti Changran in Jammu and Kashmir on the same day,” said sources.The three kin of the minor had been living in Punjab for the past about 20 years.“The three were involved in about seven loot and sexual harassment incidents in the area between Jaspal Bangar and Issewal. Some of the molestation cases were not reported,” the sources added.
