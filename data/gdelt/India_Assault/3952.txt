Frenchman charged with raping minor is acquitted

The Dindoshi Sessions Court on Saturday acquitted Patrick Brillant, French national and founder trustee of a reputed school in Andheri in the 2017 rape case of then 3-year-old student. The case was initially registered by MIDC police station.

Parents upset over the decision, a parent said, "We heard the news. Acquitting the trustee was not a right judgement. We will keep fighting against what is wrong."

The advocate Suren Shetty along with other two advocates Anil Kumar Menon and Hitesh Buch who represented Patrick welcomed the judgement. Shetty said, "We are happy with the judgement of the Session Court on acquitting the trustee as the case was charged in the false premise, based on false belief, and backed by a false certificate issued by one of the doctors."

When contacted the mother of then 3-year-old victim, said, "The justice has been denied to us. We will take up the matter further now."

Brillant was once denied the bail by the Bombay High Court in November 2017. He was also restricted from entering the school was the case was registered against him.

On 18 May, parents of a kindergarten student of Andheri school filed an FIR against the trustee alleging that the child was sexually assaulted by Brillant. They also claimed that the assault had been taking place for months.
