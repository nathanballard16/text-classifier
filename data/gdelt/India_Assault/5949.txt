‘Cunning’ PM Modi can even claim credit for killing Ravan, says Ajit Singh

Lucknow:

Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) chief Ajit Singh on Wednesday took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi by saying that he is a ‘cunning’ person and believe no one other than him. "This man is so smart and cunning that if he had gone to Sri Lanka he would have told us that he is the one who has killed Ravana because you see nobody has done anything apart from him," Singh said while addressing a rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Baghpat.

He also claimed that the government spends Rs 70,000 crore on Modi's clothes and despite this, he has the audacity to say 'I am a beggar.'

"This man wear caps, which are not the ones you wear. He gets caps from I don't know where and then has the audacity to say 'I am a beggar,' if he is a beggar then I pray to God that I be made a beggar too. They will eat, wear, travel for free and when it comes to taking some responsibility he will say I am a beggar," Singh was quoted as saying by ANI.

Taking a jibe at Modi’s Chowkidar campaign, the RJD chief said that the country needs Prime Minister and not a watchman. "If we need a chowkidar we will get it from Nepal. We need a Prime Minister," he said.

Addressing another rally in Ghaziabad, Singh claimed people have begun raising slogans like 'hai, hai Modi, bye, bye Modi' because of the government's ‘anti-farmer’ policies.

Singh made the claim while addressing a rally in Patla town of Ghaziabad district. Patla falls under the Baghpat Lok Sabha constituency from where his son Jayant Chaudhary is contesting. Baghpat goes to poll in the first phase on April 11 along with 91 Lok Sabha seats across 20 states.
