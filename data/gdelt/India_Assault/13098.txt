CBI forms additional special team to probe Unnao rape survivor's accident

New Delhi:

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has formed an additional special team of 20 members to probe the Unnao rape survivor's accident case, an agency spokesperson informed on Friday. The 20-member special team will join the five-member team already investigating the case in Lucknow.

In addition to this, six top forensic experts from the Central Forensic Sciences Laboratory have also rushed to the crime scene, he said. According to news agency PTI, citing sources, the forensic team reached the crime scene in a Swift car, same as the Unnao rape vicitm and her family members were travelling in. They have also started recreating the crime scene.

The girl, allegedly raped by four-time MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in 2017 when she was a minor, is battling for life after a truck with its number plates painted black rammed into the car she was travelling in with some family members and her lawyer. While two of her aunts died in the accident last Sunday, her lawyer is still critical.

The family of the girl has alleged that accident was a planned conspiracy by the now expelled BJP MLA to eliminate her and the witnesses of the case. Following the accident, the case again came in the limelight with Supreme Court ordering Rs 25 lakh compensation and central security cover to the girl and her family.

The top court also ordered to move all the cases related to the Unnao incident to Delhi from Uttar Pradesh, where the now expelled BJP MLA was allegedly being helped by the Police and the state government. The court has also directed the CBI to complete the probe in seven days.
