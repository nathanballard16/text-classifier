KARACHI: Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Friday visited the Karachi Corps and Pakistan Rangers Sindh formations in border areas, according to the military's media wing.

According to a press release issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the army chief during his visit to the formations praised the state of readiness of the forces "for response against any conventional threat".

The army chief's visit comes in the backdrop of heightened tensions between India and Pakistan. On Thursday, the Indian forces' unprovoked aggression across the Line of Control (LoC) had resulted in the martyrdom of two Pakistan Army soldiers.

Pakistan Army had effectively responded to Indian shelling.

Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday had said India would conduct a false flag operation in Azad Kashmir to divert the world's attention from its contentious citizenship law that has triggered protests in the entire country.

"I am telling you now, Modi will use this [protests in India] to do something in Azad Kashmir," the prime minister had said. "I informed Gen Bajwa about this and he told me that Pakistan Army is ready for India."

PM Imran said Modi had thousands of Muslims massacred in Gujarat and was also responsible for injuring thousands of Kashmiris in the occupied valley through pellet guns.

"I want you to listen to my prediction. The people of India will stand up against Modi. Not only Muslims but Hindus, Sikhs and Christians," he had said. "They know that what he is about to do in India is the same what Hitler did 60-70 years ago against the Jews."
