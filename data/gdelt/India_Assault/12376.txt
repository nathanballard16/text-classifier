IOK: Students injured in Indian forces’ raid on varsity

F.P. Report

ISLAMABAD: In occupied Kashmir, dozens of students were critically injured during a raid by Indian troops on the boys’ hostel of the Central University of Kashmir in Ganderbal.

According to Kashmir Media Service, as the students and scholars objected to the unjustified raid, the troops went berserk and started beating them with their guns. Two grievously injured students were shifted to Soura Institute of Medical Sciences in Srinagar for treatment.

The brutal action of the Indian troops forced the students to raise anti-India and pro-freedom slogans.

Meanwhile, senior APHC leader and Chairman of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir, Ashraf Sehrai in a statement in Srinagar said the acquittal of four illegally detained Kashmiris after 23 years gave an idea of the biased mindset of Indian judiciary against the people of Kashmir.

While commenting on the release of Mirza Nisar, Muhammad Ali Killay, Latif Ahmed Waza and Asadullah Goni from New Delhi’s Tihar jail, he said after incriminating them in false cases, the Indian judicial system made them spend twenty-three years of their lives in jail.

The APHC leader demanded unconditional release of all political prisoners of Kashmir languishing in different jails of India and the territory.

The Jammu and Kashmir Islami Tanzeem-e-Azadi in a statement in Srinagar said the family members of illegally detained party Chairman, Abdul Samad Inqilabi were worried about his well-being as they do not know about his whereabouts after July 19 when he was reportedly released from Kot Bhalwal Jail, Jammu.
