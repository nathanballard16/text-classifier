3 men on bike beat decorated Army officer on Mumbai footpath

A decorated officer of the Indian Army, who had repulsed terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, faced hooliganism on the streets of Mumbai when he was allegedly assaulted by three young men riding a motorcycle on a footpath in suburban Malad last week, police said Monday.

The trio were arrested later.

Sadly, no member of public intervened when Anup Joseph Manjali (36), a Kirti Chakra awardee Lieutenant Colonel, was beaten up by the trio following an argument.

The incident occurred on the night of January 5 in Malad (west) when Lt Colonel Manjali, who was in civil dress, was waiting for his mother on a footpath, a police official said.

He said a man drove his motorcycle on the footpath and asked Lt Colonel Manjali to move out of way, following which an argument broke out between them.

Soon one of the two men riding pillion pushed Lt Colonel Manjali while another started hitting the officer on his head and face with a helmet, the official said, adding that the motorcycle rider also joined them in the attack.

The official said the Lt. Colonel didn't fight back.

"The trio left Manjali following intervention by his mother," he said.

The injured Army officer was taken to hospital where doctors found that one of his shoulders got dislocated, he said.

After a case was registered on January 6 under various sections of the IPC and Motor Vehicle Act, police traced the three men and arrested them.

The Army officer had gunned down three terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir in 2012 when he was posted with the Rashtriya Rifles, the official said.

The Lt Colonel is currently attached with the 12 Bihar regiment, he said, adding that he is recuperating.

Kirti Chakra is the second in order of precedence of peacetime gallantry awards given for valour, courageous action or self-sacrifice away from the field of battle.
