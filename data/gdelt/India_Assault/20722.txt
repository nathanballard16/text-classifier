Jackals Save Honey Badger From Python's Grip By Biting Reptile In Fight Caught On Camera

A pair of jackals rescued a honey badger from a python by biting the reptile. The fight took place in Botswana’s Chobe Park last month and was beautifully captured by 60-year-old Roselyne Kerjosse, who released the photos Monday.

The series of photographs begins with the reptile coiling itself around the honey badger’s body. The mammal can be seen lying helpless with the snake wrapped around its body. Two jackals then enter the frame and rescue the mammal by biting the python. The honey badger then fights with the jackals to get hold of the python and the three indulge in a tug of war. The mammal then tried to bite one of the jackals when it tried to pick the python by its tail. The fight ended with honey badger taking away the snake into a nearby bush.

“I was very disappointed because the honey badger, often described as brave and tenacious, was one of the animals I wanted to see during my safari, but not in this situation. I felt a big relief when the badger escaped,” the photographer said.

The incident comes less than a month after a leopard bit a python after the reptile tried to eat the animal at Kenya’s Maasai Mara Triangle Reserve. The fight, which was captured by 28-year-old Canadian photographer Mike Welton, showed the reptile attacking the leopard. The big cat, which is initially taken off guard, attacks the reptile before biting and crushing it.
