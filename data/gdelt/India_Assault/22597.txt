First Road-Related Death of the Year in Patna; Speeding Truck Kills One

Patna: While most people in Patna district were busy celebrating the arrival of 2019, an angry mob on Bihta-Khagaul Road in Patna on Tuesday set an auto-rickshaw on fire after a speeding truck mowed over a man on bike killing him on the spot.

As reported, Ravi Mishra, the 28-year old son of Suresh Mishra, was going to a pharmacy on his motorcycle to get medicine for his ailing father when a truck coming from Patna side hit him head on.

The driver of the truck fled the scene with the vehicle leaving Ravi in a pool of blood. By the time a crowd gathered, Ravi was already dead.

Angered by the accident, a mob went on a rampage damaging several passing-by vehicles. They also took their ire out on an innocent auto-rickshaw driver by torching his vehicle, his livelihood.

The body of the victim was sent to the Danapur Hospital for post mortem.

Grieving family members said Ravi worked as a locomotive driver in the Northern Railways and had come to Bihta after hearing his father was ill. Around 4:00 pm, he was going to a drug store on his motorcycle when a truck coming from the opposite direction slammed into him throwing him several feet in the air.

The trauma was severe enough to kill him on the spot.

Based on the video surveillance footage from the area, police are trying to identify the owner of the truck and its driver, police station in-charge Ranjit Kumar Singh said.
