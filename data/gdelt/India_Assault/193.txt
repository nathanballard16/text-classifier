Chennai: In another case of sexual assault at the hands of a self-styled godman, a woman was sexually assaulted near Minjur, Thiruvallur. The incident has come as a big shock for women devotees who used to visit the popular temple regularly.

The temple was famous for ‘prophesies’ given to women to rid them of their family problems. This superstitious belief was widely accepted by the locals of Thiruvallur district near Chennai and hence, a lot of women frequented the place.

The accused, 55-year-old Rajasekar, had been reading and orating ‘prophesy’ for almost last three years at a Karuppasamy temple in Devadanam village next to Minjur. It is said that devotees from Chennai, Kanchipuram and Thiruvallur districts visited the temple regularly. Generally, the self-styled godman used to spend more time with woman devotees.

A newly married woman visited the temple a couple of days ago to meet him. The accused then told her that he knew about her depression and had the ultimate solution to rid her of all her problems. However, he refused to tell the remedy in public and asked her to come separately at another isolated location.

Since she believed the words of the fake godman, she went along with him. The accused asked her to close her eyes and pray to god and then, touched her private parts and acted like he was murmuring some mantras.

Alarmed, the victim somehow managed to flee the scene of crime and registered a police complaint against the accused at the Ponneri Women Police station. The self-styled godman Rajasekar then questioned and subsequently arrested. He was produced before Ponneri magistrate and remanded to Puzhal Central Jail.
