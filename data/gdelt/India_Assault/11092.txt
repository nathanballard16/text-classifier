Congress president Rahul Gandhi to step down: A definitive list of names who served before him

Rahul Gandhi Wednesday reiterated his stand that he is firm on stepping down as Congress president. In a four-page open letter to Congress workers, he said: “We will not defeat our opponents without sacrificing the desire for power and fighting a deeper ideological battle.”

“As president of the Congress party, I am responsible for the loss of the 2019 election. Accountability is critical for the future growth of out party. It is for this reason that I have resigned as Congress president,” he said.

On the party choosing its next president, he wrote: “Many of my colleagues suggested that I nominate the next Congress president. While it is important for someone new to lead out party, it would not be correct for me to select that person.”

“I trust the party will make the best decision regarding who can lead us with courage, love and fidelity,” he added.
