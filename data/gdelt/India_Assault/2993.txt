Asaram ran a worldwide chain of over 400 ashrams and is also accused of raping two sisters in Surat between 2002 and 2004. Serving a life term for the heinous crime, Asaram has applied for bail on previous occasions too and all his pleas have been rejected.

Moreover, during Asaram’s trial in Jodhpur, a total of nine witnesses who had testified against him were attacked. Three key witnesses also died during the course of the trial, prompting the law and order machinery to provide safety to the witnesses and their families.
