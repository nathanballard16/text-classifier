According to media in India, police initially refused to file the victim's complaint.

However, they are said to have processed it once she approached a court.

The man allegedly let his friends gang-rape his wife after he lost to them, the Daily Star reports.

The victim is said to have gone to a relative's house after the incident.

It is claimed her husband followed her there in his car and apologised.
