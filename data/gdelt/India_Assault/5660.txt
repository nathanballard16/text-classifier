The Rajasthan police on Thursday arrested a man on charges of demanding 'supari' (ransom) to kill Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

According to Bajaj Nagar Police station sub-inspector Ramkripal Yadav, the accused on March 26 night posted on his Facebook wall saying, 'Kya koi hai jo mujhe Modi ko marne ki supari de sake, mere pass foolproof plan hai" (is there someone who can pay me ransom for killing PM Modi, I have foolproof plan).

On Thursday morning, the police after receiving the information arrested the accused, said a police officer.

The accused has been identified as Naveen Yadav, who has been staying in Jaipur for the last 10 years.

During interrogation, the accused told the police that he had been posting on his facebook wall against politicians for years. "He said he was feeling sorry now for posting against the PM," said a police officer, adding the accused had posted the content from his fake account.

The accused is a graduate and his father is a CRPF retiree. Yadav has been working in a bookshop which also provides printouts to school students.

His family members have been informed, police said, adding further investigation is on.
