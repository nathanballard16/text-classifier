Authorities have to ensure she does not come face to face with the accused during trial proceedings

He also directed that the survivor be brought on a stretcher or a trolley and stationed "at the right side of the dais in the seminar hall so that she faces the court and not the counsel for the parties".

The proceedings will be closed and no other public person would be allowed to enter the seminar hall without the court's permission.

There will be no audio or video recording of the survivor's deposition.

The court further instructed the AIIMS facility's medical superintendent to ensure that surveillance cameras installed in the seminar hall remain switched off during the proceedings.

Authorities have also been directed to ensure that the survivor does not come face to face with the accused – Kuldeep Sengar or Shashi Singh.

The court instructed the centre's management to "place a stand with curtains" so the accused can hear and observe the court proceedings from behind the curtains. It also asked the management to ensure that the survivor does not come in contact with the accused persons.
