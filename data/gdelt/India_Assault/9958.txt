Efforts on to end West Bengal doctors’ agitation

Efforts are on to end the West Bengal Doctors agitation which entered the 7th day today.

The agitation began on Monday night when two junior doctors of NRS Hospital in Kolkata were injured in an attack by relatives of a patient who died. Except emergency services, all other services including OPD in government-owned hospitals in the state have stopped.

Meanwhile, spokesman of the agitating doctors said in Kolkata that they are open to dialogue. He said they are eagerly waiting to break the deadlock. The doctors are demanding their security at the workplace.

State Governor KN Tripathi had written to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to take immediate steps to provide security to the medicos and find out a solution to the impasse.

Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan had also written to the Chief Minister. He also asked states to consider enacting specific legislation for protecting doctors and medical professionals from any form of violence.

Meanwhile, pressure on the State Government is building up. A large number of doctors of government hospitals in the state have resigned.

Junior doctors in hospitals across the country have undertaken token strike to express their solidarity with the agitating doctors of West Bengal. Indian Medical Association has called a day’s strike tomorrow.
