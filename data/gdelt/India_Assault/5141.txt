One Of 7 Kidnapped Indians Returns Home From Afghanistan

One of the seven Indian nationals has safely returned to India ten months after being kidnapped in northern Baghlan province, the India’s External Affairs Ministry said Monday.

The statement said that India continued to work closely with the Afghan government for the safe and early return of the remaining six Indian nationals.

"We are grateful to Government of Afghanistan for their support in securing the release and repatriation of the Indian national," according to the statement.

The Indian engineers of KEC International, an RPG group company, were working on a project for the construction of a power sub-station in the country.

India has been carrying reconstruction activities in the war-torn country. It has already provided at least USD 2 billion aid to Afghanistan.
