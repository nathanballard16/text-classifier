Bengaluru: Miscreants threw stones at the house of actor Darshan and damaged his car on Saturday, three days after he started drumming up support for actress Sumalatha Ambareesh, who is contesting from Mandya Lok Sabha constituency against Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy's son.

Ms Sumalatha, wife of actor and three-time Mandya MP Ambareesh, is contesting as an independent against former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's grandson and Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy's son Nikhil Kumaraswamy. Flanked by an enormous crowd, she filed her nominations on March 20, which was followed by an emotional speech.

Darshan, who too hails from Mandya, is among the many film actors and prominent persons from the Kannada film industry, including Yash and 'Rockline' Venkatesh, who openly came out in support of Sumalatha.

According to police, the actor was in Hyderabad for shooting when the incident occurred in the early hours Saturday.

Reacting to the incident, Ms Sumalatha said "Such intimidating tactics will not work. Nobody can dare threaten Darshan and Yash. Our workers need get provoked by such incidents.”

Protesting against the incident, fans of the actor blocked traffic in Raja Rajeshwari Nagar police station limits on Saturday, demanding immediate arrest of those who damaged the residence and car of Darshan.

Police said a security guard at the actor’s residence chased the accused but they managed to escape.
