AAP says woman worker assaulted by BJP, police say attack not political

The Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) South Delhi Lok Sabha candidate Raghav Chadha on Thursday said a senior woman party volunteer was cornered and assaulted by people belonging to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in south Delhi’s Hari Nagar near Badarpur.

The BJP rejected the charge.

AAP’s Badarpur legislative assembly ND Sharma said that the woman volunteer wearing the party’s cap was walking alone when she was attacked.

Sharma said the woman’s clothes were torn by people on bikes, adding that they were with the BJP.

“BJP candidate Ramesh Bidhuri’s reputation for harbouring anti Purvanchal sentiments is known well far and wide. The attack on our volunteer, who hails from UP but has made Delhi her home since decades is an assault on women’s safety, women’s honour and the Purvanchali honour,” Chadha said in a press statement.

Bidhuri, dismissed the allegations, saying, “AAP has lost the political battle. So it is trying all tricks against me and my party. Let the police probe the case. The truth will come out.”

DCP (southeast) Chinmoy Biswal termed the incident as a fight between neighbours over a petty issue and too dismissed the allegation saying that the attackers were not associated with any political party. “The woman’s neighbour was asking his friend to bring ice-cream for him by addressing him as an ‘aam aadmi’. The woman thought that he made the remarks on her and protested. An argument broke out between them and she was assaulted. We are registering a case and action as per law will be taken,” added Biswal.
