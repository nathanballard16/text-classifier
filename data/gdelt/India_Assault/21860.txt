Youth Congress, PFI members plotted to set secretariat ablaze: Assam minister

GUWAHATI: The Assam government on Tuesday alleged it has evidence that members of two fundamentalist Islamic organisations Popular Front of India (PFI) and Campus Front of India — along with some Youth Congress members, tried to storm and set ablaze the state secretariat by posing as anti-CAA protesters on December 12.The government has asked NIA to probe the matter. “We have electronic evidence. The deadliest attack was planned to burn down the state secretariat and demolish the city. The arson was pre-planned and it had no connection with the peaceful movement (by students and the civil society). We have handed over the investigation to NIA to unearth the deep-rooted political conspiracy,” Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said.“We also have evidence of a leading academician working with a central government institute in Guwahati sending out instructions to those on the ground in front of the Janata Bhawan (secretariat) on how to burn it down. He is a silent operator who was coordinating the attack on the phone. This person was instructing the protesters that politicians should stay away and protesters should then go and attack the Janata Bhawan.”Sarma, however, declined to name the ‘handler’.Sarma flashed still pictures pulled out of TV footages and also showed videos in support of the government’s allegations. “Assam Youth Congress chief Kamrul Islam Choudhury is seen shaking hands (with a person whom Sarma didn’t identify) with fire blazing behind him,” he said, adding that another Congress member from Nagaon made an appeal on December 11, asking everyone to gather in front of the Janata Bhawan.Denying the allegations, Choudhury said, “Yes, I, as a Congress member and a worker, did join the protests. But I was not involved in any kind of violence as alleged by Himanta Biswa Sarma.”
