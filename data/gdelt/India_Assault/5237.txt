Delhi Crime first impression: Netflix series based on Nirbhaya rape case has a riveting narrative

Netflix's Delhi Crime starring Shefali Shah in the lead delves into how police investigated Nirbhaya rape case and got hold of the culprits.

Netflix's Delhi Crime premieres on March 22. The seven-episode series directed by Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta is based on Nirbhaya rape case that shook the nation in 2012. It still sends a chill down the spine when one remembers the details of the gruesome gang rape. The series delves into how police investigates the case and gets hold of Nirbhaya's culprits.

Richie Mehta has worked on the script for four years and that reflects in the final output as the minutest of details have been taken care of. Delhi Crime provides important insights into Delhi Police's world, their challenges, limitations, internal politics and external pressures.

The series has an amazing cast which includes Shefali Shah, Adil Hussain, Rasika Dugal, Rajesh Tailang, Anurag Arora, Gopal Datt, and Vinod Sherawat. Actress Shefali Shah's Vartika Chaturvedi is inspired by Chhaya Sharma who headlined the Delhi Police team that nabbed Nirbhaya's culprits.

Shefali Shah in impeccable as Vartika and she has kept is so real that it's hard to imagine anyone else portray the role than her. She is aghast after knowing the details of the crime but she holds the fort and gets her team to solve the case. Filmmaker Richie Mehta did not get into the details of the horrific crime but focused on the aftermath of it that included the protests and candlelight vigils held in the entire country.

One can easily fall into the trap of sensationalism while portraying one of the most talked about case but Delhi Crime will not once make you cringe because of its content. It's a well-researched and painstakingly made series, which will make you see the police in a new light. Richie tried to represent the roadblocks the cops have to deal with while working on a case, be it lack of funds or manpower. One could easily say that the series is biased towards the police but Richie himself has accepted that he wanted to show the ordeal that the police went through and despite their challenges timely solved the case.

On @Netflix March 22nd. I watched a 2 episode preview & it's quite well researched and well made. (Except Minor concerns but they are minor) For the many people who have expressed a hesitation to see it, there is NO graphic violence. #DelhiCrime #nirbhaya https://t.co/b2cst9izA6 Anusha Yadav (@anushayadav) March 19, 2019
