A relative of Murugan and Nalini, two of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, has moved a petition in the Madras High Court to shift Murugan from solitary confinement to the general prison.

Murugan was put into solitary confinement on October 19 after a mobile phone and charger were seized from his possession, prison officials said on Saturday. Following the move, Murugan and Nalini both began hunger strikes, they said. Before the move, the couple was allowed to meet once a week — a facility that has now been revoked, according to Nalini’s lawyer.

On Friday, a bench of Justices M M Sundresh and R M T Teekaa Raman issued notices to the ADGP, IG of Prisons and the Vellore prison superintendent, giving them two weeks to reply on the matter

“In protest against the solitary confinement, Murugan is fasting for the past 10 days. His condition is slowly deteriorating. We have had a negotiation meeting today (Saturday) also to make him withdraw his protest,” the prison official said.

Nalini’s lawyer, M Radhakrishnan, said she had also been fasting from 10 days in protest.

“…Murugan’s niece filed the petition as the solitary confinement continues even as a penalty was imposed for the alleged seizure of the mobile phone,” said Radhakrishnan.
