Earlier Akshay Kumar, Sona Mohapatra amongst many other stars had raised their voice against this injustice. Akshay Kumar had tweeted, “Whether it is #PriyankaReddy in Hyderabad, #Roja in Tamil Nadu or the law student gang-raped in Ranchi, we seem to be losing it as a society. It has been 7 yrs to the gut-wrenching #Nirbhaya case & our moral fabric continues to be in pieces. We need stricter laws. This needs to STOP!”

In between all this, known sexual predators are endlessly platformed & sexual aggression normalised.”
