Protests over citizenship Bill rage in north-east India

GUWAHATI (India) • Protesters set fire to tyres and cut down trees to block roads in a shutdown yesterday across India's north-east, hours after lawmakers approved the government's new citizenship Bill.

The legislation, set to go before the Upper House today, will fast-track citizenship claims by refugees from three neighbouring countries - but not if they are Muslim. For Islamic groups, the opposition, rights groups and others, this fits into Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist agenda to marginalise India's 200 million Muslims - something he denies.

People in north-east India object for different reasons, fearing citizenship for large numbers of Hindu migrants from Bangladesh, who are regarded as intruders.

Yesterday, the region sandwiched between Bangladesh, China and Myanmar was crippled by a general strike called by dozens of organisations, with buses off the roads and most schools and shops shut.

"The bandh (strike) has drawn a total response in the north-eastern states," said Mr Samujjal Bhattacharyya from the powerful umbrella group the North East Students' Organisation.

"We have made it clear... the CAB (Citizenship Amendment Bill) will not be accepted, and we are going to intensify our agitation," he told Agence France-Presse.

"Assam and north-eastern states have already taken a huge burden of illegal foreigners," he said.

India's Lower House passed the Bill just after midnight, following a fiery debate that saw one Muslim MP compare the government to the Nazis. The Bill, once it passes into law, will make it much easier for Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis and Christians fleeing Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to become Indians.

The Modi government says Muslims are excluded because they do not face persecution in these three countries. Also excluded are minorities fleeing other countries - such as Tamils from Sri Lanka, Rohingya from Myanmar and Tibetans from China.
