Mumbai: A man has been arrested by Cuffe Parade police in Mumbai for allegedly sexually assaulting a Brazilian national. The 37-year-old Brazilian national had submitted a complaint to police few days back, said a police officer.

The accused has been identified as Padmakar Nandekar. The police have charged the accused under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code. A police officer said that the arrest in the case came following a probe into the incident.

According to a report in Indian Express, the women did not file the complaint immediately after the incident. “Further inquiry in the matter is on. The victim's statement will be recorded soon,” the report quoted a police official as saying.

Earlier in December 2018, a 48-year-old British national was allegedly raped by an unidentified man while she was strolling at a beach in Goa. The incident was reported from Canacona town, located about 100 km from Panaji.

In November 2017, a 20-year-old foreign national accused a bank manager in Mathura of allegedly raping her on pretext of friendship. The victim said she was raped repeatedly since she came to India in September after they met on Facebook.

According to police, both the victim and the accused knew each other through Facebook since November 2016. The two were staying together after the victim came to India.
