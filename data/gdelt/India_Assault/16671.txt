Cook sets himself ablaze, body found after 2 days

Ludhiana: Depressed after losing his arm in a road accident, a 37-year-old man set himself on fire at his house in Bhukhari Kalan village, Jamalpur. Even as Janardan Prasad took the extreme step on October 4, his decomposed body was found on Sunday after neighbours complained of foul smell emanating from his house.

Prasad, who worked as a cook at a private hospital, along with his wife Sheela Devi and two children lived in a rented accommodation in Mohalla Fatehganj of Division 3.

Devi told the police, “My husband had met with an accident in Haridwar, Uttarakhand, two months ago. He has been depressed since then as he had lost an arm in the crash. This dejection turned him into a hard drinker.”

Jamalpur police station ASI Gurmeet Singh said, “Prasad had left his house 10 days ago without informing his family. Since then, he had been putting up alone in Bhukhri Kalan village, where he owned a house. His neighbours called us up on Sunday, complaining of foul smell emitting from the house. The house was locked from inside. After breaking open the main door, we found Prasad charred to death. His room was also burnt.”

Police said it seemed to be a case of suicide. “It appears he set himself ablaze about two days ago. His family had not lodged any missing complaint,” the ASI added.

Devi said they tried to contact Prasad many a time, but his phone was switched off.

Police have initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC.
