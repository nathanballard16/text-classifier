High Court summons SP in sexual assault case

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Monday summoned the Superintendent of Police of Thanjavur to appear before it on January 22 to ascertain action taken so far in a case pertaining to the sexual assault of a young woman in Thanjavur.

A Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and P.D. Audikesavalu had earlier initiated suo motu proceedings in the case after taking cognisance of a letter written by the mother of the woman to the court on the incident. The court had sought an action taken report in the case and had ordered notice to the Thanjavur police.

The woman, in her letter to the court, said that her daughter, a garment unit worker, was invited to a factory’s get-together function. She alleged that the woman was offered a drink which was spiked and subsequently assaulted sexually by influential men.

Though a complaint was lodged, the police did not take action against the influential men.

Accusing the police of shielding the accused, she sought a direction to the authorities concerned to conduct a proper, fair and impartial investigation in the case.
