Supreme Court of India Rejects Petitions Seeking Intervention in Jamia University Protests Violence

After the counsel including Senior Advocates Indira Jaising and Colin Gonsalves mentioned the matter on Monday, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case on Tuesday.

The Supreme Court Bench said: "We are confident that appropriate inquiries will be made."

On Sunday, several rounds of shots were heard at the Jamia Millia Islamia University in Delhi, while heavy police forces were deployed at the site.

According to Jamia Millia Islamia University's Chief Proctor Waseem Ahmed Khan, the police entered the university campus building by force, and several students were reportedly taken in for questioning in police vehicles.

The protests at the universities are being witnessed in the wake of the contentious Citizenship Amendment Act and the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC).

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) enacted last week, grants citizenship to illegal immigrants from six religious minorities – Hindus, Parsis, Jains, Christians, Buddhists and Sikhs, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, if they arrived in India before 2015 but excludes Muslims with the same circumstances.

A segment of Muslims fears that when the NRC is launched across India, only Muslims will have to prove their citizenship and not people of any other faiths. Regardless of being illegal migrants in India from neighbouring Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, under this new Act, non-muslims will just need to show their papers as per the exemptions granted under the new citizenship law.

More than 100 activists and 35 police officers, including some senior officers, were injured in the protests at Jamia Millia Islamia while about 60 students were reportedly injured at Aligarh Muslim University.
