A young bear has fell to its death from a cliff after it was chased and pelted with stones by villagers.

Distressing footage emerged capturing the brown bear cub struggling to climb a steep slope in the Drass area of Jammu and Kashmir in India.

Locals were said to have spotted the animal in the village and chased it to the cliff before throwing stones at it.

The endangered animal was struck by a number of stones before it fell into the river below.

A crowd can be heard cheering in the background as the bear plunges to its death.

The heartbreaking incident happened on May 10.

It's believed the bear had just escaped from the village where it got trapped in barbed wire while looking for food.

Shortly after it freed itself, angry locals began chasing it.

Brown bears, also known as the Himalayan brown bears, are considered critically endangered in India.

It is believed there are between 500 to 700 left in the country.

Last May, a tourist was mauled to death by bear when he tried to take selfie with the animal near a forest in Nabaragpur in Odisha.

Heartless locals tracked the animal down and clubbed it to death with sticks.
