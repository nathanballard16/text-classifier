Indian occupying forces use rape as a tool in occupied Kashmir: President

President Dr Arif Alvi says Indian occupying forces use rape as a tool in occupied Kashmir which was also highlighted by Human Rights Watch in one of its reports.

On his twitter account, the President tagged a clip of the Indian TV programme in which an Indian retired army officer SP Sinha and a BJP leader, shamefully advocated rape of Kashmiri women.

Dr Arif Alvi said imagine the fate of women in Indian Occupied Kashmir where such men wield power with total impunity.

During the programme, the other participants and female host could be seen shouting "Sinha down" with loud condemnation over his appalling remarks.

Human Rights Watch in its report titled, “India’s secret army in Kashmir, New patterns of abuse emerge in the conflict,” found the Indian occupying forces' involvement in such heinous acts of gross human rights violations.

It said these incidents were never investigated by the judicial and medical authorities competent to determine culpability.
