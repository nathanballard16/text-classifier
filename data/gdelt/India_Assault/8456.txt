One Nation truck set on fire in Tasmania

A One Nation truck has been 'torched' in Tasmania, according to party leader Pauline Hanson.

Last night, just hours after the federal election, local candidate Adam Lambert left the campaign truck in a Hobart car park as he bought groceries.

He later filmed what he found on his return, telling supporters on social media: "You see a lot of red and blue lights going on - this is the way I returned to the vehicle coming out of the shopping centre this evening.

"And this is after the election, when all is said and done. The way I figure it is - if you don't like us, don't vote for us," he said, adding: "What a mess, what a mess. "

Thanking supporters during the "long hard campaign ", which resulted in a 36 hour stint on the last day, Mr Lambert ended the 90 second clip with an ironic "Happy Sunday ".

Pauline Hanson also tweeted about the incident, saying: "Our One Nation truck in Tasmania was parked outside a shop while our candidate was buying groceries. Someone was seen torching it before fleeing. "

"It is amazing how the left call for tolerance but act like they’re above the law when you don’t agree with their ideologies," she added.

Tasmania Police and Tasmanian Fire Service have not confirmed the incident but are investigating a vehicle fire near the Shoreline Hotel in Howrah, which is being treated as 'suspicious'.
