Police move court to reopen Pehlu case

ALWAR/JAIPUR: State police have moved court for permission to reopen the investigation into the cow smuggling case against lynching victim Pehlu Khan’s two sons and a third person.Pehlu, a dairy farmer, was fatally assaulted by cow vigilantes in 2017, more than two years before a chargesheet filed by police named him and his two sons in a case of “transporting cattle without the requisite permit”.Alwar SP Paris Deshmukh told TOI that Pehlu’s two sons, Irshad and Arif, had requested the state DGP to reinvestigate the case, based on which police sought the court’s permission to “probe five points”.Hukum Chand Sharma, counsel for the accused, accused police of focusing on the peripheral aspects of the case instead of probing Pehlu’s murder. “The (Congress) government is playing politics in the name of cows,” he said.The plea to reopen the investigation is likely to be heard on Monday.Pehlu, his two sons and a few others were transporting cows from Jaipur to their native village in Haryana’s Nuh district when they were intercepted and thrashed by cow vigilantes near Behror, in Alwar district , on April 1, 2017. Pehlu died of his injuries on April 3.Behror police station registered seven FIRs after the incident, one in connection with the lynching and six for “illegal transport of bovines”.The last of the six chargesheets in the cattle smuggling case wasn’t filed until May 24 this year. It states that Pehlu and his sons had violated the Bovine Act of 1995.Pehlu’s sons have contested the allegation, saying they bought the cows at a cattle fair in Jaipur and had receipts for the same.In the case pertaining to Pehlu’s lynching, seven accused were arrested and two minors detained. The chargesheet against all nine accused was submitted in the additional district judge’s court in Behror on February 25 this year.Reports on Pehlu’s name featuring in one of the chargesheets in the cattle smuggling case had caused an uproar, prompting Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot to clarify that it was “factually incorrect”.Police said the third accused named in the chargesheet was one Khan Mohammad.
