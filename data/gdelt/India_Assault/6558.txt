SURAT: A 35-year-old swami of Swami Narayan Gurukul located on Ved Road was booked on Tuesday for trying to sexuallly assault a 14-year-old student of the gurukul. The accused is on the run since Monday.

Patit Pawan Swami allegedly tried to get physical with the class IX boy but he escaped from the gurukul campus and went straight to his house. The boy informed his family who approached police.

The accused had called the student at an isolated place adjoining the exhibition hall in the basement of the hostel block on the campus of the gurukul. When the student reached the room, the accused asked him to sit on floor where he made the advances.

Family members alleged that the room was chosen by the accused because it was not under CCTV camera coverage.

Family members alleged that the accused swami had tried to molest the student 10 days ago too.

“We are yet to arrest the swami, who is on the run. We will nab him soon,” said a police officer of Katargam police station.
