Follow us on Veteran actor Alok Nath granted anticipatory bail in rape case

Actor Alok Nath has been granted anticipatory bail by a court in Mumbai in an alleged rape case. The City Civil and Sessions Court at Dindoshi here heard Alok's plea seeking protection from arrest following an FIR from the writer-director, who has claimed he raped her 19 years ago, said official sources.

The victim had lodged the complaint with Oshiwara Police on October 17 last year after Alok hit back by filing a defamation case against her in a Mumbai Magistrate Court. Alok had denied all the allegations levelled by the victim and lodged the defamation case demanding Re.1 as damages and a written apology from her.

Known for his 'sanskaari' image on the big screen, Alok was expelled from the Cine & TV Artistes Association last year after the rape charges came to the fore. It was in October that the Tara producer shared her ordeal in a long Facebook post, amid the #MeToo movement wave that hit India.
