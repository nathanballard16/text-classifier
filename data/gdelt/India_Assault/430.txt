Global Amphibious Ship Market Report 2018

DUBLIN, Jan 9, 2019 /PRNewswire/ --

The "Amphibious Ship Market: By Technology and By Geography - Forecast 2016-2022" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering.

There are various classes of ships available with navy such as amphibious warships, aircraft carriers, destroyers, littoral warships, support craft and submarines. An amphibious warship is employed to support ground forces in amphibious assaults. An amphibious warships is intended to operate in a short distance warfare which also include shore to shore technique.

Globally, the amphibious warship market has been witnessing a relatively steady growth, which has been primarily attributed to force projection over the sea. Many countries are planning to develop the amphibious warship to protect their sea shores. India is looking forward to scale up its amphibious warfare capabilities with an expected expenditure of approximately $3 Billion.

Market Dynamics:

The global navy ship building and defense is driven by the factors such as national security, territorial integrity and sovereign state. National security is a concept that a government, along with its parliament(s), should protect the state and its citizens against all kind of "national" crises through a variety of power projections, such as political power, diplomacy, economic power, military might, and so on.

Whereas Territorial integrity is the principle under international law that nation-states should not attempt to promote secessionist movements or to promote border changes in other nation-states. Conversely it states that imposition by force of a border change is an act of aggression.

The electrical propulsion system will be one of the major driver in procuring amphibious warships. This will further increase the payload capacity of the ship with endurance reaching around 1000 nautical miles.

Countries are specifically looking to integrate the aviation capabilities into the amphibious ships. This will further increase the cost of construction. In addition, this will reduce the speed of the ships and its capability to operate near shore area.

Scope of the Report:

Based on Technology Type

Others

The current industry trend is to develop new amphibious assault ship that is typically designed to support a blue-water fleet. The stealth features are expected to be integrated in the ship for greater extent.



Report Insights



Recently constructed a fourth YUZHAO-class (Type 071), which is capable of amphibious and logistical operations in the near seas, although it is also equipped to support expeditionary operations and nontraditional security missions, such as counter piracy patrols, around the world

China is expected to begin construction on Type 081-class amphibious assault ship within the next five years. The ship is believed to be of the order of 20,000 tones and may be based on the Type 0781 hull.
