Gurugram: Police in Gurugram have booked three persons for allegedly raping a 19-year-old woman on the pretext of giving her job. The case was filed after the mother of the woman approached the police accusing three men of raping her daughter since December 2018.

The woman is a resident of Kurukshetra district. According to a report in Times of India, the woman's mother informed police that her daughter told her about her ordeal only on May 26.

"My daughter was working in a private company in Sonipat. In December last year, she got in touch with one 40-year-old Sunil Saha who promised her a good job in Gurugram. When she went for the interview, Saha took her in a hotel room near Sikenderpur metro station and raped her. After a few weeks, Saha told her to meet one Naveen Chauhan in Manesar for the job. However, when she went to meet him, she was raped by him too. Again, Chauhan referred her to one Raja Babu but she was again cheated and molested. She kept going to meet the men from Sonipat where she worked, but she got fed up and returned home in April," the ToI report quoted from complaint of the woman's mother.

The police have booked all the three accused on charges of rape and molestation. SHO of Gurugram woman police station Garima said she is verifying the facts and action will be taken accordingly.
