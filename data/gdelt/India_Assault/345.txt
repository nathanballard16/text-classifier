Bharat Bandh: Two-Days Union Strike Hits Normalcy Across Country

As 10 trade unions began their two-day nationwide general strike today, incidents of vandalism were reported from Bengaluru and West Bengal's Asansol. A police officer said that bandh supporters allegedly forced Asansol shopkeepers to shut shops, while some allegedly ransacked South Bengal State Transport Corporation (SBSTC). There were also reports of miscreants hurling stones on a BMTC bus in Bengaluru's Basaveshwaranagar.

The nationwide general strike has disrupted normal life as transport, bank and other services have been affected in several cities. The bandh has been called by 10 trade unions across the country against what they believe are "anti-labour policies of Modi government". Workers from the power, steel, auto, and financial services sector are all set to participate in the 'historic event'.
