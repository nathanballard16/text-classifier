GUWAHATI: Gauhati Commerce College (GCC) has taken education beyond the four walls of classrooms. It has tied up with Assam Power Distribution Company Ltd (APDCL) to supply surplus power from its solar power project commissioned at the campus.

Manik Kalwar, a senior teacher of GCC has successfully implemented the solar power project which has an installed capacity of 200 kilowatt. Surplus power from the college’s solar plant will be transferred to the APDCL during daytime. On other hands, the college will be receiving power from the APDCL at night.

The GCC, established in 1962, is one of the leading commerce colleges in the North East. The college with an enrollment of around 3000 students is one of the few colleges in the city to have executed such a “big solar plant” being backed by the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI). Assam Engineering College is the other one to have a solar plant. Suryam International Private Ltd has set up such plants. Suryam has executed several projects in the city, including BSNL Bhawan, GST Bhawan and NIT in Silchar. It also has installed projects in Jorhat and Agartala.

The SECI is a company of the Union ministry of new and renewable energy. Its objective is to develop and deploy new and renewable energy for supplementing energy requirements of the country. The sudden increase in oil price, uncertainties associated with its supply and adverse impact on the balance of payments position are reasons to promote other sources of energy, including solar energy.

“One of the key benefits of the solar plant will be a sharp fall in our power bill. The amount thus saved could be used in further development of GCC,” Kalwar said.
