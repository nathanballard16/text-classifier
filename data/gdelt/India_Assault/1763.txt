CISF constable ends life

Was on guard duty at activist Teesta Setalvad’s residence

A Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) constable posted on guard duty at activist Teesta Setalvad’s Santacruz residence killed himself while on duty on Saturday morning.

According to the Santacruz police, constable Bhanwarsingh Nayak (42) committed suicide using his service weapon, an AK-47 assault rifle, around 10.30 a.m. “Nayak was part of a two-man detail guarding Ms. Seetalvad’s house. One guard was posted at the front entrance of the house, while Nayak was at the back,” senior police inspector Shriram Koregaonkar said.

Nayak’s colleague, with the help of some others, rushed him to Cooper Hospital in Vile Parle, where he was declared dead before admission. The Santacruz police were subsequently informed and a team was sent to conduct inquiries.

The police said the reason for Nayak’s extreme step is not yet clear. “No suicide note was found on Nayak, and his colleagues do not recall seeing him depressed or stressed. We spoke to his superiors at work and they told us that he had just come back from leave,” Mr. Koregaonkar said.

According to inquiries so far, Nayak was a Delhi native and was posted there before being transferred to Mumbai. He had gone on leave to spend time with his family following his transfer, after which he reported to duty on Friday and was posted at Ms. Seetalvad’s residence.

The police are examining Nayak’s call record and messages for clues. Inquiries will also be made with his family members once they reach Mumbai to claim his body. The police have for the moment registered an accidental death report in connection with the incident. Mr. Koregaonkar said circumstantial evidence does not point to foul play.

Ms. Seetalvad could not be reached for comment.
