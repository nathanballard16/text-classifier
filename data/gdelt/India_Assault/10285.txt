After Monday's arrest of the woman who accused actor Karan Oberoi of rape for staging an assault on herself, several citizens spoke of the need for gender-neutral laws on social media Gargi Kalita wrote, "Because of such women, actual victims don't get justice. It is high time that strict laws are made to punish the ones who misuse the law." Amitava Bhattacharyya asked, "Who will compensate for all the harassment the guy went through? These kind of lopsided laws need to be revoked immediately." Another citizen, Puneet Malhotra, wrote "if rape creates fear among society, then false charges also create fear in society".Actress Pooja Bedi stated on Twitter , " Mumbai police in such a hurry to arrest Karan Oberoi, strongly oppose his bail and confiscate his phone. Her phone not taken. High court judge asks why no arrest for woman and they finally arrest her and rush her for bail without letting Karan's lawyer know?" One RN Mohanty advised Oberoi to file a case against the woman and approach the high court.A section of citizens felt the police were supporting the "false complainant". Documentary filmmaker Deepika Bharadwaj told a TV channel, "Whenever cases like these come to light, women activists say things like it is an isolated incident and we shouldn't talk about it because then women won't come forward (with complaints of abuse)." Sagarika Mishra commented, "She (the woman) should be treated equally. Let her face the same public humiliation." Some others too posted on social media that the woman be named as she was now accused of orchestrating an attack on herself. Vishal Kulkarni said, "Now the lady who has accused Karan is a criminal and is accused. Reveal her identity."However, Section 228-A of the IPC relating to disclosure of identity of victims of certain offences prohibits the printing or publishing of the name of a rape victim. If the name is revealed, the punishment is a maximum of two years' imprisonment and fine. Section 228-A (2) states that the name of the woman in such cases could be printed only by a written order of a police officer in good faith for investigation or with written authorization of the victim; if the victim is dead or minor or of unsound mind, the authorisation of next of kin is necessary; such authorisation by kin can only be given to the chief of a recognised social welfare institution.
