Newborn rushed to hospital after being found buried alive in northern India

A newborn baby has been rushed to hospital after she was found buried alive in northern India.

The little girl was discovered by a villager who was digging a grave for his own baby who had died minutes earlier.

The man contacted the police, who transported the newborn to hospital, where she is recovering, according to the BBC.

Police have launched an investigation into the incident and are appealing for information to locate her parents.

Abhinandan Singh, police chief in the state of Uttar Pradesh said: "The police took the baby to the city hospital where she is getting treatment.

"We are trying to find the parents of the baby and we suspect that this must have happened with their consent."

India's gender ratio is one of the worst in the world.

Women are often discriminated against socially and girls are seen as a financial burden, particularly among poor communities.

Campaigners say a traditional preference for sons has meant millions of female children lost to foeticide and infanticide over the years.
