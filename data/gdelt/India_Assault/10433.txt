The spate of incidents of rape of minors in Uttar Pradesh doesn’t seem to stop any time soon. Child abuse is on rise and severe punishment plays no deterrent for perpetrators.

In yet another case reported from Yogi Adityanath-ruled Uttar Pradesh, an 11-year-old girl was raped and murdered in Unnao district. The incident took place on June 21.

The girl was sleeping outside her house and when her father woke up in the middle of the night looking for her, she was found missing.

"Initially, I thought that she might have gone to nearby fields to go to the toilet. However, when she did not return for long, I along with my family and neighbours launched a search and found my daughter's body lying in an orchard. Her head was badly crushed with bricks," he told IANS.
