J&K: Forces eliminate three terrorists, jawan martyred; hostage freed

Three terrorists, including a top Hizbul commander, were gunned down after they took a civilian hostage in Jammu and Kashmir's Ramban district, the police said on Saturday. The person was freed after an encounter that went for nearly nine hours during which a soldier was martyred. The soldier was identified as Naik Rajendra Singh from Jaisalmer.



"Three terrorists have been killed. The hostage has been rescued. Two police officials sustained bullet injuries and an Army personnel died. Operation is over now. They are the same terrorists who were seen in the morning," said Jammu Inspector General of Police Mukesh Singh. Two jawans were also injured in the exchange.



The encounter started in the morning after three terrorists tried to stop a civilian vehicle at Batote on National Highway 244. However, the driver sped away and informed the Army Quick Reaction Team. The terrorists then barged into the house of a cable operator where they took an elderly man hostage.



The Indian Army condoled the death of Naik Rajendra Singh. "#LtGenRanbirSingh, #ArmyCdrNC and all ranks salute the supreme sacrifice of Naik Rajendra Singh and offer deepest condolences to the family," Northern Command of the Army tweeted. Security agencies have said that Pakistan is trying to push terrorists through the LoC to launch attacks in India.
