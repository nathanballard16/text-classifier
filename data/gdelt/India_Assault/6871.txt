LS poll: 2002 Guj riots victim Bilkis Bano votes in Dahod

Bilkis Bano, a 2002 Gujarat riots victim, Tuesday cast her vote at a polling booth in Devgadh Baria in the state's Dahod district.

Earlier in the day, the Supreme Court directed the Gujarat government to give Rs 50 lakh compensation, a job and accommodation to Bano who was gang-raped during the 2002 riots.

She arrived at the polling booth in Kapri primary school accompanied by her husband and relatives.

"Whatever the Supreme Court has given is very good. We had earlier rejected the Rs 5 lakh compensation of the state government. We are happy with the court's order," her husband Yakoob Patel said.

Seven family members of Bano, who was five-month pregnant at the time, were killed and she was gang-raped in a mob attack on March 2, 2002 at Randhikpur village near Ahmedabad during the post-Godhra riots.

A total 18 men were convicted in the case by the Bombay High Court.

The case was first heard by a court in Ahmedabad but was later transferred to Mumbai in August 2004.

Union minister of state for tribal affairs Jaswantsinh Bhabbor is pitted against Congress candidate Babubhai Katara for the Dahod Lok Sabha seat.
