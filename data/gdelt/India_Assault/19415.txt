Bohra girls learn to defend self in wake of Vadodara rape

Over 100 students attended the first session in the madrassa

VADODARA: A 'shy girl' would have been perhaps the apt description for eight-year-old Zainab, who is often seen clinging on to the safety of her parents at the slightest hint of strangers.

But that's a past now. A 90-minute session on self-defence at her school changed her perspective towards her timidity. In the wake of the horrific gangrape of a 14-year-old girl in the heart of the city recently, the authorities at Alavi Bohra Madarsa on Ajwa Road decided to teach their students invaluable tips on how to stay safe. Zulkarnain Bhaisaheb, a community leader who works with the madrassa organized the session. Self-defence expert Mihir Desai was roped in to train the children, especially the girl students, on the art of self-defence and how to break free from strangleholds if caught from behind or attacked upfront.

And Zainab wasn't alone. Nearly 100 other girls from the Alavi Bohra community too learned how to deal with anybody who dared to misbehave with little girls like her.

The training proved to be real confidence booster, said Bhaisaheb, while explaining to TOI why the school wanted to add a new dimension to their teaching.

"We have been teaching our children religious scriptures and language only. Time now demands us to train them, especially girl students, the art of self-defence too," Zulkarnain Bhaisaheb said.
