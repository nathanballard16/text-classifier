According to forest officers, the wild boar could have been poisoned by traps on nearby farms. It is suspected that by eating the poisoned boar, the two tigers accidentally caused their own deaths. There were no injuries on the tigers suggesting fights or external injuries.

Tigers are an endangered species, with 70% of them located in India. In 2016 about 3,890 wild tigers were reported to be in the country.
