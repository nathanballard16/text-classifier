Pradeep Maharathy gets bail in EC squad attack case

BHUBANESWAR: Pradeep Maharathy , a former minister and BJD’s candidate for the Pipili assembly constituency, who was arrested in connection with the attack on Election Commission officials in Puri on April 22, was granted conditional bail by a special court designated to deal with poll matters here on Saturday.Maharathy’s lawyer Arup Chanda said, “The special court granted bail to the BJD leader on three conditions. He shall appear before the investigating officers as and when required. He shall refrain from tampering with evidence and not terrorize the witnesses of the case. The violation of these conditions will lead to cancellation of bail.”Chanda added that Maharathy had been charged with serious offences, including Section 307 (attempt to murder), Section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharging his duty), Section 147 (rioting) and Section 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon) of the IPC.Police had on Monday arrested Maharathy for allegedly assaulting Rabinarayan Patra, the magistrate of the flying squad of the Election Commission, and others at his farmhouse in the Pipili area of Puri district on Sunday night. Patra had alleged that the MLA candidate and his supporters had brutally assaulted him.Though Maharathy had applied for bail at the additional district and sessions court here on Monday citing illness, the judge had sent him to judicial custody at Jharpada special jail. He failed to cast his vote on Tuesday.Maharathy, who was admitted to Capital Hospital here for treatment, has denied his involvement in the attack on the poll officials.According to the affidavit he had submitted during the filing of nomination papers, he has five criminal cases pending against him. He was forced to resign from the ministry four months ago following his controversial remarks in favour of two brothers acquitted by a court in connection with the 2011-12 rape and murder of a 19-year-old girl in Pipili. The MLA had hailed the acquittal.
