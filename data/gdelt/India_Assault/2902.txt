Following the assault, the vendors so concerned about their safety, deboarded the train at Nangloi railway station and left their bags containing goods.

A case has been registed by the Delhi railway police and efforts are being made to identify and nab the attackers.

Brinda Karat, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader assisted the injured Kashmiris in approaching police and filing an FIR, said,

“They said you are the people who killed our men and started beating them. About 15 more passengers joined the two men in assaulting them and also started hurling abuses,” she was quoted as saying by HT.

Cases of assaults on Kashmiri Muslims in various parts of the country are on the rise following the Pulwama terror attack that claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel.
