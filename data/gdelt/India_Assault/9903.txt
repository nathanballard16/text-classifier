Chennai: Barely a week after a dispute over drinking water led to a stabbing spree in the state capital of Jharkhand, yet another violent crime over access to water. This time, from Shankar Nagar area in Tamil Nadu's state capital of Chennai. The incident took place on Thursday night when a 28-year-old woman was stabbed by one of her neighbours after the latter engaged in an argument with her husband.

The victim, Subhashini was stabbed on the ground floor of her two-storey apartment building on Ilango Street in Shankar Nagar around 10.25 pm Thursday night. The argument which led to the attack occurred when the victim's neighbour Adimoola Ramakrishnan and her husband got into a fight over switching on the motor.

In her statement to the police, the woman alleged that she heard her husband and neighbour fighting. "I went down and asked them to switch on the motor," she added. However, the neighbour did not entertain her request and instead continued arguing with her husband. Ramakrishnan then ran to his apartment on the second floor of the building and returned with a knife. He then stabbed Subhashini and pushed her husband down.

The commotion alerted other residents of the building who came to the couple's rescue. Currently undergoing treatment at a local hospital, the victim told media persons that residents of her building have been paying Rs 3000 every week to book a water tanker. This has been going on for over the last month due to an acute shortage of water in the region, said Subhashini.

A case was then registered at the Shankar Nagar police station in this regard resulting in Ramakrishnan's arrest. A report by New Indian Express suggests that the accused works as a driver for P Dhanapal, the speaker of the Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly.
