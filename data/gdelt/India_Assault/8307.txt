Gang-rape in Alwar: RaGa meets victim, assures action

The victim was raped by five men in front of her husband last month



JAIPUR Congress president Rahul Gandhi Thursday met a Dalit woman who was allegedly gang-raped in front of her husband in Rajasthan’s Alwar district, p arty sources said.



Gandhi was accompanied by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, deputy CM Sachin Pilot and Congress national general secretary Avinash Pandey, they said. “This is not a political issue for me but an emotional issue,” Gandhi said.



He said that a message should go across the country, not just in Rajasthan, that “this will not be tolerated”.



Responding to a question about his conversation with the victim’s family, Gandhi said, “They spoke about justice. They will get justice and action will be taken against the people involved in the crime.” On charges levelled by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that state government was negligent in the case, he said, “I am not here to do politics over the issue but to meet the family.



The family will get ‘Nyay’ (justice).” He was earlier scheduled to arrive here Wednesday.



On April 26, six miscreants accosted the woman and her husband on the Thanagazi-Alwar bypass and took them to an isolated place, where they allegedly raped her in front of him. An FIR was lodged on May 2.
