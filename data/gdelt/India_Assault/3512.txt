Ajay Kumar was one of the 40 CRPF jawans who was martyred in J&K on February 14 after a JeM suicide bomber attacked a CRPF bus in the Pulwama district.

"Pakistan has killed so many sons; Pakistan is not that big that India cannot destroy it. India can destroy it in one day. I am proud of my son, he sacrificed his life for the country," sepoy Ajay Kumar’s mother was quoted by PTI.

Last week, four more jawans, including a major rank office, died in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). In the 12-hour long operation, (JeM) commander Abdul Rasheed Ghazi alias Kamran was gunned down.
