Jaipur, Sept 05

In a condemnable act by goons, a youth from Kashmir’s Baramulla, studying in School of Aeronautics, was allegedly forced to wear a girl dress and beaten up by unidentified persons in Alwar’s Neemrana town on Wednesday night.

“Meer Faid (21), a seventh semester student of aeronautics college, was sent for medical examination. He received injuries in his limbs and upper body,” investigating officer Laxman Singh told on Thursday.

Wearing a T-shirt and shorts, Meer had come to withdraw cash from an ATM outside the campus. As the ATM was not working, he moved towards a market where three-four local boys allegedly caught him and forced him to wear a Maxi dress.

On finding it strange a man wearing a woman’s outfit, a crowd chased and manhandled him after tying him with a pole. The police rescued him and also interrogated him. “There was a rumour that the Kashmiri boy came out wearing a woman outfit but it was a wrong perception,” the IO said.

A case under Sections 143, 323, 341, 342 and 505 of the IPC for unlawful assembly of people, and assaulting a person was registered against the unknown accused, he said.

The boy was sent back to his private resident where he is living with other students.
