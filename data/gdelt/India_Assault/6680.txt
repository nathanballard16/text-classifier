Delhi Crime: Will there be a second season?

Delhi Crime, a Netflix series based on the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, will return for a second season, the series creator confirmed.

“There is going to be a next season. Same characters, different crime,” Creator Richie Mehta told Indian Express.

There are reports that the next season will focus on a different crime story, but its plot hasn’t been revealed yet.

Actor Shefali Shah, who played the lead role in season one, will play the same role of DCP Vartika Chaturvedi in the next season.

Sacred Games, another Indian series, will return to Netflix with season two this year.
