From Delhi to Lucknow, protests broke out in multiple cities across India against the newly amended citizenship law on Thursday. Delhi witnessed an unprecedented situation as mobile voice, messaging and internet services across networks were suspended. In Bengaluru, several Left leaders were detained along with historian Ramchandra Guha for defying prohibitory orders. Protests turned violent in Lucknow as the agitators set a police station on fire along with several other vehicles. Section 144 was imposed in several cities across the country. The law has been amended to enable grant of speedier citizenship to non-Muslim refugees from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan if they had to leave their respective countries due to religious persecution. Despite raging protests, the ruling BJP and the government maintained there won't be any rethink on implementation of the new law.
