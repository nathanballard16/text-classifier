Earlier this morning, Rahul and Priyanka along with mother Sonia Gandhi offered respects to the former Prime Minister at his memorial, Veer Bhumi, in Delhi. Former President Pranab Mukherjee and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh also joined them.

Rajiv Gandhi became the youngest prime minister of the country when he was sworn in at the age of 40 as the sixth Prime Minister of India after his mother's assassination in 1984. He was busy campaigning for the Congress for the national elections as party president when he was assassinated in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, in May, 1991. His death anniversary is also observed as Anti-Terrorism day.
