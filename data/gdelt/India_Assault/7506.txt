Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal slapped during roadshow in New Delhi

In a major security breach, Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) convenor Arvind Kejriwal was attacked during his roadshow in New Delhi’s Moti Nagar area on Saturday.

The incident took place when Arvind Kejriwal was holding a roadshow in favour of his party’s candidate Brijesh Goyal who is contesting from the New Delhi seat.

In the video, a man wearing a red shirt can be seen climbing atop the open jeep and slapping Kejriwal across the face before he is pulled off the jeep.

The assailant, identified as Suresh, 33, who has a spare-parts business in Kailash Park, was immediately apprehended by the AAP workers around the jeep and handed to the police. He has been taken to the Moti Nagar police station.

Here’s the video:

This is not the first time that the Delhi CM has been attacked.

In November 2018, a man had thrown chilli powder on him outside his office in the Delhi secretariat.

In 2016, a man had thrown a shoe at Arvind Kejriwal when he was giving the details of the phase 2 of the odd-even scheme. Around the same time, a woman had also thrown ink on him at a “thanksgiving” gathering at Chhatrasal Stadium.

In 2014, an autorickshaw driver had slapped Kejriwal while he was campaigning for the Delhi assembly elections in Sultapuri in northwest Delhi. Kejriwal had suffered a black eye at that time.

Earlier, he has had engine oil and eggs also hurled at him.
