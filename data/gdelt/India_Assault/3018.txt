Coimbatore: A bull dance event in Tamil Nadu went out of hand after scores of angry locals pelted stones at police officials in the Mathakondapalli village near Denkanikottai in Krishnagiri district on Wednesday. Law enforcement personnel had to resort to lathi charge to control the unruly crowd.

The altercation began when police officials attempted to stop the bull dance, reported Times of India. Villagers had approached the district administration to conduct a bull dance at the Sri Prassana Lakshmi Venkateswara temple in Mathakondapalli as part of a car festival. While they were denied the permission for the event that was to be held on February 20, festival committee members managed to get approval for the same from local police.

On the day of the festival, scores of locals from Denkanikottai and Hosur thronged to Mathakondapalli village to witness the bull dance. Over a hundred decorated bulls were released during the event prompting local police officials to request the organisers to halt the event.

However, a group of youngsters began pelting stones at police vehicles and fire tenders present at the spot. As a result, six policemen and two firemen sustained injuries. This compelled local law enforcement personnel to resort to a lathi charge to control the crowd. Later in the day, over a hundred personnel were deployed in the village to avoid any untoward incidents. Going by reports, as many as 26 locals were detained and questioned by the police in connection with the stone pelting incident.
