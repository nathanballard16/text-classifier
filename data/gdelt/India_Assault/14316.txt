2 Chinese-Origin People Killed In Kolkata, Faces Smashed With Iron Bucket

The police said that the house door was bolted from inside.

A Kolkata man of Chinese-origin was arrested this morning in double murder of his 60-year-old wife and his octogenarian father. The two were brutally attacked on Friday at their home in Tangra, also known as Kolkata's Chinatown.

After a night-long probe, Li Wan Sang, the accused, confessed he murdered two of his family members as his marriage had turned sour, said police.

An iron bucket - found at the home - may have been used to smash the faces of the woman, Li-Hou-Meihha, and her father-in-law, Li- Ka-Song, according to the initial probe.

An emergency call was received by the police around 9.15 pm on Friday. The two were rushed to a nearby hospital, but the woman was declared brought dead. Her father-in-law, who was in a critical condition, died during treatment, police said. The homicide department of the Kolkata Police headquarters at Lalbazar also reached the spot to assist officers from the local Tangra police station.

The police said that the house door - a 10-foot-high red iron gate typical of homes in Tangra --was bolted from inside. Everything inside the house seemed intact.

CCTV footage showed the husband of the woman, Li Wan Sang, leaving the house at 7.11 pm; he returned at 8.20 pm. "When he came, he found house was latched from inside," the police said.

According to eyewitnesses, Li Wan Sang then climbed over the high wall around the house and found his wife and father lying in pool of blood in the courtyard. He immediately raised alarm.

The couple have two daughters and one son.

The father-in-law, Li Kasong, was a "much-respected record keeper and almanac reader of the local community", residents said. His son assisted him in the job. The daughter-in-law was Li Han Meihha, a housewife.

The home is located opposite an upmarket residential highrise.
