A neonatal was abducted from BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences in Dharan, Sunsari, last night.

According to Dharan Area Police Office DSP Dhundiraj Neupane, two women had stolen a 13-day-old child from the institute taking advantage of the lax security at the institute. “We rescued the child within three hours after the abduction and have arrested the two women involved in kidnapping the baby,” said the DSP.

The abducted baby has been identified as the son of Babita Mehata of Bhokraha Narsing, Sunsari.

The child had been abducted from the bed at midnight from the Gynaecology Ward while the mother and the one other attending the mother and the child were fast asleep.

The mother, who didn’t see the baby when she woke up, had then informed doctors at the institution, who reported to the police. Police rescued the baby from Bagarkot of Dharan-15.

Police have identified the women involved in the abduction as Lila BK, 27, of New Delhi, India, and her sister-in-law Mina Limbu (BK) of Dharan. Police have said the duo was preparing to take the baby to New Delhi.

Meanwhile, the child’s father Dip Narayan thanked the police for finding his son and asked the institute to make security at the hospital more effective.
