Pakistan ISI plotting big strikes outside Valley

New Delhi: The Intelligence Bureau (IB) has alerted Delhi police against potential terror attacks in the National Capital Region (NCR) post revocation of Article 370 in J&K.

Its top secret reports say, "With Jaish-e-Mohammedd (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) exposed at international platforms, Al-umar-Mujahideen (AuM) is the new poster boy of ISI (Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence) and is capable of carrying major terror strikes outside the Valley".

The Pakistan-based terror outfit, AuM, is led by dreaded Kashmiri terrorist Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar alias Mushtaq Latram, whose module executed terror strike in Anantnag, near Srinagar on June 12 last, killing five CRPF jawans.

"Zargar has recruited Kashmiri cadres from Jammu and Kashmir as well from Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).

Post revocation of Article 370, the ISI's intention is to use Zargar's cadres to carry out terror strikes in and out of Jammu and Kashmir," says the IB report.
