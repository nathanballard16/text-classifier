Pollachi sex abuse case: Student fury in Tamil Nadu as thousands hit streets

Students protesting in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, where a sex abuse scandal that came to light recently has sparked outrage.

College students skipped classes and protested a gang's alleged sexual crimes on Wednesday in several places in Tamil Nadu.

In Pollachi, where the case came to light, students demanded a fair investigation and clashed with police trying to disperse or detain them.

Woman students were manhandled by the police.

A local TV channel said "thousands" of students from colleges around Pollachi had converged before a local government office.

It was a young college student who complained to the police last month that she had suffered sexual assault near Pollachi at the hands of four men -- Thirunavakkarasu, Sathish, Sabariraj and Vasanthkumar.

They have been arrested.

Police officials have told India Today TV that the gang sexually harassed over 50 women for over two years, befriending them on social media and then subjecting them to abuse in moving vehicles, hotels or farmhouses.

The case acquired a political colour when a local functionary from the ruling AIADMK allegedly attacked the brother of the victim, outraging opposition parties.

He was expelled.

The four suspects have been booked under sections of the Indian Penal Code and two other laws -- the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Harassment of Women Act and the Goondas Act.

The case has been transferred to the Crime Branch CID.

Although the Tamil Nadu government has recommended that the CBI take over, activists, students and political parties want a judicial probe.

In a letter to Tamil Nadu's director general of police, the National Commission for Women has called for "appropriate action" and asked for a report.
