Indian Ruling Party Leader and Ex-Minister Arrested in Student Rape Case

A 23-year-old law student from Uttar Pradesh’s Shahjahanpur, around 200 kilometres from the state capital Lucknow, has accused the politician of kidnapping and rape for more than a year. The girl is studying at a college managed by the former minister.

Opposition leaders and civil society members have been accusing the ruling party of protecting the strongman as he wasn't even charged with rape for almost a month after the woman filed a police complaint.

A video purportedly showing the BJP leader getting a massage from the law student also surfaced last week. The girl claimed that she was allegedly brought to his room at gunpoint but recorded the video of massage using a spycam.
