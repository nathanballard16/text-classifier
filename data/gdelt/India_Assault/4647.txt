‘A crime that shocked the nation’, the fateful night on December 16, 2012, Netflix just released the trailer of the seven-part anthology series, Delhi Crime based on Nirbhaya rape case and it is a powerful performance one is forced to revisit. The series is reportedly based on the crime files of the Delhi police and stars Shefali Shah, Rasika Dugal, Rajesh Tailang, Adil Hussain, Gopal Datt, and Vinod Sherawat in important roles.

A fictionalised depiction, Netflix says it will “capture the complexities of the scrutiny, the emotional toll on the investigating team, and their determination to bring the perpetrators to justice in a fraught environment.”

The Delhi Crime trailer opens with a patrolling unit of the Delhi Police finding the victims on the side of a road, before we are introduced to our protagonist DCP South Delhi, Varthika Chaturvedi (Shah) and her powerful line, “This crime is not just heinous, it is insanity’’. The trailer makes us revisit the horrendous memories of the crime, one would like to erase from the fateful cold December night in Munirka.

The 2: 14-minute trailer also shows Nirbhaya as she is being carried to a hospital and requesting the cops to not tell her father about the incident before her coma and eventually her death from the unspeakable injuries for more than two weeks after her attack on December 29.
