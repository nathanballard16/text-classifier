Lucknow: Shocking allegations have come to light against staffers at the King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Uttar Pradesh's state capital Lucknow. A video showing employees stationed at the hospital's out-patient department (OPD) counter misbehaving with a female cancer patient and assaulting her son is going viral on social media.

Hospital authorities swung into action after eyewitnesses posted a 44-second video of the assault on social media. OPD in-charge Manish Bajpai identified three contractual employees who were placed with the hospital via Loyal Touch Management Service Pvt Ltd. All three were then terminated by the hospital.

In the video, the OPD staffers can be seen ferociously assaulting the patient's son. Despite his attempts to resist the assault, the men continued to thrash him.

Chief Proctor professor RAS Kushwaha told Hindustan Times that the female cancer patient wanted to use the particular toilet which staffers claimed was only for employees' use. The patient could not walk any further and that was the nearest toilet, he added. Professor Kushwaha further added that staff members facing an issue could summon security personnel instead of taking law into their own hands or misbehaving with a patient.

A similar instance had come to light from Kolkata in November of last year when three men were arrested for assaulting a 51-year-old cancer patient and his family members at the New Government Colony in Bansdroni. Reports had asserted that the complainants were assaulted simply because they raised objections over the bursting of firecrackers during an idol immersion ceremony.
