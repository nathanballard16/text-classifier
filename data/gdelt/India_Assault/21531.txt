The Supreme Court intervention comes following a hue and cry over the rise in rape cases in the country.

Key Highlights Supreme Court sets up 2-member judges panel for speedy trial in rape cases Justices R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah will be part of the committee SC decision comes in wake of rising cases of rape and delay in justice

In a significant move, the Supreme Court has set up a two-member judges committee to facilitate speedy trial in all rape cases in the country. Justices R Subhash Reddy and M R Shah will be part of the committee.

It's an important administrative decision taken by Chief Justice of India (CJI) in consultation with other senior judges for speedy trials in rape cases.

The Supreme Court intervention comes following a hue and cry over the rise in rape cases, most prominently Disha rape case in Cyberabad area of Telangana.

A 27-year-old veterinary doctor was raped and killed in Cyberabad on November 27 by four men allegedly truck drivers and cleaners in the Chatanpally area of the city. Later the four accused were killed in a controversial police shootout on December 6.

Human rights activists and other groups had termed the encounter as fake and accused the police of indulging in extra-judicial killings. Following these killings, a number of inquiries were set up including by state government and National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).

Last week, a bench of the Supreme Court led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde ordered a judicial inquiry into the killings of four men accused.

Keeping in view the pendency of rape cases, the Andhra Pradesh government also promulgated a law knows as Disha Act that provided for the completion of trial in 21 days and awarding the death penalty in rape cases.

However, experts have termed the Andhra Pradesh's anti-rape law as impractical and atrocious keeping in view the short span of time for trial and police investigation.
