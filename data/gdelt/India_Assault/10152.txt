Kannur police likely to book woman who filed rape case against Binoy Kodiyeri

The Kannur district police is likely to register a case on a petition by Binoy Kodiyeri, son of Communist Party of India (Marxist) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, against a Mumbai-based woman who has accused him of raping her for years by promising to marry her.

The police here are examining the content of the complaint lodged by Mr. Binoy last month in a petition submitted to the Inspector General of Police (Kannur Range) alleging that the woman was blackmailing him. The petition was then forwarded to the District Police Chief (DCP) for action.

“Let me see the petition first as I have not yet seen it because I was outside,” said Prateesh Kumar, who had taken charge as new DCP here a few days back. When contacted, Mr. Kumar said that the police would naturally take whatever legal action to be taken as per the petition's content. He also said that he was now examining the content of the petition.

According to police sources, the complaint by Mr. Binoy said that the woman had tried to blackmail him earlier as well.

An FIR has been registered in Mumbai’s Oshiwara against Mr. Binoy accusing him of cheated her into a long term conjugal relationship on the promise of marriage. She claimed she had an eight-year-old son from the affair, which commenced when she worked as a danseuse in a bar hotel in Dubai in 2009.
