A case was registered against two Congress workers after they “assaulted” members of the rival faction in Dakha on Saturday. Congress workers Gursewak Singh Gora and Tarandeep Singh, both residents of Baddowal, were booked on the complaint of Zila Parishad member Kuldeep Singh and Baddowal ex-sarpanch Amarjot Singh.

Kuldeep alleged that he and Amarjot were standing outside the office of Congress candidate Capt Sandeep Sandhu when Gursewak and Tarandeep assaulted them.

“They blamed me for interfering in politics at Baddowal village. The duo then started thrashing me badly. When Amrjot tried to save me, Gursewak snatched Amarjot’s mobile phone. Tarandeep also took away my gold chain. When we raised an alarm, party workers gathered on the spot and the duo escaped,” the complainant alleged.

Sudagar Singh, Gursewak’s father, said the police had registered a fake case against his son at the behest of a minister. ASI Hardeep Singh said Gursewak had been arrested while the second accused was still at large.

Notably, SAD candidate Manpreet Ayali also went live on Facebook last night, alleging that a Congress minister had tossed the turban of a Congress worker. The minister, Ashu, had denied the allegations.
