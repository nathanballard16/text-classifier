Mouse tied to bottle and tortured with stick after it was caught chewing phone charger

Sickening footage shows the mouse strapped to a bottle as it is beaten with a stick until it urinates after it chewed up a phone charger.

The man from Mandya in southern India can be heard cursing the little mouse as he wacks it on the nose, head and belly.

The rodent was strung up by its limbs to a plastic water bottle to expose it to the foul punishment.

He shows the severed chord of his charger to the mouse and says: 'Why did you bite this causing me a loss of eighty rupees (one pound). Will your father or mother pay me for the loss now?'

The mouse is strung up by its limbs on a water bottle, reminiscent of a medieval torture rack, as the man from Mandya in southern India strikes it with the stick

As he continues to beat the mouse, he accuses it of eating rice, tomatoes and soap at his home.

In a particularly disturbing segment of the video, the mouse urinates in terror only to get more beatings.

'Why are you p***ing, will you do it again?' he asks.

Indian animal rights activists are outraged after the video emerged earlier this month and have urged officials to trace the man and arrest him for cruelty towards animals.

Noted animal rights activist Subhendu Mallik said: 'While killing a mouse is not illegal, this kind of torture is unwarranted.

'This is a crime under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 and officials should act.'
