Bomb detection, disposal squad seeks advanced equipment

Coimbatore: The city police have sent a proposal to the director general of police (DGP), J K Tripathy , seeking advanced equipment such as bomb disposal suits, explosive vapour detectors and RTVS bomb disposal kit to its bomb detection and disposal squad (BDDS).The BDDS squad was formed in the city police following the serial bomb blasts on February 14, 1998.According to an inside source, the squad, which came into existence on January 24, 2003, has handheld metal detector, door frame metal detector, explosive vapour detector, explosive chemical kit, mine sweeper, non-linear junction detector, search kit, under vehicle search mirror, letter bomb metal detector, search light, X-ray baggage scanner, night vision binocular, bomb blanket and drilling machines, among others, in its kitty. Some of them were provided to the squad as early as in 2003.Pointing out that the wing was in possession of four explosive vapour detectors, the source said only two of them were in working condition today.The wing has one inspector of police, one sub inspector and seven other cops of different ranks. It also comprises 10 ex-army men, who were earlier with the bomb disposal team of the national security guard (NSG).Coimbatore is one of the sensitive cities in the country. While the bomb detection and disposal squad is having enough manpower, they are not having advanced equipment.The source said the proposal was sent the DGP through city police commissioner Sumit Saran a few weeks ago. “People working with the NSG’s bomb disposal squad wear bomb disposal suits, while at work. But we don’t have even a single bomb disposal suit.”The squad has an X-ray baggage scanner, which is used whenever a VVIP or a VIP visits the state. The scanner weighs more than 400kg and a separate vehicle is used to transport the same. “So, the squad has sought a portable baggage scanner,” the source said.As of now, Greater Chennai police and Coimbatore, Salem, Madurai, Trichy and Tirunelveli city police have BDDS squads. Tamil Nadu Commando School (TNCS) is also having a BDDS squad in Chennai.
