A heavy stone was tied to the body, suggesting it to be a case of murder, said police.The deceased was identified as Prince Pravin Nakia, a resident of Wankaner town.According to Wankaner taluka police, Pravin had lodged a complaint on August 27 alleging that his son Prince, who had gone to a religious function in Thikariyada village with his grandfather, had gone missing. On examining CCTV footage from near the event venue, police found a car moving in suspicious manner. Based on eye witness accounts police suspect that two people had abducted Prince in the car.Separate teams had been searching for the missing boy since August 27. Police also scrutinized CCTV footage from toll booths on Morbi-Ahmedabad and Morbi-Rajkot highways, but could not find a substantial lead.On Saturday, police was informed about a body of a boy inside a well in Thikariyada village from where Prince had gone missing.Talking to TOI, Wankaner circle police inspector V D Bhrambhatt said, “There are no injury marks on the boy’s body so it’s difficult to say if he was thrown into the well after he was murdered or before he was killed. Since the body had decomposed it was difficult to know the immediate cause of death. Only postmortem could reveal the cause of death.”He added, “Even the boy’s family did not get any ransom call. So we believe that the crime was committed over personal animosity. But it is difficult to talk about the motive of murder.”Prince’s family are engaged in agricultural activity.
