[Rape]Allahabad HC Rejects Bail Plea Of BSP MP Atul Rai [Read Order]

In a major setback for BSP MP Atul Rai, the Allahabad High Court on Friday rejected his bail plea in connection to a case of sexual exploitation and rape.



The high court said that keeping in mind the principle of fair and speedy trial, Rai should not be granted bail and the Trial Court should be allowed to frame charges against him. The order was passed by Justice Ramesh Sinha.

Rai was accused of raping a college student from Varanasi earlier this year. As per the FIR lodged against him on May 1, he took the student to his home on the pretext of meeting his wife but sexually assaulted her.

As per the prosecution, Rai has tried to linger on the trial by not appearing before the trial court and avoiding framing of charges. The prosecution also pleaded the high court that his criminal antecedents should also be treated as guiding factor in determining his bail plea. Reliance was placed on Neeru Yadav v. State of U.P. & Anr., (2014) 16 SCC 508.

Allegedly, as many as 32 criminal cases for different offences are pending against him.

Denying the allegations, Rai said that the present case had been lodged under political influence. He demonstrated that the allegations imputed against him were leveled proximate to the time when he filed his nomination for Parliamentary elections. He had also submitted that the allegations were not corroborated with the prosecutrix's medical examination report.

Further asking the court to not take into account criminal cases pending against him, he said that the law was settled in terms of Maulana Mohammad Amir Rashadi v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Anr., (2012) 2 SCC 382, that criminal antecedent cannot be the sole ground for rejecting the bail application of an accused
