Cong demands Amit Shah's apology for attack on advocates

New Delhi, Nov 2 : The Congress on Saturday criticised Delhi Police for their action against advocates in the Tis Hazari court complex in the national capital and demanded an apology from Home Minister Amit Shah over the incident as the force comes directly under his ministry.

Speaking to reporters, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said that his party stood in solidarity with the advocates.

A clash broke out between the lawyers and the Delhi Police in Tis Hazari court complex on Saturday, resulting in arson which left one lawyer injured with a bullet injury.

The clash erupted after a minor argument between a lawyer and some policemen over parking.
