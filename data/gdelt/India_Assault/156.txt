Civilian-Military Tensions Brew in India's Insurgency-Hit Arunachal Pradesh

Tahjam Wangsu is one of the several people who attended a recent village-level security meet at the Indian Army camp in the Longding district. Longding is one of the three districts of Arunachal Pradesh, which has long been designated a "disturbed area" by the Indian government. Besides Longding, Tirap and Changlang are currently governed by the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), which empowers the army and central paramilitary forces to kill anyone acting in contravention of the law.

Moreover, the act grants government forces the power to arrest and search any premises without a warrant.

The Wancho tribe is culturally related to the Naga tribe, therefore, Naga militants often seek refuge in the homes of Wanchos who say they have very little choice.

"I am not saying that militants of NSCN (IM) are not taking shelter in the areas but what can the villagers do in front of gun-toting militants? They (militants) come to us and force us to provide them with meal and shelter. We had even asked the army to deploy personnel for our security but they did not. They (army) are only concerned about their lives and not of the villagers," Tahjam Wangsu added

On the other hand, the Indian Army claims that the safety of the civilians has always been their first priority.

"It is a fact that most of the time we do not retaliate against militants to avoid undue casualties. But we cannot tolerate if the people take undue advantage," Commanding Officer of Indian Army's 19 Sikh Regiment M Karmaker said during one of the village-level security meetings.
