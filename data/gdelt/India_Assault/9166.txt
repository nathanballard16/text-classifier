New Delhi: Shiv Sena leader Priyanka Chaturvedi on Monday adviced Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to set his "priorities right" over the latter's new proposal of free metro and bus rides for women commuters, in his bid to make public transport safer for them.

Chaturvedi cited the infamous Nirbhya gang rape case of 2012 to remind the Chief Minister that the incident happened on the bus, while asserting that the need of the hour is to make public transport safer rather than making it free for women.

"Hate to remind this, but Nirbhaya was gang-raped in a bus in Delhi. At that time the country didn’t protest over free rides for the women but for making the capital safe for its women to be able to take a bus or metro at any time of the day. Get your priorities right," Chaturvedi tweeted.

Earlier in the day, Arvind Kejriwal announced free rides for women in Delhi saying contending that women have safe travel experience in metro and DTC buses.

On all DTC buses, cluster buses and metro trains women will be allowed to travel free of cost so that they have safe travel experience and can access modes of transport which they were not able to, due to high prices," Kejriwal said.

Chaturvedi tried to counter the safety claim of the CM citing the gruesome Nirbhaya rape case which happened on a moving bus.

Many leaders have dubbed Kejriwal's proposal as a poll gimmick contending that it was result of the party suffering a massive drubbing in the recently held Lok Sabha elections.
