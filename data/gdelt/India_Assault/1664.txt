The event was attended by a large gathering of guests including British Parliamentarians, members of Cross-party Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate of Pakistan, Local government Mayors and Councillors, representatives from civil society organizations, students, Kashmiris and members of the British Pakistani Diaspora.

A part of display of Indian atrocities pertained to genocide and dozens of massacres carried out by the Indian occupation forces.

A number of Kashmiri artifacts were also on display along with pictures depicting the heavenly landscape and pristine beauty of Jammu & Kashmir. They stood in sharp contrast to the present-day situation where violence continues to inflict suffering upon the people of IOK through use of draconian laws and Indian state sponsored terrorism in complete disregard and violation of the UN and other International Conventions on human rights.

On the occasion, a number of documentaries and slide shows pertaining to the people of Jammu and Kashmir’s endless sufferings were also shown to the jam packed venue.

He assured that the Government and the people of Pakistan remain steadfast in their moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris.
