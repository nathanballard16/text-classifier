Newcastle's Lascelles out until New Year with knee injury

(Reuters) – Newcastle United captain and defensive lynchpin Jamaal Lascelles has been ruled out until the New Year after picking up a knee injury in last Saturday’s 2-1 victory over Bournemouth, the Premier League club said on Thursday.

The 26-year-old centre back, who has started all 12 league games for the club this season scoring one goal, was injured in a clash with Bournemouth striker Callum Wilson and replaced by Paul Dummett in the first half.

Newcastle, who are 13th in the table with 15 points, will hope defenders Fabian Schar and Florian Lejeune will return from their own knee injuries in time for the league game with Aston Villa on Nov. 25.
