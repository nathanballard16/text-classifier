HC confirms life sentence for man who killed his sister-in-law

MADURAI: The Madurai bench of the Madras high court has confirmed the life sentence accorded to a man, who hacked his sister-in-law to death. The accused, Sekar of a village in Pudukottai district was sentenced to life in 2008 by a trial court ther, for the murder of his sister-in-law.Sekar’s elder brother, Panayan had sent one of his brother, Chinnaiyan to work in Singapore. Similarly, with great difficulty he sent Sekar too to Singapore after borrowing money from people in the village.It is reported that Sekar did not go to work properly in Singapore and returned back to the village to live off his elder brother’s money. This was resented by his sister-in-law and caused fissures in the family as lenders knocked on Panayan's doors seeking to return the money. After few arguments between his brother and wife, Panayan housed Sekar in a separate hut nearby.Meanwhile, on January 30, 2008, when the woman was grazing cattle, Sekar hacked her to death, which was witnessed by a farmer in the adjacent land. Namanasamudram police booked a case of murder and arrested the accused a day later. The trial court convicted the appellant and sentenced him to imprisonment for life.In the appeal petition, the accused contended that except for the solitary eye witness, there is no other eye witness in this case and also pointed out a lapse in the investigation. A division bench of Justice P N Prakash and B Pugalendhi after going through the appeal said, “It is trite that the quantity of evidence is not the criteria, but quality.”The court noted that the sole eyewitness, being a farmer, would have been harvesting his crop on the date of murder because post mid-January is the harvest season in the state and therefore the presence of the eyewitness cannot be doubted or could be said to be unusual.The bench held that there is no reason to reverse the trial court judgment and confirmed the life sentence.
