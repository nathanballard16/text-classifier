Pauline Hanson slams torching of One Nation truck outside Hobart pub

Hanson later took to Twitter, saying her candidate had in fact been inside the neighbouring grocery store doing his shopping when the fire started.

"Our One Nation truck in Tasmania was parked outside a shop while our candidate was buying groceries," Hanson tweeted on Sunday night.

"Someone was seen torching it before fleeing. It is amazing how the left call for tolerance but act like they’re above the law when you don’t agree with their ideologies."

The incident came less than 24 hours after the federal election saw support for One Nation surge across the country.

Hanson again blamed the left for the incident on her 'Pauline Hanson's Please Explain' Facebook page.

"This is what the left do to conservative parties," she wrote.

"Yesterday, one of our volunteers was bashed and called a 'white dog' because he asked a man to stop wrecking our signs in Cowan. "I’m concerned about where politics is heading in this country." Hanson says she is "concerned about where politics is heading in this country" after a One Nation truck was set alight.

A Tasmania Police spokesperson told SBS News on Monday morning an investigation into the incident was ongoing.

"Tasmania Fire Service and Tasmania Police [attended] a vehicle fire at the Shoreline Hotel in Howrah," the spokesperson said.

"Police are investigating and treating the fire as suspicious."
