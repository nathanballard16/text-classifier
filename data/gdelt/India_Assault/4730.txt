Delhi Crime trailer: New Netflix series on Nirbhaya rape case will remind you of the dark past; Watch

One of the darkest times India faced in the recent past was the horrific Nirbhaya case that came under the spotlight in 2012. Today, Netflix released the trailer of its seven-part anthology series Delhi Crime directed by Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta. The series stars Shefali Shah, Rasika Dugal, Rajesh Tailang, Adil Hussain, Gopal Datt, and Vinod Sherawat in important roles. Set in the capital city of India, Delhi Crime revolves around the Delhi Police's investigation into the rape of a young girl in the heart of the city in December 2012.

Details of the horrific rape case shook citizens of the country to the core and led to nation-wide protests. Nirbhaya, who battled for life and eventually passed away, was brutally tortured, beaten and gang-raped by six men inside a bus. Her friend, too, was assaulted to a great extent.

The trailer delves into the lives of those associated with the case as well as those in power. The trailer opens with a police patrolling unit finding the victims on the side of a road. We are then introduced to our protagonist: DCP South Delhi, Varthika Chaturvedi played by Shefali Shah. The series is based on the case files of the Delhi Police and trailer sure looks gripping.

The seven-part series will explore the whirlwind of emotions as well as touch upon public anger, media's role and politicisation of the case. The first two episodes of series were premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival in the Indie Episodic category. It was then acquired by Netflix and is now slated to release on March 22.
