JRL urges UN Chief for return of mortal remains of Butt, Guru from New Delhi’s Tihar Jail

In occupied Kashmir, the Joint Resistance Leadership has sent a memorandum to the UN Chief for return of mortal remains of Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru from New Delhi’s Tihar Jail to their families.

The JRL comprising Syed Ali Gilani, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq and Muhammad Yasin Malik urged UN General Secretary, Antonio Guterres, seeking his help for the return of mortal remains of prominent liberation leaders.

Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru were executed and buried inside the premises of New Delhi’s Tihar Jail.

On the other hand stranded Kashmiri passengers and students of Gandhi Memorial Science College shouted pro-Pakistan slogans during an anti-India demonstration in Jammu.

The passengers, stranded for the past six days due to closure of Srinagar-Jammu highway, shouted pro-Pakistan and pro-freedom slogans on the occasion.

Several protesting students were injured when Indian police resorted to baton charge against them.

The Chairman of Hurriyat forum, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, in a statement criticised the local administration for failing to provide relief and help to thousands of people stranded on the Srinagar-Jammu highway for the past several days.
