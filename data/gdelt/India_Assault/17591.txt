Brother kills sister’s husband after he refuses to take her back

Bhopal: A furious brother stabbed his brother-in-law to death after he refused to take back his sister home for Diwali.

The incident happened in Bhopal’s Cholla area where Shekhar Lodhi hacked his sister’s husband Rajesh to death along with the help of his associates after he refused to take her back, Indiatoday reports.

According to reports, Rajesh married Shekhar’s sister two years ago after months of courtship and had been staying with Shekar for over the past three months.

“For the past three months, Rajesh’s wife was staying with her brother Shekhar after some dispute between her and her husband. Shekhar had approached his brother-in-law on several occasions in the past and had asked him to patch up with his sister but when he refused to take her home even on Diwali, he stabbed Rajesh in the Cholla market area on Diwali night,” the police said.

Shekhar was accompanied by his two friends Yogesh Ahirwar and Arun Vishwakarma when they cornered Rajesh to murder him.

Despite Rajesh’s friends reaching the spot on time to help him he could not be saved while the killers managed to escape before the police arrived.

Rajesh was rushed to hospital but succumbed to the knife injuries close to his heart.

A case has been registered against Shekhar and his two associates.

The Police are attempting to trace the location of the accused who are still at large.
