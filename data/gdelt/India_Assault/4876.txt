Man sets 18-yr-old college girl on fire for rejecting his ‘proposal’

Kasaragod, May 12: A man set an 18-year-old girl on fire after she rejected his advances at Thiruvalla in Pathanamthitta district of Kerala. The accused poured petrol on her on a street in broad daylight and set her ablaze.

The victim, a student of radiology and a native of Ayiroor, Pathanamthitta, has been hospitalised and the initial reports suggest that she has suffered 75 per cent burns. The accused tried to flee the scene of crime but was caught.

A man, witnesses to the ghastly crime, overpowered the accused, Ajin Reji Mathew, and handed him over to the police. It was told by the witness that Mathew had set the girl on fire after pouring petrol over her.

On being questioned, the accused told the cops that he was provoked after the girl refused his proposal. Enraged by the rejection, he committed the crime. However, police have continued with the questioning of the accused as he had petrol with him at the time she rejected his proposal.

It would hint that it is a case of predetermined murder and a thought out crime rather than a case of murder due to temporary insanity that the accused tried to advocate.
