Delhi woman turns down marriage proposal, man stabs her to death in front of daughter

New Delhi:

A woman was stabbed to death in the national capital by a jilted lover, a police officer said. The accused, identified as Shyam Yadav, was apprehended when he was planning to flee Delhi. Yadav is a native of Pansalwa in Madhubani district of Bihar and further investigation is underway.

"The accused identified as Shyam, works as a constructor in a shoe factory where the deceased also used to work under him. He was apprehended on Thursday morning from West Delhi's Nangloi area, following a tip-off. The weapon used in the crime was also recovered," Additional Commissioner of Police Rajender Singh Sagar told IANS.

As per reports, the woman - mother of five kids - had left the job after sensing Yadav's desperation. However, the accused started following her and used to visit outside her house very often.Â

The incident took place on Wednesday night when Madhuri was walking outside her residence with herÂ younger daughter. "Seeing Madhuri alone, Shyam came to her and stabbed her over half a dozen times following an argument after she refused to elope with him. When her daughter came to rescue Madhuri, Shyam dragged her and escaped," Sagar said.

"Locals informed the police and Madhuri was taken to the hospital where she was later declared dead. During the investigation, it was found that Madhuri was already married and a mother of five children. Shyam used to harass her. He was forcing her to get married to him from the last few days," the officer added.

However, Madhuriâ€™s family members alleged that she had earlier filed a complaint against Shyam after he threatened her with dire consequences if she turned down his marriage proposal.
