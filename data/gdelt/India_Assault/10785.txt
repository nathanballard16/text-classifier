Actor Aditya Pancholi is recently being held by the Mumbai Police for rape. A complaint was registered against him with the Versova police by Kangana Ranaut. She had registered a case against him of rape, wrongful restraint, assault and criminal intimidation under IPC.

Today, Kangana Ranaut's sister Rangoli Chandel took to her Twitter page to accuse Aditya Pancholi of extorting money from the Queen actress. Rangoli shared that Aditya extorted up to Rs 1 crore from her sister. She shared, "Whoever it may concern, complain against Pancholi had been lodged in 2007 for physical abuse harassment and extortion, he has taken more than 1cr from Kangana saying he has fed her for 3 months when she was homeless ( grocery bill of three months)...(contd)".

Her second tweet reads, "(Contd)... but he wanted more money after that, last message of extortion I myslef received from him was in 2016 which has been submitted to cops and now FIR has been lodged, she had absolutely no time for all this...(contd)."

She also shared, "Contd)... but everyday cases from him and his wife needs to be fought as they are finding lot of strength in the fact that Kangana is very busy so I have revived this case on her behalf, so her work isn’t disturbed."
