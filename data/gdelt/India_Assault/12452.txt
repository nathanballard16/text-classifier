MUMBAI, July 27 (Agencies): A 32-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly bludgeoning his father to death in Maharashtra's Yavatmal district, police said on Saturday.

Namdeo Uravate allegedly killed his father Dattu Uravate at Khapri village in Jhari tehsil in the early hours of Friday because the latter was not ready to give him his share in the property.
