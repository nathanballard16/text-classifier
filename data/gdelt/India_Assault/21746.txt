Jamia Violence: “We are confident appropriate enquiries will be made”, SC directs petitioners to approach High Courts

Although the counsel, including Senior Advocate Jaising, urged that the Supreme Court to set up a fact-finding enquiry commission headed by a retired judge to inspire the confidence of the student community, Bobde opined that the same may be done by sitting Chief Justices of the High Courts as well. Senior Advocate Gonsalves also requested that the commission, ideally by a retired judge, be sent to the University today itself, so that the torture and beating of the students would be put to an end.
