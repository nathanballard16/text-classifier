Roorkee Armyman on UN mission found dead in Lebanon

Roorkee: The news of the death of havildar Ramesh Singh Negi (44), resident of Nanda colony in Roorkee, has cast a pall of gloom over his family since Thursday, when the family heard of his demise.

Negi, a havildar in Jat regiment, had left for Lebanon from Delhi on May 4 as part of a UN peace mission. He was reportedly found dead in his room in the Middle Eastern country on Wednesday night. Sources said that his body will reach Roorkee for cremation by next Thursday.

Negi is survived by his wife, two minor children, and parents, who have come to Roorkee from their ancestral home in Chamoli district of Garhwal.

“At about 11pm on Thursday, we got a call from his regiment in Delhi about Ramesh’s untimely demise. The cause of his death is still unclear. We were told he was found dead in his bed on Wednesday night. It seems he suffered a cardiac arrest in his sleep,”said Bharat Singh Rawat, brother-in-law of Negi.

‘My son had visited us in April. We had no idea it would be our last meeting,” said Gachhapal Singh Negi, 72, Ramesh’s father.
