Man arrested for raping 22-year-old student

Ludhiana: Jagraon police have arrested a man for allegedly raping a 22-year-old student while promising to marry her.

The accused belongs to a village in Jalandhar. In her police complaint, the 22-year-old woman said early this year, she had met the accused while pursuing IELTS from an institute in Nakodar. She said the accused became friends with her and told her he wanted to marry her.

The complainant claimed on February 6, she left her home without informing her family, and went with the accused to Chandigarh, where they rented a house. She returned home on February 21, but went again with the accused and stayed at the same accommodation in Chandigarh in March.

The complainant, who is a commerce graduate, claimed after Chandigarh, they came to Jagraon about 15 days ago and started living there. She said when she asked the accused to marry her, he declined to do so, and thrashed her as well. Police officials said on Tuesday, the complainant’s father called from Dubai on the district control room, informing cops about the matter. A sub-inspector was then sent to the spot as part of investigation.

Police said the complainant claimed that the accused had left her at a rented accommodation and had switched off his phone. The student informed that the accused was married and she came to know about it when his brother-in-law called on his mobile phone when he was away.

Police have booked the accused under Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

SC ruling

The Supreme Court had recently ruled that sex on the pretext of marriage is rape and is a blow to the honour of a woman. On April 21, Sudhar police had booked an Armyman for allegedly raping a student by promising to marry her.
