‘Abdullah’s, muftis trying to divide nation’, Here’s how Abdullah responded to Modi

Sri Nagar: National Conference President and Srinagar candidate Farooq Abdullah on Monday responding to Modi’s accusations, said the country would have disintegrated long back if they had wanted to as Modi claimed.

“Abdullahs and Muftis of trying to divide the country” Modi said referring to Muslim politicians in the region creating fresh controversy in the region, New Indian Express reports.

Daring PM Modi to hold election rally in Kashmir, 83-year-old Abdullah addressing party worker’s convention said: “PM Modi is accusing us of dividing India. I can tell Modi that he will break but India will not disintegrate.”

“I contested the poll for the sake of my people despite reservations from my party leaders. At that time, we unfurled the Indian flag. No one from your party (BJP) was here,” Abdullah said referring to 1996 polls.

When PM has held rallied in Kathua and Akhnoor in the state then why is he not coming to Kashmir to address Muslims here? He is not because he knows he has betrayed Muslims said Abduallh.

Taking a direct jab at PM’s statement that “J&K is an inseparable part of India”, Abdullah questioned: “If it is your part, why you did not come to Kashmir to address the people here? Is it because you are afraid that you haven’t done justice to them?”

Meanwhile, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) chief Mehbooba Mufti convoy was pelted with stones by youths at Khiram in south Kashmir’s Anantnag on Monday which left one of the driver’s was hurt.

However, Mehbooba, who is contesting the polls from Anantnag, escaped unhurt. She claimed Modi is planning another Balakot-like strike on Pakistan in a bid to extract political mileage during the elections.
