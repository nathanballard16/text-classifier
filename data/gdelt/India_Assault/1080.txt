Hyderabad: A 42-year-old school headmaster in Andhra Pradesh was arrested after he allegedly raped a class 2 student in his school earlier this week.

The incident took place on Tuesday when the headmaster of a government school allegedly took the girl to an empty room and raped her.

The 8-year-old is said to have gone home crying, with injuries and blood on her clothes. She complained of the pain and narrated her ordeal to her mother. Later, mother took her to the hospital where doctors informed the family that the girl was sexually assaulted.
