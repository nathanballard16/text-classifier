Navy officer’s wife found dead

Family does not suspect any foul play; no note recovered

A 28-year-old woman, the wife of a serving Lieutenant Commander in the Navy, was found dead at their residence in south-west Delhi’s Vasant Kunj.

The police said no note has been recovered. A senior officer said a PCR call was made at 6.30 a.m. on November 8 regarding a woman found dead in Tarapore Enclave, a residential area for defence department officers.

When the police entered the fourth-floor residence of the couple, the door to the woman’s room was found locked from the inside. When they broke open the door, the body was found inside. She had no clothes on. “No note was found. There were several cigarette butts in an ashtray nearby,” the officer said.

Sources said the woman’s husband was not at home during the night and when he returned, he knocked on her door. When she did not open, he peeped through the kitchen window which opened into the room and spotted her body.

He then called a doctor from a private hospital and also informed the police.

The doctor reached the residence and declared her dead.

The woman’s family does not suspect any foul play. The police said that the couple had been married for less than seven years and a magisterial enquiry has been initiated, sources said.

Initial probe has revealed that the couple got married three years ago.

The husband allegedly told the police that his wife used to remain upset with him over personal issues, which led to frequent arguments. “The husband returned to Delhi around 10 days ago and they used to often stay in separate rooms. They have been living in the residential complex for the last one year,” the officer said.
