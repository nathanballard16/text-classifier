Home department expandslaunched in 2018 following positive results.Thehas decided to expand a pilot project launched in 2018 and provideto all traffic police personnel in Mumbai. The project, under which nearly a hundred cameras were issued to traffic police, has yielded positive results and the authorities have now decided to expand it to the entire department.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Ranjan Kumar Sharma told Mirror that an order has been placed for 2,304 cameras. They will each cost around Rs 4,000 and have a battery life of three to four hours.The cameras will be lightweight and appear to be part of the police uniform. They will be easy to handle and capture high-quality images and videos under all light conditions. They will also have Wi-Fi, GPS, and Bluetooth capabilities to quickly transmit data.“These will be for constables. In the past when they have taken action, there have been allegations against them,” Sharma said. “To know the truth, we need evidence. At times, our staff is at fault and sometimes, the public does wrong things.”Following a fatal attack on a constable in 2016, the government decided to issue body cameras to police personnel, but it wasn’t until two years later that the pilot project could be launched. Vilas Shinde had asked a motorcyclist and his companion for documents. But instead of complying with the request, the two assaulted the constable, who later died.In 2018, a motorcyclist died after a traffic policeman allegedly assaulted him with a helmet.“These body cameras will curb such incidents,” said a police official. “Attacks on police personnel, public emergencies, violence, traffic violations… now we will have photographic/video evidence when things go wrong. These cameras will also record routine activities,” the official said.
