Guj govt to demand death for rapists of three minor girls

The Gujarat government will demand capital punishment for the accused involved in rape of three minor girls in separate incidents recently, Minister of State for Home Pradeepsinh Jadeja said on Monday.

He said the government will also request the high court to shift these cases to fast track courts.

The incidents had occurred in Vadodara, Rajkot and Surat last week.

While the accused involved in the Rajkot and Surat incidents were already arrested, police are looking for the culprits of the Vadodara incident.

Jadeja said the state government would appoint special public prosecutors as well as 'pairvi' officers (prosecuting officers) to ensure justice for the victims.

"Accused were already arrested in Rajkot and Surat cases. Police have formed 25 teams to trace the accused who had raped a 14-year-old girl in Vadodara," he told reporters in Gandhinagar.

Jadeja said the maximum penalty for such crimes where victims are minors is death penalty as per amended law.

"Our government will try to ensure that these accused get capital punishment. We will urge the High Court to shift these cases to fast track courts for a speedy trial," he said.

A 14-year-old girl was raped by two unidentified men on November 28 evening when she was sitting with her friend at Navlakhi ground in Vadodara.

In Surat, an 11-year-old girl was raped by her 30-year-old step-father on November 29. The accused was arrested.

In Rajkot, an 8-year-old girl sleeping in a public park was raped by a 22-year-old man on November 29 night, who was arrested later.
