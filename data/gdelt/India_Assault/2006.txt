Ludhiana gang-rape: 3 arrested, sent to police remand

A court in Ludhiana on Wednesday sent three accused in the gang-rape of a 21-year-old woman to seven days' police remand.

The Punjab Police had arrested the three men who had allegedly gang-raped the young woman in Issewal area of Ludhiana district on February 9 night.

Police officials said on Wednesday that raids are being conducted at various places to nab the remaining accused. Those arrested so far include Jagroop Singh, Sadik Ali and Surma, Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Ranbir Singh Khatra said.

The DIG said police investigations have revealed that six men were involved in the gang-rape of the victim when she was driving along a canal in a car with her male friend.

The victim had alleged that she was gang-raped by at least 10 men after she and her friend were attacked and abducted. Both were taken in their car to an isolated plot in Issewal area of Ludhiana district and the woman was gang-raped while her friend was held captive.

All the suspects are in the 25-30 age group, police officials said.

The police registered a case of rape and under other sections of the Indian Penal Code against the accused.

Khatra had earlier admitted that there were lapses by the local police in dealing with the matter due to which the gruesome crime took place.

Assistant Sub-Inspector Vijay Rattan was on Monday suspended for dereliction of duty as he had failed to investigate the matter seriously and did not inform his seniors about it after receiving a complaint about the incident.

The accused had called up a friend of the rape victim's friend and demanded a ransom of Rs 2 lakh. The friend approached the police following the call but the police did not take immediate action.

The couple were set free on Sunday after which they complained to the police.
