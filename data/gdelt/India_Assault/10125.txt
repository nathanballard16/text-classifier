Rape case is to blackmail me, says Binoy Kodiyeri

Thiruvananthapuram: Binoy Vinodini Balakrishnan against whom rape case was filed by a Bihar woman in Mumbai Andheri police station said it is blackmail and the same woman had filed a complaint earlier too. He said a legal move will be taken after consulting with his advocate.

“The news on sexual assault is baseless. Six months back, a letter was given demanding Rs 5 crore and the woman had stated in the letter that I had married her.” Binoy said he had filed a petition with the Kannur IG over this. When the probe on the first case is progressing, news on rape case was filed and I will deal with it legally, he said.

A case may be booked against the woman as per the complaint filed by Binoy. Binoy’s complaint was registered with the Kannur IG in May.

“I challenge the complainant’s claim of an 8-year-old child out of the relationship. There are several ways to prove this scientifically. The complainant is on a blackmail mode,” he said. Binoy said he is not aware if anyone else is behind the woman. Only further probe into the complaint will reveal more.

A Bihari woman has filed a complaint of rape and false promise of marriage at the Andheri Oshiwara police station. The complaint states that she was sexually assaulted for over 8 years and has a 8-year-old child from the relationship. Police have registered FIR against Binoy and probe have begun. The complaint also states that the woman was assaulted from 2008 to 2018.
