NEW DELHI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- At least eight people were killed and six others injured after a speeding goods truck rammed into a wedding tent in eastern Indian state of Bihar, police said Thursday.

The accident took place at Halsi Bazar in Lakhisarai district, about 95 km south of Patna, the capital city of Bihar.

"In a tragic road accident last night here at Halsi Bazar eight people were killed and six others injured when a speeding truck lost control and rammed into a wedding tent erected along roadside," a police official posted in Lakhisarai said. "The speeding truck seemed to have lost control, hit an electric pole and then overran the guests at wedding."

The victims had assembled to participate in the wedding ceremony.

According to police, the injured were immediately removed to nearest medical facility for treatment.
