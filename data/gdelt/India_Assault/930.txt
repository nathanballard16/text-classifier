Woman ‘strangles’ daughter to death

Police suspect that accused has been suffering from mental disorder

A woman allegedly murdered her seven-year-old daughter at Dimili village under Rambilli police station limits in Visakhapatnam district on Monday morning.

The deceased was identified as Bandi Ramya, a Class-II student of a government school, and the accused has been identified as Bandi Usha, a housewife.

Though the police are yet to ascertain the motive behind the crime, they are suspecting that Usha has been suffering from mental disorders, and the crime could be an outcome of her mental state. The police said that Usha reportedly strangled her daughter Ramya in front of her five-year-old son when her husband B. Appa Rao had gone out on Monday morning.

“We received a complaint from Appa Rao on Monday morning in which he mentioned that his wife Usha murdered his daughter Ramya,” said Rambilli Sub-Inspector V. Chakradhara Rao.

‘External injuries’

“We have found some external injuries on the girl’s neck and registered a case under Section 302 of IPC (punishment for murder) and investigation is on.”

‘Neglecting family’

Sources said that Usha’s husband Appa Rao is a drunkard and has been neglecting the family.

Usha has been suffering from depression for the past two years, said the police.

The mother has not been taken in to custody, but we will soon do after the primary investigation, the police said.
