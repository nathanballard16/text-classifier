Odisha CM hails IAF for strike on terror camp

Bhubaneswar: Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Tuesday hailed the Indian Air Force (IAF) for its pre-dawn air strikes on terror camps in Balakot across Line of Control.

“I salute the Indian Air Force for having taken action to protect our country,” said the Chief Minister.

Days after a suicide bomber killed 40 CRPF troopers in Jammu and Kashmir, India on early Tuesday struck the Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) biggest training camp at Balakot across LoC, killing a very large number of terrorists and their trainers.

Earlier, Foreign Secretary Vijay K. Gokhale told the media, “In this operation, a very large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders and groups of jihadis who were being trained for fidayeen action were eliminated.”
