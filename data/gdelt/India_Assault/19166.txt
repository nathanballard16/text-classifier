SURAT: Police arrested a 30-year-old jobless man on Saturday for allegedly raping and sexually assaulting his 11-year-old stepdaughter multiple times at their home in the past one month.

The accused, said police, thrashed the survivor’s younger brother brutally in front of the girl and threatened to do the same with her if she dared to complain about the assaults.

The matter came to light after the mother caught the accused in an objectionable position on Friday and approached the Salabatpura police station. Based on the complaints by the survivor’s mother, police arrested the unemployed man on charges of allegedly raping the minor multiple times at heir home.

According to the police, the complainant started living with the accused after her husband died a few months ago. Her 11-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son also lived with the couple in the house. The accused initially started harassing the girl when the mother would go out for work and then began to rape her.

Police said the minor who was terrified from the thrashing revealed that the accused would send her brother out to play before he raped her. Medical examination confirmed rape.

However, police said that the minor is under treatment and that investigating is on to find out if the accused, who is jobless and spends most of his time at home, had sexually assaulted any other minor in past too.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme Court directives on cases related to sexual assault)
