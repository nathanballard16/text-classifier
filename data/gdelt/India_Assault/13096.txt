Top Court Intervenes in Rape Case That Has Stunned India

MYSURU, India — The Supreme Court of India has intervened in the case of a regional lawmaker suspected of trying to kill a woman who accused him of rape, ordering police protection for the woman and moving the rape trial out of the state where he wields political power.

The lawmaker, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, has been jailed since last year on charges of rape and kidnapping. He is accused of attacking the woman in 2017, when she was 17, after luring her to his home with the promise of a job interview.

The police now suspect him of arranging, from behind bars, a car crash on Sunday that left the woman in critical condition and killed two aunts who were in the car with her when a truck struck it head-on.
