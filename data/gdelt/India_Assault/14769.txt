Gang of cab robbers busted, 3 held in Najafgarh

New Delhi: With the arrest of three alleged robbers, the Delhi Police claimed to have busted a gang of car-jackers who would rob cab drivers in Dwarka and nearby areas and to solve eight cases of car-jacking and robberies.

The police have also recovered four cars, one motorcycle, and one country-made pistol from the three identified as Sagar (21), Sandeep (21) and Amit (20), all resident of Najafgarh, Delhi.

On August 21 night, three bike-born robbers targeted a cabbie, abducted him and ran away with his cab after dumping him at a deserted area near Dichaon Kalan. They later used the snatched-away car for robbing another cab driver.

When the police received the complaint it set up a team and started investigating the incidents, said DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse.

During the investigation, the CCTV footages led the team to the Najafgarh area where Sandeep, recently released from Tihar Jail, was identified. On his arrest, Sandeep disclosed about his two other accomplices and plan commit more such robberies, said the DCP. As they were to come to the area to meet Sandeep, a trap was laid and they were overpowered bt the police, Alphonse added.

During the interrogation, Sagar and Sandeep said to live a lavish life and to quench their thirst for expensive liquor, they had started committing crime, the DCP said.
