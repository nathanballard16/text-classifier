In support of agitating doctors in West Bengal, more than 50,000 doctors from private hospitals and nursing homes in Maharashtra stayed away from out-patient departments (OPDs) andon Monday.“Doctors and other medical practitioners in the state have decided to support their colleagues in Bengal who are protesting against their,” an Indian Medical Association (IMA) official said, adding that emergency services will not be affected and those already hospitalised will continue to get all the necessary medication and attention.“The OPD services have been suspended in support of the strike call,” IMA Maharashtra’s honorary secretary Dr Suhas Pingale said.Junior doctors in West Bengal are on strike since June 11 after two of their colleagues were attacked by relatives of a patient who died at thein Kolkata.In Mumbai, the organisations supporting the IMA include the Association of Medical Consultants, the Indian Society of Anaesthesiologists, the All India Ophthalmologists, the Federation of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Society of India (FOGSI), the Indian Radiological and Imaging Association, the Bombay Nursing Homes Association, and the Federation of Family Physician Association, among others. The participating hospitals in the city include the Asian Heart Institute, Holy Spirit Hospital, Fortis Hospital, Jupiter Hospital, Kokilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital, among others.The IMA has demanded a comprehensive central law in dealing with violence on doctors and health care staff. Security measures and the determinants leading to violence should also be addressed, it said earlier in a statement.“Doctors have been assaulted in the past as well. When we protested, the government increased the CCTV surveillance and security guards. However, either CCTV cameras don’t work or the guards are not paid. If this how the government will deal with the situation then such assaults will keep happening,” said Dr Lalit Kapoor, founder member of the Association of Medical Consultants (AMC).“We strongly condemn the lack of security of doctors, a problem which has now become endemic and is threatening to shake the roots of the healthcare system of this country, a situation which we can hardly afford,” said Dr Mukesh Gupta, the current president of AMC.According to Dr Bina Pandit, a senior member of AMC, the Maharashtra Medicare Act passed in 2010 has made no significant difference as there has not been a single conviction under this Act since its inception.Dr Shivkumar Utture, a member of IMA and current president of Maharashtra Medical Council, pointed out that the recent agitation has also brought to our notice that junior doctors are working 24X7, especially in government hospitals.
