Message by the President of Russia at the ceremony marking the launch of a Russian-Indian joint venture for Kalashnikov assault rifle production

Dear friends!

I welcome you at the launch of the Russian-Indian enterprise for production of Kalashnikov assault rifles.

Military and technical cooperation has traditionally been one of the key areas of special and privileged strategic partnership between Russia and India. For more than seven decades, we have been supplying reliable and high-quality armaments and equipment to Indian friends. Around 170 military and industrial facilities have been set up in India with assistance from our country.

The new joint venture will manufacture world famous Kalashnikov assault rifles of the newest 200 series and eventually will reach full localization of production. Thus, the Indian defence-industrial sector will have the opportunity to fulfill the needs of national security agencies in this category of small arms, resting upon advanced Russian technologies.

Let me remind you that it was during my official visit to India last October that my counterpart and friend Mr Modi and I reached the agreement on setting up Kalashnikov production in this country. The respective intergovernmental agreement was prepared and signed in the shortest possible time. In this regard, I would like to express gratitude to Russian and Indian specialists, to all those who so promptly made this project happen.

I am convinced that commissioning of the new enterprise will contribute to stronger defence potential of India, to further advance of the scientific and industrial basis of the national economy, will be instrumental in terms of creating new jobs for qualified work force, and will provide an impetus to professional education and personnel training. The plant itself will become another symbol of friendship and constructive cooperation between our two countries.

I wish you every success and all the best.
