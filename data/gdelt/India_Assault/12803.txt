BHUBANESWAR: Armed miscreants allegedly robbed belongings from three persons in separate incidents under Mancheswar police station limits here on Tuesday. In the first incident, the goons allegedly snatched gold jewellery and cash from a railway employee and his wife, who were on their way to the station in an auto-rickshaw.

In another incident, a gang of robbers brutally assaulted a person inside an automobile showroom and decamped with Rs 2 lakh from him. "I had gone to purchase a second hand car. The robbers had already taken the showroom's owner hostage. The moment I entered, they gagged and assaulted me. They snatched away my cash," said Vicky Sharma, a trader from Rairangpur in Mayurbhanj district.

In the third incident, miscreants allegedly decamped with gold ornaments from the house of a bank employee in Mancheswar. "We have received complaints and are investigating," deputy commissioner of police Anup Sahoo said.
