The Chief Minister of Karnataka, B. S. Yediyurappa, called on citizens living in the southern state “to remain calm and maintain peace” in a tweet Thursday.

“I appeal to the people, particularly those in Mangaluru (Mangalore), to maintain harmony and to refrain from destroying public property,” Yediyurappa, who is a member of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, wrote.

He denounced the violence in the city of Mangalore and said “false propaganda is being spread about the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Do not pay heed to politically motivated, provocative statements from anyone.’”
