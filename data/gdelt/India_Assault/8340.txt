A day after Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur was called out by the Opposition for calling Nathuram Godse a patriot, Anant Kumar Hegde said, "Time to assert and move away from being apologetic! If not now ... When?"

On Wednesday, Pragya Singh Thakur the Lok Sabha candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Bhopal ignited a political row by claiming that, Nathuram Godse, the assassin of Mahatma Gandhi was a patriot and will remain one.

Later on Thursday night, she tendered an apology and said she respected Mahatma Gandhi as his work for the country cannot be forgotten.

However, the controversy began when Kamal Hassan said "independent India's first extremist was a Hindu" while referring to Nathuram Godse. On Thursday, Makkal Neethi Miami chief Kamal Haasan said that he stands by his comment regarding Nathuram Godse and he has only reiterated what was history.
