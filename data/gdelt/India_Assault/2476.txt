Unfair to blame Islamabad for everything, Pak minister tells India Today

Pakistan has strongly rejected Indian media and government's allegations of the country's link to the Pulwama terror attack "without" probe, even as the entire world condemned Islamabad for providing safe havens to terror groups.

In one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's three decades of militancy, a suicide bomber on Thursday rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district, killing over 40 personnel and leaving many critically wounded.

The Jaish-e-Mohammed, a group of militant Islamic extremists, claimed responsibility for the terror attack. The group had pioneered suicide bombings in the disputed region of Kashmir earlier too -- pre 2004-05.

The Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) is often seen connected to Pakistan, in terms of the location of its headquarters. It is said, and proven many times, that the militant group is based in Pakistan and its leader, Maulana Masood Azhar, puts up there.

But Pakistan information minister Fawad Chaudhry has refuted all these allegations -- once again.

In an exclusive interaction with India Today TV, Chaudhry said it was unfair to put the blame on Pakistan for everything and that normalisation process with India was their top most priority.

"Putting the blame on Pakistan for everything is wrong. It is unfair. Normalisation process with India is our top most priority," he said.

Chaudhry added, "JeM is a banned organisation. We are taking action against it and will do whatever is required."

He further said Kashmir was a highly militarised area and there were less chances, in such a scenario, for peace.

"Pakistan is taking strong action against terrorist groups and we are happy to assist India if they want," Chaudhry added.
