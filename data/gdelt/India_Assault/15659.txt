SC stays death row convict’s execution till October 19

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed execution of a condemned prisoner who was awarded the extreme punishment for raping and killing a 10-year old girl and her 7-old brother in Coimbatore in 2010.Almost one-and-half months after upholding his death sentence, a bench of Justices R F Nariman, Sanjiv Khanna and Surya Kant agreed to hear the plea of the death row convict seeking review of the apex court’s verdict. The three- judge bench had on August 1 upheld the sentence by a majority of 2:1 verdict.Upholding the sentence, Justices Nariman and Kant had said, “There can be no doubt that today’s judgment is in keeping with the legislature’s realisation that such crimes are on the rise and must be dealt with severely.” Justice Khanna, however, said it is not the rarest of rare case and showed leniency for the convict for being a first-time offender and because of his young age and family status.As the senior counsel who was to argue his case was not available, the bench posted the case for October 19.In this case, there were two accused but the prime accused, who had kidnapped the children, was killed in police encounter and the trial was conducted only against Manoharan. The trial court awarded the death sentence to him, which was confirmed by Madras HC.According to prosecution, Manoharan along with prime accused Mohanakrishnan, former driver of the school van of the children, abducted the siblings on October 29, 2010 with the aim of demanding ransom from their father. However, they raped and murdered the girl and later also killed her brother who was a witness to the crime. They later threw the bodies in a canal near Pollachi
