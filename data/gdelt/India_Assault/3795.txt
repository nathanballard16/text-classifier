Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman’s parents

New Delhi: The parents of Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s parents received a standing ovation after they de-boarded an IndiGo Chennai-New Delhi flight. In videos uploaded by users on social media, the parents were seen alighting from the aircraft while the co-passengers clapped and cheered for the parents of the brave pilot.

According to media reports, the parent had boarded a flight from Chennai to Delhi. As soon as the plane landed in the national capital fellow passengers discovered their identity and voluntarily gave them the first right of de-boarding, reported IANS.

The 35-year-old Wing Commander was flying a MiG 21 Bison when it was shot down. His fighter jet crash landed in PoK after which he was captured by the Pakistani Army. During the dogfight, Varthaman successfully brought down an F-16 over Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir on Wednesday, a spectacular feat in the history of aviation.

Pakistan PM Imran Khan, while addressing a joint session of the Pakistani parliament, said that the captured pilot will be released as a peace gesture to de-escalate the current situation between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

PM Khan also said that this should not be seen as “weakness” and added that Pakistan like any other country stands for peace and stability.

Prior to this entire standoff, on 14 February, the bilateral ties between both the countries nosedived after 40 CRPF jawans were martyred in Pulwama. Later, Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the dastardly attack.

In response to this terror attack, India launched air strikes on JeM terror camps in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.
