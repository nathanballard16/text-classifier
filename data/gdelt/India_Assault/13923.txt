Customs stays order revoking DHL registration

MUMBAI: Global logistics company DHL Express got a reprieve late on Friday when the customs department stayed a Wednesday order revoking its courier registration. The department said it was doing so due to the government's commitment to “ease of doing business,” probably the first time this has happened, said people familiar with the matter.The registration had been cancelled by the commissioner of customs, New Delhi , after investigations revealed that a gold smuggling syndicate had been exploiting the courier network’s sloppy oversight to bring the yellow metal into the country. ET has seen a copy of this order. “I hold DHL Express responsible… for contravention of provision… and revoke the courier registration of the company,” read the order signed by the customs commissioner.DHL said the order was quashed by a chief commissioner on Friday. “Chief commissioner has issued a stay order as he has found merit in our case. He appreciates and understands that our company has always been compliant with law of the land,” a DHL spokesperson said.Several experts who have dealt with similar situations said that “it’s unheard of that such an order is quashed on the very next working day.”The gold was painted black and imported from Dubai under the guise of automobile components from Dubai. Company sources told ET that top DHL executives will arrive in Mumbai from Frankfurt on Saturday to take stock.The Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) had received information that “one syndicate was resorting to smuggling of gold by the way of concealment in automobile parts at international courier consignments sent from Dubai to India through DHL Express.”Acting on the tip, the investigators searched its New Delhi office.
