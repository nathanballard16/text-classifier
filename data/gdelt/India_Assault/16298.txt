Forum thread: Ashamed to call myself indian

You just accepted the other end of the twisted story. It's hard to be unbiased about this subject for people. They either believe the indian government narrative or Pakistan government narrative. Indian government paints Pakistan as the absolute worst enemy they could have.And the same goes for Pakistan government. It's easier to appease people that way. Imran khan pretty much labels RSS organisation as some Nazi influenced group with a global aim for ethnic cleansing of muslims which is absolute bullshit. RSS maybe a overly religious organisation with stringent principles. I do not fancy them.At the same time, i do not think their aim is to get rid of muslims from india. It pretty much shows how much biasness every individual in indian and pakistan has towards the other nation. The problem with Pakistan government is that they let terrorists to operate in their territory .It was made clear when osama bin laden was found near their military academy of all places. Some say Imran khan is trying to change it. Not really sure how effective he has been so far. I am specifically using the term government here is because i do believe most of the people in both countries are good people. It's just they feed too much into their government propaganda. As for kashmir, I think the indian government's resolution was over the top. They could have handled it way better,even if they were going to remove article 370. The question of whether it's constitutional or not is debatable. Only time will tell whether that was the right decision to make. People don't get killed for being a muslim here in india. It's the same as indians thinking all of pakistanis are terrorist assholes. There are bad hindus and bad muslims, doesn't mean it defines the majority of the population.Try to see things with an unbaised eye, you'll understand that both of them misunderstand each other. And the ingrained hate only makes it worse.
