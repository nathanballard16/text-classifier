New Delhi, July 12

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has issued a notice to Haryana’s Director General of Police seeking a report on the alleged abduction and subsequent gang-rape of a 12-year-old Dalit girl in Nuh in southern Haryana.

The DGP has been asked to submit the report in four weeks detailing the status of the investigation in the matter and the relief and rehabilitation, and counselling provided to the victim.

The police registered a case under the POCSO Act yesterday. Three persons, who have reportedly confessed to the crime, have been arrested.

The victim reportedly lives with her grandmother as her parents have passed away.

The unsuspecting girl was taken out of her home for a drive by one of the accused, who is still at large, when her grandmother was outdoors. He was known to her.

He allegedly called up his other accomplices and took the girl to an under-construction house belonging to a policeman and raped her for two days during her abduction. The accused had reportedly threatened to kill her if she dared to reveal the incident to anybody.

The police authorities reportedly did not take action when the grandmother of the victim approached them on Tuesday. It eventually filed the case on Thursday.

The Commission has observed that the non-action by the police when the victim’s grandmother was seeking help was “disheartening”. The incident relates to the violation of human rights of the victim.
