Welcome Citizenship Amendment Bill No logic for Congress to oppose CAB

Dear Editor,

Union Cabinet deserves all compliments for approving Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 which allows people of all religions other than Muslims, easy access to Indian citizenship. Everyone knows that Hindus who are mainly limited to India and Nepal are facing worst torture in Islamic nations like Pakistan and Bangladesh as minority-community there, forcing them to flee to India. Same is situation with Christians in Pakistan. Central government has thus played a perfect secular role in opening its doors for people of all religions facing torture in Islamic countries.

Congress which was instrumental in creating divided India on basis of religion has no right in opposing the Bill in its usual policy of pseudo-secularism. How can people of Muslim community from countries like Myanmar can be allowed to enter India when that country has itself become victim of Rohingya Muslims. Likewise Bangladeshi Muslims came to India only because of better living here, but are manly involved in anti-social and criminal activities. As such all accounts, decision of Union Cabinet is based on practical aspects. Indian Muslims are enjoying equal rights and better livelihood here, being the proof that Muslims from neighboring Islamic nations Pakistan and Bangladesh want to come to India, which must be stopped.
