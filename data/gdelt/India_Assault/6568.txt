Wife Burns Husband Because He Had A Dark Complexion, What The Actual F*ck?

We have seen many cases of dowry where women have been burned or abused for not fulfilling her in-laws' demands. But this woman set her husband on fire, killing him for not having a fair complexion in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly.

The incident happened on Monday when the accused - Prem Shri - set the victim - Satyaveer Singh - on fire while he was sleeping, reported The Times of India. The victim Satyaveer’s brother Harveer Singh said that his sister-in-law didn’t like his brother because of his dark complexion.

Harveer also told TOI that she always used to comment on his brother’s dark complexion, but he never thought that she would take such a big step.

They were married for over two years and the couple also has a five-month-old daughter.

Inspector Sehdev Singh, station house officer (SHO) of Kurh Fatehgarh, said that initially, an FIR was registered under Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code but later it was converted to section 302 (murder) after the death of Satyaveer Singh.

Prem Shri also suffered burn injuries on her legs.
