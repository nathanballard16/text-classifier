Govt clears new assault rifles for Army

New Delhi [India], Feb 2 (ANI): The Defence Ministry has cleared the purchase of 72,400 modern assault rifles for the Indian Army from global manufacturer Sig Sauer for troops deployed in counterinsurgency operations.

This would be a big development for the Army as it has been looking for such weapons for a long time but could not do so due to repeated cancellation of the tender process.

“The Defence Minister cleared the procurement on Friday and now the rifles would be made available to soldiers in a year after signing the contract,” Defence sources said here.

The SIG716-G2 rifles would be lighter than the present rifles with the Army troops and are expected to cost around Rs 700 crores.

The government is also working to get smaller weapons such as carbines and Light Machine Guns for troops to equip them in a better way to counter the adversaries. (ANI)
