Missing survivor: 2 out-on-bail accused detained for questioning

Ludhiana: Two months after a gang-rape survivor went missing, the Crime Investigation Agency has detained two accused for questioning.“The duo will be quizzed about the whereabouts of the missing survivor ,” said a CIA official.Five men had gang-raped the 16-year-old, who worked as a domestic help, in April and May after holding her captive. The incident came to light on May 2, when the accused took her to civil hospital for treatment of injuries she suffered in the assault. All five were arrested a day later. The survivor went missing on September 16, soon after the main gang-rape accused came out on bail. Days later, another accused was released on bail.Last week, the survivor’s parents, who work as daily-wagers, wrote a complaint to the commissioner of police accusing investigating officers of being hand in glove with the accused. “We suspect the two accused, who have came out on bail, kidnapped our daughter. They have either confined her somewhere or killed her. Even as we have lodged a complaint, the police are not arresting them,” said the survivor’s father.After receiving the complaint, police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal had handed the investigation over to additional deputy commissioner of police (investigation) Harish Dayama.Dayama said, “We have taken the two accused into custody for questioning.”8-MONTH ORDEALApril 30 | 16-year-old girl goes missingMay 2 | Gang-rape accused get her admitted to civil hospital, claiming that she met with an accident.
