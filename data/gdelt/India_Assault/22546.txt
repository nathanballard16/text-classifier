Akali Dal president is lying: Congress MLA Madan Lal Jalalpur

PATIALA: The Congress MLA from Ghanaur, Madan Lal Jalalpur, on Saturday said the SAD was lying by claiming he influenced a police probe into a clash between Akali and Congress supporters, so that 42 residents of Takhtumajra village could be booked in the case.Jalalpur said the case had been registered after a police investigation and he was being falsely accused of influencing the probe. Jalalpur , who had called a press conference here, said 20 people entered the Kheri Gandian police station and attacked Congress sarpanch Harsanget Singh, 40, of Takhtumajra before assaulting him again inside the emergency ward of a hospital in Rajpura.“Videos of same went viral and all saw what happened inside the emergency ward when men armed with swords came to attack the sarpanch,” the Congress legislator said.Jalalpur, who had gone vocal against the delay on part of the police in taking action against the accused during the meeting of the district grievance redressal committee meeting chaired by Sadhu Singh Dharmasot last month, said, “If the police were taking orders from me, why would have I raised the issue in the meeting? No action was taken till I spoke up,” he said.Jalalpur had landed in a controversy after a video of him suggesting that the police should arrest the family members, especially women relatives, of the accused went viral on social media.The Punjab State Women Commission also had taken note of the issue and ordered an inquiry, but he was later given a clean chit.
