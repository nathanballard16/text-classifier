Two held for murderous assault on SAIL boss

The chairman of India's largest public-sector undertaking (PSU) was assaulted by four armed assailants in south Delhi's HUDCO place near upscale South Extension market on Wednesday night.

According to police, Anil Kumar Chaudhary (58), the chairman of Steel Authority of India (SAIL), was returning to his home in Siri Fort from Lodhi Road in his official car with his driver when the incident took place.

Chaudhary, who was attacked with iron rods, has alleged that it is not a case of road rage but an attempt to kill him. He claims that the attackers had a definite intention to kill him.

The assailants who were trailing Chaudhary for a few minutes were travelling in Honda City car.

Narrating the horrifying incident Chaudhary said, "the attackers were holding iron rods and sharp-edged weapon. They attacked me with a clear intention to kill me. It was the most horrifying five minutes of my life. One of the attackers tried to hit on my head with the rod but I was lucky to move out in time and the rod hit my shoulder. They kept punching me. I screamed for help but no passerby came for rescue."

Chaudhary claims that while hitting him, one of the assailants shouted 'finish him'. He and his driver had a narrow escape as a police patrolling team reached the spot.

"A police team was on the patrol duty which immediately reached the spot for his rescue. Chaudhary received severe injuries and he was taken to AIIMS where he was given medical treatment and was discharged," said an officer.

In a statement, SAIL said that it is "deeply shocked and anguished" at the attack.

The police said that two assailants were nabbed from the spot while two of them managed to give the cops a slip. The accused were identified as Amarjeet and Lalit. The accused have a previous record. They were found in an inebriated condition.
