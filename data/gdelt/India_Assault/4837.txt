Two arrested for rape, murder of 25-year-old

She rebuked them for passing lewd remarks

The Uran police have arrested two men for raping and murdering a 25-year-old woman, who had reprimanded them for passing lewd comments at her.

The Uran police said that the accused raped the woman and killed her by slitting her throat. The arrested accused have been identified as Naresh Ramlu Koli (42) and Lalitkumar Lalmanprasad Jaisal (22).

The incident came to light on February 23, when an unidentified body was found in a dilapidated house behind Dighode High School in Uran. The body was later identified by the woman’s mother-in-law and the Uran police registered a murder case.

Senior police inspector Jagdish Kulkarni said, “In the course of the investigation, we found out that the victim was last seen with the two accused and nabbed them on February 11. During interrogation, they confessed to the crime.”

According to the police, Mr. Koli hails from Hyderabad and ran a Chinese stall in Uran. Mr. Jaiswal is a labourer and the victim worked at a brick kiln. The police said that the accused routinely passed lewd comments at the victim and she retorted back.

“The duo wanted to take revenge for the abuses she hurled at them,” Mr. Kulkarni said. On February 22, when the victim was heading back home from work, the accused made friendly gestures to her and offered her alcohol. They took her to the dilapidated house and consumed alcohol. They then raped and killed her.

Mr. Kulkarni said, “We are yet to recover the murder weapon. The accused have been remanded in custody till February 20.”
