Man held for raping 7-yr-old daughter of his employer

Ludhiana: The police on Wednesday morning arrested a mechanic for raping the minor daughter of his employer.

In her police complaint, the survivor’s mother said, “On Monday, my seven-year-old daughter complained of pain in her private parts. She later told that the man who works at her father’s workshop lured her with a video game on his cellphone. While she was playing it, he violated her.”
