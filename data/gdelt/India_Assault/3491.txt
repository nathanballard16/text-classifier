Panel probes survivor’s charge of misbehaviour against doctor

Ludhiana: An inquiry is being conducted against a Sudhar civil hospital doctor after the 20-year-old student, who was gang-raped in Issewal village on February 9, accused her of misbehaviour and delaying her medical examination.

Chief medical officer (CMO) Parvinderpal Singh, who had marked the inquiry to a three-members committee on the complaint of the survivor and her two friends, said, “The probe team will submit its report by next week.”

On the night of February 9, a group of six men had raped the student after holding her friend captive in Issewal village. The gang had also called up their common friend, seeking a ransom of Rs 1 lakh. When nobody turned up with money, the gang escaped. The next day, the survivor and her friend lodged a complaint with Dakha police and went to Sudhar civil hospital for a medical examination.

“Her tests were not conducted that day as there was no woman doctor there. On February 11 morning, she again went to the hospital for the examination. The doctor, however, reached by afternoon. The doctor looked annoyed as she was especially called for the medical examination and senior doctors were waiting for her. She misbehaved with the survivor and asked her what was she doing there with her friend on the evening of the incident. Instead of being compassionate, she was quite rude,” said the survivor’s friend.

“We doubt the doctor will prepare a correct medical report. Besides, during the survivor’s examination, an electrician and male staffers of the hospital were present there,” he added.

The three-member committee had summoned the doctor on Monday.

The complainant said, “The committee members are trying to pressurize us to strike a compromise with the doctor. Therefore, we met the CMO again, seeking an impartial probe.”

The CMO said, “A fair inquiry will be conducted into the matter.”
