Cops lay down norms to fix spa session of gangsters

Ludhiana: Gangsters taking spa treatment after committing crimes is hardly heard of. But Ludhiana police have got information about certain cases where gangsters had used spas as a hiding place for a few hours after executing crimes in other cities.

And that had happened as the spas had no checks in place till now. But with the reports emerging of their misuse, Ludhiana police have now issued guidelines for city-based spa centres to keep a check on their visitors.

From now on, all spas in the city will have to get ID proof of their customers, maintain a register of visitors and install CCTV cameras at the reception. They will also have to keep the CCTV recordings of at least 30 days.

Police commissioner Rakesh Agarwal issued these guidelines during a meeting with city-based owners of spa centres on Friday.

Agarwal also made spa owners familiar with the guidelines and sought their feedback.

The police commissioner said there had to be checks on people visiting spas. In certain cases, it had been found that criminals from districts like Tarn Taran and Fazilka had executed crimes in those places and then had come to spa centres in cities like Chandigarh and Ludhiana.

Knowing the fact that spas don’t keep a check or maintain record of visitors, the gangsters spend a few hours in the centres and then proceed to other destinations, Agarwal added.

He said some spa centres had also been raided recently for being involved in immoral activities.

“Considering all these factors, the city police have come up with these guidelines,” Agarwal added.

The spa owners have been asked to implement the guidelines by next week.

Kapil Kumar, an owner of a spa centre, said they would certainly follow the guidelines.
