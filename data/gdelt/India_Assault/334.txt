Bhanushali, who hails from Kutch district, resigned as the BJP vice-president on June 13, 2018, in the wake of the allegation of rape. Bhanushali had claimed that the charge was a conspiracy to malign his image.

The Gujarat High Court quashed the FIR filed against Bhanushali in which he had been accused of raping a 21-year-old woman from Surat multiple times. The court's decision to quash the FIR against him after the woman complainant submitted an affidavit in the court giving her consent to drop the rape case against Bhanushali and recorded her statement before the police.

He had represented Abdasa seat in Kutch district from 2007 to 2012 as the BJP MLA.
