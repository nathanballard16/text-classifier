Three Bulandshahr police officials were booked on Friday for allegedly torturing a Dalit man in custody. The victim, Pramod, was called to Pahasu Police Station on September 27, where he was tortured, the FIR has alleged.

“The FIR has been filed as per the orders of the SC/ST commission. The victim had approached the SSP office after the alleged incident and a medical was carried out. In the report, no injuries were found and he merely had a limp. He approached the commission a few weeks later, who ordered the FIR. We are investigating the allegations,” said Bulandshahr Senior Superintendent of Police Santosh Kumar Singh.

According to the FIR, Pramod’s father had purchased a tractor on EMI and could not pay up due to financial reasons. The tractor had been missing for three months and Pramod’s father had allegedly absconded.
