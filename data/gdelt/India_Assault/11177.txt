Hyderabad: Cops to attach Nowhera’s assets

The three were arrested by the CCS police for defrauding the public by running a Ponzi scheme.

Hyderabad: In a fresh development in the alleged multi-crore fraud committed by the Heera group, the Telangana state government has accorded permission to the Central Crime Station (CCS) police to attach 55 properties worth `300 crore belonging to group founder Nowhera Shaik.

The accused is presently in Chanchalguda prison together with her aides, Molly Thomas and Biju Thomas. The three were arrested by the CCS police for defrauding the public by running a Ponzi scheme.

A few days ago, the Registrar of Companies (RoC) filed a case in the special court for economic offences against Nowshera Shaik, director Mubarak Jan Shaik and Heera Foodex Private Limited for reportedly failing to submit balance sheet accounts since 2016.

The case, which was filed under Section 92 of the Companies Act, will come up for hearing on July 12. CCS officials have already issued a Lookout Circular (LoC) against the company’s four directors — Ashrof Ahmed, Ismail Shaik Abu Baqar, Abdul Qayyum and Yasin Baig — across all airports and seaports to prevent them from fleeing the country.
