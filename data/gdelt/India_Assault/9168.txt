Rape victim’s lawyer held for ‘attack’ on her

Says woman, who had accused actor Karan Oberoi of rape, was aware of plan to orchestrate the attack

The Oshiwara police on Monday arrested the lawyer of the woman who had accused actor Karan Oberoi of rape in connection with the alleged attack on her last month.

The 34-year-old woman had last month registered a complaint with the Oshiwara police alleging that she was attacked by two men on a bike while taking a morning walk. The police arrested four people, whose interrogation allegedly pointed to her lawyer, Ali Kaashif Khan.

Officials who are part of the investigation confirmed that Mr. Khan, who had been on the run for several days, was arrested in Mumbai on Monday. “Mr. Khan has said in his interrogation that the woman was aware of the plan to orchestrate the attack on her. We are verifying her claims,” an officer said.

The police have so far arrested Zishan (23) and Altamash Ansari (22), Jithin Santosh Kurian (22) and Arafat Ahmed Ali (21) in connection with the case. The alleged attack occurred on May 26, where the assailants assaulted the victim and threw a piece of paper with ‘TAKE THE CASE BACK’ written on it.
