MUMBAI: The Bombay high court on Friday granted bail to actor Karan Oberoi in the rape case filed against him by a 34-year-old woman last month.The court added that his lawyer must furnish all documents in support of his innocence by June 20 to the police station. It set the bail amount at Rs 50,000.The court said prima facie Whatsapp messages exchanged between the two, the contents of which her lawyer has not denied, shows no case of extortion.Justice Revati Mohite Dere said that though the accuser's FIR states that the first rape allegation was made in January 2017, it has to be read “in juxtaposition with messages dated January 13, 2017.”The court observed that the woman had orchestrated the attack on herself and prima facie appears to have filed a second FIR against Oberoi to deny him bail.“The police have found the FIR to be false,” the court said in its order and directed the police to take appropriate action against the woman.The court also reminded the police that the investigation must be “fair and impartial” and questioned the cops for not seizing the woman's phone for investigation.In an FIR lodged on May 4, the woman had alleged that Oberoi "blackmailed” her by “demanding cash and other valuables” and maintained sexual relationship with her on the pretext of marriage.
