LUDHIANA: A doctor has been arrested for rape bid on a 20-year-old woman, the police said on Wednesday.The accused, who is about 45-year-old, is a registered medical practitioner and runs a clinic near the house of the complainant.The victim said in her police complaint, “As my younger sister, 8, was running high fever, I along with my mother took her to a clinic near our house. After checking my sister, the doctor prescribed some medicines and asked my mother to buy those from a nearby medical shop. My sister and I were sitting outside his cabin, waiting for our mother, when the doctor came to us.”“He said my eyes were looking swollen and called me to his cabin to check me. While my sister waited outside, I went in for a check-up. To my shock, the doctor locked the door from inside and tried to rape me. As I resisted his attempts and raised the alarm, he let me go. I rushed back home along with my sister,” she added.When the mother of the victim, who has studied till Class XII, came home, the latter broke down and apprised her of the incident. “My mother then went to the doctor’s clinic. The doctor apologised when my mother confronted him,” she said.When the victim’s father learned about it, he along with her mother went to the doctor’s house. “The doctor apologised again, but his wife blamed my daughter. As heated arguments ensued, the doctor’s wife hit my wife on the head with a medical apparatus. By chance, a police party was passing through the area. We called them up and apprised them of the incident,” said the victim’s father.After registering a case, the police arrested the doctor on the charges of rape attempt and causing injury (sections 376, 511 and 323 of the IPC) on Tuesday evening.The victim’s father said, “My wife has received five stitches on her head. We are counselling our daughter as the incident has traumatized her.”The victim’s family had shifted to the locality about three months ago.
