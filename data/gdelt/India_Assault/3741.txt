Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government, India has given Pakistan a strong message, and it’s up to Islamabad to decide where ties will go, BJP chief Amit Shah said on Friday.

Amit Shah was speaking at the India Today Conclave 2019 in New Delhi, amid a rapid escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan following a terrorist attack that killed 40 CRPF soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14.

India carried out airstrikes in Pakistani territory within two weeks of the attack, and says it thwarted an attempt by Pakistani jets to target its military installations a day later.

A pilot captured by Pakistan during Wednesday’s aerial confrontation — Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman — will be returned to India on Friday.

At the India Today Conclave, Amit Shah slammed Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan for not condemning the suicide bombing on February 14, asking why he was scared to do so.

The attack was carried out by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed, whose training camp India targeted when it carried out airstrikes in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province 12 days later.

“There is fairly credible evidence with us which proves that there was damage to the camps,” said Air Vice Marshal RGK Kapoor, the assistant chief of Air Staff, said on Thursday.

“The weapons hit the intended target and they caused damage that was intended. However, it will be premature to say that what was the number of casualties we have been able to inflict on those camps and the number of those killed,” he said.
