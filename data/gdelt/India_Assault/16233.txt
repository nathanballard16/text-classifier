Pakistan drone recovered in Punjab after terror accused reveals location

The Punjab Police on Friday found another Pakistani drone, a second such seizure within three days, at Attari bordering Pakistan, which was used to airdrop arms and ammunition in Punjab, police said.

Earlier, on Sunday, Punjab Police exposed a terrorist module of revived Khalistan Zindabad Force (KZF), backed by a Pakistan and Germany based terror group that was conspiring to unleash a series of terror strikes in Punjab and other adjoining states.

Hand grenades and five AK-47 rifles were recovered. The police had arrested four people in this regard.

According to sources in Punjab police a huge number of AK-47 assault rifles, grenades and satellite phones were dropped in Punjab’s Amritsar by heavy-lifting drones that came from Pakistan, just across the border for terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab Police officials said on Tuesday.

The sources also said that the high-end technology drones were armed with GPS and they carried out about eight ‘sorties’ in September to drop the arms consignment at the designated place and yet remained undetected. With a capacity to carry weight up to 5 kg, the drones flew at low level and at fast pace to evade detection.

The National Investigation Agency is looking into the case.
