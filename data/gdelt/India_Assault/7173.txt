F.P. Report

PESHAWAR: Zahran Hashim alledged mastermind of Sri Lankan Blasts travelled to India three months back. According to sources, Indian High Commission didn’t ask for security from local authorities despite having confirmed reports of being a target.

Meanwhile, Indian High Commissioner popularly known as viceroy in Sri Lanka due to his conduct, didn’t appear in Ambassador’s brief conducted by President and Prime Minister.

He also didn’t meet opposition leader and no appearance in media for which he usually crave / look upon the opportunity.

According to sources the suicide bomber stayed at Taj Sumudra on April 20 / 21 night and didn’t blast there in the morning and went to some other area.

Sources revealed Indian High Commission and agencies knew everything 20 days before the attack and also gave final warning an hour before the happening.

Is RAW more powerful and prevalent in Sri Lanka than the Sri Lankan agencies?

If yes, what’s requirement of RAW to have such strong and heavy presence actually undermining the host agencies? Nothing else but to wage war through other means.

Tamil Nado has been the breeding ground / origin for the modern suicide bombing trend.

Terrorists’ around the world have learnt the art and tactics of making suicide bombs and successful execution from Tamil Nado, India.

India has history of interfering in internal matters of all the neighboring countries in order to raise his stature as regional policeman and to prove the notion of being the net Secusity provider of the region which indeed she is not at all!
