Student’s assault at police station: SHO challenges constitution of PCA

‘PCA not in consonance with Supreme Court’s 2006 order’

A police officer has approached the Delhi High Court challenging the constitution of the Police Complaint Authority (PCA) and the proceedings initiated by it against him for allegedly torturing and beating up a Scheduled Caste student inside the premises of a police station.

Mahaveer Prasad Saini, who is the Station House Officer at Adarsh Nagar police station, has contended that the PCA set up by the Delhi government in 2017 was not in consonance with the Supreme Court’s 2006 direction to set up such a body each at the State and district levels.

The petition said that the apex court had directed that the state-level PCA would deal with complaints against officers of the rank of superintendent of police and above, while the district-level body would address complaints against officers up to the rank of deputy superintendent of police.

He has also sought quashing of the proceedings initiated against him by the PCA which had on September 2 taken suo motu cognisance of news reports regarding the alleged assault of a law student by policemen inside the police station premises.

He has said that an FIR was registered on October 1 on the student’s complaint and is being investigated by the police while the National Commission for Scheduled Caste is also looking into the matter, and therefore, there was no need for the PCA to suo motu initiate proceedings against him.
