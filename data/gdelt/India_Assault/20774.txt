Report: Delhi Twp. couple dead in apparent murder-suicide

CINCINNATI (FOX19) - Delhi Township police are investigating after two people were found dead in a home after an apparent murder-suicide early Tuesday morning, according to our media partners at the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Police were called to the home in the 500 block of Pontius Road at 3:25 a.m.

James Howarth, chief of the Delhi Township Police Department, told the Enquirer it appears to be a murder-suicide situation. He said one of the persons suffered from “chronic pain.”

The male 911 caller stated his wife was “in constant pain and nothing else could be done.”

Shortly after, two gunshots can be heard in the background.

Police requested a SWAT team after they responded when contact with the caller could not be made.

The SWAT team gained entry to the home and located an elderly male and female deceased upstairs.

Their names have not been released at this time.

Police said no suspects are being sought.
