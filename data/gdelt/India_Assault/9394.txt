Police hunt 'racist' attackers after daytime assault in Auckland's Sandringham

Police are still hunting three men after a daytime attack where a migrant was beaten and subjected to racist slurs in Auckland.

An Indian migrant said he was walking on a residential street in Sandringham this week, when he said three men tried to hit him with their car, then jumped out and punched him all over his body.

A police spokesperson said on Saturday there was no update on their investigation into the attack, and inquiries were ongoing.

The victim, who emigrated to New Zealand from India around two years ago, said the attack left him on the ground and screaming for help.

The injuries he received weren't too serious but he was still "in a lot of pain," the man said.

Speaking to Stuff at the time, he said: "This attack has made me feel very nervous and scared and my wife is very upset about it too, we have two young children and it's tough to think about what could have happened to my family if I had been injured."

"I can't change what happened to me, it has happened, but I can change the future - this kind of incident is not okay and shouldn't happen here," he added.

The man described his attackers as looking like they were aged in their early 20s, and their car as a silver hatchback.

He managed to remember the license plate number, which he gave to the police on the day of the attack.
