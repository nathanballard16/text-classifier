India is acquiring the rifles under the fast-track procurement (FTP) programme.

The new rifles will replace the existing Indian Small Arms System (Insas) 5.56x45mm rifles used by the forces and manufactured locally by the Ordnance Factories Board.

The Indian Army will get the majority of the rifles with a total of 66,000 units. The navy and the airforce will obtain 2,000 and 4,000 units respectively.

SIG716 uses the 7.62mm cartridge and provides enhanced functionality and reliability.

The rifle has an advanced operating system that decreases excessive heat and carbon fouling. It features an adjustable gas valve to increase or decrease gas flow.

The news agency also stated that the army has started receiving ammunition for its sniper rifles.

India will also manufacture AK-203 assault rifles in collaboration with Russia. The plan is to produce more than 700,000 of these rifles.
