Delhi shocker: Mother, lover arrested over murder of 5-year-old son

The lover of a woman allegedly killed her five-year-old son by smashing his head on a wall for not studying. The incident took place in Delhi's Bijwasan area two days ago.

Police have arrested the accused, Narender, and a case of murder and criminal conspiracy has been registered against him.

Police said that the boy's mother, Rani, was not present when the incident took place. However, she has also been arrested for providing misleading information to the police. The two tried to show the boy's death as an accident.

The boy, identified as Yuvang Singh, was admitted to a hospital where he later succumbed to his injuries.

Correction: An earlier version of the story had the mother killing her son with her lover. The mother was not present when the murder took place. We are sorry for the error.
