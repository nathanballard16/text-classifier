Nagpur: In another case of sexual assault in the city, a 19-year-old girl was raped by her mother's boyfriend here. In this case, a report has been registered in the Jaripatka police station in Nagpur city. After the complaint, the accused has been arrested by the police.

36-year-old accused Ritesh Padgalvar lives in the Hudco area of Nagpur and ran a catering business of his own. The victim's mother who lived in the same area was introduced to the accused by some common friends. Since the victim's mother had left her husband and lived with her 19-year-old daughter, Ritesh tried getting closer to her. His persistent efforts led to an alleged affair between the two of them which resulted in Ritesh frequenting the victim's home often.

Six months later, accused Ritesh came to live with the family. According to the Police, Ritesh would always tease the 19-year-old victim while she went to the bathroom or while changing clothes but she refrained from complaining to her mother to avoid making her upset.

On Tuesday afternoon, after the victim's mother went for work, Ritesh taking advantage of the situation, asked the victim for a glass of water. He then asked her to have a physical relationship with him, but she refused. Ritesh later raped the 19-year-old girl.
