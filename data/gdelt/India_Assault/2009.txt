Amarinder to approach HC to fast-track rape cases

Chandigarh: Taking serious note of the Ludhiana gang-rape case, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Wednesday said that he would approach the Chief Justice of Punjab and Haryana High Court to ensure speedy justice in rape cases.

Responding to an issue raised by Lok Insaf Party MLA Simarjeet Singh Bains and AAP MLA Kultar Singh Sandhwan over the recent Ludhiana gang rape case, the Chief Minister assured the Punjab Assembly that he would also request the Chief Justice to try all such cases in a fast-track court on day-to-day basis.

He stressed the need for prompt dispensation of justice to the victims, besides exemplary punishment to the convicts in such dastardly acts as a deterrent for others.

The Chief Minister told the Assembly that out of the six accused persons involved in the crime, three had already been arrested and the remaining would be nabbed soon.

Asserting that there was absolutely no law and order problem in the state, Amarinder challenged the opposition to a debate on the issue.

“No major law and order problem has taken place in the state since my government took over,” he said.

A 21-year-old woman had alleged that she was gang-raped by at least 10 men after she and her friend were attacked and abducted on the night of February 9.

Both were taken in their car to an isolated plot in the Issewal area of Ludhiana district and the woman was gang-raped while her friend was held captive.
