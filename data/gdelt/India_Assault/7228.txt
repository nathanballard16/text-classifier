Narayan Sai's sentencing to be held today

A sessions court in Surat will pronounce the sentence of rape convict Narayan Sai, son of jailed self-styled Godman Asaram Bapu, on Tuesday. Narayan Sai was on Friday convicted by additional sessions judge PS Gadhvi for rape, unnatural offences, assault, criminal intimidation, and criminal conspiracy in a case filed against him by a former woman devotee in 2013.

Lawyers had said that quantum of punishment of Narayan Sai, and three other of his associates who were also convicted, would be pronounced on April 30.

Two Surat-based women had accused Asaram and Narayan Sai of sexual exploitation. The elder sister had accused Asaram of sexual assaults between 1997 and 2006 when she lived at his ashram in Ahmedabad, while the younger sister had accused Narayan Sai of sexual assaults between 2002 and 2005 while living at his Surat ashram. Narayan Sai is in jail since his arrest from Delhi in December 2013.

Asaram was convicted for life for raping a minor girl in Rajasthan last year and is serving his sentence. Trial is going on against him in the earlier mentioned case in a court in Gandhinagar.
