SC pulls up Haryana govt over boycott of Dalits in Hisar village

The bench directed the concerned senior police officers who are looking into the matter to appear in court with the relevant records on November 8, when it will hear the matter next.

The Supreme Court pulled up the Haryana government on Tuesday over allegations of the boycott of Dalits in Hisar’s Bhatla village for over two years. The court directed the state to file an affidavit by November 8 explaining the steps taken by the administration to deal with the same.

“Social boycott was happening… Your government did nothing… Boycott continuing. What is happening?” Justice N V Ramana, heading a three-judge bench, told the counsel for Haryana when it took up a petition which highlighted the issue.

The bench, also comprising Justices R Subhash Reddy and B R Gavai, termed the issue as “serious”. It also directed the concerned senior police officers who are looking into the matter to appear in court with the relevant records on November 8, when it will hear the matter next.

The petition said the dispute arose on June 15, 2017, when a group of Dalit boys were assaulted by members of the dominant community over the use of a hand-pump for drawing water.

It sought a direction to the Haryana government to “immediately put an end to the social boycott imposed by the dominant community since July 2, 2017, inter alia, and punish all those responsible for the social boycott by imposition of a collective fine on the dominant community….”
