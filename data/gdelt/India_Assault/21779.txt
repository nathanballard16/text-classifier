Congress slams BJP for under-utilisation of Nirbhaya fund in Jharkhand

RANCHI: Congress spokesperson Lal Kishore Nath Shahdeo has accused the Raghubar Das government of being apathetic for its under-utilisation of Central funds meant for women’s safety. “Non-use of funds once again justifies that for BJP, their slogan of beti bachao, beti padhao (save girl, educate girl) continues to be a jumla,” he added.Recently, the Union Minister of Women and Child Development, Smriti Irani, in Rajya Sabha had said that more than 50% of the Nirbhaya fund remains underutilised throughout the country and in Jharkhand , out of the total allocated fund of Rs 15.91 crore, only Rs 4 crore has been used. The Nirbhaya fund was created during the UPA-II rule for projects related to women’s safety following the 2012 gang rape of a medical student in New Delhi.Smriti added that the scheme-wise break-up of the Mahila Police Volunteer Scheme showed that not a single penny was used out of the Rs 2.64 lakh allocated to Jharkhand. She further said that under the One Stop Centre scheme, only Rs 48 lakh has been used in Jharkhnad out of the allocated Rs 10.78 crore and under the Women Helpline scheme, a meagre Rs 23,000 was used out of the Rs 34.54 lakh allocated for the state.Speaking about the gang-rape of a law student in Kanke last month, Shahdeo said, “Last month, a law student was gang raped in Kanke, which is only a few kilometres away from Das’s official residence. A few days back, battered bodies of two minor girls were found from a forest in Piparwar in Chatra district, which triggered violent protests. In the last five years, over 5,200 cases of rape have been reported in different police stations across the state and over 6,300 molestation cases were reported. These are no small figures for a tiny state like Jharkhand.”
