Pune: A 24-year-old journalist from Jammu & Kashmir has said the assault on him by a mob was not an organized one even as the local police have called it an incident of road rage. Jibran Nazir, who works with a leading daily in Pune, said the assailants told him that they would "send him back to Kashmir" and asked him to pursue his journalism in the Valley. Police Friday said the journalist was thrashed by two men Thursday night during a squabble at a traffic signal. Nazir said when he told the attackers that he was from Kashmir; they got aggressive and beat him up more. He claimed that the men were drunk and fled the spot after realizing that he actually was a journalist.
