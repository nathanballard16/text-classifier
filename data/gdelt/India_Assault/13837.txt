Happy 73rd Independence Day: Freedom in 73 Pictures

India has been home to several ancient civilisations and empires, some dating back to more than 2,000 BC. Culture and religions have flourished over the millennia, and foreign influence has ebbed and flowed. The image above shows the repulse of a sortie during the Siege of Delhi, a conflict of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The rebels advance on a British battery, who repel them with swords, bayonets and rifles. A lithograph by E Walker, after a drawing by Captain GF Atkinson. (Image: Getty Images)
