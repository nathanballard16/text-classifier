Chennai: Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict Nalini Sriharan on Monday moved the Madras High Court seeking direction to the Governor of Tamil Nadu to approve the state government's recommendation regarding the release of all seven convicts.

In September last year, the Tamil Nadu government had recommended the release of all seven convicts to the governor under article 161 of the Constitution. The resolution was passed in a meeting chaired by Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.

Under Article 161, the governor can pardon a person who has been proved guilty in court.

Earlier in February this year, Sriharan wrote a letter to CM Palaniswami urging him to release all the convicts at an early date given the fact that the Cabinet's recommendation has already been made.

Sriharan then sat on a hunger strike in the Vellore prison on Saturday demanding the release of all seven convicts in the case. She began a fast in solidarity with her husband Murugan who was then an indefinite hunger strike.

The seven convicts lodged in prison since 1991 include- Nalini Sriharan, Murugan aka Sriharan, Jayakumar, Santhan, Robert Payas, Ravichandaran and Perarivalan aka Arivu.

Earlier, Sriharan had also written to Governor Banwarilal Purohit expressing disappointment over delay in making a decision to release the prisoners in the case.
