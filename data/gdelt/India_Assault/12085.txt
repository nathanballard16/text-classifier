Bombs at Trinamul workers' houses

ABVP activists allegedly beat up the father of a TMCP activist after failing to find him

The ABVP activists also allegedly beat up the father of a Trinamul Chhatra Parishad (TMCP) activist after failing to find him.

BJP and ABVP activists on Friday night allegedly hurled bombs at the houses of Trinamul and TMCP workers, hours after a clash at Kalyani College in which at least four students were injured.

Nadia TMCP chief Sourik Mukherjee said: “BJP activists and their goons hurled bombs at the houses of our workers in Kalyani, Gayeshpur and adjacent areas.”

The ABVP’s Nadia president, Ashis Biswas, dismissed the allegations. “The Trinamul leadership is trying to hide facts by staging a drama with the help of police,” he said.

BJP leader Mukul Roy on Saturday evening met the parents of Tarak Haoladar, a students who has suffered severe leg injuries during the bombing at Kalyani College.

Doctors at the private hospital in Calcutta where Tarak is admitted said his condition continued to be critical.
