Ahmedabad, July 9

A Dalit youth had to pay with his life for marrying a high caste Hindu girl in Gandhi’s Gujarat. Haresh Solanki and Urmila Jhala studied together in a college in Kadi, Mehsana district, and fell in love.They had to flee home to get married some six months ago owing to stiff opposition by Urmila’s family. Haresh, 25, hailed from Gandhidham in Kutch.

Shockingly, he was accompanied by volunteers of helpline Abhyam 181 when he was hacked to death by 12 persons, reportedly from Urmila’s village Varmor, Ahmedabad. Some volunteers were also injured.

An FIR filed by Abhyam counsellor Bavika Bhagora, who was among the injured, alleged Haresh approached the organisation for help after Urmila’s family refused to let her go back to her husband. She was sweet-talked into visiting them. They had promised to allow her to leave after the “necessary marriage formalities.”

Six months passed by but her parents refused to let her return following which Haresh approached Abhyam to pick up his wife from her parents’ residence. Last night, as soon as they reached Urmila’s village, they were attacked by 12 persons carrying sharp-edged weapons. Haresh died on the spot. The police arrested one of the assailants. — OC
