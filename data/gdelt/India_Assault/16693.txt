Dussehra, also called Vijayadashami is one of the most desired festivals of Hindus and is widely celebrated all over India with great fervour and fanfare. The festival’s name is derived from the Sanskrit words dasha (“ten”) and hara (“defeat”). After the nine-day celebration of Navratri, Dussehra is celebrated on the 10th day of the month of Ashvina (September–October), the seventh month of the Hindu Calendar, with the appearance of the full moon, an event called the “bright fortnight” (shukla paksha). Dussehra coincides with the culmination of the nine-day Navratri festival and marks the triumph of Rama over the 10 headed demon king Ravana, who abducted Rama’s wife Sita. The festival also incorporates Ram Lila, a gala theatrical enactment of Rama’s life story. Ramlila is the most significant feature of Dussehra Celebration.
