New Delhi: Tehelka magazine founder and rape accused Tarun Tejpal who is facing a trial in 2013 sexual assault case of a junior colleague in a Goa Court, said that "the truth will come out".

Upon asking if the hearings would conclude in the coming six months, Tejpal confidently replied 'yes, it will'. In August this year, the Supreme Court had refused to quash charges against him in the 2013 sexual assault case. Along with it, the bench also lifted the stay of the trial and then it commenced in a Goa court.

Reportedly, the Goa police earlier claimed in the Supreme Court that there were 'contemporaneous' WhatsApp messages and e-mails which showed that Tarun Tejpal should face trial in an alleged sexual assault case.

The police, while opposing Tejpal's plea seeking quashing of charges framed against him, told a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra that there was "ample material" warranting a trial in the case. The case was lodged against him by a former woman colleague in 2013 accusing him of raping her in a hotel's elevator. He was charged with rape, sexual harassment and wrongful restraint.

The woman alleged that the incident happened in Goa on November 7, 2013, at the Think Fest- an annual event organised by the magazine. Tejpal's lawyer Vikas Singh contended that the allegations levelled against the senior journalist were tailor-made and an attempt to malign his image.
