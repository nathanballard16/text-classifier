West Bengal: Another BJP Supporter Murdered By Trinamool Goons For Chanting ‘Jai Shri Ram’, Alleges Supriyo

Defending itself against the accusations, the Trinamool Congress said that the death had nothing to do with politics.

Meanwhile, the police had, prima facie, ruled out any political connection to the murder. Sirajul Shiekh, a gram panchayat chief said that the man was drunk and he reportedly misbehaved with a woman, prompting some residents to beat him up.

"Krishna Debnath was attacked late in the evening on 3 July when he was returning home. Later, he was found in a pool of blood near a local club. He was rushed to Shantinagar Hospital locally. His health deteriorated and he was referred to NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata where he died on Friday. On Saturday, local BJP leadership held a road blockade with the body in the area," said a police officer said on the condition of anonymity.
