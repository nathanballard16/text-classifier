Lucknow Dec 05: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Thursday questioned the claims of Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath on the law and order situation after a rape victim was set on fire in Unnao.

"Yesterday the home minister of the country and the Uttar Pradesh chief minister clearly lied that law and order in Uttar Pradesh has become better. Seeing such incidents everyday anger the mind. BJP leaders should now come out of false propaganda," Gandhi said in a tweet.

The Congress leader also tagged a news report of the incident in which a rape victim from Unnao in Uttar Pradesh was allegedly set ablaze early on Thursday morning by five men.

The incident happened when the accused, out on bail, took the 20-year-old woman, and his friends outside her village and into the fields and doused her in petrol before setting her on fire.
