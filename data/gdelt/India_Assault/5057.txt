Another Hyderabadi confirmed dead in Christchurch mosques shooting

Hyderabad-based Ozair Khadir was named among the five Indians killed in Friday's terror attack at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Khadir, a resident of Noor Khan Bazar in Hyderabad, had gone to New Zealand to complete his education. The 25-year-old was a student of the Aviation College and an aspiring commercial pilot.

Khadir's family was in search of him since the terror attack occurred in Al Noor mosque. He was confirmed dead by the Indian High Commission in New Zealand a day after the attack.

On Saturday, Farhaj Ahsan, also a native of Hyderabad, was confirmed to have died in the terror attack.

The death toll in Friday's terror attacks at two mosques in Christchurch rose to 50 with victims ranging in age from two years to over 60 years, New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush said on Sunday. He also informed that 50 people were wounded in the mass shootings.

Giving out details of those injured, Bush said that 36 of them are undergoing treatment at Christchurch Hospital and three persons, including a child, remain critical at Auckland's Starship Hospital, New Zealand Herald reported.
