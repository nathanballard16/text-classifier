After her own rape, author says victims of sexual violence are more than ‘broken beings’

Sohaila Abdulali:

We make it bigger than it should be, and at the same time, we make it smaller than it should be. It's such a loaded subject.

If you think of one person, say in a bedroom, being raped by one man, a woman and a man, it's a very personal act at that moment. But then you sort of pull back the camera, and you see the world and all that things that have led to this. It's much bigger.

So I think it is wrong any time we try to make it too much with one lens, in a way. I think we do disservice to both men and women the way we think about rape. We assume that men can't help themselves, and we also assume that women are completely broken and destroyed, which sometimes they are, but often they're not.
