Ludhiana: The defence counsels concluded the cross examination of the Issewal gangrape victim during the hearing of the case in a local court on Tuesday. The court of Additional Sessions Judge Rashmi Sharma has now fixed October 10 as the next date of hearing.

The defence counsel said now the trial court would send the report of the testimony of the prosecutrix to Punjab and Haryana high court where the bail plea of one of the accused, who claimed to be a juvenile, was pending before the court. Before taking a decision on the bail plea of the accused, the court would go through the report, he said.

He said the defence counsels might start the cross examination of the friend of the prosecutrix on the next date of hearing. The trial court has to also decide on the revision petition filed by the juvenile as to whether he was to be tried with other accused or by the Juvenile Justice Board.

Special public prosecutor for the state B D Gupta has averred that the prosecutrix has fully supported the case of prosecution.

The defence counsel for the accused claiming to be a juvenile said as per the matriculation certificate, he was born in April 2002 and at the time of offence he was not even 17-year-old.

On February 9, a group of miscreants had allegedly gang raped a 20-year-old student after holding her and her friend hostage at Issewal. The police had booked 10 unidentified persons in the case and later arrested six accused.
