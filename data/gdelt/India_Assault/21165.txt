Police arrested Ravirajsinh Gohel and his 17-year-old accomplice for pelting stones on the statue after booking them for hurting religious sentiments of a community.

“After the alleged incident, hundreds of Dalits from Ambedkarnagar gathered at the site, threatening law and order. We rushed to the spot and tried to pacify the crowd. We assured them of action against the guilty and checked the CCTV footage of the incident, in which we found Gohel and his accomplice,” said J V Dhola, inspector with Malaviyanagar police station.

The accused were booked on the complaint of Jayesh Parmar (32), a resident of Ambedkarnagar.
