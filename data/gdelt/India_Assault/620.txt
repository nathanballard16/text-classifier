Hyderabad: In a shocking incident, a 16-year-old girl was allegedly repeatedly raped for four years by 11 people in Hyderabad’s Murali Nagar. The victim has accused one of her relatives of giving her a soft drink spiked with sedatives and subsequently raping her in 2015. The relative has been identified as Raju, who is the victim’s cousin.

The girl in her complaint alleged that her relative, who was then staying with her family, told the incident to two of his friends, who also joined in to sexually exploit her on multiple occasions over the years. The three allegedly made some videos of the shameful act and had also blackmailed her to give in to their demands.

The minor girl’s ordeal, who is said to be a student of Class 12, didn’t stop here. The 16-year-old student has informed the Hyderabad Police that besides the above mentioned three accused, she was raped by eight others, including a `panch' witness.

Following a formal complaint by the victim, police have arrested three persons, including the relative of the alleged rape victim on December 31. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Charminar Division) B Anjaiah has confirmed the arrests.

Among the eight more accused, one is a `panch' witness (a witness used by police to sign on crime spot inspection reports). The girl's ordeal was compounded over the years and she also alleged that she was made to take pills in order to avoid pregnancy.

After a demonstration was held in the Kamatipura area on Sunday, Hyderabad Police Commissioner Anjani Kumar has entrusted the sensational case to Assistant Commissioner of Police K Sridevi.
