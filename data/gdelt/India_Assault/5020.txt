Youth arrested for sexual abuse, blackmail in TN

Chennai, March 16 : Even as the Pollachi sexual abuse-cum-blackmail case continues to be a burning issue, a taxi driver was arrested in Tamil Nadu's Nagapattinam on a similar charge, police said.

Sundar, a taxi driver, befriended a girl working in a shop in Nagapattinam district, around 320 km from here. After some time, he took the girl to a hotel room in Karaikal in Puducherry and laced her cold drink with a sedative and sexually assaulted her, police said.

As she was threatened by Sundar, the girl lodged a complaint and the police took him into custody.

In Pollachi, also in Tamil Nadu, four youths -- Thirunavukkarasu, Sathish, Sabarirajan, Vasanthakumar -- have been accused of assaulting women and filming their act to blackmail them for money or for physical submission for over seven years.
