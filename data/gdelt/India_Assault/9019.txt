Article 15: The trailer of Ayushmann Khurrana’s cop drama film is both captivating and chilling

The build-up to Ayushmann Khurrana’s upcoming release - Article 15 - has been an enlightening and engaging affair. The actor released the first look of the film – showcasing him as a cop – back in April, and his since followed it up with two interesting teasers.

While the first teaser introduced us to the subject of the film, the second one left us pondering over why a film battling social and judicial injustices based on one’s caste, creed or religion is the need of the hour.

The second teaser of the film was released this morning – under the guise of the official trailer. The 43-second teaser opens with the same frame as the first teaser, but in the next few seconds, Khurrana tells us that we’re not eligible to watch the trailer because of our caste, creed and religion. As we gulp down Khurrana’s harsh words, he asks us how we feel after hearing these words, asking are we hurt? He goes on to elaborate that a lot of people in India feel the same way every day and lets us ponder on it.
