He was suspended from the post with immediate effect by the Bishop of Mananthavady.

The Priest of Catholic Diocese of Mananthavady was accused of raping a minor who was a school student and attempting to destroy evidence of the crime. The case had become a challenge for the investigating authorities with even the parents of the survivor refusing to give a statement against the priest.

While the main accused along with others who helped him cover up the crime have been arrested, two more nuns surrendered before the police on Thursday but were let off on bail.
