Chennai police arrange an air ticket for stranded Sudanese youth

He landed here 6 months ago and was hoping to find a temporary job

A Sudanese national, who had made Marina beach his home, returned to his country on Saturday, thanks to the Chennai city police who played the role of a Good Samaritan. They arranged plane tickets for the youth, who also spent four months in jail.

Mohammed Al Mustafa, 22, came to the State for higher studies. He joined a three-year course at a college in Nagapattinam. After three years, he went back to his country and came back to clear the arrears with not much money.

He landed here six months ago and was hoping to find a temporary job in Chennai. However, he could not complete the course. He ended up doing menial work and slept at the Marina.

He was arrested by the Marina police after he assaulted a few locals at the beach. He was imprisoned for four months. During his incarceration, his visa expired.

Precarious position

Mr. Mustafa said, “After four months of imprisonment, I came out of prison and continued to make the Marina beach my home. I had no money to pay penalty for overstay or return to my country. I was not able to go back to Nagapattinam to continue my course. I was doing odd jobs in shops and mosques to run my life here.”

A few days ago, the Marina police spotted him on the beach and took him to the police station. They learnt about his imprisonment and his precarious position and passed the information to City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan.

Inspector Jayaraj said, “Following instructions from the Commissioner, we made arrangements for his return journey. The Foreigners Regional Registration Office readily approved the exit and a philanthropist came forward to meet the air travel expenses.”
