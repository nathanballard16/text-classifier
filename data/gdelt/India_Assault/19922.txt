New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party MP from West Bengal, Locket Chatterjee, on Friday hailed the encounter by Telangana Police where four rape accused were killed in the dead of the night, and said that such police encounters should be made “legal”.

“This is a very good step taken for our country... I felt really good when I read this news in the morning. The soul of the rape victim must be at peace now. Her family must be at peace. Such encounters should be made legal,” news agency ANI quoted Chatterjee as saying.

The accused were shot dead early morning today around 2-3 am by the Cyberabad Police when they tried to escape and fired at the cops while being taken to the site of crime to recreate the entire scene.

“If something of this sort happens, then the culprits should be hanged to death or killed in an encounter within seven to fifteen days. I thank Hyderabad Police for the encounter carried out today,” Chatterjee said.

According to the police, all the four accused were being taken to the scene of the crime, where the charred body of the doctor was found, when they allegedly attempted to escape and were later killed in the encounter.

The veterinarian woman was brutally gang-raped and murdered by the four accused before they burnt her body on November 27 in Shamshabad. All four accused were lodged at the high-profile Cherlapally Central Jail in Hyderabad.
