What the Madras HC held on the limited Jurisdiction of the Police Complaints Authority

… the power to give a direction to register an FIR or to transfer investigation or to complete the investigation within a particular period or to alter the offence or to direct further investigation or to file a further report, are all falls within the jurisdiction of competent Court, as prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure. These powers can never be exercised by the Police Complainants Authority since by exercising such a power, it exceeds its authority and jurisdiction and starts acting like an alternate Court of law.”
