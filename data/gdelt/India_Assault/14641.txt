Brothers held for 'abducting', marrying Kashmiri sisters

PATNA: Two youths from Bihar 's Supaul district were arrested on Wednesday for allegedly abducting two Kashmiri girls and marrying them after abrogation of Article 35A on August 5. The girls, stated to be sisters, were recovered from Rambishunpur village in Supaul after locals informed police.Article 35A bars a woman belonging to J&K from all property rights if she marries a person from outside the state. So, if their marriages were consummated after abrogation of Article 35A, the girls' rights to property cannot be denied. The parents apparently were against this.Police said brothers Parvez Alam and Mohammad Wasim - both residents of Rambishunpur village in Supaul district - had allegedly eloped with Sania and Naheeda Yusuf. On August 24, the girls' father lodged a case against the youths. Supaul SP Mritunjay Kumar Choudhary said both of them were arrested and booked for kidnapping.The girls told police that they fell in love with Parvez and Wasim. "The youths got married in a court before leaving for their village," an officer said. Parvez and Wasim pleaded innocence.
