Jailed BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar Finally Expelled From Party

New Delhi: In a major development, the Bharatiya Janata Party on Thrusday expelled Unnao rape accused and MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar from party. An official announcement regarding this will be made soon, reports said. Sengar, a four-time legislator, has been accused by the now 19-year-old woman of raping her at his residence in 2017 when she was a minor. The rape case was filed against the Bangermau MLA after the woman tried to set her ablaze outside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath's residence in April last year. The rape victim, her lawyer and two aunts were returning from Rae Bareli to Unnao last Sunday when a truck with a blackened registration plate cut across the road and rammed the car they were travelling in, leaving the teen and her lawyer grievously injured and her two aunts dead.
