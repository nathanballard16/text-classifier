Pakistani prisoner, stoned to death in Indian jail, laid to rest

SIALKOT: Shakirullah, a Pakistani prisoner who was stoned to death by other inmates in an Indian prison, was laid to rest in his village Jasarwala on Sunday.

The Pakistani inmate's funeral prayers were offered in Daska, Sialkot today.



Shakirullah’s body was handed over by India to Pakistan at the Wagah Border on Saturday. He was murdered while in captivity at Rajasthan’s Jaipur Central Jail last month, after India levelled baseless allegations against Pakistan of involvement in the Pulwama attack in occupied Kashmir.

He had been in the Indian jail since 2001.

Pakistan had lodged its protest with India after the inspector general of police (IG) for Rajasthan and in-charge of prisons Kapil Garg confirmed the news of Shakirullah's murder on February 20.

The Pakistani prisoner had been eight years into a life term when he was attacked at the Jaipur central jail. He was stoned to death following a quarrel, Garg told AFP.

The deceased's family maintained that the late Shakirullah was not mentally fit and crossed Indian territory by mistake during his visit to Shakargarh to visit a festival.

The Pakistan Foreign Office has objected over India's no response to Pakistan's request for a 'post-mortem-judicial' inquiry into the incident.
