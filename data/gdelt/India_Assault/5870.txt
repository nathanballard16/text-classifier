Three Pakistan Army soldiers killed in Indian shelling across LoC

Three Pakistan Army soldiers have been killed by Indian shells fired across the Line of Control (LoC) in Rawalkot.

The Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) identified the martyred soldiers as Subedar Mohammad Riaz, Lance Havaldar Aziz Ullah and Sepoy Shahid Mansib.

In a statement addressing the incident, the ISPR said: “Three brave son of soil laid their lives in the line of duty. Indian troops resorted to unprovoked fire in Rakhchakri, Rawalakot Sector along Line of Control (LoC).”

The military’s media wing said that one other soldier was injured in the shelling on Tuesday, adding that the Pakistan Army responded effectively and that there were reports of casualties on the Indian side of the LoC.

A day earlier, an elderly man was killed by Indian shelling across the LoC into Pakistan occupied Kashmir.

Five others were wounded in the Nezapir area, officials claimed.

The shelling came amid heightened tension in Kashmir after a suicide attack killed at least 40 Indian personnel in Pulwama, followed by India’s violation of Pakistani airspace on February 26.

After the IAF violation, Pakistan claimed to have shot down two Indian fighter jets.

A captured Indian pilot was then returned to India as a gesture of peace.

In the wake of the Pulwama attack, the government in Pakistan said it had renewed its crackdown on armed groups operating in Kashmir.
