Border Security Force (BSF) jawan Mohammad Ramzan Parray was gunned down inside his home in Kashmir's Bandipora while he was on a vacation.

Parray will now be decorated with the Police Medal for Gallantry (PMG) on Republic Day, posthumously.

Parray, whose life ended in his 20s, had joined the Border Security Force in 2011.

The jawan was killed by militants in 2017 while he was on leave and was visiting his family back home in North Kashmir. When Parray was killed by militants, it underlined the threat faced by Kashmir Police, paramilitary and defence personnel when they are on leave and went back to their homes for festivals.

Parray, his citation said, bravely thwarted a bid by the militants to abduct him but they later barged into his home in Hajin village of Bandipora district and shot him from a point blank range.

He later succumbed to injuries.

PARRAY'S VACATION

Parray was deployed with the 73rd battalion team of Border Security Force.

According to a report, Parray joined the force, which is primarily deployed along India's border with Pakistan and Bangladesh, over half a decade ago.

PARRAY'S DEATH

In September, 2017, the terrorists made an attempt to kidnap Parray. His family resisted the attempt and it was then when the terrorists opened fire on his family as well.

According to a few eyewitnesses, the terrorists also thrashed Parray before shooting him down. According to reports, the terrorists dragged him out of the house but when they realised they would not be able to kidnap him due to the resistance, they opened fire.

The unarmed jawan of the Border Security Force died on the spot.
