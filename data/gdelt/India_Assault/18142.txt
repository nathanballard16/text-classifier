Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Friday held the Modi government responsible for taking away livelihoods through demonetisation and said her party will ensure that the nation never forgets or forgives the 'Tughlaqi' blunder.

In a scathing attack, the Congress president said, "The PM and his colleagues have never taken responsibility for the faux pas that claimed over 120 lives and proved a death knell for India's medium and small businesses. No matter how much the Modi government may try and evade responsibility for this ludicrous and short-sighted measure, the nation and its people will ensure that they are held accountable," she said in a statement.

Former party president Rahul Gandhi also attacked the Modi government. "It's 3 years since the demonetisation terror attack that devastated the Indian economy, taking many lives, wiping out lakhs of small businesses and leaving millions of Indians unemployed," he said in a tweet.

The party's UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the BJP for claiming that 'demonetisation was a slayer of all evils, saying it proved to be a disaster that has all but destroyed the economy'.

The Congress party's youth wing also staged a protest at RBI office in the Capital on Friday.

The Congress president alleged that objectives of the exercise have not been achieved. "PM has failed spectacularly on promises made to the nation on November 8, 2016 to wipe out black money, eliminate fake currency and purge terrorism and Naxalism," she said.

She further added that the RBI has confirmed that 99.3% of all the devalued currency notes has been re-deposited with zero windfall gain.
