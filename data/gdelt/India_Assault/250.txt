IIT-Guwahati teacher held for rape bid

Action follows a complaint from an insurance agent

An assistant professor of mathematics at the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati (IIT-G) was arrested on Saturday for allegedly attempting to rape a woman, who visited him from Kolkata.

The police said K.V. Srikanth was picked up on Friday after the woman, an insurance agent, filed a complaint at the Gauripur outpost near the institute.

“We registered a case under Sections 354A (related to sexual harassment) and 354B (assault or use of criminal force on woman with intent to disrobe) of the Indian Penal Code. The victim said in the FIR that the teacher had attempted to rape her,” a Kamrup district police officer said.

The IIT-G authorities said the woman, who had come to the campus before going out with Mr. Srikanth in a car on Friday, did not lodge any complaint with them. “We received information about the arrest of the assistant professor today [on Saturday]. We are waiting for the legal proceedings,” Labanu Konwar, the institute’s spokesperson, said.
