Judge records Unnao rape survivor’s statement at AIIMS

A temporary court was set up at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) on Wednesday to record the statement of the Unnao victim who is undergoing treatment at the hospital.

Special Judge Dharmesh Sharma recorded the statement of a teen in the case of alleged sexual assault by politician Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a former BJP MLA.

Sengar was also brought to the AIIMS from the Tihar jail for the court hearing.

The teen from Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao has been in hospital since July, after a truck hit the car she was travelling in, killing two of her aunts.

Special security arrangements were made by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inside the hospital premises.

Last week, the Delhi High Court issued a formal order allowing special judge Dharmesh Sharma to hold court to record the testimony of the rape survivor at the All India Institute of Medical Science (AIIMS) Trauma Centre.

The victim was air-lifted from a Lucknow hospital to Delhi on the Supreme Court orders.

On August 1, the Supreme Court transferred all cases linked to Unnao rape victim from Uttar Pradesh to Delhi.

The BJP expelled Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a four-time MLA, days after the rape survivor, her lawyer were critically injured and two of her aunts including one who was a witness to the crime were killed in the accident.
