Domestic help booked for robbery in employer’s house

Ludhiana: Division 8 police have booked a domestic help — hired a week ago without police verification — and his unidentified accomplices for executing a burglary at his employer’s house in Tagore Nagar on Friday. The family had gone to Dubai on Wednesday to shop for a wedding in their family.

On Thursday, the domestic help — Krishan of Nepal — first gave sedative-laced food to another domestic help, Raju. Then, he and his unidentified accomplices executed the burglary in the house and escaped in their Volkswagen Polo car. The matter came to light when another maid came to the house around 4pm and raised an alarm. Thereafter, police reached the spot and contacted the house-owner who had reached Dubai on Thursday.

The investigating officer from Division 8 police station said house-owner Navneet Gupta returned to Ludhiana on Friday, and gave a statement that Rs4 lakh in cash, some gold jewellery, and a car was stolen. It may be mentioned here that CCTVs were installed in the house, but the ASI said the software connected to the CCTVs was not updated, as it was showing a year-old recording.

Meanwhile, an FIR has been lodged against Krishan and other unidentified accused under sections 381 (theft by clerk or servant of property in possession of master), 328 (causing hurt by means of poison etc with intent to commit on offence), and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intension) of the IPC.
