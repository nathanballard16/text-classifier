Rajkot: 45-year-old man forces minor into unnatural sex

RAJKOT: A 45-year-old man forced an eight-year-old girl into unnatural sex in Popatpara locality of Rajkot on Wednesday.The accused, identified as Shamji Koli, was arrested on Thursday, after the girl’s parents lodged a rape complaint with the Rajkot women’s police station.According to the details of the case, the accused lured the girl to his house with the promise of getting her biscuits.“A girl from the survivor’s neighbourhood had not come to school, which is located near their houses. At this, the class teacher asked her to go to the girl’s house and bring her. But when she went there, Koli, who is the girl’s uncle, was alone at home and allegedly lured her into his room and committed the crime,” said N B Dodiya, sub-inspector with Rajkot women’s police station.When neither she, nor the other girl reached school for a long time, the teacher went to Koli’s house to inquire. However, after committing the crime, Koli had already dressed up the survivor and sent her back to school. So, when the teacher came, Koli said that she had already left. Koli is married and works as a labourer.The teacher then went to the survivor’s house, but when the mother learnt that her child was not in school, she panicked and reached the school along with the teacher and found the survivor there. She narrated her ordeal to her mother, who immediately called for her husband, who is a labourer. Together they lodged a complaint against Koli, who went absconding.The police could find him only on Thursday morning from near his house from where they arrested him.“The survivor alleged that the accused had beaten her up after committing the crime and threatened to kill her if she complained about the incident to anyone,” Dodiya added.Koli was booked under 376 (2) (I), 377, 354 (A), 323, 506 (2) sections of Indian Penal Code and under various sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso).
