Delhi High Court seeks ED’s response on lobbyist Deepak Talwar’s plea

The Delhi High Court on Tuesday sought a response from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) on a plea by alleged lobbyist Deepak Talwar challenging his detention by agencies after he was deported from the UAE last week.

A bench of Justice Siddharth Mridul and Justice Sangita Dhingra Sehgal issued notice to the ED and directed it to file a response to the petition by February 11.

Senior advocate Mukul Rohatgi, appearing for Talwar, contended that his client was abducted from Dubai and handed over to Indian authorities.

ED counsel Amit Mahajan sought time to respond to the plea.

The court listed the matter for further hearing on February 12.

Talwar has been charged with criminal conspiracy, forgery and under various other sections of the FCRA for diverting Rs 90.72 crore worth of foreign funds.

He was booked by the ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in criminal cases of corruption.
