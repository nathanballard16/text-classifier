Earlier in the day, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a case against rape accused and suspended BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, his brother Manoj Singh Sengar and eight others in connection with the accident.

The case was handed over to the CBI yesterday after a formal request was made by the state government to the Centre for a probe by the agency.

On July 28, the Unnao rape survivor was on her way to Raebareli when a truck rammed into the vehicle in which she was travelling with her two aunts and a lawyer. Her aunts succumbed to injuries.

The Unnao rape survivor and her lawyer, who were seriously injured, are currently being treated at King George's Medical University trauma centre in Lucknow. Their condition is said to be critical.

The teenager was allegedly raped by Kuldeep Sengar at his residence in Unnao on June 4, 2017, where she had gone seeking a job.

The legislator was arrested by the CBI last year and is currently lodged in Sitapur district jail.
