Saints wearing robes inside temple committing rape: Ex CM

Bhopal: People wearing saffron robes inside temples selling churan are committing rapes said former Madhya Pradesh CM Digivijay Singh today sparking a whole new controversy.

Addressing the Sant Samagam event oragnised by the Madhya Pradesh Adhyatmik Vibhag Spiritual Department in Bhopal, former CM said: “Even God will not spare those who have defamed the ancient Sanatana Dharma. People wearing saffron robes are committing rapes inside temples and selling churan,” India today reports.

The controversial statement was made in the presence of Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath.

He further added ‘Jai Shri Ram’ slogan has been hijacked by those with political interests who use this slogan instead of Jai Siya Ram.

“The slogan should, in fact, be Jai Siya Ram. When we raise the slogan in the name of Lord Ram, why do we forget Sita?,” Digvijaya Singh said.

The event was attended by saints from across the state led by Narmada Mandakini trust chairman Computer Baba who had participated in the event too.

Computer Baba demanded allotment of government land on which temples have been constructed in the names of those running them.

“The temples should also be given free electricity and saints should be given old-age pension,” Computer Baba said.

MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath said, “We give land to industrialists and traders, why will we not give land to sadhus? In the future, the saints will not have to raise such demands.”
