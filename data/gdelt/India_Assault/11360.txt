Delhi: Group of men rapes 17-year-old, chops off her hair. Police debate which station case will go to

A 17-year-old girl was gangraped by five men at two different places in Sagarpur in Delhi's South District. When the girl resisted, the accused thrashed her and chopped her hair.

Two of the five accused were friends of the victim's brother, reported the Dainik Bhaskar.

The incident, that took place last week, also brought out the police apathy. When the relatives of the victim went to the police station, instead of lodging a case, the police were busy deciding under which station's jurisdiction the case would fall.
