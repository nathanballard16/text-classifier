Srinagar, Feb 22

Traders lowered their shutters on Friday afternoon in Lal Chowk and the adjoining markets as a mark of protest against a string of attacks on Kashmiris in several parts of India from past one week in the aftermath of Pulwama attack.

An eye witness said as soon as clock struck 3:30 pm, the shopkeepers downed their shutters in the commercial hub of Srinagar city to protest attacks and harassment of Kashmiris outside.

The traders also took out a protest march to condemn the attacks and demand security for Kashmiris residing and studying outside.

Carrying banners and placards, the protesting traders denounced the attacks on Kashmiri students and traders in some parts of India. They sought stringent punishment against the miscreants and goons who according to them assault Kashmiris in broad day light. (CNS)
