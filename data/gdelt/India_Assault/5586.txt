IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman back to his squadron in Srinagar

Though being on a four-week leave, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, captured by Pakistan last month and returned India after two days, has returned to his squadron in Srinagar, said official sources.

He preferred to stay with his squadron in Srinagar than going back to his family in Chennai, added they.

After completing his two-week debriefing, after returning from Pakistan, the IAF pilot went on leave around 12 days ago.

“Varthaman could have gone to his family home in Chennai to spend time with his parents. But he chose to go to Srinagar where his squadron is based,” the sources said.

After his leave period, his fitness will be reviewed by a medical board to help him decide whether he can return to fighter cockpit as desired by him.

Varthaman was captured by the Pakistan Army on February 27 after his Mig-21Bison jet was shot down. He downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan before his plane was hit.
