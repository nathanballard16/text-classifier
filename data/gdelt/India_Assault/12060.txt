Designed for women Nirbheek revolver has sold 2500 pieces

New Delhi: After Delhi's gruesome Nirbhaya gang rape that shook the country seven years ago, the Ordnance Factory in Kanpur came out with a light-weight revolver, especially designed for women. Named Nirbheek, to deter recurrence of such a case, the revolver has so far sold around 2,500 pieces mainly in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Against a normal revolver that costs Rs 1 lakh, Nirbheek was launched with Rs 1.20 lakh price tag that went up to Rs 1.40 lakh after inclusion of Goods and Services Tax. Nirbheek can easily aim a target at 10 meters, but the Ordnance Factory claims the revolver comes with an effective range of 15 meters and a 0.32 (7.65mm) bore calibre. Apart from bringing down the weight of the revolver, the Ordnance factory made sure that the women did not have to spend a lot of time on its maintenance.
