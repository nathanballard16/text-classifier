31-yr-old gets 10-yr RI for raping minor

Ludhiana: A local court has sentenced a 31-year-old man to 10 years of rigorous imprisonment for raping a minor in 2013.

A fine of Rs 70,000 has also been imposed on the convict. In case of default in fine payment, he will have to undergo another year of rigorous imprisonment. Of the Rs 70,000 fine, Rs 50,000 would be paid to the survivor as compensation.

On June 23, 2013, police had booked the accused under sections 376 (rape), 377 (unnatural offence), 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC, Section 4 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act and sections 66A, 67A of the Information and Technology Act on the complaint of the survivor’s father.

The teen’s father had told the police that his daughter was pursuing a course from an educational institution in city. “The accused was her classmate. As they became friends, the accused took my daughter along to his rented accommodation on the pretext of picking up his stuff. There, he clicked her objectionable pictures. He then started blackmailing her and threatened to upload those pictures on social media.”

In October 2012, the accused forced her to have physical relations with him. “He sexually assaulted her repeatedly and threatened her against speaking about the incident,” her father added.

Another accused who was named abetter in the case was acquitted as prosecution couldn’t prove his involvement in the case.
