Srinagar, June 18: Three civilians are critical and many others injured after a grenade that terrorists threw at a police station in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama exploded outside on a busy road today.

"Three critically injured civilians have been shifted to hospital in Srinagar for specialised treatment. The area has been surrounded for searches," a police source said.

The attack comes a day after militants targeted an Army convoy with an IED in Pulwama in which 18 soldiers were injured. The injured were rushed to an army hospital in Srinagar where two soldiers succumbed to injuries on Tuesday.

The failed attack comes days after Pakistan informed India of a possible attack in the district near Awantipora.

In another incident, an Army Major was killed in a gunbattle in Anantnag district on Monday. The officer killed in the gunbattle was identified as Major Ketan Sharma (31) of 19 Rashtriya Rifles - his family is in Meerut.

A militant, who is suspected to be a foreign national, was also killed in the exchange of fire during a joint security operation in Badoora village of Achabal early morning. Two other Army officers were injured, J&K Police said.
