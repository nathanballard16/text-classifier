Factory worker held for rape bid on minor

Ludhiana: The police on Wednesday claimed to have arrested a factory worker for rape bid on his nine-year-old neighbour.

The minor’s father said in his police complaint, “My daughter was playing outside our house on Monday evening. The accused, a native of Uttar Pradesh who is 20-year-old, took her along on the pretext of giving her eatables. When my daughter returned home at night, she looked terrified. On being asked, she broke down and told that their neighbour tried to violate her and that she escaped from his clutches.”

Her parents, along with the area residents, went to the house of the accused and nabbed him.

He was handed over to the police, who on Tuesday arrested him under section 376 (rape), 511 (punishment for attempting to commit offences punishable with imprisonment for life or other imprisonment) of the Indian Penal Code.
