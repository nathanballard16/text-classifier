Rajkot: A 65-year-old man was stabbed to death by unidentified robbers in Lakhavad Society of Kanbivad locality in Bhavnagar on Wednesday night.

Police said the robbers, whose numbers could not be ascertained, had tied the hands and feet of Dilip Patel before stabbing him multiple times.

“The robbers looted Rs 1.10 lakh cash and gold jewellery worth Rs 28,000,” said an official from Bhavnagar C division police station.

One of Patel’s neighbours happened to pass by his house. As the door was open he peeped inside only to find Patel’s body lying in a pool of blood. The neighbour called up Patel’s nephew Bhavesh who alerted the police.

Patel used to live alone. His estranged wife Asha lived with their son Vishal in Surat. Apart from tying his hands and feet, the robbers had also gagged Patel’s mouth with a piece of cloth. Blood was splattered on the walls of the room.

“We found four blood stained knives and a pair of scissors in the room. It appears that Patel resisted the assassins who could have been more than one person,” added the official.
