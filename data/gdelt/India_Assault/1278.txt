New Delhi: Another appalling rape case surfaced in Delhi when a seven-year-old girl was allegedly molested by a 30-year-old man. The 30-year-old has been accused of attempting to kill a seven-year-old after kidnapping and raping her on the terrace of a Madhu Vihar house in east Delhi.

The accused has been identified as Manish and has been arrested for attempting to kill a girl after he kidnapped and raped her. According to police records, the accused apparently has two rape cases registered under his name Ghazipur and Kalyanpuri . Any confirmation on the same, however, is yet to be received from the police.

According to the Times of India's report, Manish saw the girl leave the house to go to a shop nearby. On seeing the girl, Manish lured her on to the terrace of a house in Madhu Vihar on account of showing her something. On the terrace, he allegedly assaulted her sexually after which the girl raised an alarm. Panicking, Manish tried to muffle her voice but the girl escaped and called out the neighbours.

When the girl caught the attention of the neighbours, Manish made a failed attempt to flee. The neighbours caught him and beat him till the police arrived. Manish has been booked for a case of rape under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act 2012.

This case held resemblence to another rape case which happened in Sahibabad earlier this week. A 15-year-old girl was allegedly raped after being abducted by two boys while going to buy milk. While one of the accused was caught, the other had managed to flee.
