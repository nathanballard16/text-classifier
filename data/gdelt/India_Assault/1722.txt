Regulation at last

Police place barricades to check speeding on a section of Anna Salai around Munro statue

Driving on a one-km wide stretch of Anna Salai, between Madras Gymkhana Club and Island Grounds, has been a breeze for long. Earlier, motorcycle enthusiasts would take advantage of this and race and do stunts on this stretch. Due to this, there had been accidents involving motorcyclists, especially near the statue of Sir Thomas Munro. Complaints of motorists not stopping at the traffic signal would be common. Now, all this has come to an end.

Police have erected a number of steel barricades near the traffic signal to prevent rash driving.

The stretch, maintained by the State Highways Department, had become notorious as petty criminals and robbers were using it as an escape route after committing a crime in business areas such as George Town, Broadway and Evening Bazaar Road, say the police. Complaints of cellphone- and chain-snatching were being frequently registered at police stations in Chintadripet and Triplicane. Accidents had become frequent, especially at night, as motorists coming from Island Ground would not stop at the signal.

To make matters worse, no CCTV cameras are installed between Pallavan House and Island Grounds. “Being an Army-regulated zone, installation of such cameras needs their nod. As a result, we have deployed police personnel to check traffic violations and prevent accidents,” police said. This traffic arrangement would also ensure safety and security of defence establishments including the Army Headquarters. No petty shops and eateries can be found on the stretch as the Army establishment evicts such encroachments immediately. Parking of vehicles is also not allowed.

A team of police personnel is seen patrolling the intersection. Vehicular documents of two-wheelers are being checked. The police say that the surveillance will continue as the road does not have CCTV cameras.
