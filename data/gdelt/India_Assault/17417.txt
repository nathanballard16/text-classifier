Ashfaq and Moinuddin who murdered Kamlesh Tiwari arrested by Gujarat ATS

In a major breakthrough in the Kamlesh Tiwari murder case, Gujarat ATS has nabbed Ashfaq and Moinuddin, the two prime accused in the case from Gujarat-Rajasthan border.

According to a press note released by the Gujarat Police, a team led by DIG ATS Himanshu Shukla and apprehended Ashfaqhussain Jakirhussain Shaikh, who worked as a medical representative in a pharma company and Moinuddin Khurshid Pathan, who worked as a food delivery boy. The duo were caught after they approached their family members after they ran out of the money they had.

The technical and physical surveillance the police had on them led the police to the absconders. The duo was nabbed near the Gujarat-Rajasthan border near Shamlaji.

According to initial police investigation, they have revealed they committed the crime as retribution to the alleged statements of Tiwari against Prophet Muhammad. As per the police statement, the duo were in Nepal till yesterday morning and reached Shahjahanpur before they left for Gujarat.

The duo would be handed over to UP Police for further investigation. Maulana Mohsin Shaikh, Faizan Member and Rashid Pathan were already handed over by the Gujarat ATS to the UP Police for investigation on transit remand.

Tiwari, a former Hindu Mahasabha leader, was assassinated at his Lucknow office by Ashfaq and Moinuddin from Surat. The Uttar Pradesh police and Gujarat ATS sprung into action to blow the lid off a Surat-based Jihadi group that was indoctrinated by one of the accused who planned the murder, Maulana Mohsin Sheikh. Two other conspirators, Rashid Pathan and Faizan have been arrested. While Ashfaq and Moinuddin will be handed over to the UP Police for further investigation, the other three accused have already been sent to UP on transit remand.
