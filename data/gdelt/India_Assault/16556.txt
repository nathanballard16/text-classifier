Unnao victim was gangraped by 3 persons a week after rape by ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar

New Delhi: It seems that the Unnao rape victim did not suffer agony only once when she was a minor. According to the CBI, the victim was gangraped by three people a week after she was allegedly raped by ex-BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in June 2017.

The CBI filed Thursday a chargesheet naming the three men before District Judge Dharmesh Sharma in Delhi’s Tiz Hazari court. The accused named in the chargesheet are Naresh Tiwari, Brijesh Yadav Singh and Shubham Singh. All three are out on bail. The court listed the case for October 10 after the investigative agency sought time to file additional documents and a list of witnesses to be examined.

In the chargesheet, the CBI has said that the woman (then minor) was gangraped by the men June 11, 2017. The incident took place only a week after she was allegedly raped by Kuldeep Singh Sengar, June 4, at his residence.

Kuldeep Sengar is currently in jail, awaiting trial. The woman, who was critically injured in a car crash – which is also under investigation – earlier this year, was recently released from hospital and has alleged a threat to her life.

It should also be stated here that Subhan Singh, who is one of the three accused in the chargesheet is the son of Shashi Singh. Incidentally it was Shahsi Singh who had lured the girl to Kuldeep Sengar’s residence. Shashi is a co-accused in the rape case filed against Sengar.
