DELHI TWP. - A Lansing firefighter faces seven felony counts, including attempted murder, in connection with an apparent domestic incident at his home.

Clyde Davis was placed on unpaid leave from his job after the allegations surfaced on Friday, a spokeswoman for Lansing Mayor Andy Schor said Monday.

Davis was arraigned Friday in 55th District Court on one count each of assault with intent to murder, assault with intent to do great bodily harm, unlawful imprisonment and domestic violence, court records show.

He also faces two counts of felony firearm possession and one count of discharging a firearm in a building, the records say.

Public records show Davis lives on Moorwood Drive in Holt. His LinkedIn profile says he's been with the fire department for more than 10 years

The case is being investigated by the Ingham County Sheriff's Office. Sheriff's officials could not be reached for comment late Monday afternoon, and details of the incident involving Davis were not immediately available.
