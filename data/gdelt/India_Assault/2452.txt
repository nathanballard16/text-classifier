Dhule: Deploring the terror attack on CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Saturday, said that if someone teases new India, it will not let it go unpunished.

Addressing a rally in Maharashtra’s Dhule district, Prime Minister said, there has been outrage among people of the country in the wake of the ghastly attack, adding "it is time for mourning and to show sensitivity and restrain".

On Thursday, at least 40 security personnel lost their lives and several others were injured after a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist rammed an explosive-laden car into a CRPF convoy in Awantipora of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

“The policy of India has been that we never poke anyone, but let me make it clear that if someone teases this new India, it does not let it go unpunished,” he said, warning Pakistan of stern action. He further said that the entire world will now realise that India is a country of new policy and custom.

“Our martyrs, our jawans perform their duties selflessly. We stand by the families of the those who laid their lives for this country,” PM Modi said assuring that each drop of tear of the bereaved families will be avenged.

Earlier today, PM Modi, while addressing a rally in Yavatmal district, said that security forces have been given a free hand to punish the perpetrators of the attack.

"Sacrifice of Pulwama martyrs will not go in vain. Our security forces have been given a free hand to punish the perpetrators of the attack," the Prime Minister said, adding that Pakistan has become synonymous with terrorism.
