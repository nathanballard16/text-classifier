Jaipur: Rajasthan Transport Minister Pratap Singh Khachariyawas on Thursday said that no rape accused will be spared. Describing rape as an act committed by someone with a mental disorder, Khachariyawas said that there is “only one place for culprits of rape in Rajasthan, and that is jail”.

The minister’s statement came after the Rajasthan Police arrested a man for purportedly raping an eight-year-old girl in Alwar district.

The heinous incident was caught on the CCTV cameras installed in the area.

"The man was seen raping a minor girl on CCTV camera. Based on the footage, we identified the accused and arrested him," Superintendent of Police Paris Deshmukh had said on Wednesday.

As per the police, the incident took place around 2 am on October 6 when the man lured the victim from a Durga Puja pandal and then raped her.

The accused has, meanwhile, admitted to the crime.

A case has been filed and police are carrying further investigating the matter.
