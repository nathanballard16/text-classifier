Christian leaders urged to raise voice against Indian oppression in IOK

Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan on Monday urged Christian leaders to raise their voice for the oppressed people of Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) against the rising tide of Hindu nationalism which is an equal threat for Muslims, Christians and other religious minorities in India.While talking to a delegation led by Dr Leif Hetland, founder president of Global Mission Awareness and a US-based organisation of churches around the world, President Masood said that Hindutva ideology — persisting in our neighbourhood India — has become a serious threat to harmony and peaceful co-existence of followers of different religions and faiths, especially after the phenomenon of Islamophobia and Anti-Semitism.The AJK president reiterated that Hindu extremists consider Indian Muslims as aliens and intruders whose very existence was repugnant to the "natural order of Indian society and thus treat them as inferiors"."This kind of belief had previously emerged in Germany under the Nazi regime back in the 20th century and resulted in a disastrous war and holocaust. The same is now being repeated in South Asian region."Appraising the delegation about the latest situation in occupied Kashmir, President Masood said the disputed valley was invaded, reoccupied and blockaded by Indian forces in early August this year. “The Indian army is committing the worst crimes against humanity. Thousands of people — mostly youth — have been illegally arrested by authorities since the Modi government made the controversial move on August 5The detainees, he said, are being subjected to the worst form of torture. "People in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir have been robbed of their rights to settlement, permanent residence, education and health."The AJK president said that the government in New Delhi is not only denying Kashmiris their right to self-determination but also actively promoting persecution and violence against other religious minorities, including Christians, in its bid to impose its extremist ‘Hindutva ideology’.Praising the mission of Dr Leif as noble, President Masood termed him as a man of peace, saying his support to the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir demanding their right to self-determination keeps immense value.The Global Mission Awareness with its 70 million members and a network of 2,000 churches across the world can play an important role in creating awareness about the plight of Kashmiris who is the most victimised population on earth, he added.Appreciating Hetland for his efforts to promote education and interfaith harmony, Masood also credited him for promoting peace and love among the people of different faiths living around the globe.Speaking on the occasion, Dr Leif expressed his grave concern over the deteriorating situation in the disputed territory and condemned the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government and Hindu extremist organisations for targeting Muslims, Christians and other religious minorities in India.“Hindu agenda is affecting the peace in the region and the lives of the followers of all the religions living in India,” he said, adding, "Christians around the world are not fully aware of what is happening in occupied Kashmir and with minorities in India."Others members of the delegation included Dr Marqqus Fida, chairman Global Mission Awareness Pakistan, Fred Vernor Bruner JR and Saeedur Rehman Siddiqui, president Peace Group of Journalists.
