Security stepped up in Mangaluru malls after ugly communal brawl

Mangaluru, Sept 26: The police have stepped up security measures at shopping malls across the city a day after an ugly communal brawl which led to the arrest of three persons including a minor boy.

Yesterday, a handful of people had assaulted a man in a mall for saying 'India is a Hindu Nation and Muslims should not come here.' The incident of the video has gone viral on social media.

The one who provoked the group through communal dialogue has been identified as Santosh, a resident of Bantwal taluk.

The police have arrested three persons for assaulting him. Two among them are Moideen Safwan and Abdul Rahim Saad. The third one is a juvenile.

The police have registered a case against the people who thrashed Santosh and the investigation into the matter is underway.
