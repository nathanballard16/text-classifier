The family of 26-year-old Vijay Singh, who allegedly died in custody at the Wadala TT police station a week ago, has alleged that police ignored his complaints of chest pain.

At a press conference on Sunday, Singh’s family presented their version of events leading to Vijay’s death last Monday. Singh’s cousin Nirmal and friend Ankit Mishra, also brought to the police station with him on suspicion of assaulting a couple; his father Hridaynarayan; and their lawyer Vinay Nair spoke at the press conference.

Nirmal said Vijay was speaking to his fiancee over the phone in Antop Hill on October 27 night when the headlight of his motorcycle fell on a couple. “Ankit and I were some distance away and were about to leave for dinner when we heard the raised voices. It was completely dark and it was only when we got close that we saw the man as well as the woman attacking Vijay and stamping on his chest,” Nirmal said.

At the police station, the officers on duty denied any assistance to Vijay, his cousin said.

The family said Vijay was placed inside the lock-up while the couple registered a case of assault against him. Nirmal said when he protested against this in front of the duty officer, police threw him and Ankit in the lock-up as well.

Even as Vijay’s condition began to deteriorate, the men alleged that police refused to take him to the hospital. “Police claimed that there was no petrol in their car, and that they did not have phone numbers of local ambulance services. In the end, we got two local boys to help us put Vijay in a vehicle and take him to Sion Hospital,” Nirmal said.
