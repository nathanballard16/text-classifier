Running in the Indian election? Get an armoured car

JALANDHAR, India: The mechanics retrofitting cars with blast-resistant doors and bulletproof windshields in a Punjab garage have been flat out of late — elections are looming, and politics can be a dangerous game in India. In the past, prime ministers were assassinated, political motorcades ambushed and party officials attacked, and some candidates aren´t taking any chances.

Orders for specialised armoured cars have been piling up at Sunchit Sobti´s factory in Jalandhar, where his crew have already retrofitted four SUVs for political bigwigs since the upcoming poll — the biggest election in history — was announced a few weeks ago. It´s a pattern that repeats itself every election season, said Sobti, whose father started supplying armoured cars for politicians and other VIP clients in the 1980s when an armed insurgency was raging in Punjab. “This one is the mother of all elections,” he told AFP, as sparks flew from welding equipment on the factory floor. “Like all big events, there are bigger risks involved and leaders want to ensure they are safe. We have been working on orders for months.” It was not just political candidates keen to bullet and blast-proof their cars but party bookkeepers and backroom heavyweights too, he added.

At least seven rival companies contacted by AFP, in northern Punjab, neighbouring Haryana and also Maharashtra state in the west, have also experienced a spike in election-related orders for armour-plated vehicles. The market for such cars in India is worth $150 million a year and growing by double digits, industry representatives said. Companies like Mahindra & Mahindra, and Tata Motors, also offer a small range of pre-made armoured vehicles for civilian use. The outlay is considerable for reinforcing a private vehicle, costing anywhere between $7,000 and $70,000.
