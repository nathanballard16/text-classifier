Deoband clerics oppose triple talaq bill

After the Modi 2.0 government tabled the triple talaq bill in the Parliament on Friday, seeking to make the Islamic practice a crime punishable under the IPC, many clerics in Deoband, Uttar Pradesh, were 'upset' and opposed the bill.

Still, some women in Deoband have welcomed it. Reshma, whose husband gave her talaq through WhatsApp, welcomed the bill as she thinks that women in the community will get justice.

Reshma told India Today TV, "My husband left me and ruined my life. Now, I hope that he and other men like him are punished after this bill is passed."

Other women in Deoband, who are fighting for the cause, also welcomed the move. Meanwhile, the clerics opposed this move by the government, questioning the timing and the intention. They alleged the government was targeting a community in particular.

Maulana Shah Alam claimed, "Only 5 per cent women oppose triple talaq, however, 95 per cent of them support the practice."

Advocate Tahseen Khan told India Today TV, "If a Hindu man tortures his wife, he will be punished for domestic violence, only for one year. However, a Muslim man will be jailed for three years. This bill is contrary to the right of equality."
