New Delhi, Dec 6 : National Commission for Women Chairperson Rekha Sharma has said that the police's 'encounter killing' of the accused in the Hyderabad rape case is "good".

While talking to IANS Sharma said that "It is a good decision on the part of the police," adding "But it is subject to investigation because I wanted that the culprits should have been punished as per the legal process but what police did at that time looking at the circumstances is a good decision".

The four accused in the Hyderabad veterinarian's gang rape and murder case were killed in an 'encounter' early on Friday when they tried to escape as police took them for recreation of the crime scene at the site where the incident occurred.
