Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: Madras HC grants Nalini Sriharan 30-day parole for arranging her daughter's wedding

Nalini Sriharan, convicted in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's assassination in 1991, appeared today in the Madras High Court to seek parole for six months as she intended to make arrangements for her daughter's wedding.

The Court, however, has agreed on a thirty days parole, on condition that during the period, Nalini would not be allowed to meet politicians or interact with the media.

A division bench of Justice M M Sundaresh and Justice M Nirmal Kumar also directed the Tamil Nadu government to finalise the process for her release within ten days.

She was brought to the court amid tight security in compliance with the June 25 order of the bench granting her permission to appear in person and argue on her petition.

According to reports, Nalini, one of the seven convicts in the May 1991 assassination, has been lodged in the Special Prison in Vellore for over 27 years now.

She had earlier in February approached the Court seeking its permission for her personal appearance to argue on the petition seeking six months ordinary leave.

Nalini's argument was that a life convict is entitled to a one-month leave once in two years and since she had never availed such ordinary leave for more than 27 years, she was entitled to take a leave now. She had appealed on February 25 for the six months leave to make arrangements for her daughter's marriage.

Former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated by a Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) suicide bomber during an election rally at Sriperumpudur on May 21, 1991.
