Lucknow, October 5

A Shahjahanpur court today allowed the special investigation team (SIT) to take the voice samples of rape accused Chinmayanand, survivor and three of her friends.

They all are in judicial custody at the district jail. While Chinmayanand is imprisoned on the rape charge, the law student and her three friends are facing charges of extortion. Last week, the SIT had filed a petition, seeking permission to take voice samples of rape accused Swami Chinmayanand and the survivor.

After hearing the counsels, Chief Judicial Magistrate Omvir Singh, who had reserved his order on Friday, gave permission to take the five of them to Lucknow for the purpose.

The samples would be taken to a state forensic laboratory in Lucknow for examination.

The law student's counsel, Anoop Trivedi, said he and others had objected to SIT's application seeking permission to collect the samples, saying that if required, it should have been sought within the stipulated time of 15 days.

In her statement before the court last month, the 23-year-old law student had accused 72-year-old Chinmayanand of blackmailing her into submitting to rape on the basis of a video of her bathing in her hostel. Chinmayanand, in turn, had filed a case against her and her friends for blackmailing and trying to extort Rs 5 crore from him.

Meanwhile, BJP leader and former MLC Jayesh Prasad on Saturday held a press conference, accusing the top Congress leadership of hatching a conspiracy to defame the Yogi Adityanath government in connection with the case.

“The top leadership of the Congress has been working on a plan since the past few months to defame the government. I have proof to prove my point,” said Jayesh, who is the cousin of Congress leader and former Union Minister Jitin Prasad.
