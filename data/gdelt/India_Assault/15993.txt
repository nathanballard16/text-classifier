Chinmayanand hospitalised days after his arrest

New Delhi: Days after he was arrested and sent to 14 days judicial custody, former Union Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Chinmayanand was shifted to Lucknow’s Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences from Shahjahanpur early on Monday morning after he complained of pain in the chest.

Sources said he has been admitted to the Cardiology Department and will undergo angiography. According to doctors treating him, Chinmayanand has a blockage in heart and is a patient of diabetes and hyper tension. He had been briefly hospitalised in Shahjahanpur last week following severe diarrhoea.

Meanwhile, the Special Investigation Team (SIT) has submitted its status report in the case to a special two-member bench of the Allahabad High Court. The SIT submitted the progress report in three sealed envelopes along with the pen drive and other evidences in the case.

The SIT is accompanied by the law student, who has accused Chinmayanand of rape and blackmail, and may also press for her arrest in the case. (IANS)
