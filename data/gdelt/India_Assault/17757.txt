I was writing specifically about the US.

Interesting! Another site I looked up, with an article listed ten days apart form the time of the writing of the article you shared, has different countries, only agreeing on Sweden, Lesotho, Botswana, and Nicaragua being in the top 10, while disagreeing on their placement, and only agreeing on South Africa as the worst.

I’m not sure about Japan, but I’m pretty sure (from a lot of reading on the subject) that rapes are simply not as reported in Turkey and India due to the religions there.

As far as the european countries go, I’m also sure that due to the influx of migrants, rapes have gone up, but are not being reported, either. Certainly the police refuse to prosecute them, but that’s another topic.

I was surprised you said that prostitution is readily available in other countries, comparing them to the U.S., while in fact, it’s literally as easy for a (sick and twisted) guy to find a girl online as it is to order pizza. This is sex trafficking, of course, not legal prostitution, so that just makes the number of unreported rapes go up by thousands every night in the US. Very sick and twisted, the whole thing…

Anyway, thank you for the thoughtful response!
