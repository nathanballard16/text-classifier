Foodgrain trucks torched at Mawlai

SHILLONG: Three parked trucks loaded with foodgrain of Food Corporation of India (FCI) were torched by goons in Mawlai early on Monday morning.

The action appears to be a fallout of the assault of a home guard by four truck drivers hired by an FCI contractor in Khanapara on the night of April 24 leading to his death, police said. The incident had followed an altercation.

The home guard, Disnarlin Lyngdoh Lyngkhoi, hailing from Mawlai Mawroh, was posted at FCI, Khanapara, when the incident took place.

Following this, a meeting was convened by the Joint Action Committee, Mawlai, seeking action against the truck drivers.

East Khasi Hills SP Claudia Lyngwa told reporters that the torched trucks with Assam registration were parked inside the FCI godown in Mawlai.

“Some miscreants threw petrol bombs at the trucks probably from the jungle as CRPF men were guarding the entrance,” she said.

Though as many as 20 trucks were parked inside the compound, only three were damaged in the petrol bomb attack.

“We took control of the situation within half an hour which prevented the fire from spreading to more trucks and the building,” Lyngwa said.

The trucks belonged to the same FCI contractor whose drivers had allegedly caused the death of the home guard personnel.

The SP said police are yet to indentify the perpetrators of the petrol bomb attack though a case has been registered.

The police officer added that the incident would not hamper distribution of foodgrain and “we are also providing additional security in and around the area”.
