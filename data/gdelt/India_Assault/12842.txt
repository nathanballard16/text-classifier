Realising that suspension of MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is not enough, the BJP leadership decided to expel Sengar who is a prime accused in the Unnao rape case. According to reports, an urgent consultation held by BJP top brass in Delhi on Wednesday night with BJP leaders from Uttar Pradesh Swatantra Dev Singh and Sunil Bansal led to Sengar's expulsion. Party realises a suspension is not enough, reports further added.

A letter by the rape survivor and her family to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, sent on 12 July, alleging grave danger to them was taken up by the Supreme Court, four days after the girl was critically injured and two of her aunts died in the crash that her family alleges was planned by Kuldeep Singh Sengar, the man she has accused of rape. Gogoi had sought a report from the top court registry on the delay in bringing the letter to his notice.

Supreme Court will pass order on transfer of all Unnao rape-related cases outside Uttar Pradesh at 2 pm today. Order on compensation to the victim and her family and also whether the victim and her lawyer should be airlifted to AIIMS will be passed at 2 pm.

Supreme Court wants the CBI to complete its investigation into the Unnao survivor's accident case within seven days. CBI said they need a month to conclude the investigation.

Reacting to Sengar's expulsion, UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said that The Uttar Pradesh unit is yet to receive any information on the expulsion of the rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar from the party. He said, "The decision in this regard would have been taken by the top bosses in Delhi. Let me make it clear again that Sengar was suspended from the party the day allegations were levelled against him and BJP never favours a criminal no matter at how strong position he or she is."

The Uttar Pradesh government has also suspended three police personnel, including two women cops, appointed for the security of Unnao rape survivor, reported ANI.

Another team of CBI officers have rushed to Sitapur jail where accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar is lodged. BJP expelled the MLA from the party today.

A team of CBI officers have reached King George's Medical University in Lucknow on Thursday as the Supreme Court asked the central investigating agency to finish the investigation into 29 July accident where the two aunts of the survivor died. One of the aunts (maternal) was cremated on Thursday in Subeha village under heavy police presence.

Earlier this week, the BJP claimed that Sengar had been suspended, but had refused to say when this step was taken. The BJP's announcement emerged hours after severe embarrassment in the Supreme Court for the party's government in Uttar Pradesh.

The BJP's decision to expel Kuldeep Sengar is seen as belated after a year-long saga of police callousness, administrative neglect and bullying by a powerful rape-accused politician. The ruling party has faced intense criticism for not taking any action against the lawmaker for over a year.

Making an emotional appeal at the Supreme Court, amicus curiae V Giri said that the incident IS extremely disturbing and an exemplary compensation should be given to the survivor and her family.

Supreme Court registry has informed CJI Ranjan Gogoi that the delay in dealing with the letter written by the survivor and her family to the CJI was not deliberate. The registry receives more than 5,000 letter petitions a month. Last month, it received 6,800 letter petitions, secretary-general told the Supreme Court on Thursday.

Explaining the delay in delivering letter from the survivor in the Unnao case was not deliberate, the secretary-general told the Supreme Court that letter petitions are screened as per Supreme Court judgment. Registry was in the process of screening when it came to know from reports that the survivor had written to the CJI. The secretary-general of the registry further said that immediately, the letter was traced and placed before Ranjan Gogoi. "The delay was not deliberate," Secretary-General to Supreme Court.

King George Medical University hospital, where the Unnao rape survivor and her lawyer are being treated in Lucknow, said that their condition is critical. "Both are on ventilator. But their condition is stable. A team of experts at KGMU is treating them free of cost," the medical bulletin released by the hospital said.

Solicitor General has informed the Supreme Court bench that the survivor in the Unnao rape case and her lawyer can be shifted to Delhi and there are no medical impediments. Family's consent is paramount, CJI Ranjan Gogoi has been told.

Supreme Court orders transfer of five cases in Unnao rape and accident to a "competent" court in Delhi. Supreme Court also ordered completion of the investigation into accident case in seven days. Kuldeep Singh Sengar has been charged under POCSO and the court said that the probe must be conducted in a steady manner.

The Supreme Court also asked counsel for survivor's family to take their opinion with regard to shifting the survivor to Delhi. A similar opinion is to be sought by the amicus curiae from survivor's lawyer's family who was also injured and is in hospital in Lucknow's KGMU. Uttar Pradesh has also been ordered by the Supreme Court to pay Rs 25 lakh interim compensation to the survivor and her family.

The Supreme Court, pronouncing its order in the Unnao rape and accident case, held that the trial court must hear cases on a day-to-day basis and complete the same within 45 days. The top court also held that trial in four cases, which includes 29 July accident and the gangrape case, to be concluded within 45 days.

Swati Maliwal, the chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women, lauded Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi's order to the CBI to conclude the investigation into the road accident involving the Unnao rape survivor in 7 days. She said, "Kuldeep Sengar is not far from hanging."

Adityanath has often been the target of criticism for the increase in crimes, especially against women , in the state ever since he took charge as the chief minister.

The chairperson of the Delhi Commission for Women, Swati Maliwal slammed the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh, and said that Adityanath "should be ashamed".

He was quoted by ANI as saying, "Probe to be completed within seven days in the accident case, however, as an exception, CBI can take another week, but in no circumstance shall the probe extend beyond a fortnight."

Slamming the Uttar Pradesh government for the poor condition of law and order in the BJP-ruled state, Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi stipulated a time of seven days for the CBI to conclude its investigations into the road accident involving the Unnao rape survivor.

The Supreme Court has ordered an inquiry to be conducted by the secretary-general within seven days, under supervision of a sitting judge of the apex court, who will be nominated by CJI Ranjan Gogoi, into whether there was any lapse or negligence by registry officials in processing the letter of the Unnao rape victim’s mother to Gogoi.

Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra tweeted after the Supreme Court ordered that five cases in Unnao rape and accident to be transferred to Delhi. "Grateful to the SC for taking cognisance of the ‘Jungle Raj’ being unleashed in U.P. Meanwhile, the BJP finally acknowledges having empowered a criminal and takes some action to correct itself and move in the direction of justice for a young woman who has suffered immeasurably. (sic)"

"Truth is law and order willingly kneeled before perpetrators of the crime and now an example needs to be set," he said. On the expulsion of Kuldeep Singh Sengar, Shergill said, that the BJP's decision is a "classic case of 'too little, too late' and mere hogwash to escape answerability regarding government's connivance in sheltering the accused and targeting the victim."

Supreme Court lawyer and Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill told News18 that the horror that the Unnao rape survivor and her family has been subjected to "can never be compensated" by any form of monetary compensation or token gestures of expelling the accused.

The Supreme Court will again hear the matter tomorrow, reports have said. Issues of witness protection will also be examined by the top court tomorrow. In a crucial hearing today, CJI Ranjan Gogoi held that five cases in Unnao rape and accident must be transferred to a "competent" court in Delhi and set 45-day deadline for the trials in these cases to conclude.

CJI Ranjan Gogoi said, 'We have also considered the question of interim compensation to the victim, as an interim measure we direct the Uttar Pradesh government to pay Rs 25 lakh as compensation to the survivor." Besides, the designated judge in Delhi will commence the trial on day-to-day basis and complete the trial within 45 days.

Chief Minister of Delhi Arvind Kejriwal welcomed the Supreme Court decision in the Unnao case and called it a 'landmark order' "This will enhance the faith of people in the judiciary and will serve as a lesson to those who make a mockery of law."

"Had the Supreme Court not interfered, god knows what would have happened to the victim and her family. Amit Shah did not taken any action against the accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar for last two years. Instead, BJP MP Sakshi Maharaj met accused Sengar in jail. Amit Shah, Narendra Modi and Yogi Adityanath stood by the Sengar for two years and continued to lie about his expulsion. Sengar was expelled only after court’s reprimand," she said.

At a press conference, Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev said, "Unnao victim had written to CJI expressing fears despite CBI probe. The victim and her family have been repeatedly drawing attention of authorities towards threat to their life. Today, the Supreme Court and CJI have taken cognisance of matter, we thank them for that."

The rape victim's another aunt, who was also killed in the truck-car collision in Rae Bareli on Sunday, was cremated on the banks of the Ganges in Unnao on Wednesday amid tight security arrangements.

The body of the Unnao rape survivor's aunt, who was killed in an accident in Rae Bareli district, was consigned to flames in her village, about 70 kilometres from Barabanki on Thursday. Her mortal remains were brought to the village in the Subeha area from Lucknow amid tight security.

As directed by the apex court, the Unnao district magistrate has issued a compensation cheque of Rs 25 lakh in the name of rape survivor. The cheque will be given to the survivor's mother through Lucknow district magistrate.

The girl had said that she was sexually assaulted by the politician when she went to his home to seek a job in 2017. Her father died in custody, arrested for allegedly possessing illegal arms.

Realising that suspension of MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar is not enough, the BJP leadership decided to expel Sengar who is a prime accused in the Unnao rape case. According to reports, an urgent consultation held by BJP top brass in Delhi on Wednesday night with BJP leaders from Uttar Pradesh Swatantra Dev Singh and Sunil Bansal led to Sengar's expulsion. Party realises a suspension is not enough, reports further added.

A day after Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi took cognisance of the letter sent by the Unnao rape survivor, the Supreme Court of India has transferred all cases related to the Unnao incident out of Uttar Pradesh. Additionally, the court also demanded presence of a "responsible officer of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)" in the court.

The CBI officer is required to appear before the Court at 12 pm today (Thursday). The officer will have to inform the apex court of the details of the rape case as well as the accident case of 29 July, which is also being investigated by the CBI. In case the investigation details are such that they cannot be divulged in open court, then the CBI officer will be heard in chambers, Gogoi clarified, Bar and Bench reported.

According to reports, Solicitor General informed the Supreme Court bench led by the CJI that the CBI investigating officers are out of town for the probe into the Unnao case. He asked for an extension till Thursday evening, but Gogoi refused to adjourned the hearing. Gogoi said gather instructions over the phone. "CBI director can do so."

According to News18, the Supreme Court has clearly said that all cases related to the 2017 incident in Unnao, including the rape allegations, the survivor's father's imprisonment and death, the very recent truck accident which claimed the lives of two aunts of the girl (and any other related cases filed in the state), will most probably be transferred to Delhi. Reportedly, Gogoi said that all the cases will be transferred to Delhi.

#CJI makes it clear all cases relating to #UnnaoCase will be shifted outside #UttarPradesh. #SupremeCourt has sought presence of a responsible official of the #CBI with details of probe in rape case, accident, intimidation etc. Formal orders to be passed when matter taken up. — Utkarsh Anand (@utkarsh_aanand) August 1, 2019

On Wednesday, Gogoi sought an explanation from the Supreme Court secretary-general for the delay in placing the letter before the court. "This morning I read in the papers that the Unnao victim had written to the Supreme Court. I was informed about the letter yesterday (Tuesday). I have not yet seen the letter. It is yet to be placed before me. We try to do something constructive in the midst of this highly destructive volatile environment and this happens," said Gogoi.

The CJI also said that such cases are a reflection of the 'destructive volatile environment' and are a setback to the Supreme Court's constructive steps.

The observations came when senior advocate V Giri, who is assisting the court in a suo motu case on the alarming rise in child rapes, sought urgent hearing of the Unnao rape case.

The 19-year-old woman, who was allegedly raped two years ago by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar, was critically injured in a car crash on Sunday. A lorry without a number plate rammed into the car in which the victim was travelling. The victim and her lawyer have been critically injured, while two of her aunts passed away.

The apex court also sought the survivor's medical report and asked the Uttar Pradesh authorities to file a status report by Thursday on the accident.

Two of her family members were killed in the accident and her lawyer was seriously injured. The woman's family has filed a complaint alleging "conspiracy" behind the car crash.

A copy of the letter, written by the survivor and two of her family members, was also sent to the Allahabad High Court and Uttar Pradesh government authorities.

The letter dated 12 July claimed that some people, allegedly associated with Sengar, had threatened the survivor's family with dire consequences on 7-8 July. It also sought a direction for registration of an FIR against those who allegedly intimidated the family.

The letter, signed by the girl, her mother and aunt, stated that on 7 July, Naveen Singh, son of an accused in the case Shashi Singh, brother of another accused Kuldeep Singh, and one Kunnu Mishra had visited their house and threatened them. The next day, another person came to their house.

Along with the letter, they said, they were also annexing the video of the car in which these people had come to their house.

Arrests made so far in the case

Sengar, a four-time MLA who represents Bangermau, was arrested in 2018 for allegedly raping the teenager at his residence in 2017.

In the road accident case, an FIR was filed on 29 July. Arun Singh — the son-in-law of Uttar Pradesh minister Ranvendra Pratap Singh — was named along with Kuldeep Sengar and eight others in the FIR.

About 15 to 20 unnamed people were also mentioned in the FIR. "FIR has been registered under the Indian Penal Code's sections 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 506 (criminal intimidation), 120b (criminal conspiracy) against 10 named persons, including the BJP MLA, and 15-20 others," a police officer had told PTI.
