In a case of alleged honour killing, a minor girl and her paramour were hacked to death by the girl’s family in Majitha this afternoon.

The police have booked girl’s father Balkar Singh, brother Harpal Singh, cousins Kashu and Onkar Singh, servant Laddi and two unidentified persons and launched a manhunt.

Pawan, 18, was attacked outside his house. Critically injured, his family took him to a local hospital where doctors declared him dead.

DSP Ravinder Singh said before hacking Pawan to death, the accused allegedly killed the 15-year-old girl. He said Pawan, who ran a car service centre, reportedly had an affair with the girl. Livid, the girl’s family asked him to keep away. Worried, Pawan’s family promised to intervene in the matter.

Some days ago, the girl had reportedly disappeared from her house. Her family suspected she had eloped with Pawan. They went to his house and enquired about his whereabouts. They were told Pawan and his brother had gone to give their sister’s wedding card to a relative.

The girl returned home from a gurdwara later that evening. Pawan’s younger sister was slated to be married on Friday.
