US woman fumes as Delhi rapist gets bail

US woman cries foul as her rapist gets bail from Delhi court, video goes viral

NEW DELHI/WASHINGTON: In a setback to a US national who was digitally raped by her landlord in Delhi in 2013, the high court has granted him bail and suspended his seven-year jail sentence.Upset by the decision, the American woman shot a video in front of the Indian consulate in San Francisco in which she drew attention to not only bureaucratic hassles faced by her but also to the difficulties women, including foreign travellers to India, face in securing justice.The US national was asleep with her husband when her landlord Rajiv Panwar entered their room and violated her with his finger in the early hours of June 24, 2013. Because of the action, the woman said, she had to leave India and her marriage broke down. Panwar was convicted by a fast-track court in February this year ago, but was later granted bail pending appeal in a higher court. Subsequently, Panwar challenged the verdict in the Delhi high court, which last month gave him partial relief.The woman, who is a human rights and gender equality activist, had come to India to testify in the case resulting in his conviction, and said she intended to follow up the case in higher courts to make sure he was punished.But instead of helping her, she alleged that the Indian consulate put her through the bureaucratic wringer.In the video, she also raged against the judicial system in India, saying although her attacker was convicted and sentenced for his crime when found guilty, “now due to the pervasive corruption he’s been given bail during his appeal on a crime.”Her post attracted thousands of views and shares from celebrities like Farhan Akhtar and Arjun Rampal, leading to the Consulate giving its version of the incident. Acknowledging that she was indeed told to get her documents notaried elsewhere by clerical staff as per procedure, one official said she was recalled after consular officials were told she was upset, and all help was rendered to her, after which she thanked the consulate before leaving.“As you know, all attestations were provided on the same day (Tuesday) after you spoke to the Consulate offi:: - cials and we waived the requirements of the Hague Convention that requires apostilling of legal documents. We hope that you obtain the justice you seek and deserve at the earliest,” the consulate wrote in response to her video.In his order while suspending Panwar’s sentence, Justice Chander Shekhar noted that “after the grant of bail to the appellant by the trial court, neither the prosecution nor the complainant moved any application for cancellation of bail. There is nothing on record, nor has anything been pointed out even today that the appellant in any manner or at any point of time misused the bail during the entire period of trial before the Trial Court,”.HC also pointed out that the disposal of the appeal may take some time and recorded that Panwar has been behind bars for over five months. The court, however, took into account the apprehensions of the US-based victim and directed Panwar not to contact her.The court also declined the victim’s plea to be made a party to Panwar’s appeal.But the high court was quick to add that the victim “has a right of audience and hearing” and she can “intervene and assist the APP and this Court within the legal parameters during the course of the hearing of the present appeal”.
