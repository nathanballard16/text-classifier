Maoists stab off-duty cop to death in front of his family

RAIPUR: Maoists stalked and killed an off-duty policeman when he was shopping with his wife and children at a Sunday weekly market in Bijapur district. Assistant constable Chaitu Kadti was stabbed to death by a band of four to five rebels in front of his horrified family and scores of other shoppers in Mirtur village.The killers then walked out of the market and into a jungle , unchallenged. Such attacks, carried by small ‘action teams’ of the Maoists, aren’t new in Bastar, but what’s chilling this time is that the hit squad targeted an off-duty cop, in plainclothes, out with his family on a Sunday. Local cops have been advised to be careful and move around only in groups, a police officer said.Kadti was posted at Mirtur police station, but regularly took part in anti-Maoist operations, said police. “The rebels must have kept a watch on him and knew he would go shopping with his family to the haat on Sunday,” said an officer.Such attacks are carried out by small hit squads of Maoists, who roam around in local attire and hide weapons under their clothes. Last Sunday, they hacked to death an alleged police informer in the Bastanar weekly market.
