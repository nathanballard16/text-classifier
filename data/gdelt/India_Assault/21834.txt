Police fired tear gas at protesters in India's capital yesterday as tens of thousands rallied around the country against a new citizenship law they say is anti-Muslim, but Prime Minister Narendra Modi remained defiant.

The law grants citizenship to non-Muslims from three neighboring countries in what opponents say is part of Modi's Hindu-nationalist master plan.

Uproar over the move has sparked days of protests, clashes and riots across India that have left six people dead and dozens injured in a major challenge to Modi.

In Muslim areas of Delhi yesterday, buses and a police outpost were torched and tear gas filled streets as thousands hurled stones at police.

Tens of thousands more rallied in West Bengal, Kolkata and Tamil Nadu states on a sixth day of protests.

But Modi was adamant that the Citizenship Amendment Act, passed last week, would not affect Indian nationals, including Muslims. He blamed the opposition Congress party for spreading violence and creating fear by lying about the law's intent.
