Rape case against Binoy: Woman first filed complaint to CPM national leadership

New Delhi: Even before lodging a rape complaint with the police, the Bihar woman had filed a complaint to the CPM national leadership, according to reports. In the complaint, she said Binoy Kodiyeri, son of CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, cheated her on a false promise to marry.

The party national leadership has discussed the matter. It was on June 13, Mumbai police registered a case against Binoy based on a complaint filed by the woman. According to reports, the woman had filed a complaint to the party leadership much earlier.

National leaders had discussed the matter with state leaders who reached Delhi for meetings. As the issue remains personal, the discussion was unofficial. It is learnt the state leaders have informed that the complaint of the woman is fake. The national leadership took a stand that since the issue is personal, the party shouldn’t interfere in that and let Binoy defend it individually. The leadership also directed all leaders to refrain from interfering in the matter.

The complaint states that she was sexually assaulted for over 8 years and has a 8-year-old child from the relationship. Police have registered FIR against Binoy and probe has begun.
