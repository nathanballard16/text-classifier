Reportedly, there has been a rise in the number of rapes perpetrated by criminals who meet their victims on social media platforms in India. Around half a dozen cases of "Facebook rapes" were reported last month alone.

Last December, a 45-year-old woman was allegedly raped in her own home in a similar case in Delhi. In the same month, a 13-year-old Delhi girl was allegedly abducted by an online friend and taken to a hotel in Meerut in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh where she was gang-raped.
