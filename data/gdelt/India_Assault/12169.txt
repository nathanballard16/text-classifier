Amid the Apollo 11 anniversary and India’s new lunar mission, we are missing chance to change how we think about the moon

It has been a very big week for the moon: there has been a lunar eclipse, a mission to its surface sent by India, and the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 landings.

But only one of those three events really received the coverage it deserved, and that was the one from five decades ago. That wonky amount of interest threatens to eclipse the way we think about the moon and space exploration more generally.

This was the week that the Indian space agency sent a mission that should be the first time the country will conduct a soft landing onto the lunar surface. And while that achievement will be a rare one, it won’t be unique: India will become the fourth country to do so, after the US, the former Soviet Union and China.
