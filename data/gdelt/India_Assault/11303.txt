Pappu Yadav Now Turns His Focus on Women for their Support in 2019 Elections

Patna: Jan Adhikar Party (JAP) leader Pappu Yadav, after spending nearly two years attempting to win the hearts of students of Bihar though with little luck thanks to his penchant for 'disruptive' politics, is now going after another demographic, this time women of Bihar, to make sure he is not relegated to the pages of history books after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

Yadav, an MP from Madhepura, to ensure women votes, held a meeting/membership drive of his party's women cell during which more than a dozen new members were inducted into JAP.

"I have entrusted the women members of the party with some very responsible roles because I trust their judgment. They will be going from village to village and block to block to spread awareness about the failure of the current administration in Bihar and at the national level. We want women to be empowered with equal rights as men and that is why a large number of them joined our party today," Yadav said.

On the occasion, Yadav appointed Jyoti Chandravanshi as the working president of the party's women's wing while Vandana Bharti was named as the vice president of the same cell.

General Secretary post was given to Priti Saha who will also act as the official spokesperson of the party. Renu Jaiswal was appointed the district president of Patna.

Ejaz Ahmed, JAP national general secretary, said that women in Bihar remained the most victimized group as crime including murder, rape, and misbehavior against them had skyrocketed under the current Nitish administration in the state.

"We are the only party that is raising safety and security concerns of the women and that is why more and more women were coming out to join us by leaving other parties," Ahmed said.
