New Delhi: In a turn of events in Arvind Kejriwal assault incident, a video has surfaced on media in which the person who attacked the Delhi Chief Minister was seen at Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) event.

The AAP chief was attacked by a man, identified as Suresh Chauhan during his roadshow in Delhi’s Moti Nagar area on Saturday. The video of the incident also went viral on social media.

Following the incident, Kejriwal blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) behind the attack while calling the attacker Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s supporter.

“I don't think in India's history there have been such attacks on any CM. In this country Delhi CM is the only CM whose security's responsibility is in the hands of the Opposition party that is BJP,” Kejriwal had said during a press conference.

“A Chief Minister was attacked and the Central government says, 'didn't receive the complaint, unable to move ahead with further proceedings’. The PM should resign over it. It's not an attack on Arvind Kejriwal, it is an attack on Delhi's mandate," he added.

However, in the new video, the attacker can be seen donning the trademark AAP cap at a public meeting addressed by the Delhi CM.

On Saturday, the Delhi Police said that preliminary interrogation has revealed the person who attacked Kejriwal was a disgruntled supporter of AAP and he used to work as organiser of its rallies and meetings, news agency PTI reported.

However, Kejriwal refuted the claim and said that the attacker was “Modi bhakt” and not an AAP supporter.

Earlier, the BJP had alleged that the attack on the AAP chief was planted to garner limelight.
