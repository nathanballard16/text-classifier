Government delaying award of Dharavi redevelopment project, alleges bidder

Maharashtra’s ambitious project to redevelop Asia’s largest slum Dharavi in the centre of India’s financial capital Mumbai is about to get mired in legal issues.Seclink Technologies Corporation (STC), the company that emerged the highest bidder for the project, is planning to take legal action against the state government for delaying the project award. “We are planning to move the court as the Letter of Award (LOA) for Dharavi redevelopment project has been delayed without assigning reasons when they have acknowledged that Seclink has complied with technical and financial closure,” Hiten Shah, partner, Seclink Group, told ET.Seclink Group, funded by the royal family of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), emerged as the highest bidder for the project to redevelop the slum spread over 593 acres after global bids were invited by the state government. Seclink bid ?7,200 crore when the minimum bid amount was set at ?3,150 crore.After almost one-and-half decades of deliberations and three attempts to redevelop Dharavi, the Maharashtra government had invited global tenders to start the process, this time projecting it as a single project to build a new business district and township.“The state government has already acknowledged that we have qualified to execute the project. We had also readied ?28,500 crore for completion of the entire project within our scheduled deadline of maximum nine years,” Shah said. ET’s calls and text message to SVR Srinivas, chief executive officer (CEO), Dharavi Redevelopment Authority (DRA) remained unanswered until press time on Wednesday.According to Shah, the delay and resultant legal entanglement would also impact the entire $20 billion investment committed by the royal family of the UAE through Seclink that was to flow over and above Dharavi for the state.The selected lead partner was expected to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV) and invest ?400 crore for an 80% stake, while the state government will infuse ?100 crore for the remaining equity. The lead partner will bring in any additional funding for the project through convertible instruments including debentures and preference shares.The SPV will also construct free housing for eligible slum dwellers and occupants, apart from amenities and infrastructure stipulated by the state government, according to the public notice issued by the Officer on Special Duty of the Dharavi Redevelopment Project. In return, the SPV will get to build space equivalent to four times the area developed for sale in the open market.The earlier plan was to divide Dharavi into five sectors, one to be redeveloped by the Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority (MHADA) and the other four by private entities. However, the plan did not progress beyond a few buildings constructed by MHADA. This time, the state government approved the plan to redevelop Dharavi as a single project and had floated one global tender.
