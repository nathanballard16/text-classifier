Jharkhand lynching: Meet the accused — most under 30, daily wagers

From daily wage labourers to men looking for work and from a gangman in the Railways to a farmer. They are among the 11 men arrested after Tabrez Ansari died on June 22 in a Jharkhand hospital, four days after he was attacked by a mob that accused him of theft.

On June 18, a mob tied Ansari to a pole, assaulted him and allegedly forced him to chant “Jai Shri Ram and “Jai Hanuman”. Ansari was arrested on charges of theft after the assault and sent to judicial custody, but died of his injuries in hospital.

On June 23, police arrested 11 residents of Dhatkidih village, where the attack took place, and suspended two police personnel.

Speaking to villagers and family members of the 11 arrested, The Indian Express found out that only five of the men had completed Class 10, most are either daily wage labourers, unemployed or were looking for a job.
