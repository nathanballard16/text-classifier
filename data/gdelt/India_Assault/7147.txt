Retired HC judge’s family hands over infant to daughter-in-law

The development came after she protested in front of his house

Amid protest by several women’s organisations, family members of retired High Court judge Nooty Ramamohana Rao handed over the 17-month-old baby to their daughter-in-law Sindhu Sharma here on Sunday evening.

The development came after the former judge’s daughter-in-law staged a sit-in protest in front of his house in Journalist Colony of Jubilee Hills here.

Further, the family members told the daughter-in-law that they would hand over her three-year-old daughter at SHE Teams office on Monday morning. On Saturday, the 30-year-old MBA graduate had lodged a complaint with Women Police Station of Hyderabad Central Crime Station, stating that her husband Vasista, and in-laws Ramamohana Rao and Durga Jayalaxmi had been ill-treating and physically assaulting her. Following this, a case of domestic violence and dowry harassment was registered against Mr. Rao and his family members.

“She got married to Vasista in 2012 and since then they have been harassing her and we had several family meetings about the issue. Now, even the police are supporting the judge’s family,” said the woman’s uncle Raghava Das of Uppal.

“Finally, they handed over the 17-month-old girl to us. Now, we are waiting for the custody of the elder daughter,” he said.
