Criminal complaint filed in Delhi court against Kamal Hassan for 'hurting religious statements'

New Delhi [India], May 14 (ANI): A criminal complaint was filed in a Delhi's Patiala House Court against actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan for allegedly "hurting religious sentiments of Hindus" by associating terrorism with Hindu religion in a speech in Tamil Nadu on May 12.

The court is likely to hear the matter on May 16.

The complainant Vishnu Gupta who claims to be a founding member of Hindu Sena said Haasan's remarks hurt religious sentiments and promoted enmity between Hindu and Muslims. Gupta also sought the accused to be summoned for the same.

On May 12, Kamal Hassan, chief of political outfit Makkal Needhi Maiam while campaigning in Tamil Nadu's Aravakurichi assembly constituency had stirred a controversy by asserting that first terrorist in independent India was a Hindu, referring to Nathuram Godse, the man who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi.

"I am not saying this because many Muslims are here. I am saying this in front of Mahatma Gandhi's statue. The first terrorist in independent India is a Hindu, his name is Nathuram Godse," Haasan had said while campaigning in Tamil Nadu's Aravakurichi assembly constituency for the by-election. (ANI)
