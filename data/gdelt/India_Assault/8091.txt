SC to hear on May 17 Atul Rai's plea seeking protection from arrest in rape case

The Supreme Court will hear on May 17 a petition filed by SP-BSP candidate from Ghosi Lok Sabha constituency, Atul Rai, seeking protection from arrest in connection with a rape case.

A vacation bench comprising Justices Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna will hear Rai's plea seeking protection from arrest in connection with the case till May 23.

Rai, who is an accused in the case, is absconding.

In April, a college student in Varanasi had accused Rai of sexually assaulting her. The victim had alleged that she was taken by Rai to his residence on the pretext of meeting his wife.

An FIR was lodged against Rai in the matter.

On May 8, the Allahabad High Court had turned down Rai's plea seeking anticipatory bail. Since then, he has been absconding.
