Gujarat High Court picks holes in rape victim's cock and bull story, criticises trial court

A month later, Rakesh's parents came and started living with them. Being a minor, Rakesh's parents were not ready for the marriage and took her to a women police station in Mehsana, which sent her back to her home. The high court also took the trial court in Himmatnagar to task for "not applying its mind" and believing in the "cock-and-bull story" of the victim-girl, while rejecting their bail pleas. The victim has also claimed in her statement that she, somehow, got an opportunity to contact her mother through Rakesh's mobile, who came to Vadu. She was taken to Surat the next day where Rakesh had got a job and she was confined in a house.
