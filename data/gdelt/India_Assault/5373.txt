Special team to curb stone pelting on Vande Bharat

ALLAHABAD: Railways on Wednesday set up special teams comprising GRP and RPF personnel to track the miscreants pelting stones at India’s first premium class semi-high speed train Vande Bharat . Plain-clothes team members would mingle with folks of villages where attacks have occurred in past, railway officials said on Friday.“We have decided to keep a close watch in areas on the route from Kanpur to Varanasi,” said SP Railways Himanshu Kumar “Once caught, we would prosecute trouble-makers under suitable sections of CrPC like section 107 and 116, which is a bond for decent behavior. But if one repeats the crime, then the action would be stringent,” he said.“The teams are being set up at thana and police outpost level. At police station level, each team would comprise of one sub-inspector, two head constables and four constables. Likewise, at police outpost level, the team would have one head constable and two constables,” Kumar told TOI.“The teams will conduct raids randomly so that the element of surprise is maintained. We deployed two teams and no incidents took place in the last few days,” he said.Meanwhile, the railway police on March 12 arrested a 24-year-old unemployed youth of Chheemi under Khaga police station of Fatehpur district, who claimed that he threw stones at Vande Bharat for ‘target practice’.“A special team caught this unemployed youth for throwing stones at the train on March 12. It was found that he had placed a bet with his friends about hitting the ‘target’, which in this case was Vande Bharat,” said SP Railways Himanshu Kumar.
