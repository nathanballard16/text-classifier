Mumbai: Man rapes mentally-challenged Andheri woman in tempo, held

A 41-year-old man was arrested for allegedly raping a mentally-challenged girl in a tempo a few days ago.

The accused identified as Arvind Gupta raped the woman after asking her to accompany him in his tempo, took her to a deserted place late at night and raped her inside the vehicle.

According to the police, the 30-year-old victim is a resident of Andheri and due to her mental condition, she used to wander outside her house most of the times. On the day of the incident, the victim was sitting outside her residence, when Gupta, who was passing by, approached her to start a conversation. The victim, unaware of his plans, accompanied Gupta in his tempo. "Gupta had to make no efforts to convince the victim to accompany him. After a few flattering chats, the duo left the place and roamed in the locality away from the victim's residence. Late in the night, Gupta took his tempo to a deserted place falling under the jurisdiction of Andheri police station and on finding a correct opportunity, he raped her in the tempo," said a police officer of the Andheri police station requesting anonymity.

After committing the crime, Gupta dropped the victim outside her residence and fled away. Next day the victim's family registered a complaint after learning about the incident. As per police reports, no one had seen him in the locality before. "Based on the available leads, we scrutinised at least 50 CCTV footages of the locality. Based on them, we got details of Gupta who was arrested from MIDC area. Gupta is a daily wager by profession and works in a godown. Gupta has been booked under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and at present, he is under jail custody," said senior police inspector of Andheri police station, Lalasaheb Shete.
