3rd anniversary of demonetisation: Rahul Gandhi terms it ‘terror attack’

New Delhi: Terming demonetisation as a ‘terror attack’, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said Friday that those behind the ‘vicious’ assault are yet to be brought to justice. His attack on the government came on the third anniversary of demonetisation.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi had announced November 8, 2016, to the nation that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes would cease to be a legal tender.

“It’s 3 yrs since the Demonetisation terror attack that devastated the Indian economy, taking many lives, wiping out lakhs of small businesses & leaving millions of Indians unemployed (sic),” Rahul Gandhi said in a tweet.

“Those behind this ‘vicious attack’ have yet to be brought to justice,” the former Congress president said, using the hashtag ‘DeMonetisation Disaster’ (sic).

Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also hit out at Modi for the demonetisation move, describing him as ‘today’s Tughlaq’.

“Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq rendered the country’s currency useless in the year 1330. Today’s Tughlaq did the same November 8, 2016,” he said in a tweet.

“3 years have passed and the country is suffering because- economy collapsed, employment lost. Neither terrorism stopped, nor the business of fake notes,” Surjewala said, and asked ‘who is responsible’.

Surjewala also cited global rating agency Moody’s lowering the outlook on the government of India’s ratings to negative, to claim that demonetisation was a ‘man-made catastrophe’. He also questioned the ‘silence’ of those in power on the third anniversary of demonetisation.
