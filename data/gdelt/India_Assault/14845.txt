Solidarity with Kashmiris

In occupied Jammu Kashmir, Muslims are being subjected to worst atrocities by the Indian occupation forces. For the past 25 days, Kashmiris have been living under curfew. They are running short food, life-saving medicines and other necessaries. These people have long lived under tyranny. Since the latest uprising began in 1989, around around 100,000 Kashmiris have been martyred, thousands have disappeared, thousands are in prisons in the state and in far-flung areas of India where they are being subjected to torture. We as a nation stand united in our support to our Kashmiri brethren. The government is doing whatever it could do help them diplomatically and politically. Indian prime minister Narendra Modi is tyranny and butchery personified. The international community is however slow in coming to the rescue of the Kashmiris. If Modi is allowed to have his way, he would soon become a big danger to world peace. He should be stopped. This barbarous monster should be stopped by the entire world community.Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party have unleashed a reign of terror not only in Kashmir but in Assam as well. Now two million Muslims, mostly Bengalis, have become stateless due to the machinations of the champions of Hindutva. Muslims and other minorities have long been living in an atmosphere of fear and misery in other parts of India. Modi and Hindutva elements have lit a fire which will soon engulf themselves. First, Modi committed butchery in Gujarat. Since then his killing orgy is going on and on with no end in sight. Everything has a limit. The world has seen tyrants and monsters but they all have met with a tragic end. Modi, you are bloody and your end will be bloody.Shanza NawabPublished in The Express Tribune, September 2, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
