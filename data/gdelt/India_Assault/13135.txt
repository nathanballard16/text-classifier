BEFORE Mr. Aston, Chief Presidency Magistrate, today Sir Oowasjee Jahangir, appeared in response on a notice issued on him at the instance of Major F. J. W. Porter, R.A.M.C. (retired), who runs a nursing home next to Sir Oowasjee’s residence, to show cause why an order should not be issued against him directing him to abstain from causing a brass bell in his residence to be rung between 6 p.m., and 6 a.m. and also to abstain from allowing his chaukidar to disturb the complainant. Sir Chimanlal Setalvad instructed by Mr. Payne, Solicitor, appeared for the respondent. Major Porter alleged that he had been subjected to much harassment at the hands of Sir Oowasjee and had reason to believe that Sir Oowasjee wanted to compel him to vacate the premises. He had to face a criminal prosecution for an alleged assault on Sir Oowasjee’s maid but had been acquitted. At the outset the Magistrate enquired if the parties could not come to a settlement. Sir Chimanlal said Major Porter had behaved in a manner which left no chance of any amicable settlement. Further Major Porter had shot and killed a goose in the respondent’s compound, which was a dangerous thing to do as there were a large number of people in the compound.
