17-year-old raped multiple times by neighbour in Dwarka; accused held

Victim says he had threatened her after she rejected his advances

A 17-year-old girl was allegedly raped multiple times by her neighbour, the police said on Saturday.

The incident was reported from Dwarka’s Baba Haridas Nagar and the accused has been arrested, they said.

A senior police officer said the teenager, who stays in a rented accommodation in Baba Hardas Nagar, told the police on Saturday that she was raped by the 24-year-old neighbour two to three times in the last three-four months.

“She said he was pursuing her but she rejected his advances. However, he started threatening to harm her if she did not give in,” the officer said.

‘Forcibly married her’

The accused, who had come to Delhi from Nagpur to attend his sister’s wedding a few months ago and decided to stay, allegedly forcibly married the minor by putting vermillion on her forehead and also clicked pictures of the same.

‘Defamed her’

“When the victim continued to resist, the accused started showing the pictures to her relatives to defame her. She then approached police on Saturday,” the officer said.

The police have registered a case under Sections 376 (punishment for rape) and 506 (punishment for criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code and under relevant sections of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at Baba Haridas Nagar police station.
