Kanpur: Uttar Pradesh police have revealed that a 23-year-old man out on bail murdered a minor boy, who was the younger brother of a woman he had been accused of molesting. Villagers discovered the body of the 10-year-old boy in the fields in Kanpur district's Sajeti police area on Saturday morning and alerted officials.

The accused, one Sarvesh Nishad was arrested in 2018 on a molestation charge. He was later released on bail and decided to murder his childhood friend, the younger brother of the woman who accused him of molestation, reported Times of India. An investigation into the matter led city police to Nishad who they say abducted the minor boy with the help of his friend Anil on Friday night. The duo then strangled the boy to death and dumped his body in the fields.

Following a complaint by the boy's family, police arrested Sarvesh and Anil who confessed to the heinous crime. Circle officer Shailendra Singh told the national daily that an FIR was registered in this regard and a team led by the Station House Officer (SHO) of Sajeti was constituted to probe the case which led to the arrests of the accused.

During the course of the investigation, officials with the police department discovered that Sarvesh was accused by the victim's elder sister of molesting her last year. Nishad and his kin had been pressurising the girl's family to withdraw the case against him. However, when they refused to comply, Sarvesh decided to murder the complainant's younger brother as an act of revenge.
