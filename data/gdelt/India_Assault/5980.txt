Senior citizen found injured, naked in park

Police suspect sexual assault, probe on

A 61-year-old woman was found lying naked with injuries in a park in south-east Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar on Wednesday morning, the police said on Thursday.

The police suspect that she has been sexually assaulted and got injured while trying to resist.

Rape charges

They have registered a case on charges of rape.

A senior police officer said a PCR call was received at 6 a.m. stating that an old woman is lying naked in the park.

On reaching the spot, they found the woman lying unconscious with a head injury.

“There were also bruises and abrasions on her body. She was taken to a hospital immediately,” said the officer.

During enquiry, it was revealed that the woman, who appears to be mentally challenged, stays with her sister in East of Kailash.

Her sister is also mentally challenged, the police said. “The two, however, regularly visited the locality where the incident took place because their parental house, which is now sold, is there,” the officer said.

The locals told the police that they often saw the woman in the park.

“The victim has not been able to narrate the incident. Her sister is also not aware of the incident. Involvement of local ruffians is suspected. The woman is out of danger,” the officer said.

The police have registered a case under Section 376 (punishment for rape) of the India Penal Code.

CCTV footage

“CCTV footage of the spot and nearby area is being obtained and locals are being questioned to ascertain the sequence of events,” the officer added.
