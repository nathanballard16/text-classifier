Airborne Weapon Systems for Rotorcraft Market To Witness High Demand During 2018-2026

Airborne Weapon Systems for Rotorcraft Market To Witness High Demand During 2018-2026

A rotorcraft is a heavy airborne machine that works by generating lift caused by its wings, which are called rotary wings or rotor blades.

A rotorcraft is a heavy airborne machine that works by generating lift caused by its wings, which are called rotary wings or rotor blades. Several rotor blades are fixed and rotate around the pole to generate the lifting force to overcome the gravity pull and the weight by generating the required uplift pressure and providing direction through forcing down the oncoming air. The major advantage of a rotorcraft is that it can hover at a location. Gyroplanes are used for low speed surveillance operations and are relatively more cost-effective and easier to maintain than other types of aircraft.

The major concern of rotorcraft is the generation of enough lift, against the bulky wings to overcome the air force. These aircraft also require a long runway for takeoff and landing. These pose as major restrains for growth of the market for airborne weapon systems for rotorcraft.

Rotors of the aircraft are thin wings that spin around a shaft on the same spot and by that rotating force, it generates a huge downdraft of air lifting the helicopter upward. It helps to take off or land vertically and drift smoothly in any direction that is not available in a conventional plane.

Global Airborne Weapon Systems for Rotorcraft Market Taxonomy

On the basis of class, the global airborne weapon systems for rotorcraft market is segmented into:

• Helicopter

• Cyclocopter

• Autogyro

• Gyrodyne

• Rotor kite

Military Rotorcraft:

The military segment is expected to exhibit significant growth over the forecast period (2017 – 2025), due to constant demand for replacing old fleets to enhance the operations.

Governments across the world are more likely to adopt multi-functional helicopters, including ground attack, air assault, cargo, surveillance, rescue operations, humanitarian aid, and troop transport due to the cut in defense budget. The Ministry of Defense, Government of India, intends to procure around 123 naval multi-role helicopters along with spare engines. Hence, the multi-mission and maritime helicopters segment is expected to account for the major market share of the global rotorcraft market over the forecast period.
