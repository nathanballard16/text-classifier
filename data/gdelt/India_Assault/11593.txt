Gurugram, July 11

A nurse from the city planned to extort Rs1 crore from a local businessman by threatening to abduct his son to fund her MBBS admission.

Along with one of her relatives, she conspired against the businessman whom she had known for a few days and made threat calls to him.

Her relative was on recee of the businessman’s house to execute the abduction when he was nabbed by the police. He then led the police to the nurse.

According to the police, the arrested persons have been identified as Nasrin, alias Fiza Khan (20), and Mustkim Khan (33).

Ten months ago, Fiza had taken care of the complainant’s mother for 25 days. Her accomplice works as a fruit juice vendor in Ghaziabad.

The businessman, a Sector-14 resident, moved the police yesterday alleging threat calls. As per the complaint, a woman — identifying herself as Fiza — threatened to abduct his son and demanded Rs1 crore.

As per the complaint, an FIR was registered under Sections 387 and 120-B of the IPC. The crime unit started investigating and was led to Mustkim by his mobile location. He then led the police to Fiza.

Fiza had done her nursing from a city college but aspired to be a doctor and wanted money to fund her admission. She told the police that coming from a poor family, she could have never arranged it.

When she worked in the victim’s home, she realised that Rs1 crore was a small amount for him. She offered Rs20 lakh to Mustkim. He was headed on a recce when he was caught by the police.

“We are looking into their past record and her previous employers,” said an investigator.
