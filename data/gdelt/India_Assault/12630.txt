Kidnapped Hyderabad woman freed in Prakasam district

The 21-year-old B. Pharm student was assured a decent job in a hospital

In a happy ending, the B. Pharm student, who was allegedly kidnapped from Hayathnagar in Hyderabad on Tuesday last week, has been freed at Addanki in Prakasam district in Andhra Pradesh.

Inquiries by the Prakasam police on July 30 revealed that Ravisekhar kidnapped the 21-year-old woman assuring her that he would find her a decent job in the hospital of a doctor he knew.

Police said that the woman, who was found at Addanki early on July 30, left on her own to Hyderabad without taking their help.

Using the same modus operandi, the conman had reportedly cheated about 70 women by promising them jobs in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh.

A Docile Criminal (DC) sheet has been opened at his native place Kankipadu, near Vijaywada, according to information received by the police here.
