The jubilant mood of the nation over Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman's homecoming is reflected on social media - on Twitter, #WelcomeHomeAbhinandan has trended all day. The euphoric posts include one from Shah Rukh Khan, who wrote: "There is no better feeling than coming back home, for home is the place of love, hope and dreams. Your bravery makes us stronger. Eternally grateful." Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over by Pakistan at Wagah Border today. He was captured by Pakistan after an aerial confrontation with 24 Pakistani jets which attempted to cross the Line of Control on Wednesday. He shot down a Pakistani F-16 before his own MiG 21 Bison crashed and he was forced to eject.

Yesterday, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that they would release Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman as a 'gesture of peace,' after flaring tension between the two countries. Shah Rukh Khan's is just one of several joyful posts on social media today. Read what he tweeted here:

Two weeks ago, a suicide bomber in Pulwama, Kashmir blew up a CRPF bus killing 40 soldiers. Terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility. This week, tension between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian jets bombed Jaish's biggest training camp at Balakot in Pakistan, which tried to target Indian military installations in response. Global leaders intervened to urge both countries to step back from hostilities.
