The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) ordered on Saturday that security will be provided to 18 witnesses testifying against the main accused, Kuldeep Singh Sengar, in Unnao rape case.

The CBI handed over the list of witnesses who will be provided protection to the district administration. The administration will now provide every witness mentioned in the list with a gunman soon.

Security by the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was already being given to the advocate of the rape survivor's family and two key witnesses, on the Supreme Court's orders.

The people mentioned by the CBI are witnesses in the case in some way or the other and need protection.

Out of these, 15 people are from Makhi village of Unnao, who also appear for the hearings of the case. Apart from this, the CBI mentioned three more people who need security as they were questioned recently. One of whom, include a journalist.

The next date of hearing for the case was set as August 19. The rape survivor's uncle, who is imprisoned in connection with the case, will be heard through video conferencing from Delhi's Tihar Jail.

The Uttar Pradesh police, instead of the CRPF, was providing protection to one of the family members of the Unnao rape survivor, in defiance of a Supreme Court order, a Delhi court was informed on Friday.

The court had sought a report in this regard from the investigation officer of the case by Saturday.

The counsel for the 19-year-old rape survivor and her family -- advocates Dharmendra Mishra and Poonam Kaushik -- told the court that the relative, who was also one of the witnesses in the murder case of the victim's father, was provided a gunman by the Uttar Pradesh police.
