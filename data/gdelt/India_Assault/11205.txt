Chennai: Nalini Sriharan, one of the convicts serving a life sentence in former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi assassination case has been granted parole by the Madras High Court.

Nalini had asked for six months leave to make arrangements for her daughter's wedding, however, the court only granted her a month on parole citing suspension of sentence rules. The division bench comprising Justice MM Sundresh and Justice M Nirmal Kumar passed the judgment after Nalini herself appeared in court.

However, the court also directed Nalini to stay away from media, categorically saying that she should not give any interview or meet political leaders. Further, it has asked the prison authorities to process her application within 10 days.

According to reports, Nalini first made a representation to prison authorities in February, arguing that she's been behind bars for over 28 years and has never availed ordinary leave of a month available to convicts serving lifers, and thus she's entitled to six months leave.

When the prison authorities failed to consider her representation, she moved another similar one in March. However, when the second representation also failed, she moved the high court.

Nalini is India's longest-serving woman prisoner, convicted for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. She along with Murugan aka Sriharan, Jayakumar, Santhan, Robert Payas, Ravichandaran and Perarivalan aka Arivu have been behind bars since 1991.
