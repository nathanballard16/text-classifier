Nepali national stabbed to death by another Nepali

New Delhi, Aug 13 : A 22-year-old Nepali man was stabbed to death by a compatriot who was sick and tired of being bullied by the victim, police said on Tuesday.

The incident occurred at Central Delhi's Desh Bandhu Gupta Road on Monday night.

Police have arrested the accused Vishal, who worked in an eatery, while the deceased has been identified as Virendra, who used to wash cars for a living.

The police rushed Virendra to a hospital where doctors declared him dead due to excessive bleeding.

Police said Virendra and Vishal knew each other for a long time. On Monday, they got into a row. It became so heated that Vishal took out a knife and stabbed Virendra in his neck, said a police officer privy to the investigation.

The murder weapon has been seized.

A friend of both men told police that Virendra was addicted to alcohol and used to bully Vishal. "Vishal got fed up."
