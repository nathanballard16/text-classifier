Sabarimala Protests: Kerala becomes a war zone, scribes attacked by protesters

The Kerala temple protests reached the national capital on Thursday. Protestors attacked media outside Kerala House in New Delhi. They also tried to pelt stones at the Kerala House, but were stopped by the police, which was followed by a ruckus. Besides, the mobile phone of a Tamil news channel, Suchitra, was intentionally broken by one of the protestors after he attacked the journalist.

With media personnel being attacked in New Delhi and at various districts in Kerala during the 12 hour hartal by political outfits against entry of two women in their 40s into Sabarimala temple, the Kerala Union of Working Journalists on Thursday decided to boycott BJP and Sabarimala Karma Samithi.

The press meets called by BJP state president P S Sreedharan Pillai and Samithi leader K P Sasikala were boycotted by the media on Thursday.

The dawn to dusk shutdown called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi and the Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad (AHP), plunged the state into turmoil, as hundreds of activists disrupted rail and road traffic and vandalised shops and offices of the ruling CPI(M).

The state was under siege as strike supporters clashed with police and the ruling CPI(M) activists at several places.

In Thrissur, three BJP activists were stabbed during a clash with workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, a militant Islamic outfit, police said.
