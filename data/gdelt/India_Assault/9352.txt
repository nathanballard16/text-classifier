Here’s the latest development in Karan Oberoi’s ongoing case. The actor has been granted bail by the Bombay High Court after a woman filed a complaint against him for allegedly raping her and blackmailing her with a video. The actor was arrested the very next day after the woman filed a complaint against him. She also claimed that he shot videos of them making love and threatened to make the video viral on the internet. Close friends of the actor like Pooja Bedi, Sachin Shroff, Danny Fernandes, Anveshi Jain, Chaitanya Bhosle, Varkey Patani, Sherrin Verghese and Sudhanshu Pandey spoke up in support of him on social media.

His band mate Sudhanshu, had said, “In the case of girls, we all make sure that we are respectful towards women and Karan was the most chivalrous, I can't believe that there is such a case against Karan.” The actor has been granted bail on a surety of Rs. 50,000/-. The Sessions Court had refused the actor’s bail plea on May 17. “Oberoi not only raped the woman and filmed the act but also demanded money from the victim threatening to release the video if she did not pay up,” ANI had quoted the police when the actor got arrested. The last one month has definitely been a roller coaster ride for Karan and we are eagerly looking forward to hearing his side of the story now that he will be out soon.

Pooja Bedi, who is one of his closest friends, said while addressing the media that it’s not fair for certain women to misuse a movement and make it difficult for other women to get justice. Fans and close friends of the actor will definitely take to social media to post their excitement over the bail. Stay tuned with us for more updates from TV town and tweet to us @zoomtv.
