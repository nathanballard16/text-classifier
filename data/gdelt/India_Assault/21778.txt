New Delhi: The resident welfare association (RWA) of New Friends Colony that bore the brunt of the violent protest over the amended citizenship law has filed a police complaint demanding action against "miscreants" responsible for damaging property and "disturbing peace" in the area. The complaint was filed with DCP, South East, Chinmoy Biswal by New Friends Colony RWA president B M Bakshi and senior vice president Rommel Jggi.
