Days after Pulwama attack, terror threat looms large over Statue of Unity in Gujarat

Prime Minister Narendra Modi dedicated to the nation a 182-metre-tall statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, believed to be the tallest in the world. The imposing monument is twice the height of the Statue of Liberty in the US and is built on an islet, Sadhu Bet, around 3.5 km downstream from the Sardar Sarovar Dam in Gujarat's Narmada district. Visiting hours of Statue of Unity: The Gujarat government recently increased the Statue of Unity's visiting time for the public by two hours, state Chief Secretary J N Singh said. He said the new visiting hours for the Sardar Patel memorial in Kevadiya in the state's Narmada district are from 8am to 6pm instead of the earlier 9 am to 5 pm.

Statue of Unity has a footfall of lakhs of people every week ever since its inauguration. The monument was inaugurated on a large-scale. Ever since the authorities have received the mail, the security has been beefed up. This comes days after a suicide bomber killed 40 soldiers in Pulwama by ramming a car full of explosives into an Army convoy.
