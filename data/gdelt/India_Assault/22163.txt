Kolkata: Police often refused Pocso cases or registered lighter sections, said Justice Samapti Chatterjee of Calcutta High Court. She was speaking at a programme on human trafficking management organised by NGO International Justice Mission (IJM) on Wednesday.Bengal, sharing borders with Nepal and Bangladesh, served as a trafficking corridor, she said at the event, attended by 30 public prosecutors . Of the 800-odd victims rescued, 90% were found to be speaking in Bengali, she said, even as she urged prosecutors to be more sensitive towards victims.Chief public prosecutor of city sessions court Tamal Mukerjee pointed out there was no space, where they could hold discussions with witnesses.
