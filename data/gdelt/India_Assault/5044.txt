Two minor girls have been allegedly raped in two separate incidents on Saturday in Aurangabad and Dibai areas of Bulandshahr district in Uttar Pradesh, according to police.

The first incident involves a 14-year-old girl from Aurangabad while another 8-year-old girl was raped in Dibai.

Speaking to news agency ANI, Bulandshahr superintendent of police said: "It is sad and horrific. We are trying to come up with something to prevent heinous crimes. Minors are accused in the case."

"In Aurangabad case, four people were named and we have so far arrested two. However, two others who were named in Debai rape case have not been arrested yet."

Both victims have been admitted to a nearby district hospital for medical examination and check-up, added the report.

Police, however, have not shared any further details related both the case and further investigation in on.

Incidents of crimes against women have seen a meteoric rise in Uttar Pradesh. In 2018, crimes against women went up by at least 24 per cent in India's most populous state.

It was reported that at least eight women were raped and 30 abducted every day in Uttar Pradesh while more than 100 FIRs are filed daily.

The rise in such crimes has put the Yogi Adityanath government in pressure as leaders from opposition parties have slammed his government for failing to maintain law and order.
