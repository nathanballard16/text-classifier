Plea of Ayanavaram rape accused dismissed

HC calls discharge petition audacious

The Madras High Court has termed as “audacious” a plea for discharge made by one of the 17 accused in a case booked by the Chennai city police in connection with the alleged gang rape of a less than 12-year-old girl at her residence in an apartment complex at Ayanavaram last year.

Dismissing a revision preferred by the accused Deenadayalan against the Mahila Court’s refusal to discharge him from the case, Justice V. Parthiban said the alleged involvement of the petitioner in the incident which gave rise to the charge of this petitioner and others was not a run off the mill criminal case of sexual assault.

A despicable act

“It is a case which shocked the moral conscience of the society at large when 17 perpetrators have committed an act of abominable sexual assault on the disabled girl who was below 12 years. The way in which the crime was reported to have been committed prima facie appear to be a despicable act of giving vent to their carnal desire... on the hapless victim girl. The alleged act of perpetrators, to put it appropriately, is outrageously inhuman, wickedly laced with unalloyed perversion of the inconceivable kind. Such crimes in society need to be viewed strictly in order to save the children from the predatory sexual instinct of such men in society. Each one of such men, if found guilty, is the evil personified, possessed with depraved and malevolent mind,” said the judge.

Agreeing with the Mahila Court that enough materials existed in the case to make the petitioner face the trial proceedings, the judge said it was not open to the accused to resort to discharge petition as a matter of routine like in any other criminal case. “This court is unable to appreciate as to how this petitioner could resort to such course of action in the face of a grave and repulsive charge slapped on him,” he wondered.
