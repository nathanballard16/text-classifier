Chandigarh, October 30

Even as the gender-neutral Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, treats penetrative assault on any person below 18 years of age as punishable, a 15-year-old minor boy was sent to Juvenile Home at Sector 25 today after a 21-year-old woman alleged rape by the minor on the pretext of marriage.

Initially, the police were in a fix whether to register a case against the woman under the POCSO Act or the minor boy. However, the police apprehended the minor boy today as the woman was the complainant in the case.

A complaint was lodged at the Sector 31 police station yesterday by the victim, who alleged that the boy had raped her at a hotel in Mumbai. Both of them had eloped to Mumbai together. According to the complainant, the minor established sexual relations with her in Mumbai and Bihar, and refused to marry her thereafter.

A case under Sections 376 (1) (rape) and 376 (2) has been registered against the minor. A police official said on condition of anonymity, “This is among the rarest of the rare cases wherein an adult woman is alleging rape on the pretext of marriage by a minor boy. Had the minor boy registered a complaint with the police in the first place, a case against the woman was possible. In the present case, the complainant is the 21-year-old woman. The law is silent on rape allegations on the pretext of marriage by a minor boy on an adult woman.” The matter will now be dealt at the level of the Juvenile Justice Board and the Child Welfare Committee, UT. — TNS

Tricky case: expert

This is a very tricky case and has not been been reported earlier. The POCSO Act is a gender-neutral Act and treats any person below the age of 18 years as a child. As per provisions of the Act, whoever commits penetrative sexual assault on a child is liable for punishment. — Inderjit Bassi, advocate
