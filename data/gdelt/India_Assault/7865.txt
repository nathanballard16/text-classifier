Shocking moment a bear tumbles off a cliff and dies in river below after it is pelted with rocks

A shocking video has emerged of a brown bear falling off a cliff to its death in a river below after being chased by humans in India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state.

The incident occurred on May 10 in Dras town of the state's Kargil district.

Footage that appears to have been shot on a mobile phone shows the bear trying to climb a steep slope when a stone hits it.

The bear loses its balance and tumbles at least 50 feet down the rocky cliff face as its tormentors can be heard cheering in the background.

Reports said the bear, which appears to be an adolescent, later drowned.

It was also reported that local villagers not only chased the animal, but pelted stones as it tried to escape.

Earlier the bear was filmed freeing itself from barbed wire as it was tormented by villagers in India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state

The bear - which is an endangered species in India - ran off but was chased and pelted with rocks by villagers

Earlier in the day, the bear had managed to escape from barbed wire after it became trapped.

However, as soon as it came out, villagers started pelting stones.

Brown bears are listed as critically endangered in India owing to the loss of suitable habitat to humans and fewer protected areas.
