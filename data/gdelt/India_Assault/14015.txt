Supreme Court will today morning, at 10:30 am, pronounce its verdict on a plea by former Tehelka editor Tarun Tejpal seeking quashing of charges against him in the 2013 sexual assault case.

Tejpal is accused of raping a junior colleague in a hotel elevator at the Think Fest annual event organised by the magazine in Goa. On August 9, the day judgment was reserved in the case, Tejpal's lawyer Vikas Singh contended that the allegations of rape against the senior journalist were tailor-made and had no truth.

Justice Arun Mishra then questioned that if he was actually innocent, why did he send a letter of apology to the woman. “If nothing had happened, you would not have sent apologies. Something inappropriate must have happened,” remarked Justice Mishra.

Another bench in the Supreme Court had last year in October stayed the trial in the case, pending its final decision on Tejpal's petition. Senior lawyer Vikas Singh referred to the CCTV footages of the hotel lobby, and argued that it was the complainant who could be seen running after him and that "she is the one who started everything". But the court was not ready to buy the argument.

Tejpal was arrested on November 30, 2013. In September 2017, a trial court in Goa charged him under Sections 376(2) (rape), 354 A (sexual harassment) and 342 (wrongful confinement) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Tejpal had challenged the trial court’s charges in the Supreme Court and sought a discharge from the case. He approached the apex court after Bombay High Court rejected his plea against the framing of charges.
