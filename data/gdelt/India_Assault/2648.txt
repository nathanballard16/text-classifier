Pulwama attack — India exposed

THE dreadful face of India has once again been exposed as it emerged that New Delhi had its soldiers killed and then blamed Pakistan for it. The conversation that took place between Firebrand Indian Television anchor Arnab Goswami and head of the Indian Broadcast Audience Research Council on Whatsapp has brought to fore the whole facts as to how the Indian side orchestrated the Pulwama attack to malign Pakistan and to find excuse to mount an aggression on the neighbouring country. Pakistan stance on the Pulwama attack proved accurate.

On Pulwama incident, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi kept shedding Crocodile tears on bodies of the country’s soldiers and to appease his voters, he resorted to strikes in Balakot. As truth surfaced, the question arises whether Modi will be held accountable for murder of his own soldiers. Is the Indian judiciary independent enough to prosecute the Prime Minister? Given recent judgments including in the case of Babri Mosque, we understand there will be no legal action against Modi, but it is for the people of India to condemn and rise against the BJP’s extremist policies that have not even spared their own soldiers. The Indians must take a clue from their own farmers who are on the roads over last several weeks for protection of their rights.

As Pakistan has now sufficient evidence of all wrongdoings of BJP government, PTI government and Foreign Office must come in full gear to present the case before the world community. Especially we should actively engage with the OIC and other friendly countries and apprise them with the available documents about Indian false narratives, propaganda and terrorism against Pakistan. The heinous crimes committed by the Indian government warrant strict action including sanctions on the part of the United Nations and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). There should not be double standard when dealing with terrorism and extremism.
