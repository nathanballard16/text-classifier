Safety of Kashmiri students: UGC issues advisory

‘Ensure safety of Kashmiri students’

With Kashmiri students facing harassment and assault on campuses in various parts of the country in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, the University Grants Commission (UGC) has issued an advisory, asking Vice-Chancellors to ensure their safety.

“In the context of reports being received through various media regarding the safety of students from Kashmir studying in various higher educational institutions, all Universities and colleges affiliated to them are advised to ensure the safety and protection of the students on the campus,” said the letter, sent on Friday by UGC secretary Rajnish Jain to all Vice-Chancellors. “They may keep a watch on the situation and seek support of law and order machinery in case of any untoward incident.”

Professor Jain also requested the Vice-Chancellors “to look into the matter personally for the safely of the students and maintaining peace and harmony in Universities/Colleges.”

On Wednesday, the Human Resource Development Minister Prakash Javadekar had denied reports of Kashmiri students being harassed and assaulted. “Nothing like that has happened,” he told reporters.

Assault, threats

Two Kashmiri students at a college in Yavatmal, Maharshtra were assaulted and threatened on Wednesday, allegedly by a group of youths affiliated to the Yuva Sena, according to police. In Panipat, a protest march demanded the expulsion of Kashmiri students, and two Dehradun colleges have barred Kashmiris from applying. Reports of large-scale evictions from campuses and hostels in Uttarakhand led to at least 300 Kashmiri students fleeing to Jammu and Delhi.

The Home Ministry had also issued an advisory on Saturday to all States and Union territories to take measures to ensure the safety and security of Kashmiris.
