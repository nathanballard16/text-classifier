The Surat police has filed a case of kidnapping and rape against a fruit seller eight months after he assaulted a 12-year-old girl.

The incident came to light after the victim's parents found out that the girl is pregnant.

The minor, who is eight months pregnant now, was raped by a fruit seller.

The accused took the minor to a farm on the outskirts of the city and raped her. After committing the crime, the man sent the preteen back home in an autorickshaw.

The victim did not inform her family about the incident. The family only came to know after they found out about her pregnancy.

The Surat police has transferred the case to a woman inspector in the crime branch.

The city police commissioner told TOI that the girl is mentally fit hence the police is trying to ascertain why she didn't tell her parents about the crime.
