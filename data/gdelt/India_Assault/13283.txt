Unnao Rape Accused Kuldeep Sengar To Be Moved To Tihar Jail

Kuldeep Sengar was expelled from the BJP last week.

A Delhi court on Monday ordered that Unnao rape accused Kuldeep Singh Sengar be shifted to Tihar jail from the Sitapur prison in Uttar Pradesh.

Both Kuldeep Sengar and his accomplice Shashi Singh were produced in the court after an order by District judge Dinesh Sharma.

Kuldeep Sengar and nine others have been charged for murder by the CBI after the Unnao rape survivor and her advocate were injured in a car accident in Rae Bareli. Her two aunts were killed in the accident.

The Supreme Court had said last week that the trial in case be completed within 45-days.

Besides the main case, two other matters transferred to Delhi are the complaint against the Unnao teen's father under Arms Act and his custodial death.
