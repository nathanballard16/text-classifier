Ahmedabad: Cops form 3 teams to nab rape accused

The city police have formed three teams to investigate the Ramol Gang-rape case in which a 20-year-old was raped by four men at various places after promising to help her clear her exams.



Of the three teams, two have been formed exclusively to track the two other accused Hardik Shukla and one Raj who have been absconding since the case came to light. Investigations have also revealed that Shukla had earlier had several cases registered against him. Since the case came to light, questions have been raised about the conduct of the cops who swung into action only after the 20-year-old died following medical complications arising from an overdose of abortion pills that she had taken.



The college student was allegedly gang-raped last year but a complaint was registered by the victim with Ramol police on March 19, eight months after the incident.



Three weeks before the case was registered the girl had delivered a stillborn child in LG Hospital on February 26. Police have also exhumed the body of the stillborn child to collect DNA samples. DNA samples of Shukla's parents were also collected.



As per the complaint, the 20-year-old victim had failed in two subjects in her second year B Com exams, and the accused won her trust by assuring her help to clear the ATKT (allowed to keep term) exams. They took her to various places under the pretext of meeting different people, and allegedly gang-raped her on several occasions.
