"The state home department had received a communication from the Union Home Ministry ordering dismissal of Bhagora from service on May 29. We had served the order on May 30, which effectively means he was sacked a day before his retirement," MR Soni, deputy secretary (inquiry), Gujarat Home Department said.

This means Bhagora will not get benefits entitled to retired government employees.

Bhagora along with other police officers were convicted by the Bombay High Court after they were found guilty under sections 218 (not performing their duties) and 201 (tampering of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) in the sensational Bilkis Bano gang rape case during the 2002 riots in the state.

The Supreme Court had in 2017 rejected the appeal filed by them and in March this year had asked the Gujarat government to take disciplinary action against five police officials, including Bhagora.

He was accused of covering up the case filed by then 19 years Bilkis who was gang-raped a mob during the 2002 Gujarat riots.

Bhagora allegedly removed all 12 names of the accused named by the victim in the statement she had give to police.

On April 23 the SC had granted Rs 50 lakh compensation and a government job to Bilkis, and had directed the government to file a report on disciplinary action taken against the accused.
