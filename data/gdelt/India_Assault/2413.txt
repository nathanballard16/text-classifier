Mumbai: The Maharashtra Police on Saturday lathi-charged a group of protesters, who were protesting against Pulwama terror attack at Nalasopara station in Palghar district of Maharashtra. Police had to resort to lathi-charge in order to evacuate the rail tracks as attempts to talk to the protesting group had failed.

The terror attack in which at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans were martyred happened on Thursday evening when a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist, identified as Adil Ahmed Dar, rammed his explosives-laden SUV into the bus ferrying CRPF jawans.

The group which started protesting at around 8:20 am was also joined by office-goers who got onto the tracks in order to block the movement of trains. Slogans against Pakistan were raised during the protest.

The protesters also shouted slogans of 'Bharat mata ki jai'. They further demanded action against Pakistan for sponsoring and sheltering terrorists and terror groups.

"The agitation is likely to affect the schedule of the long-distance trains as well," an official, meanwhile, said.

In an official tweet earlier today, the Western Railways had informed that Government Railway Police (GRP) and Railway Protection Force Personnel were deployed to evacuate the rail tracks. They had informed that they were trying to pacify the protestors so that train movement can be resumed.

Meanwhile, chief spokesperson of the WR, Ravinder Bhakar, said: "Trains are not operating between Nalasopara and Virar stations, while services between Vasai to Churchgate are normal. Forces have been called in to disperse the agitating crowd."



The Times of India reported that state transport buses and auto-rickshaws were also prevented from plying in the Vasai area today. Additionally, in the Vasai-Virar region, Shiv Sena has called for a bandh.
