Hyderabad: A most tragic instance has come to light from Hyderabad city where a 19-year-old pregnant housewife set herself ablaze allegedly after her husband and in-laws harassed her over money. Police officials familiar with the matter said that the incident took place on May 21 and the woman is currently undergoing treatment at a local hospital for burns incurred during the incident.

The couple had been fighting for several weeks which led her to leave her husband's home and move in with her mother. However, the husband arrived at her mother's home on April 21 and the couple got into a heated argument over her refusal to return to his home. In a fit of rage, the husband threatened to commit suicide by setting himself ablaze with the use of fuel he had brought with him.

However, the woman snatched the bottle of fuel, poured it on herself and set herself ablaze, confirmed police officials. In the meantime, a case under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) has been registered against the accused and an investigation into the matter is underway. More details in this regard are awaited.

In May of this year, a 33-year-old woman from Pune set herself on fire after repeated mental and physical abuse by her husband. The incident took place in the Pimpri-Chinchwad area of Pune city in Maharashtra. Married for nine whole years, the couple had a nine-year-old child. An inquiry by police revealed that the couple fought regularly which led to tensions between the woman and her in-laws. On the day of one such argument, the woman decided to consume pesticide which was meant to kill ants. She then called on her husband to return home from work and in the meantime, set herself ablaze using a can of petrol she had bought earlier that day.
