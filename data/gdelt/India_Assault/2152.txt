Pulwama attack second worst attack on CRPF after 2010 Dantewada blast

A landmine explosion was set off by Maoists in April 2010, in which 75 CRPF personnel were martyred.

The deadly terror attack on Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Kashmir’s Pulwama that shook India to its core on Thursday, is the second biggest attack on the paramilitary force, since the Dantewada attacks, reports said. The attack targeting the CRPF is the second worst for the force in the last nine years. Prior to this, an even intense attack took place in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada in the year 2010. The attack had occurred when over 80 officers from the central paramilitary force and a local police group were conducting an area domination exercise in the Bastar tribal region of the Indian state of Chhattisgarh.
