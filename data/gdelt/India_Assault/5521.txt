Tujhse Hai Raabta March 25, 2019 Written Update: Anupriya to be burnt alive

In the previous episode, we see how Anupriya revealed the source of Kalyani’s poison while risking to be the reason of Malhar’s suspicion. Later, Sampada locks Anupriya and Keshav in the temple, with an intention to belittle Anupriya’s character. Keshav breaks the temple window and just when Anupriya climbed through to the window, Sampada along with few village men enters. Sampada pretends to be shocked to see Anupriya inside and on her instruction, the men blackened their faces. The men tie Anupriya and Keshav and Sampada announced Anupriya’s intention to spend the night with a stranger in front of Aao Saheb and the villagers.

Here, Kalyani learns about Anupriya being caught by the villagers and goes to Anupriya’s rescue. Kalyani tries to explain the villagers that it was Atharva’s evil plan to humiliate Anupriya, but they were adamant to teach them a lesson. The villagers plan to hit Anupriya to teach her a lesson, just when Aao Saheb comes and backs Anupriya. Aao Saheb tells Anupriya to say something in her defence but seeing Anupriya quiet, the villagers demand death sentence for their crime. Aao Saheb requests the sarpanj to stop the villagers, who on the contrary, tells Aao Saheb that the matter had escalated beyond his capabilities. Atharva had planned his moves carefully by involving the innocent villagers in his plan to belittle Anupriya.

Seeing the villagers fuming, Atharva and Sampada rejoice their victory to get Anupriya insulted in front of the entire village. They started throwing stones and bricks on them while Aao Saheb pleaded for help. Just when the enraged villagers threw stones on Anupriya and Keshav, Kalyani comes running and finds Anupriya in trouble.
