Malappuram, Sep 23: A minor girl has been allegedly sexually assaulted by a group of around 30 people for over two years in Kerala's Malappuram district.

The incident came to light when the locals alerted the PTA members of the school where she was studying and the teachers started noticing that the girl was often missing her classes.

Following this, the school authorities decided to hand over the information to child-line authorities. Reportedly, when the volunteers at the child-line counselled the minor, she revealed horrific details of sexual harassment.
