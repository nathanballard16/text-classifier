Packard Foundation offers $875K fellowship to Indian-American biologist Ankur Jain

Rabindranath Tagore was the first Indian to get a Nobel Prize in 1913, and in his area of expertise - Literature. He won the award for "his profoundly sensitive, fresh and beautiful verse, by which, with consummate skill, he has made his poetic thought, expressed in his own English words, a part of the literature of the West".







While he originally wrote in Bengali, Tagore reached out to a wider audience in the West with his translation of poetry that conveyed 'the peace of the soul in harmony with nature'. The Swedish academy, on its website, says that 'Tagore's writing is deeply rooted in both Indian and Western learning traditions'.







Born in 1861, the Calcutta-born writer was well known for fiction in the form of poetry, songs, stories, dramas, and it included portrayals of people's lives, literary criticism, philosophy and social issues.







Tagore was home-schooled, but went to England for formal education. However, he didn't complete his studies there. His inclination towards humanity and social reforms increased when he started managing the family estates. He often participated in the Indian nationalist movement, and Mahatma Gandhi was his dear friend. The then British Government in 1915 honoured Tagore with knighthood, but he returned it within a few years as a sign of protest against British policies in the country.







He passed away in 1941 at the age of 80.
