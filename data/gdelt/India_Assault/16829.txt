Autopsy confirms murder, victim’s identity still a mystery

Ludhiana: Nine days after a man was found dead in the fields near Gill village in Ludhiana, Dehlon police late on Wednesday evening booked unidentified persons for strangulating the man to death. The case was registered after the autopsy confirmed that the vicitm, yet to be identified, was murdered.

In his police complaint, Gurpreet Singh, a farmer of Gill area, said he had taken a land of Dharampal Singh of Gill bypass on contract. On October 1, Yaqood Muhammad of Daliya, now living at Gill, called him over the phone and told him about an unidentified body lying in his fields.

The complainant said he reached the spot and later informed Marado police post. Surinder Singh from Marado police post recorded Gurpreet’s statement following which the police started proceedings under Section 174 of CrPC.

He said the body was kept in Dehlon civil hospital for identification, but he couldn’t be identified in stipulated time after which police got his post-mortem examination done at the civil hospital in Ludhiana.

Later, police registered a case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Prithpal Singh, in-charge, Marado police post, said they have put up posters and have sent teams to factories to get clue about his identity. He said the victim seems to be in his mid-30s.

Police officials said since there are no CCTV cameras around the crime spot, tracing the accused is proving to be a difficult task.

Cops said apparently the accused might have murdered the man at some other place and disposed of his body in the fields.
