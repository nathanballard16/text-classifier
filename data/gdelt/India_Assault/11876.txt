50 years later, moon landing still is awesome

On July 20 of this year the United States (and much of the world) will remember and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the day a man walked on the moon for the very first time. After many millennia, humanity finally broke the bonds of earth and put one of its species on a planetary body other than earth. The accomplishment was a major triumph for the United States and a reaffirmation of what this country can achieve. Project Apollo is arguably the greatest technological achievement in human history.

A new and young president, John F. Kennedy, had the task of leading this country during the Cold War. A race to space was part of the Cold War and Kennedy gave the nation a challenge while addressing Congress on May 25, 1961. He said, “We will land a man on the moon and return him safely to earth before the end of the decade.” Project Apollo was a big and expensive commitment. Launching six “moon shots” and placing 12 men on the moon cost an estimated $25.4 billion ($153 billion in 2018 dollars) and at its peak employed 400,000 people. Remarkably, only three astronauts died and those deaths occurred during a training exercise.
