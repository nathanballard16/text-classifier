Major terror attack averted after security forces recover 15 kg explosives at Jammu bus stand

A major attack has been foiled after security forces recovered around 15 kg of explosives at Jammu bus stand on Tuesday.

According to reports, the explosive was found in a bus which had arrived from Kathua's Billawar.

Earlier on September 23, security forces averted another terror attack in the Valley after they recovered 40 kg of explosives from Jammu and Kashmir's (J&K) Kathua region.

Ever since India's move on Article 370, Pakistan backed terror groups are desperately trying to infiltrate terrorists into the Valley, trying to destabilise the situation.

Meanwhile, in another incident, a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel sustained minor injuries in ceasefire violation by Pakistan at Manyari post of Hiranagar in Kathua district, last night.

Constable Abhishek Roy, who received splinter injuries, is undergoing treatment at JMC hospital. His condition is reported to be normal.

The Pakistani rangers violated ceasefire by firing 54 HE bombs, and 33 Rds with small weapons. The BSF troops strongly retaliated to the firing.
