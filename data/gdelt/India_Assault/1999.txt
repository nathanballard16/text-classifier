Stranded passengers shout pro-Pakistan, freedom slogans

Jammu, February 12, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, stranded Kashmiri passengers and students of Gandhi Memorial Science College shouted pro-Pakistan slogans during an anti-India demonstration in Jammu. The passengers, stranded for the past six days due to closure of Srinagar-Jammu highway, had assembled near the hostel adjoining the Geography department of the college.

A police official confirmed that passengers shouted pro-Pakistan and pro-freedom slogans on the occasion. Several protesting students were injured when Indian police resorted to baton charge against them. Two cases were registered at police station Nowabad, Jammu, over the raising of anti-India slogans.

Meanwhile, the Chairman of Hurriyat forum, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, in a statement criticised the local administration for failing to provide relief and help to thousands of people stranded on the Srinagar-Jammu highway for the past several days.

“It is incumbent upon those who have blocked our natural routes to outside world and made us solely dependent on this artificial route (Srinagar-Jammu highway) mostly closed in winter due to weather vagaries, to take responsibility of the dire consequences that people of Kashmir have to face and at least provide them with relief and help till they reach home,” he said.
