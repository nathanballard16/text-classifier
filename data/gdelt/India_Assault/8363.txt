6 to spend life in jail for gang rape of 5 NGO workers

RANCHI: A Khunti court on Friday sentenced a Christian priest and five local youths to jail for the rest of their lives in the Kochang gang rape case involving five women artists of an NGO.While the priest, Father Alphonse Aind, has been sentenced for conspiracy, three youths have been punished for gang rape and two for abetment.The women were performing a street play on June 19 last year to spread awareness against human trafficking in the remote Kochang village of Khunti district when they were abducted and gang-raped.In his 225-page judgment, additional district judge Rajesh Kumar said that conspirators should get the same punishment as the rapists, announcing the sentence for Aind under Section 120B (criminal conspiracy) and Section 376D (rape) even though he was not there at the spot of the crime.The judge also imposed a fine of Rs 1 lakh on Aind failing which he will have to undergo an additional jail term of two years. Besides, he was also sentenced to a seven-year jail term under Sections 354B (disrobing) and 365 (kidnapping) of the IPC and a one-year jail term for voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraint. All terms would run concurrently.The three rapists — Junas Munda, Ayub Purti and Baji Samad — were also fined Rs 1 lakh each under Section 376(D), apart from the life sentence.The other two convicts, John Jonas Tiru and Balram Samad, who are alleged supporters of Pathalgarhi (a movement for tribal autonomy), were sentenced under sections related to abetment of crime. They got life term under Section 376(D) read with other sections of the IPC.Public prosecutor Sushil Kumar Jaiswal said the court was convinced about Aind’s involvement in the conspiracy. “Aind did not inform anyone, including police, even though he possessed a mobile phone, after the women were kidnapped. He also took no action when the victims were brought back after being raped. The evidences produced by us convinced the court of his involvement. The verdict would assure the rape survivors that rule of law exists in the country,” he said.The fine paid by the convicts would be given to the survivors, the judge said, adding that he has written to the District Legal Services Authority to work towards their rehabilitation.
