Madhu Kishwar asks if Arya Stark from Game Of Thrones is blind Kashmiri girl. Internet dies laughing

Anyone who uses Twitter knows that anything that is there on the internet doesn’t automatically mean that it is true. And anyone who has seen the widely acclaimed series Game Of Thrones, is aware of who Arya Stark is. But not Madhu Kishwar, a noted scholar and activist, it seems.

With the recent developments around Article 370, social media is dealing with an epidemic of fake news. And Madhu Kishwar, who has earlier taken fake news at face value, was almost duped yet again. However, this time around, she asked for a 'fact ckeck' on the tweet in question.

Madhu retweeted the picture of a 'Kashmiri girl, who according to the tweet, 'went blind after she was hit by pellet gun'. Only that the girl in the picture was none other than the popular character from Game Of Thrones, Arya Stark - played by Maisie Williams.

This looks too filmy to be true. Would like @FactCheckIndia

to confirm if this is real victim. What are Zakat Funds used for if not for poor and vulnerable? https://t.co/5Q8JkqGABl MadhuPurnima Kishwar (@madhukishwar) August 5, 2019

The tweet said, "Kashmiri girl who became blind after she was hit by pellet gun, her brothers, father & mother were mercilessly killed, her sister was raped by Indian Army now begging on street of Srinagar. Where is Humanity? #KashmirUnderThreat #OperationKashmir #IndiaUsingClusterBombs."

Madhu even went forward and asked Fact Check India to confirm if the victim was real.

She tweeted, "This looks too filmy to be true. Would like @FactCheckIndia to confirm if this is real victim? What are Zakat Funds used for if not for poor and vulnerable?"

The picture was tweeted by an account called Zaidu, with a bio saying, "All Tweets are for fun 100% fake imaginary, resemblance to any person dead or alive is purely coincidental." But looks like Madhu missed that, and she tweeted to a Fact Check website to clarify the same.

But her followers were better informed than her (and obviously knew who Arya Stark was) and were quick enough to correct Kishwar. Here’s what people are saying:
