Tension in Parassala after CPI(M)-BJP clashes

Houses and vehicles of four CPI(M) activists vandalised

Tension continued to prevail in Parassala and nearby places in the aftermath of clashes between CPI (M) and BJP activists, prompting the police to tighten security in the region.

A day after seven workers of both parties were injured in a clash that took place at Inchivila, the houses and vehicles of four activists, including Parassala grama panchayat president S. Suresh of the CPI (M), were vandalised by unidentified persons early Monday.

In view of the situation, the Thiruvananthapuram rural police have launched concerted efforts to resolve the issue and bring to book those responsible for the clashes.

Two BJP workers, identified as Santhosh, 36, of Inchivila, and Girikumar, 39, of Parassala, were arrested and remanded in connection with the incident.

Four CPI (M) and three BJP workers sustained injuries in a clash that had taken place in Inchivila on Sunday evening.

One among them, Abu Tahir, a district committee member of the Students Federation of India (SFI), suffered head injuries after being hacked using sharp objects.

Manhandled

The police believed the issue to have borne out of an argument that had taken place among workers of both parties a few days ago, following which a BJP worker had been allegedly manhandled. District Police Chief (Thiruvananthapuram rural) B. Asokan said that the situation was under control and steps have been adopted to ensure that the feud did not extend to other places. Efforts were also under way to broker peace among the parties.
