16-day-old infant's body found in gutter

The body of a 16-year-old infant, who went missing on Tuesday, was recovered from a gutter near her home a day later.

A case of abduction and murder has been registered by the Sion police against unknown persons, the Mumbai Mirror reported.

Police said that the prematurely born infant was allegedly abducted from her house. The mother of the infant reportedly claimed that the baby was taken away from her within a few minutes of birth.

The family alleged that they had searched for the baby along with neighbours, but was unable to find the baby. The police also lodged an abduction case and started a search operation.

Following the police search, the body was recovered from a gutter and was identified by the family.

The police are now awaiting the post-mortem report, and suspect the crime to have been committed by someone close to the family, including the mother, who is being interrogated.



"We believe the crime is committed by someone who is known to the family and the purpose to commit the crime could be personal enmity. We have some vital leads in the case and will soon bring the culprit to book," said an officer, as quoted by Mumbai Mirror.
