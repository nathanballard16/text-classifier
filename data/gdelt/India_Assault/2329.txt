J&K attack: Condolence meet held in MP; Aishwarya pays

A condolence meeting to pay homage to the CRPF jawans martyred in the Pulwama terror attack was held Friday in Itarsi town in Madhya Pradesh at the site where Prime Minister Narendra Modi was scheduled to address a public rally.

In Indore, noted Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai- Bachchan paid tributes to the martyred jawans at a programme of a private university.

Addressing the meeting in Itarsi, Madhya Pradesh BJP president Rakesh Singh termed the deadly attack on a bus ferrying CRPF jawans as "very unfortunate".

The Lok Sabha MP from Jabalpur said suitable action will follow, but the people of the country will always remember the sacrifice made by the CRPF jawans.

The prime minister was supposed to address a public rally at the Railway Ground in Itarsi, but it was cancelled in view of the Pulwama attack. The condolence meeting took place at the same venue.

Modi's another meeting in MP's Dhar district on Saturday, too, has been cancelled.

Meanwhile, at the Indore programme, Aishwarya paid tributes to the martyred jawans by holding a lit candle in her hand.

The actress was in Indore as chief guest at the World Management and Commerce Conference organised by the Sage University.

Petrol pumps in Indore also paid tributes to the martyred jawans by not selling fuel from 3 pm to 3.15 pm.

Protests demanding stern action against the perpetrators of the deadly terror attack in Pulwama were held in different cities of the state.

Forty CRPF personnel were killed and five injured in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, when a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into their bus in Pulwama district.
