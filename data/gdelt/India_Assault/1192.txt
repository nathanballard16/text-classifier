Plea seeks probe into sexual abuse of children, nuns by clergy

A petition filed in the Delhi High Court has sought a thorough investigation by the CBI or a Special Investigation Team (SIT) into alleged sexual abuse of children and nuns by the clergy.

The plea, which is listed for hearing on Tuesday before the High Court, claimed that a nun’s complaint of alleged sexual abuse by a Catholic priest was ignored by the church here.

Petitioner Sanjjiiv Kkumaar also sought direction to the Delhi Police Commissioner to set up a ‘clergy abuse hotline’ so that sexually abused victims and survivors “may come forward to seek justice by registering their grievance and any person may give leads/tips to the law enforcement agency.”

He claimed that there was an allegation of sexual abuse in a Catholic retreat centre in Delhi which required to be investigated and the victim nun had written an anonymous letter to church authorities who chose not to act “against the perpetrator”.

The plea alleged that the inaction of church authorities is against the principle of natural justice and the victims have found it impossible to get their allegations taken seriously by the Catholic churches.

The plea referred to the case of Bishop Franco Mulakkal, who is an accused in Kerala nun rape case and currently out on bail, and said he was appointed as auxiliary bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Delhi in January 2009.

It claimed that there was a “possibility” that the bishop, who allegedly raped the Kerala nun 13 times between 2014 and 2016 during his visits to a convent in Kottayam district in Kerala, would have done the same to many children and women during his period as auxiliary bishop in Delhi.
