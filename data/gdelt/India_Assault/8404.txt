Girl, 14, raped by 3 men after her FAMILY sold her for £1,700

A 14-year-old girl with a blind father and disabled mother was raped repeatedly after her family sold her into sex slavery for just £1,700.

The girl was sold a total of three times in Rajasthan, India, after her "desperate" relatives convinced her parents to hand her over to human traffickers, reports the Times of India.

She changed hands for 1.5 Lakh, the equivalent of £1,681.50, police officer Jagdish Prasad, said.

The girl is believed to be from the upper Dalit class.

Mr Prasad said: "About three months ago their relatives convinced the desperate family to sell their daughter for RS 1.5 lakh to human traffickers.

"She was brought to Bharatpur where she was raped by one person."

She was then sold to another man who raped her before she was passed again.

The brave youngster managed to escape from this house and raise the alarm.

She is believed to have handed over a raft of evidence to police, including the phone numbers of her attackers.

Three people have been arrested for rape of a minor while others have been arrested for trafficking and illegal confinement of a minor, Mr Prasad said.

During an interrogation one of the accused told police that in many villages in the area young, poor girls are trafficked and forced to marry older men.

This comes after another Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped in front of her husband by five men last month in Rajasthan.

The attackers also filmed the incident.
