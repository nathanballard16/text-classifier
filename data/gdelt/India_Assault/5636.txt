The northernmost state of the country, Jammu and Kashmir, sends six members to the Parliament and none of these seats is reserved.

The northernmost state of the country, Jammu and Kashmir, sends six members to the Parliament and none of these seats is reserved. The state also has 87 Assembly constituencies.

Spread primarily across the Himalayan mountains, this state is at the centre of a border dispute between India, China and Pakistan. According to data from the Census 2011, of the total area of the state, 78,114 sqkm is under illegal occupation of Pakistan, 5,180 sqkm is illegally handed over by Pakistan to China and 37,555 sqkm is under illegal occupation of China in Leh (Ladakh) district.

The state can be divided into three primary divisions -- Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh. Jammu and Kashmir has a population of 1,01,43,700. Of this, around 67 percent practice Islam, 30 percent are Hindus and 1.36 percent are Buddhists. The state also enjoys a special status.

Under pressure from separatists and under attack from militants, the state is gearing for one of its most important elections in 2019. In the last election in 2014, the National Conference (NC) and Congress lost to the Narendra Modi-wave when BJP caught hold of the Jammu and Udhampur seats. However, the grand old party is expecting to change that this election. Meanwhile, the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) led by Mehbooba Mufti, has stayed away from the Jammu and Udhampur seats by not fielding any candidates.
