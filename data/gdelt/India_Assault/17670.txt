Youth rapes 5-yr-old cousin, family reports case after 25 days

Ludhiana: A 19-year-old youth allegedly raped his 5-year-old cousin after taking her to his house. As the girl’s family did not report the incident to the police for 25 days, cops have been left to make wild guesses about the assaulter’s whereabouts.

On Tuesday, the family lodged a complaint when neighbours, who had allegedly witnessed the crime, kept telling them to report the case and sought action against the accused’s family for helping him flee.

The police registered a case under Sections 376 (rape) of the IPC and Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act against the 19-year-old accused.

In his complaint, the father of 5-year-old girl claimed the incident occurred on October 4 when his daughter was playing outside the house. The youth who lived in the adjoining house accused took her inside his house and raped her, the father alleged. That time, some areas residents saw the crime and raised the alarm, following which the accused fled.

Inspector Parmod Kumar said the families of both the accused and rape survivor were aware of the incident, however since they were relatives, the father did not approach the police.

“Some of the area residents, who had seen the accused raping the girl, kept telling the girl’s father to lodge a complaint. On Tuesday, neighbours took family along to the police station and gave a written complaint,” the inspector added.

The inspector claimed that the residents have alleged that family of accused helped him flee. As the accused hailed from Uttar Pradesh, the police suspected that he might have gone there. The accused will soon be traced and arrested.

The official said if the family had informed the police in time, the accused would have been arrested by now.
