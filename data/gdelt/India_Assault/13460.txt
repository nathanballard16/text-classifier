Ludhiana: The CIA-1 arrested infamous gangster Vijay Sidhu alias Chota Lalla with a .32 bore pistol and three live cartridges on Tuesday evening from near Dussehra Ground in Upkar Nagar following a tip-off. According to officials, he had came out of jail on bail two months ago, and after coming out, he again procured a weapon to attack his rivals.

The official added that on December 24 last year, Lalla shot at Jasdev Kumar Jimmy of Naali Mohalla near Damoria bridge. Lalla and his accomplices were snatching Rs22,000 from Jimmy’s friend, and when Jimmy confronted Lalla, the latter shot at him thrice, out of which one bullet hit Jimmy. Division 1 police had arrested Lalla on December 30 in that case. He was lodged in jail, but came out on bail two months ago.

CIA-1 in-charge, sub-inspector Avtar Singh said: “After coming out on bail, Lalla got another weapon. The accused had confessed he had a rivalry with several persons, therefore he got the weapon and cartridges to attack his rivals. Lalla also worked on contract to assault people for money. He is also facing trials in two cases of ‘attempt to murder’.” Avtar added that On June 7, 2015, Lalla was sentenced to 10 years jail in an NDPS case.
