A 15-year-old Dalit girl was allegedly gangraped by three youths in a village in Kaushambi district on Saturday.

The station house officer (SHO) of the local police station told The Indian Express that the accused also made a video of the incident.

“According to a complaint lodged by the victim’s mother, the three youths took turns to rape her daughter and also shot a video of the incident. They then fled firing in the air with a country-made pistol. They also threatened to kill the girl if she told anyone about the incident,” said the officer.
