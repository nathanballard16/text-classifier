Stoning of mosque: CPI(M) seeks probe

The Kozhikode district committee of the CPI(M) has sought a detailed probe into the alleged stoning of a mosque at Perambra during the Sabarimala Karma Samithi-sponsored hartal on January 3.

Athul Das, a branch committee secretary of the party, was arrested in connection with the violence that preceded the episode and he had been accused of being involved in the stoning of the mosque.

CPI(M) district secretary P. Mohanan said in a release on Sunday that there had been tension at Perambra town during the marches taken out by the Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and the United Democratic Front (UDF) on January 3.

Some buildings were damaged when activists of both the groups threw stones against each other. A portion of the front arch of the mosque too was damaged though it was not clear who was responsible for it, Mr. Mohanan pointed out.

The CPI(M) leader alleged that Mr. Das was arrested on the basis of a complaint filed by local Indian Union Muslim League leaders, who had a grudge against him.
