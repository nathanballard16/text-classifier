‘Want my daughter to thrash both rapists’

Traders in Mandvi area in Vadodara set off crackers and distributed sweets after the alleged rapists were arrested

Vadodara: Mother of the 14-year-old girl, who was gang-raped in Navlakhi on the night of November 28, wants the accused duo to be hanged for the heinous crime they committed.

“What happened with the accused in Hyderabad gang rape was good. But that was very quick death for them. The men, who raped my daughter, should be thrashed. I want my daughter and her father to thrash the accused. They should be publicly shamed and then given death sentence,” the enraged mother said.

“Since the day of the incident, we all haven’t been able to sleep properly. My daughter has a long life ahead and I hope that she recovers from the ordeal she went through. I am taking good care and trying to comfort her,” she added. The rape survivor was in trauma after complaint of rape was filed at Raopura police station. She had to go through hundreds of sketches and also view faces of dozens of men to identify the accused.

“We are happy that the accused have been finally caught. But I am yet to come face to face with the duo,” she said. “Don’t such people think that they too have females in their family? Why should a woman always suffer and be scared of moving out alone?” she questioned. Family of the minor girl was all praises for Vadodara police and said that they were very helpful.

“The government, though, should do more for women’s safety. I hope that lights and CCTVs will be installed at Navlakhi Ground and other isolated spots soon,” the girl’s mother said.

The neighbours also praised the cops for arresting the accused and said they were expecting maximum punishment for the duo.
