MANGALURU: Some recent crimes, including the one in which a spurned lover stabbed a girl, have led police to conclude they were committed under the influence of drugs . The huge number of seizures of drugs like ganja and cocaine in the district has one have raised concerns over rampant drug abuse in the region.Activists say police aren’t taking enough measures. Most victims are youths especially college and school students.Members of DYFI, who staged a protest on Friday, alleged that drug users were involved in the Puttur student gang rape case, stabbing of a student in Derlakatte and other incidents in the recent past. They alleged that many crimes in Dakshina Kannada are at the instance of drug peddlers and youths are targets.City and district police are being tipped off by members of the public about gangs consuming ganja and creating a nuisance. The Friday phone-in by Mangaluru City Police gets such complaints every week. A few weeks ago, a caller complained about a gang of 7-8 members consuming drugs and troubling passersby in Kuloor. Another caller on Friday informed police that public places near NIT-K, Surathkal, Kulur and Krishnanagar are turning into havens for drug consumers.Another activist pointed out that over the past few years, ganja (marijuana) was the only available illegal drug. However, over the past year, Mangaluru City Police have cracked down on sale of synthetic drugs including MDMA (Ecstasy), LSD stamps and MDM pills.

Every year, the number of drug seizures is going north, a clear sign that drug abuse struck deep roots in the coastal districts. Activists and doctors said many youngsters in the city have fallen prey to drugs. Some in rehabilitation centres are between 18 years and 30 years.While the widely available marijuana comes from Shivamogga, Andhra, Odisha, Ballari and Kerala, synthetic drugs come from Goa and Maharashtra. “Youngsters are the primary targets and peddlers hang around near educational institutions to sell their stuff,” said a source in the police department.We’re cracking down on substance abuse and sale of illegal drugs in the city.
