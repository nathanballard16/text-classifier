New Delhi: Big blow for former Tehelka magazine editor Tarun Tejpal as the Supreme Court has refused to quash charges against him in the 2013 sexual assault case. The bench has also lifted the stay of the trial which means it will now recommence in a Goa court.

The Apex Court has also mentioned that the trial in the case is to be concluded in a period of six months. The bench comprised of Justices Arun Mishra, M R Shah and B R Gavai, refused to interfere with the judgement of the Goa High Court. They had upheld the September 2017 order of Sessions Judge of framing charges against Tejpal for rape. According to a report, the bench has termed the offence as 'morally abhorrent' and an assault on the victim's privacy.

Tejpal was charged with rape, sexual harassment and wrongful restraint. He was accused of raping a junior colleague in a hotel elevator at the Think Fest- annual event organised by the magazine in Goa on November 7, 2013. Tejpal's lawyer Vikas Singh contended that the allegations levelled against the senior journalist were tailor-made and an attempt to malign his image. A bench in the Supreme Court in October last year had stayed the trial in the case.
