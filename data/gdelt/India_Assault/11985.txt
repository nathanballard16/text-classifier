Goa shack worker gets 10-year term 11 years after Scarlett death

GOA: Bringing the 11-year-old case of drugging, sexual assault and killing of a British teenager to a close, the high court of Bombay at Goa on Friday sentenced the convict, Samson D'Souza, to 10-year rigorous imprisonment.Special public prosecutor representing the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI E Khan argued that D'Souza deserved no leniency since he consciously committed all the acts on the child. He added that a strong signal should go out to deter others from committing similar crimes.Pressing for compensation for the victim’s mother, he said the she being a foreigner had to run from pillar to post to seek justice in the extreme circumstances and went through severe pain and inconvenience in a foreign land.Advocate Shailendra Bhobe, representing D'Souza, argued before the division bench comprising Justices RD Dhanuka and Prithviraj K Chavan that D'Souza deserved a chance at reformation, because he is the only earning member of his family, comprising wife and 12-year-old child, and has taken up a job as a scuba diving instructor.D'Souza, then a 28-year-old bartender working at Luis Shack at Anjuna beach, was convicted by the high court on Wednesday for administering drugs, sexual assault, culpable homicide not amounting to murder and destruction of evidence, overturning a lower court's verdict acquitting him.The HC upheld the judgment of the lower court, acquitting the other accused Placido Carvalho for abetment of sexual assault.The half-clad body of the 15-year-old was found on Anjuna beach in February, 2008.It was the case of the prosecution that the accused administered Keeling cocaine lines, ecstasy tablets and beer, sexually assaulted her and left her near the water line on the beach and then removed his chappals thereby causing disappearance of evidence.The post-mortem revealed cocaine and ethyl alcohol were found in her body.
