It is understood the horror killing happened in Ajnashuli, West Bengal, when villagers filmed the elephant with its newborn.

Reports said the mum gave birth to the weak calf at a dry late and had tried to move it to a nearby stretch of forest.

The elephant can be seen struggling to get the calf to stand and move away from the onlookers as they appeared the mum and calf.

Local reports claim 27-year-old Shalier Mahalo was crushed to death when the elephant lashed out and attacked the onlookers.
