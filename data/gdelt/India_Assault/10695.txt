Lookout notice for son of Kerala CPI(M) leader Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in rape case

The Mumbai Police has issued a lookout notice against Binoy Kodiyeri, the elder son of Kerala CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, on Wednesday. Kodiyeri is facing charges of rape and has been absconding since a case was registered against him at Oshiwara police station in Mumbai.

A 33-year-old complainant has accused Binoy of repeatedly raping her for years on the pretext of marriage. She also claimed to have an eight-year-old child from the relationship.

In her written complaint to Mumbai Police, the victim stated that she met Binoy in 2009 while working for a dance bar in Dubai. After wooing her with promises of marriage, he allegedly convinced the victim to enter a consensual physical relationship. In 2010, she was brought to Mumbai and provided a rented accommodation. A year later, she gave birth to a boy. Binoy allegedly continued to exploit her physically on the false pretext of getting married till January 2018.

A Team of two officers of Mumbai Police had also visited Binoy's ancestral home at Thiruvangad in Kannur district of Kerala with a notice asking him to appear within 72 hours before the investigating agency probing the case. Mumbai Police is also seeking permission to conduct DNA test of Binoy to ascertain if the victim's child belongs to him as claimed.

Binoy, who denied all the allegations, has already moved court for anticipatory bail. The Sessions Court, Dindoshi is to hear the matter today.
