COIMBATORE: The district mahila court has directed collector K Rajamani to provide Rs 1 lakh to the family of seven-year-old girl, who was raped and murdered at Pannimadai on the outskirts of the city in March, as interim relief. This is in addition to the Rs 3 lakh solatium announced by chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami.The ruling came while disposing of a petition filed by three advocates in the city on April 30. About a month ago, advocates Balamurugan, Sheela Raj and Sekar Annadurai had approached the principal district judge R Sakthivel, urging him to direct the state government to provide interim relief to the family members of the victim in accordance with the Tamil Nadu victim compensation scheme for women victims/survivors of sexual assault/other crimes, 2018.As per the scheme, the victim’s family members are entitled to get anywhere between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 10 lakh as interim relief, said a court source. Shortly after the petition was filed, it was transferred to the district mahila court and judge Sridevi directed the collector to provide the interim relief to the girl’s family, the source said.The victim, who was playing with her younger sister after school hours near her house at Pannimadai, went missing in March. She was found murdered a few meters away from their house next morning. The autopsy report revealed that the girl was raped before being murdered. Police then arrested their neighbour Santhosh Kumar, who confessed to the crime.In another case, the judge directed the collector to provide Rs 30,000 as interim relief to the family of a four-year-old girl, who was sexually assaulted by a school van driver and helper. The victim, an LKG student, was sexually assaulted in her school van after being sedated by the driver and helper near Karamadai. The driver Govindaraj and helper Marimuthu were arrested in the case.
