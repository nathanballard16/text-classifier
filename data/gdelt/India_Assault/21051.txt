As Assam Continues To Singe Over CAB, Modi-Abe Guwahati Summit Postponed

New Delhi:

As Assam continued to singe over the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill or CAB, the India-Japan summit which was scheduled to be held in Guwahati from December 15 to 17, has been postponed. "With reference to the proposed visit of Japanese PM Shinzo Abe to India, both sides have decided to defer the visit to a mutually convenient date in the near future," MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said.

The state of Assam is burning over the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, that seeks to grant Indian citizenship to illegal non-Muslim migrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan. The bill has become an act after getting the nod from the President on Thursday.

The protesters vandalised posters of the India-Japan summit and set aflame the makeshift stage that had been constructed for the event in Guwahati.

The anti-CAB protesters clashed with the police and set afire several government vehicles. It is being said that the magnitude of the protests is the same as the violent six-year movement that resulted in the signing of the Assam accord in 1985.

The protesters attacked the house of Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal. They also pelted stones at the houses of several BJP leaders. The house of Union minister Rameswar Teli in Assam's Duliajan was also attacked by the anti-CAB protesters.

An indefinite curfew has been imposed in Guwahati and internet services has been suspended in 10 districts of Assam in a bid to curb communication between the protesters. The people of north eastern states, especially Assam and Tripura are demanding revocation of the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill as they fear being "overrun" by non-Muslims from neighbouring Bangladesh.
