Ludhiana: ‘Got no help from MEA & embassy’

LUDHIANA: A pall of gloom has descended on a house in Kubba village of Samrala after the family came to know of their son’s beheading by Saudi Arabian authorities.Accusing the ministry of external affairs ( MEA ) and the Indian embassy of inaction, Harjeet Singh ’s family said he was punished for a crime he did not commit.The ministry confirmed on Monday that two persons from Punjab — Harjeet and Satwinder Kumar of Hoshiarpur — had been beheaded in Saudi Arabia on murder charge.An unemployed Harjeet had moved to Saudi Arabia in 2007. “He was 21-year-old then. We had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh to send Harjeet there. After a company, Al Majda, hired him as a driver, I left my job to look after our elderly parents. I was a havildar with Army,” said his brother Gurdev Singh, 47.Since 2007, Harjeet visited home only once — in 2012, when he got engaged. “The engagement soon broke off as the woman’s family wanted an early marriage. My brother, who was the youngest of the six siblings, couldn’t even attend the marriage of our three sisters,” Gurdev added.Harjeet was arrested on the murder charge in 2015. “We spoke to him on February 24 when he called from a Riyadh jail. He said he did not kill anybody and asked us to save him. We received no help even as we approached the MEA and the Indian embassy. The ministry did not even inform us about his beheading. Our elderly parents — Buddh Singh, 70, and Jaswinder Kaur, 67 — are yet to accept his execution,” he said.The ministry revealed about the duo’s beheading after a petition was filed by Satwinder’s wife Seema Rani of Safdarpur Kullian village in Hoshiarpur district to get information on the whereabouts of her husband. Satwinder and Harjeet were arrested on December 9, 2015, for allegedly killing Arif Imamuddin. They were executed on February 28.
