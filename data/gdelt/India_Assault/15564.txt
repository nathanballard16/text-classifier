India’s Fortis Hospital to help Zambia stem treatment abroad – The Mast Online

FORTIS Hospital International sales manager Amit Pal Singh says Zambia’s inaugural kidney transplant confirms that capacity is being built among Zambian doctors.

The renowned Indian hospital has praised Zambia over the country’s inaugural kidney transplant.

“The development confirms that capacity is being built among Zambian doctors, as part of President Edgar Lungu’s modernisation of hospital services, in his unwavering quest for universal health coverage,” Singh said.

He said Fortis Hospital would work with Zambia to further expand scope of service delivery in Zambia, to stem treatment abroad.

This came to light when health minister Dr Chitalu Chilufya, in the company of Zambia’s High Commissioner to India Judith Kapijimpanga held talks with Fortis Hospital executives in New Delhi, India.

Meanwhile, Dr Chilufya said he was happy that Levy Mwanawasa Medical University Vice Chancellor Professor Elwyn Chomba held several meetings with academic institutions to operationalise provisions of the MoU signed during President Lungu’s state visit to India.

This is contained in a statement released by First Secretary Press and Tourism at the Zambian Mission in India Bangwe Naviley.
