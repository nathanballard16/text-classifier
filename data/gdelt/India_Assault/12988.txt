Death for child abusers as Pocso bill gets Lok Sabha nod

NEW DELHI: Stricter norms to check sexual assault against children, including death penalty for aggravated assault, became a reality after Lok Sabha passed an amendment bill already cleared by the upper House. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill, 2019, seeks to make offences against children gender-neutral and defines child pornography while also making it punishable.The bill, moved by women and child development minister Smriti Irani , received support from all parties, witnessing a debate lasting around four hours. Some MPs demanded that the bill be referred to a Select Committee in view of the provision of death penalty for certain offences. Irani said the bill would provide added legal protection to 39% of population or 43 crore children, irrespective of their gender.She said the urgency for defining child pornography stemmed from the depraved activities uncovered in the past. She referred to an online channel which featured child pornography and managed to attract 5000 followers. She said there had also been instances where children were injected with hormones for artificial maturity for sexual abuse.The bill makes punishable the offence of administrating or help in administering any hormone or any chemical substance to a child for the purpose of attaining early sexual maturity. The minister said CBSE will carry out awareness programmes in schools to make children aware about good and bad touch.She said more than 40,000 teachers will be trained for these awareness programmes. Hanuman Beniwal (RLP) said those convicted for such crimes should be “hanged publicly” so that it acts as a deterrent. Kirron Kher (BJP) said in case the convicts cannot be sent to the gallows, they should be chemically castrated.
