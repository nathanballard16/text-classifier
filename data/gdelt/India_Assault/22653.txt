Try refreshing your browser, or 'Sold out for revenge and money': How a burgeoning Eastern Ontario drug empire was brought down by betrayal Back to video A distinct picture emerged through various long-running court trials of a burgeoning drug trafficking empire that had been brought crashing down by one man’s “betrayal.” When it came time to testify, Tessier’s evidence was subject to “special scrutiny” as Ontario Court Justice Mitch Hoffman called him “the very definition of an unsavoury Crown witness.” “He was a longtime, high-level, very successful cocaine trafficker dealing at times at the multi-kilogram level, involved in loan sharking and other crimes including aggressive debt collecting.” Tessier testified he was “living like a rock star” and making undeclared millions selling cocaine when he turned on Bullen, who had handed Tessier the reins of the organization while under strict house arrest from a prior bust. Tessier’s reasons for the betrayal were never made entirely clear. At one point in testimony, Tessier cited a decade-old grudge over payments on a $20,000 minivan. He then told court his enthusiasm for the criminal lifestyle “waned” after he saw two of his friends murdered in front of him. But his motivation was simple in the judge’s estimation: “He sold out Bullen for revenge and money,” Hoffman said. “Essentially greed.”

Article content The judge found the evidence Tessier and police collected enough to find low-level dealers Richard “Ricky” Craig and Todd Coughlin guilty for their roles in the criminal conspiracy. Awaiting a sentencing hearing in May, Craig and Coughlin are the final two members of the ring to face jail time. The Crown secured convictions in February against Eric Corbeil, Bullen’s Montreal-based supplier of “high heat” high-grade cocaine, and “mule” Martin Leblanc, who lugged the drugs discreetly packaged in a backpack on the bus to the designated rendezvous: the parking lot of a Bronson Avenue Harvey’s restaurant. But those prosecutions came with a price tag. Tessier negotiated a $600,000 payout from police while the OPP collected wiretaps, audio recordings and surveillance as the deals went down, one kilo at a time. *** David “Hollywood” Bullen had already been languishing in a holding cell at the Kanata OPP detachment for a couple of hours on Oct. 25, 2016, when a familiar face was escorted in. This time, unlike the previous raid three years earlier, it seemed Bullen’s right-hand man, Tessier, had also been swept up in the large-scale police operation dubbed Project Wildwood. “I’m f—ed,” Bullen whispered to Tessier as the scale of the raid became clear, with Craig in the adjoining cell, fellow local dealer Coughlin locked up and word of the arrests of Montreal contacts Corbeil and Leblanc. “And it’s all my responsibility. Again.”

Article content Photo by File photo Bullen gave instructions to his trusted confidante to move some cash around to repay some debts, perhaps even sell Bullen’s prized Harley-Davidson motorcycle, all the while wondering who among them could have been the “loose link” in the chain. He never appeared to suspect it was Tessier. The notes Tessier took that day were added to a compendium of surveillance he conducted over years, reporting back to a police safehouse, where he would also bring quantities of cocaine and cash and the occasional restricted handgun to be photographed and catalogued by his handlers. A 2013 investigation dubbed Project Adelaide had disrupted a major cocaine pipeline run in Eastern Ontario by a burgeoning drug network: a hierarchy with Bullen at its head and with Tessier rapidly working his way up the chain. Those were higher-flying days in the cocaine trade, however. Police first caught on to Bullen when he was spotted flying a freshly purchased Robinson R44 helicopter on runs to Montreal to see his longtime friend and supplier Corbeil. (The two had served time together for cocaine trafficking more than a decade earlier.) The chopper was seized, along with a number of vehicles, drugs, guns and currency in a large-scale operation that involved raids on 25 homes and businesses from Montreal to Mont-Tremblant to Dunrobin and that put Bullen back behind bars. Tessier conveniently escaped arrest in those interprovincial raids, so, when Bullen was released with strict conditions under house arrest, Tessier was the natural choice to assume control of the business.

Article content He would later tell his handlers he made millions moving up to three kilos of cocaine each week and seeing as many as 25 clients per day. He worked 9 to 5 like a regular day job, never in the evenings, with Bullen and Tessier taking in as much as $30,000 a week. Tessier later admitted in court to raking in millions in undeclared drug profits and paying zero tax. By then he had already negotiated Bullen’s betrayal with a handsome $600,000 contract to act as police agent. *** Tessier met Bullen in 2005 and worked as a “car jockey” at a used car lot, according to court records filed by police and federal Crown prosecutor Roderick Sonley, but soon worked his way up to serving as Bullen’s driver before starting to make his own deliveries. According to Hoffman’s summary of the case in his recent ruling against Coughlin, the judge noted: “After many years loyally working for the Bullen drug organization, Bullen and Tessier had a falling out, initially over repayment for a motor vehicle … His enthusiasm for being a drug trafficker waned after seeing his two friends murdered in front of him.” Court records suggested Tessier was an eyewitness to the Oct. 26, 2011, double murder of Graham Thomas and Jason Chapman, who were gunned down inside a tanning salon at the Gloucester Centre. Police later recovered $15 million in synthetic drugs connected to the killings. Photo by Court file Tessier first wore a wire as a police agent in 2015, when he was paid $30,000 to co-operate with Project Riverstone, a short-lived operation that turned up no evidence against Bullen, who police at the time suspected of ordering a hit on a “disloyal” associate who had double-crossed him two years earlier in Project Adelaide. Tessier strongly advised against it.

Article content Tessier became a confidential informant against Bullen, then a paid agent after he signed another contract in September 2016 as Project Wildwood was launching. But he proved to be less than an ideal witness when he was called to testify, part of the arrangement he had to fulfill to collect the final $350,000 outstanding from his police contract. Tessier’s claim that he had become a good, law-abiding citizen “wilted,” the judge said, under cross-examination by Craig’s defence lawyer, Mark Ertel, who grilled the dealer-turned-agent for days on the witness stand about his failure to declare or pay income tax on his earnings. When Ertel suggested Tessier was still committing crimes as a civilian by failing to declare income, Tessier smirked. “I’ll get my accountant to look into it.” In his ruling, Hoffman echoed Ertel’s words, calling Tessier’s actions a “betrayal.” “David Bullen was your partner and you betrayed him,” Ertel said in court during the trial. “That partner is dead now, and the irony is you’re a big multi-kilo drug dealer and you’re taking guys down (like Craig and Coughlin) who are small-time.” Hoffman in his ruling earlier this month called Ertel’s efforts a “brilliant and withering cross-examination” as he picked apart Tessier’s claims. Hoffman said he accepted Tessier’s argument, however, that, while he made millions from drug dealing, he “never turned his mind” to declare it as income and he was never advised to do so by his police handlers.

Article content “I was told to lead my life the way I had led it. They told me not to burn my cover and to do what I had always done,” Tessier testified. “As an aside,” Hoffman said in his ruling, “Perhaps this is an area police should explore with agents in the future, if it was not done in this case.” *** Hoffman found Coughlin and Craig guilty on Dec. 3, one year to the day after Bullen’s guilty plea to a raft of charges including trafficking and conspiracy. The Crown also prosecuted Bullen on loansharking charges and a long-running mortgage fraud involving three properties valued at $2.3 million: a rural home in Lombardy, a home in Dunrobin and a cottage overlooking the St. Lawrence River on Ash Island in the Thousand Islands. Bullen was ordered to pay fines in lieu of forfeiture of the properties, and he was also fined for his involvement in a loansharking operation run through a business called Cadillac Financial. The judge was almost sympathetic in sentencing Coughlin earlier this month, calling him the “lowest rung” in Bullen’s organization. Hoffman said Coughlin was “sucked in” to the organization and “swept up” in the raids. Photo by Court file Coughlin was busted after police watched him in his pickup truck in the parking lot of a North Gower grocery store as he handed $4,000 in cash to Tessier for two ounces of cocaine. While Coughlin was a “prolific” pot grower, he wasn’t much of a cocaine dealer and had difficulty moving the product. He also gave Tessier 30 pounds of freshly-cultivated weed as part of a longstanding arrangement Coughlin had with Bullen, supplying pot by the pound after Bullen had provided startup capital for his grow-op. Police seized another 60 pounds of bagged bud stashed in the basement, a wood shed and an ice shack on Coughlin’s rural property.

Article content As the judge said, “The persuasive promises of profit never materialized for Coughlin.” Craig wasn’t much higher up the chain. Police had him exchanging cash for nine ounces of cocaine. Hoffman ruled there was “overwhelming corroboration,” “meticulously set out” in the Crown’s case, in the questioning of Tessier and in evidence including intercepts, surveillance photos, video and audio recordings of interactions between the dealer-turned-agent and his widening net of low-level targets. But the biggest deals, and the most profitable ones by far, were made by Tessier himself. He now lives under witness protection. Ahelmer@postmedia.com Twitter: @helmera Photo by Court file ANATOMY OF A COCAINE STING Police tracked three separate transactions between Sept. 29 and Oct. 25, 2016, when Chris Tessier would drive to Montreal to meet with suppliers Eric Corbeil and Martin Leblanc. Once the cash was dropped, the drugs would be shipped one kilo at a time by bus to Ottawa, where police were waiting and watching. Sept. 28, 2016 Tessier signs a $600,000 contract to work for the OPP to collect evidence of David Bullen’s attempts to revive his cocaine trafficking empire. Project Wildwood launches in earnest the following day. Oct. 2, 2016 Tessier drives to Montreal with $50,000 cash and meets Corbeil, known as “Glasses” and another man on the side of the roadway on Redpath Street near Mount Royal. “OK, I’m in the little Mazda,” Tessier texts under the nickname “Nitro.” Corbeil approaches, crouches by the rear passenger window, grabs the bag of money and walks away. Tessier is wearing a body pack for most of his transactions and a police surveillance team is camped nearby, taking photos. Bullen, nicknamed “Hollywood” by his own crew, but known as “English” or “L’Anglais” to his Montreal connections, had pre-arranged each deal by encrypted text.

Article content Oct. 7, 2016 After a days-long delay, with Richard Craig texting Bullen and Tessier to ask for more cocaine, the drop is finally arranged for that morning in the parking lot of a Bronson Avenue Harvey’s restaurant. Leblanc walks from the Ottawa bus terminal, gets into Tessier’s car at 8:43 a.m. and hands him a black backpack containing one kilo of cocaine, disguised as a laptop complete with a crudely-stamped Apple logo. A camera installed inside Tessier’s car captures the transactions. Leblanc walks back and boards the 9 a.m. bus back to Montreal. Tessier drives to North Gower and meets Todd Coughlin in the parking lot of Mulligan’s grocery store and exchanges two ounces for $4,000. He then drives to Smiths Falls to meet Craig for a delivery of nine ounces. Photo by Court file Oct. 13, 2016 After arranging for another kilo, Tessier again drives to Montreal to deliver $52,000 to the regular location, but this time police tail his Montreal connections to an Ontario Street massage parlour. He’s told the delivery will again be delayed. “Buddy, don’t make me wait all day,” Tessier vents, then relays the setback to Bullen. “This is bad for us, no matter what,” Tessier texts as their dealers are “all waiting. This is bad for bizz.” The drop eventually is arranged for two days later at the same Harvey’s parking lot, and another “nine-pack” (nine ounces) is wrapped in paper towels and elastics and hand-delivered to Craig. Oct. 21, 2016 The third and final kilo is arranged and Tessier drives to the new meeting spot, the Bar-B Barn restaurant parking lot on Des Sources Boulevard. After yet another hassle, Tessier angrily texts Bullen, “This is nuts. I’m f—ing done with these guys!”

Article content Bullen texts back, lamenting, “No kidding. No other options right now. Make him deliver.” Leblanc shows up the following day at the regular rendezvous. Oct. 23, 2016 Tessier meets with Bullen at his home, where Bullen appears to be tying up loose ends, suggesting Tessier sell some of Bullen’s restricted handguns — he figured the two silencers he had would alone fetch up to $3,000 — and paying off small debts and “taxes” owed. Police, meanwhile, are putting in place final plans for “takedown day.” Oct. 25, 2016 Bullen is arrested and charged with 25 counts ranging from drug possession and trafficking to loansharking and conspiracy. The OPP raid Craig’s home in Smiths Falls and Coughlin’s home in Lombardy, while Montreal counterparts take Corbeil and Leblanc into custody. Tessier’s handlers send him in one last time to join Bullen in his jail cell, in part to keep up the ruse and in part to collect the final pieces of evidence the Crown would use to secure convictions.
