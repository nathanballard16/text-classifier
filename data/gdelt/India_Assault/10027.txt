Vidyut, who made his Bollywood debut in 2011 with the John Abraham-starrer Force, is best known for playing the action hero in the Commando series. The actor is currently busy shooting for Commando 3, the third installment of the series. The film, being directed by Aditya Datt, also features Adah Sharma, Angira Dhar and Gulshan Devaiah in important roles, among others. Produced by Sunshine Pictures, the film is scheduled to hit the screens on September 6 this year.

Earlier this month, Vidyut had shared a still from the film on his Instagram account that shows him in action, battling the enemy. “Thrilled to get into the action mode early! #Commando3 releasing on #September6,” the actor had written as caption for the photo.

The actor, a self-proclaimed animal lover, was last seen in this year’s Junglee. The film, directed by Hollywood director Chuck Russell, featured him in the role of an animal protector. At the box-office, the film performed decently well and managed to collect nearly Rs 25 crore in its lifetime.

We are sure Vidyut’s diehard fans would be relieved with the news of his acquital.
