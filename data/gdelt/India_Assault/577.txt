Jaipur: Congress has found a unique way to corner the Narendra Modi-led BJP government on Rafale issue. In Rajasthan, ahead of Makar Sankranti, the Congress party workers have started distributing kites with four questions over Rafale deal printed on them.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi had recently asked 4 questions from PM Narendra Modi on Twitter. Gandhi asked why the government bought 36 aircraft instead of the 126 needed by the Indian Air Force. The next question was over the increased price of the fighter jet from Rs 560 crore per aircraft to Rs 1,600 crore. The third question was giving preference to Anil Ambani-led Reliance Defence over HAL and the last question that Gandhi asked was about Rafale files kept in Goa CM Manohar Parrikar’s bedroom and the content in it.

Gandhi was in Dubai on a two-day visit were spoke on the “Idea of India” and values of tolerance propagated by Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th centenary year.

Gandhi had also attacked the PM over the removal of Alok Verma as the CBI chief and had said that Verma was shown the door as Modi was too terrified to let him stay in his post.

"The Prime Minister is currently being held hostage by the Rafale scam. A person who has sacked the CBI Chief twice in a row and is terrified to let the CBI Chief sit there for fifteen minutes has no business talking about anything," Gandhi was quoted as saying in response by news agency IANS while addressing media in Dubai.
