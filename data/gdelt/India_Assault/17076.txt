At least three civilians, two of them children aged 10 and 12, were killed and eight others injured in Azad Jammu and Kashmir after Indian troops resorted to “indiscriminate” shelling from across the Line of Control (LoC) on Tuesday, officials said.

In one house in Kairni Mohri village, shelling caused the death of three people and injuries to another two, he said.
