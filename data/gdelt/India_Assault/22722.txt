Women power Kolkata Police inducts 30 women personnel into combat force

A few months ago, Kolkata Police officials had decided to induct women in the combat force. Following that, the chosen candidates went through rigorous training sessions for two months, to be the members of combat force. The 30 women police personnel have been trained in advanced assault rifles, endurance training and unarmed combat. Primarily, the women police personnel have been posted in the Quick Response Teams (QRTs), along with the existing police personnel. These combat force personnel are capable of countering any terrorism activity in case of emergencies.
