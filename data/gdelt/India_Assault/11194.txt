Chennai, July 05: A couple were hacked to death by a group of people in Tamil Nadu's Thoothukudi district allegedly over their intercaste marriage. The father of the girl Alagar has been arrested on suspicion that he was involved in the murder of the duo, after Solairajan's family filed a complaint.

The woman was three months' pregnant at the time of her killing.

The incident came to light when the couple wasn't to be seen on Thursday morning and the door to their house remained closed.
