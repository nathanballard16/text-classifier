UP government requests for CBI probe into Unnao rape survivorâ€™s accident

New Delhi:

The Yogi Adityanath government has requested the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to take over the probe into Unnao rape survivor’s accident in Rae Bareli on July 28. The move comes after Mahesh Singh, an uncle of the woman - who had accused a BJP legislator of rape, wrote to the Chief Minister, seeking a probe by the national investigating agency.

Meanwhile, the state government has decided to bear all the expenses of the treatment of the two injured, who are admitted to the KGMU trauma centre, Lucknow District Magistrate Kaushalraj Sharma said.

The official said the King George's Medical University (KGMU) vice chancellor has been requested to forward brief details of the expenses to the district administration and not to charge any cost from the families of injured people.

However, Swati Maliwal, chairperson of the Delhi Women's Commission, met the Unnao rape survivor at a Lucknow hospital and said that the condition of the girl is ‘very critical’ and she should be taken to Delhi in an air ambulance for better treatment.

"I met Unnao rape survivor, her lawyer and doctors. The doctors told me that the victim and the lawyer are critical and have less chances of survival. Doctors believe that they should be airlifted to the best hospital in Delhi. The family also wants this," Maliwal posted on Twitter.

Earlier, Director General of Police OP Singh had said that the Uttar Pradesh government is ready for a CBI probe if a request is made.

"The state government is ready for recommending a CBI probe into the Sunday's mishap in Raebareli if the victim's mother or any relative makes any request in this regard," the officer had said.

A car in which the woman, her family and lawyer were travelling was hit by an overspeeding truck in Rae Bareli on Sunday, killing two members while leaving her and the advocate critically injured, police had said.

The woman, who had accused Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Kuldeep Sengar of rape, was provided with three security guards but they were not accompanying her as there was no place in the car, the DGP said.
