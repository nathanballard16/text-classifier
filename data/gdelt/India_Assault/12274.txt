Gas agency employees robbed of Rs 1 5 lakh

New Delhi: The broad daylight dacoity on Wednesday sent East District police into a tizzy as eight bike-borne masked miscreants held the employees of a gas agency hostage in Chilla Village, Mayur Vihar and robbed off Rs 1.5 lakh cash and eight mobile phones from them. The assailants also targeted the consumers who had come there for new gas connection and other grievances. The assailants first entered in the gas agency and overpowered all employee and consumers on gun points. They threatened collection agents and looted Rs 1.5 lakh cash which was said to be collected from the vendors. Before fleeing from the spot, the bikers snatched eight mobile phones from the consumers and employees to avoid immediate police calls.
