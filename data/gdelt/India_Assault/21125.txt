Man convicted in the New Delhi bus rape says he shouldn’t be hanged because pollution is already killing him

The victim was a paramedical college student trying to rise above her family’s poverty. Then she went out one night in December to see the movie “Life of Pi” at a Delhi cineplex with a male friend. On their return home, the two hailed a minibus, where they encountered six men who were drunk and looking for sex, according to the charging documents. The duo tried, and failed, to fight off the group’s advances. Thakur and the other assailants took turns raping the victim for almost an hour as the bus carried on its route around the city. They then dumped her ravaged body on the street.
