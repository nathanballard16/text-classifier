Gurugram: In a case reported from Gurugram, Haryana, two people were allegedly assaulted by an angry mob on Tuesday. They were attacked on suspicion of smuggling cattle in the city. Near the Islampur village, two pickup vans were intercepted by a group of "cow protection unit" during morning hours, the person who led the group said.

The victims were identified as Shathil Ahmad, a resident of Palwal district, and Tayaid. Gurgaon Police Public Relation Officer Subhash Bokan told PTI that both of them were arrested by the local police and a search is underway for two others who fled the spot after the mob attacked.

Reportedly, Savita Kataria told news agency PTI that the residents of the village went on a rampage after they saw beef inside the vehicles and began thrashing Ahmad and Tayaid.

Meanwhile, the police said that the accused were on their way to deliver the beef consignment in Delhi. And the cops have confiscated two vehicles. However, the police have registered an FIR under various sections of the Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015.
