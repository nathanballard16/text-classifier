Jilted Mumbai stalker stabs bank employee, then slits his own throat

New Delhi:

A Mumbai man allegedly stabbed a 22-year-old bank employee in her neck and slashed her face before slitting his own throat after she reportedly rejected her relationship proposal. The brutal assault on the woman took place outside the Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) in Mumbai’s East Borivli on Wednesday. An auto driver, who was present at the spot when the incident happened, informed the police, which later rushed the two to Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli.

According to the police, the accused has been identified as Kunal Bavdane, a travel agency employee from Walkeshwar and knew the victim from childhood. He has been stalking the girl for a long time. On Wednesday, he convinced the victim to meet him.

During their meeting, the police said, a heated argument broke out between the two and the man stabbed her multiple times in neck and face. He later stabbed himself in the stomach and slit his throat.

"We made a mistake by not approaching the police when he used to constantly harass her," the victim’s father was quoted as saying by The Hindustan Times. According to the report published in the English daily, the accused had recently visited the woman’s house and apologised to her father for harassing her.

"Just a month ago, the accused and his uncle came to our house, touched my feet and apologised. He told me he will not stalk my daughter any more after I had warned them that I would complain to the police. I never imagined this to happen," her father added.

The accused used to follow the woman when she lived in Walkeshwar. She moved to Bhayander from Walkershwar several years ago. However, a year ago, the man found the woman on Instagram and started the same old drama.
