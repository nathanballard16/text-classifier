29 years on, man accused of fracturing Didi's skull acquitted

Lalu Alam, who allegedly attempted to kill Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 29 years ago, was acquitted by Kolkata Alipore Court on Thursday.

Alam, then a CPI(M) worker, along with dozens of others, was accused of assaulting Mamata Banerjee when she was the president of Youth Congress in Bengal in 1990. The attack had left Banerjee with a fractured skull.

The Alipore Court dismissed the case acquitting the prime accused after prosecutors, "admitted that there were no more evidence to carry on with the criminal case".

WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN Mamata Banerjee was leading a Congress rally protest near her residence at Hazra crossing in southern part of Kolkata on August 16, 1990 when she was attacked.



The case was apparently blocked for 21 years by the erstwhile Left government. Sources close to Banerjee said she herself did not want to pursue the case anymore.

"Of those named in the charge sheet, a few had died while few others were absconding. There is nothing left in the case. The government decided that nothing except wastage of money and time would be achieved by pursuing this case," said Radhakanta Mukherjee, government lawyer.

He also alleged, the case was blocked for 21 years by the Left government so that there was proper investigation and improvement in the case, since most of the eyewitnesses were dead.

Under Criminal Procedure U/S 232, the judge acquitted the only left accused Lalu Alam.

CM Mamata Banerjee was leading a Congress rally protest near her residence on August 16, 1990 when she was attacked and suffered serious head injuries.

Sources close to Banerjee herself did not want to pursue the case anymore.

"Since the past 29 years I was living a fearful life, today I have no words to express my happiness. Had this decision been taken earlier eight years back, when the government came to power, I would have focused more in my work front.
