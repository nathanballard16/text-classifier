‘Where were human rights when they took out my child’s intestines’: Nirbhaya's mother on convict’s mercy plea

Preparations are underway at Tihar Jail in anticipation of the impending hanging of the four convicts.

Key Highlights Nirbhaya's mother lashed out at the convict for approaching the SC to delay his sentence. She called the mercy plea a mockery of the legal system. Nirbhaya was gang-raped on December 16, 2012 by six men.

New Delhi: A day after Nirbhaya convict Akshay moved the Supreme Court with a mercy plea on grounds of Delhi’s air pollution, the mother of the victim spoke about the same and expressed her disgust. “They have all the liberty and we are given logic of human rights,” she said.

Nirbhaya’s mother also demanded that the convicts should be hanged on December 16 (Nirbhaya was gang-raped on the same date in 2012). “Why only are the victims shown all the rules? They should be hanged on December 16,” she added.

The anguished mother also said, “It's the fault of our legal system. The Supreme Court should have expedited the matter. I moved the court after waiting for a year. They (convicts) are mocking the SC and legal system.”

Reminding about the inhuman act done by the convicts Nirbhaya’s mother said, “The day they took out the intestines of the girl, did they remember human rights.”

Moreover, she also rued the fact that most of the Nirbhaya Fund was unused. “My daughter's name is taken everywhere, but the funds are not used. State governments are not using the Nirbhaya Fund. You (politicians) have powers but are not committed to the case.”

Talking about the emboldened rapists, she also pointed out the heinous cases that have occurred in Cyberabad, Buxar, Malda and Unnao. “Now victims are burned, it's a slap on the face of the system.”

Meanwhile, preparations are underway at Tihar Jail in anticipation of the impending hanging of the four convicts. The authorities have already sourced the ropes to be used for hanging from Bihar’s Buxar jail.
