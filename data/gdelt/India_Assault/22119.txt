Property Of Anti-CAA Protesters Indulging In Violence Will Be Seized: Yogi Adityanath

New Delhi:

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday issued a stern warning to anti-Citizenship Act protesters indulging in violence and said that those vandalising public property will be identified and their properties will be seized to compensate the damage caused by them.

"I have called a meeting over this. In a democracy, you cant indulge in violence in the name of protest. We will take strict action against such elements. Will seize property of those found guilty and compensate damage to public property," Adityanath said.

The statement from Adityanath came after violent protests erupted in Lucknow and other parts of Uttar Pradesh over the controversial Citizenship Amendment Act. The police in Lucknow cracked down on protesters using tear gas and batons after the agitation against Citizenship Act turned violent in Hazratganj area of old city. According to reports, protesters pelted stones and set many vehicles on fire during the protests.

Angry protesters allegedly set a fire 20 motorcycles, 10 cars, 3 buses and 4 media OB vans around Parivartan Chowk area during protests against "divisive act". UP police chief OP Singh said cops had to fire tear-gas shells to control the situation in Madeyganj area. The protesters had defied the prohibitory orders, put in place across the state, and gathered on the streets of the city.

They were all demanding the Narendra Modi government revoke the Citizenship Amendment Act, that grants Indian citizenship to illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on basis of their religion. Immigrants from Muslim community have been excluded from the Act.
