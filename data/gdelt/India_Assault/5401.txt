Will there be another series of Delhi Crime?

Yes - Netflix ordered two seasons of Delhi Crime back when season one was announced.

The series will now take an anthology format, with season two following a different case.

The first season of Delhi Crime is based on the December 2012 investigation by the Delhi Police into the brutal and horrific gang rape of a young woman, which shocked India and the world.

Creator Riche Mehta told Indian Express: “There is going to be a next season. Same characters, different crime.”

The series follows a similar format to Ryan Murphy's American Crime Story, which follows a different high profile crime each season.
