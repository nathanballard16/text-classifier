Thousands of protesters gathered Friday in Melbourne, Australia at the start of a day of worldwide demonstrations calling for action on climate change ahead of a United Nations summit in New York.

Some of the first rallies, in what is being billed as a "global climate strike," kicked off in Australia.

Australian demonstrators called for their nation, which is the world's largest exporter of coal and liquid natural gas, to take more drastic action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Global Strike 4 Climate said protests were staged in 110 towns and cities across Australia on Friday, with organizers demanding government and business commit to a target of net zero carbon emissions by 2030.
