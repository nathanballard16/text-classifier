Five Terrorists Get Life Imprisonment in Bodh Gaya Bombing Case

Patna: A week after five members of the Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), a front of the Indian Mujahideen, a domestic terrorist outfit, were convicted in the July 7, 2013 serial bomb blasts in Bodh Gaya, a special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court in Patna on Friday sentenced all five men to life imprisonment along with a fine of Rs. 40,000 each.

NIA court judge Manoj Kumar sentenced Omar Siddiqui, 39; Azaharuddin Qureshi, 25; Imtiyaz Ansari, 35; Haider Ali, 30; and Mujibullah Ansari, 28 who were also held responsible for similar serial bomb blasts in Patna during Narendra Modi's Hunkar Rally at Gandhi Maidan on October 27 of the same year.

Failure to pay the fine would result in an additional six months of imprisonment.

Another accused who was identified as Taufique Ansari was a juvenile in 2013 and was sent to a juvenile court that sentenced him to three years in prison last year.

As reported, 13 IEDs were carefully planted at strategic locations both inside and outside of the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya to cause maximum casualty during the blast. Fortunately, only 10 bombs exploded causing injury to five men, including two Buddhist monks. No one died in the blast.

Bombings at Patna's Gandhi Maidan had killed six persons and injured 85 others.

Talking to reporters, special Public Prosecutor L P Sinha said that both blasts were masterminded by Haider and Mujibullah who had planned the bombings at a Ranchi lodge to avenge the atrocities committed on Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar.
