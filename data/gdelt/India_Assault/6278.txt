NEW DELHI, April 10 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 people including some women labourers died Wednesday after a huge mound of mud fell on them in India's Telangana state, officials said.

The mud fell upon labourers at Edmartippa hillock on the outskirts of Tileru village of Narayanpet district, about 165 km southwest of Hyderabad, the capital city of Telangana state.

"This afternoon a huge mound of mud fell on workers at a worksite here and buried them alive," a police official said. "Ten people were killed and one person has been admitted at hospital in injured condition."

Officials said the labourers were digging earth for a government work under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), an Indian labour law and social security measure that aims to guarantee the 'right to work' to citizens.

"The bodies have been extricated and most of them are women," the official said.

Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao described the incident "unfortunate".

A local minister V Srinivas Goud said he was monitoring the situation and rescue work.
