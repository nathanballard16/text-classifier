Police pick up 25 suspects from Valsad

Protest against rape at Mandvi

Vadodara: Cops investigating the gang-rape of a minor girl thought they were close to cracking the case on Tuesday after they received a tip-off about the suspects spotted in Valsad. But they were a disappointed lot after the rape survivor on Wednesday ruled out the involvement of any of the suspects detained by them.

“We had received an information that some youngsters who looked just like the suspects were seen in Valsad. We sent in our teams and coordinated with the Valsad police who helped us in picking up nearly 25 suspects,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

“The suspects were shown to the girl but she told us that none of them were involved in the crime,” Jadeja told TOI.

Nearly 32 police teams led by the detection of crime branch (DCB) have been working on cracking the gang-rape case and tracking down the accused duo over the last six days. The cops have scanned thousands of mobile phone call records, and checked 900 suspects including anti-social elements and notorious criminals.

The police also showed nearly 400 photos of the suspects to the girl but she didn’t confirm the involvement of anyone of them. “We have now done DNA profiling and taken blood samples of 10 youngsters who are top on our suspect list,” Jadeja added.

The cops have also been picking up ragpickers staying near Navlakhi to ascertain if they have seen the suspects.

The 14-year-old girl had on Tuesday recorded her statement in front of a magistrate. On the night of November 28, the girl was gang-raped by two unidentified men when she was hanging out with her 16-year-old boyfriend in Navlakhi Ground. The boy was first thrashed and scared away by the accused who then dragged the girl away for some distance. They asked her if she was carrying gold ornaments or mobile phone. When she refused, they took turns to rape her. She faced the ordeal for nearly an hour.
