Youth Akali Dal back encounter by Hyderabad police

LUDHIANA: In an interesting development, the Youth Akali Dal (YAD) activists on Monday came out in support of the dubious encounter of rapists and killers of a veterinarian by the Hyderabad police a few days ago.The YAD workers, led by district president Gurdeep Singh Gosha, also held a march to highlight the rising incidents of rape in the country, and demanded that in cases of rape, the accused should not be put on trial, instead they should be straightaway done to death publicly.Addressing the media persons on the occasion, Gosha said, "Regardless of the doubts being raised on the encounter by Hyderabad police, in which four rapists and killers were killed, we fully stand with the cops. Whether this encounter was staged or it really happened so matters little, as the culprits, who raped and killed an innocent girl, deserved to die like this only. It's high time that death sentence should be fixed as the minimum punishment in case of rape and there is no harm in giving such punishment publicly to the culprits who commit such heinous crime."Gosha went on, "We, as the alliance partner of BJP, will also press upon our high command to ask the central government to bring a law for death sentence in rape cases. Moreover, the Centre should also respect the public sentiments in the Hyderabad encounter case, as everyone is appreciating the action of the Hyderabad police against the killers. So, governments - whether at the Centre or the state government - should give a serious thought to this fact before ordering any action against the policemen involved in the encounter."YAD worker Gurpreet Kaur said, "The Hyderabad police did a great job by eliminating the criminals who were involved in such an inhuman act of raping and burning a woman. I think all such criminals deserve similar punishment and no mercy should be shown towards them at all."
