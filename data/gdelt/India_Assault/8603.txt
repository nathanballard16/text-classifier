Grand Rapids man crushed by tractor -- latest in a string of Michigan deaths

A 64-year-old Grand Rapids man is dead after an accident involving his tractor, said the Oceana County Sheriff's Office.

The incident unfolded at 7:18 p.m. Monday, when Oceana County deputies were called to the 4600 block of South 44th Avenue in New Era, north of Muskegon.

According to Sheriff Craig Mast, the man, who has been identified as Gary Mills, was operating an older Oliver tractor on a family member's farm when the tractor flipped over and crushed him.

He believes Mills was attempting to expand a power take-off shaft on a mower and had chained it to a tree and to the tractor to try to pull it open.

Mills was pronounced dead at the scene.

It's the latest in a string of deadly farming accidents in Michigan.

On May 16, 72-year-old Robert Othmer of Vermontville died when he was trapped under two feet of corn in a grain silo in Barry County.

On May 2, 45-year-old Patrick Freehling was found dead in a farming accident in Baroda Township, a town located on the western side of the state. Police are unsure of what happened, but believe it was an accidental death.

In March, two men were killed in separate farming accidents when they became tangled in an auger.

On March 20, a 63-year-old man from Waterloo Township died after getting tangled in an auger while spreading manure.

Then, on March 11, 42-year-old Jacob Fruchey was drilling holes near a sheep farm in Montcalm Township when his clothes got caught in an auger.

According to a 2016 list from Bankrate, agriculture is the sixth-most-dangerous occupation in the United States.
