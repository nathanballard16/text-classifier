Sashakt Committee recommends changes in Inter Creditor Agreement

The Sashakt Committee has recommended that the existing Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA) to incorporate the revised voting threshold and other changes for decision making stipulated by the Reserve Bank of India. In a statement it said that this will enable expeditious implementation of the new framework on stressed assets.“The Sashkat ICA can be modified to incorporate the requirements of New Framework and serve as the Master Inter-Creditor Agreement for resolution of all stressed asset under BLRA . The New Framework is pragmatic and a step in the right direction. It takes care of all stakeholders interests,” said Sunil Mehta , chairman of Sashakt Committee.Mehta noted that this will ensure that a consensus building amongst lenders will be carried forward promptly, to its logical conclusion and within timelines as specified.On June 7, RBI had issued revised guidelines for resolution of stressed assets. Under the new framework, it is a mandatory requirement for lenders to enter into an Inter-Creditor Agreement (ICA) during the review of the borrower account within 30 days from date of first default to any lender.The New Framework further lays down some parameters to be included in the Inter-Creditor Agreement including decision-making by lenders holding 75% (by value of total outstanding facilities) and 60% by number and protection of dissenting lenders. The Inter-Creditor Agreement is required to be executed by all lenders covered under the New Framework and asset reconstruction companies.The New Framework applies to all banks, term financial institutions, small finance banks, systemically important non-deposit taking non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) as well as deposit taking NBFCs.In 2018, the government had constituted a committee led by Mehta which had come out with Inter-Creditor Agreement for Resolution of Stressed Assets and was executed by 35 banks and financial institutions.The Inter-Creditor Agreement of July, 2018 which was operationalised in December 2018 by the Indian Banks Association (IBA) covers the key parameters that have been specified by RBI in the New Framework.State Bank of India’s chairman Rajnish Kumar noted that RBI’s New Framework recognizes the need for Bank led Resolution Framework and also provides regulatory sanction for the Bank led Resolution Framework. “This will expedite resolution of stressed assets given the revised voting thresholds and the requirement that all banks, NBFCs and ARC are mandated to join the ICA,” he said.
