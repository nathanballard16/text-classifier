MASSIVE WIN: Forces Gun Down Key Terror Conspirator Whose Vehicle Was Used In The Horrific Feb 14 Pulwama Attack In Which 40 CRPF Jawans Were Martyred

In a massive victory for the security forces and for India - the significance of which cannot be underplayed - the terrorist and key conspirator Sajjad Bhat, whose vehicle was used to perpetuate the horrific Pulwama terror attack on February 14, has been gunned down by the security forces on Tuesday in Anantnag.

As per NIA (National Investigative Agency) investigation, a Maruti Eeco minivan, owned by Sajjad Bhat, was used in the Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were martyred in suicide bombing perpetrated by the Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Sajjad Bhat, a resident of Bijbehara in south Kashmir, was on the run since the attack and the NIA investigation reported that he went onto become an active terrorist, as a part of the JeM organisation.

Piecing together remnants of the vehicle recovered from the scene of the blast, the NIA investigators, with the support of forensic and automobile experts, identified the vehicle in which the JeM suicide bomber attacked the CRPF convoy, as a Maruti Eeco having chassis number MA3ERLF1SOO183735 and engine number G12BN164140.

The vehicle was sold to Mohammed Jaleel Ahmed Haqani, a resident of Heaven Colony in Anantnag in 2011, and subsequently it changed hands seven times and finally reached Sajjad Bhat, a student of Siraj-ul-Uloom, Shopian. The vehicle was purchased by Sajjad Bhat on February 4, as per reports.

Earlier on March 11, one of the main conspirators of the dastardly Pulwama terror attack was neutralised during an encounter in Tral. It was a massive win for the country as Mudasir Khan who was one of the chief perpetrators of the dastardly attack on the CRPF jawans was gunned down by the forces.

Twelve days after the heinous attack, the Indian Air Force decimated the largest JeM terror base in Pakistan's Balakot across the LoC with precision air strikes, post which the neighbouring country was forced to initiate a sham 'crackdown' on terrorist groups on its soil.
