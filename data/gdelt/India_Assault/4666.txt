TN sexual assault case be probed without affecting victims: Stalin

Chennai: DMK President M.K. Stalin on Monday said investigations into the sexual assault of young girls in Pollachi by a gang should be done without affecting the future of the victims.

He also charged the ruling party officials of trying to influence the police probe so that the accused are let free.

Pollachi is about 535 km from Chennai.

Stalin said it also shows the lack of safety for women in Tamil Nadu for the past eight years under the AIADMK government.

He said the videos of innocent victims crying for mercy from the sexual assaults is heart rendering.

On his part, PMK Founder S. Ramadoss in a tweet said the news about sexual assault case in Pollachi is shocking and the perpetrators should be punished.

The Pollachi police has arrested four persons — Thirunavukkarasu, Sabarirajan, Vasanthakumar and Satish — in this connection.

According to the police, the accused would befriend women on social media first. After gaining the girl’s confidence, she would be invited to a secluded place and sexually assaulted which was also videographed.

Later the victims were blackmailed for money or for physical submission.

The issue came to light when a young girl lodged a complaint with the Pollachi police against the accused.

Thirunavukkarasu, when he was in hiding, released a video saying politicians were also involved and wanted the case to be transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).
