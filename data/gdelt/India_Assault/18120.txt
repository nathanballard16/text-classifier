Sarpanches also to be held responsible

Amritsar, November 7Even as the police registered nine cases against farmers indulging in stubble burning, Deputy Commissioner Shiv Dullar Singh Dhillon on Thursday said the sarpanch of the village, where cases of paddy straw burning occurred, would also be held liable for the same and appropriate measures would be initiated against him. Following the flak from the Supreme Court and the National Green Tribunal, the Punjab Government finally woke up to the menace that has been eating into the health of the people in the region. The farmers were booked for violating the orders, causing obstruction, annoyance or injury to persons lawfully employed while the administration failed to initiate any provisions under the Environment Protection Act against the offenders. In a press statement here on Thursday, the DC said FIRs were registered against those who indulged in farm fires to get rid of paddy straw while fines were also imposed on them as per the directions of the National Green Tribunal. He said the Duty Magistrates were also allowed to issue challans to the violators.
