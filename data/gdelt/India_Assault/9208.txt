Karnataka JD(S) chief quits, flays functioning of coalition with Congress

BENGALURU: Karnataka JD(S) president A H Vishwanath on Tuesday resigned from his post after taking "moral responsibility" for the party's rout in the Lok Sabha polls.Vishwanath also alleged that a conspiracy was hatched to make former prime minister H D Deve Gowda contest from Tumkur and that the JD(S) supremo was cheated in the Lok Sabha election.The resignation is the first major fallout of the Lok Sabha poll debacle for the coalition. The JD(S) and Congress won just one seat apiece out of 28 , while the BJP clinched 25 seats. BJP-backed independent Sumalatha Ambareesh won the Mandya seat."I take moral responsibility for the (party's) defeat," said Vishwanath, who is also reportedly unhappy over being sidelined and not being taken into confidence on key issues by his own party.Vishwanath was recently locked in a public spat with senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah over the latter's role as the ruling coalition coordination committee chief.Speaking to reporters, Vishwanath said even after a year of the government formation, the coordination committee headed by Siddaramaiah could not prepare a common minimum programme (CMP) for the smooth functioning of the government.He said neither he nor the Congress state president Dinesh Gundu Rao were part of the coordination committee.Claiming there was a conspiracy behind Gowda's defeat from Tumkur, Vishwanath said that the veteran leader was cheated in the elections."I have mentioned in my letter (to JD(S) chief) how a conspiracy was hatched and Deve Gowda was defeated in Tumkur. Trust is important in politics ... a leader (Gowda), a veteran who has significantly contributed to the state and the nation, was made to trust and then was cheated in the election. What else is required now," he asked.Asked whether Siddaramaiah was responsible for Gowda's defeat, he said he would not name anybody.In his resignation letter to Gowda, Vishwanath said: "There aren't major achievements barring a few in one or two departments. Though it is inappropriate, as a party president I felt there was a pressing need to express my disappointment."Vishwanath said he sympathised with chief minister Kumaraswamy for running the government despite health issues and "torture from friends," an apparent dig at the Congress.Vishwanath, however, ruled out joining the BJP.He also made it clear he did not have any ministerial ambitions but added he would not shy away if a berth was given to him.About the longevity of the coalition government, he said it should complete its term and insisted that JD(S) pulling out of the government was out of the question.Vishwanath also apologised for the "disparaging remarks" made by some JD(S) leaders against Sumalatha Ambareesh during the election campaign."Sumalatha is the daughter-in-law of Mandya. She is our daughter. As a JD(S) president I seek apology on behalf of my party for hurting her sentiments," Vishwanath said.
