LAHORE: A Pakistani prisoner was reportedly stoned to death by a group of inmates at the Jaipur Central Jail in the Indian state of Rajasthan on Wednesday.



Quoting prison officials, multiple Indian publications reported that the Pakistani prisoner, Shakir Ullah, was found dead in his cell.



Shakir Ullah, hailing from Sialkot, was serving life imprisonment after his conviction in a terror-related case. He was arrested in the Indian state of Gujarat in 2001.



The gruesome killing came as Indian media continues to whip up war hysteria since the killing of nearly three dozen Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir (IoK) earlier this month.



Indian politicians are also giving out belligerent statements and enraging the public against Pakistan, which they allege for being behind the suicide attack.



As a result, Kashmiri students in different cities of India have complained of mob attacks and discrimination. On February 19, authorities in Rajasthan gave visiting Pakistani nationals a 48-hour ultimatum to leave India.



According to a list compiled this year, over 350 Pakistanis are held in different jails of India.



Alarmed by the gruesome killing of Shakir Ullah, Pakistan has sought a response from India.



In a statement, the Foreign Office said the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi has officially raised the issue with Indian authorities, requesting them to urgently authenticate the report and awaits a response.



“We call upon the Indian government to fulfill its obligations and ensure provision of fool proof security to all Pakistani inmates/prisoners in Indian jails and Pakistani visitors to India,” reads the statement.
