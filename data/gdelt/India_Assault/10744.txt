The incident had taken place near Ankhol village in Vadodara tehsil late Tuesday night.

The accused were identified as Tampivendse Montohari, Tafdzava Sumba, Mopvev Zoi and Vatidaize Zanze.

According to complainant Tanmay Tamboli, resident of Shyam Green society near Ankhol, three of the accused live in the same society as tenants.
