‘Accused deserve death, nothing less,' says UP victim’s brother

'All I want is that either they should be hanged or they should be shot dead, like what happened near Hyderabad,' woman's father said.

New Delhi: Referring to the encounter of four rape accused by the police in Telangana on Friday, the father of a 23-year-old Uttar Pradesh woman, who dies at a hospital in Delhi, said that he wants the accused to be ‘shot dead’. The UP woman suffered burn injuries after she was set on fire by men accused of raping her.
