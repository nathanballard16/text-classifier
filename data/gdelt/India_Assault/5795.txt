Police yet to complete inquiry in two FSL reports in rape case

SURAT: The ongoing police inquiry in two different test results given by forensic science laboratories (FSL) in a rape complaint, now quashed against Dr Praful Doshi is yet to be completed. The inquiry was ordered four months ago by city police commissioner Satish Sharma when FSL Surat issued a report that said there was no scientific evidence that the complainant woman had been raped, but FSL Gandhinagar ’s report confirmed that she was raped by the doctor.The inquiry in the issue started after the police complaint was quashed by high court in October 2018 as the 28-year-old complainant woman had reached a compromise with the accused. She submitted in the high court that she didn’t wish any further investigation in the matter.Police were shocked when Surat FSL said it did not find scientific evidence to prove rape. The vaginal swab collected at the time of her medical examination was sent for re-examination to Gandhinagar FSL which confirmed that the woman was raped.Later, the inquiry was handed over to assistant commissioner of police, E division, to find out if there was any negligence in investigation while collecting scientific investigation. The officer submitted his report after taking statements of doctors at New Civil Hospital, officials at Surat FSL and concerned cops.“The inquiry report was submitted and we are collecting some more details. The facts will be out soon,” said N S Desai, ACP.“The inquiry is at a crucial stage and I can’t comment on it right now. Once the inquiry is over, police will disclose the details,” Satish Sharma said.Meanwhile, the police had sought permission from the state government to challenge quashing of the FIR in December. The FIR was registered at Athwa police station on September 5 wherein the woman had alleged that she was raped by the doctor in his consulting room.
