He counselled his sons to treat their life partners as not their slaves but equal partners. In fact, in one letter, Gandhi even counsels his son against marital rape advising conjugal bliss only with mutual consent."With your consent, I wish you to take a vow. You will maintain Sushila's freedom. You will not rape her for your carnal desires but establish conjugal relationship only with mutual consent," Gandhi wrote to his second-born son Manilal in a letter discussing ideal married life with prospective bride in Sushila.Gandhi was a very vocal advocate for women's equality. "Treat your wife as a partner not a slave," Gandhi counselled his son Manilal.The letters are documented in a book titled 'Jyan raho tyan mahekta raho: Putra ane putra-vadhuo prati Gandhiji' (Keep spreading fragrance wherever you are: Gandhiji towards his sons and daughter-in-laws) authored by Neelam Parikh, great-granddaughter of Mahatma Gandhi.Gandhi was father to four sons and their wives namely Harilal and Gulabben; Manilal and Sushilaben; Ramdas and Nirmalaben and Devdas and Lakshmiben.Offering congratulations on engagement of his grand-daughter Manu with Surendra, nephew of his associate Kishorelal Mashruwala, Gandhi doled out advise to the couple, "You are becoming each other's friend and ally. The girls are not connected with you so that you can rule over them or make them do hard labour," he wrote. "The coupling is to complete the two of you. Both partners experience equality of heart, mind and soul. Do not ever put each other down but complete yourself."
