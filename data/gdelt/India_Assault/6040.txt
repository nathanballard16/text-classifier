Parking contractor’s men assault 3

Ludhiana: Employees of a parking contractor assaulted three men when the latter objected to overcharging at mini secretariat on Friday.

Mohan Lal, a resident of Jawahar Nagar, said in his police complaint, “I , along with my friends Shivam and Sahil, had gone to the court complex for work. When I parked my scooter, the parking contractor’s employee asked me to pay Rs 15. When I said the fee was Rs 12 for a two-wheeler, he started arguing with me and called his two aides.”

As the stick-wielding trio attacked Mohan, his friends came to his rescue. “But the three assaulted my friends too,” he added.

Division 5 police station SHO inspector Goldi Virdi said a complaint has been received.
