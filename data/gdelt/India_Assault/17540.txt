MUMBAI: The Chembur police probing the alleged rape of an Uzbekistan national, on Sunday reached Palose village in Pune with her and local tehsildar to search the farmhouse of the accused, police inspector Anil Jadhav, where the latter is suspected of burying a body. However, they had to return emptyhanded as Jadhav's wife and family did not allow the search. "The family prevented policemen from carrying out their investigation. Next time, we will go fully prepared, along with the local police," said a senior police officer.

Jadhav, who was posted in Pimpri-Chinchwad, has been accused of drugging and raping the 35-year-old complainant repeatedly over 14 years and forcing her to have an abortion twice. The complainant also alleged that in 2016, Jadhav had buried a woman who had died of drug overdose. In 2017, when the woman's brother confronted Jadhav and asked about her whereabouts, he called him to his farmhouse, where he shot him and later buried his body. The Chembur police have registered a case under IPC sections of rape,unnatural sex, threats, blackmail and assualt against Jadhav.

The complainant met Jadhav, who was married, in 2004 for a passport-related issue. Under the pretext of getting her visa extended, he kept her passport. In her complaint, she said Jadhav spiked her drink and raped her. She claimed that he promised her marriage. She said Jadhav forced her to get an abortion twice. The two have a five-year-old son.

Jadhav was earlier arrested in a 2011 drugs case after a rave party bust at Khalapur, and last month, he was booked on corruption charges. Last week, the sessions court had rejected his anticipatory bail.
