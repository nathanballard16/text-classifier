NEW DELHI, Feb. 20 (Xinhua) -- A Pakistani national who was serving a 20-year jail sentence was reportedly killed inside a prison in India's western state of Rajasthan on Wednesday by four other inmates during a brawl that broke out over TV volume.

According to media reports, identified as 50-year-old Shakir Ullah, who hailed from Sialkot in Pakistan, had already spent eight years in the jail since his arrest in 2011.

According to media reports, four prisoners were watching TV when a quarrel broke out. As the fight escalated, three convicts bashed Shakir Ullah's head against a stone on the ground which reportedly led to his death.

Meanwhile, senior police officers, a forensics team and district officials have rushed to the jail to probe into the incident.
