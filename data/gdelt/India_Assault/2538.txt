Neighbour booked for raping 18-yr-old for 9 months

Ludhiana: Acting on a complaint of an 18-year-old schoolgirl, police have booked her 22-year-old neighbour for allegedly raping her for nine months and blackmailing her with the help of nude pictures and videos.

The girl shared this fact with her parents on Friday, following which a complaint was lodged with the police. The police have registered a case under Sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the IPC.

The girl, who studies in Class XII, said her father and the accused’s father were friends and lived in the same locality. The accused often visited her house.

In May 2018, when her family had gone to Himachal Pradesh for pilgrimage, the accused came to her house and offered her sweets claiming that her father had won a lottery. As she ate the sweet, she fell unconscious.

The girl alleged that when she gained consciousness, she was lying naked in the bed, and the accused was clicking her pictures. He showed her those pictures and their video, threatening her to keep mum. Moreover, when the girl was alone on days in July, September and December, he allegedly raped her again by threatening to upload her pictures and videos on the social media. Further in January, he forced her to come to a hotel near the bus stand, where he committed the crime again.

The girl alleged that the accused also extorted money from her, which she had to steal from her house.

ASI Arshdeep Kaur Grewal, investigating officer, said, “The police have registered a case. Our team has raided the house of the accused, but he is absconding. We have launched a manhunt to arrest him.”
