The accused was then remanded to judicial custody. In a similar case, police had arrested a 16-year-old boy for sexually assaulting an eight-year-old girl near Colachel in Kanyakumari district of Tamil Nadu.

The girl was living with her grandmother after the death of her mother and was studying in Class 3 in a government school near her house. A 16-year-old teenager living in the same area found her alone in her house a few days ago. He sexually assaulted the girl and threatened her to not tell anyone about the incident.

However, the girl told her grandmother about what had happened to her. After that, her grandmother saw the teenager passing by their house and questioned him about the same. Suddenly, the boy got angry and beat up the girl's grandmother as well. The elderly lady then approached the Colachel police station and filed a complaint. Cops registered a case and are searching for the teenager who has since gone absconding.
