Dalit Youth Set Ablaze In Uttar Pradesh Because He Was In Relationship With A Girl From Different Caste

In a shocking crime, a 20-year-old Dalit youth from Bhadesa area of Hardoi district in UP was set ablaze by the relatives of a girl whom he was in a relationship with.

The incident happened on Sunday when the youth identified as Abhishek alias Monu, had gone to meet his girlfriend, who is also from the same village.

The girl's adoptive parents who belonged to an OBC caste were reportedly opposed to her relationship with a Dalit boy.

The girl's father caught them in a compromising position and in a fit of rage beat him up with the help of some relatives inside his house and later set Monu on fire.

"Abhishek alias Monu was in a relationship with a girl who used to live in Bhadaicha village. The boy was found in a suspicious state from the girl's house. Monu's relatives filed a complaint and leveled allegations that 5 people set him ablaze. We have registered the FIR. Three people have been arrested and two are absconding," SP East Hardoi, K Gyananjay Singh told ANI.

Abhishek was rushed to a hospital by some villagers who rushed to the spot hearing his cry.

"Abhishek was admitted in the district hospital in Hardoi. Later, he was referred to the trauma centre in Lucknow but he succumbed to his injuries on his way to the centre," Singh said.

Abhishek's family also said that his mother Ram Beti, who was unwell, died of shock hearing about her son's death.

"To burn a Dalit youth alive in the name of caste over love affair in Hardoi district of Uttar Pradesh is very cruel and extremely condemnable. The BSP demands that the government should immediately punish culprits so that no such incident takes place in the state again," BSP chief Mayawati said in a tweet.
