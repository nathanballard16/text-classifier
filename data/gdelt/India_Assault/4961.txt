Axe all videos on Pollachi horror from Internet: HC

Chennai, March 15 : The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Friday told the Central government to remove all the videos related to the Pollachi serial sexual assaults from the Internet.

On a PIL filed by an Ilamuhil from Trichy, Justices N. Kirubakaran and S.S. Sundar also directed the Tamil Nadu government to issue a fresh government order transferring the case to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

The earlier order had revealed the name of the victim.

The court also recommended to the state government to take departmental action against the officials who revealed the identity of the victim, observing that other victims would not come forward to lodge complaints fearing similar exposure.

"The cries of the victim is still echoing in our ears," the judges said. "If the identity of the victim is revealed, how will anyone come forward against such atrocities?"

Stating that the incident had sent shock waves across the country, the Bench said: "Let it be an eye-opener. Such incidents should not happen again."

The court also directed the State to advertise that sharing and circulation of such videos was an offence and suggested including a chapter on cyber crimes in schools.

Stating that social media had several advantages and disadvantages, Ilamugil submitted that videos, pictures and audio files relating to sexual offences were being circulated on social media.

Meanwhile, the key accused in the case, Thirunavukkarasu, was remanded in four days police custody for questioning after a petition filed by the CB-CID.
