Bengal Doctors On Strike After Colleague Attacked For Alleged Negligence

Junior doctors locked up the hospital gates, stopped work at the out patient department

Junior doctors are on strike at all state-run medical institutions in West Bengal today after a doctor at a government hospital in Kolkata was assaulted last night over alleged negligence. The assaulted doctor is in critical condition and was beaten up by relatives of a patient who died at the hospital.

Junior doctors at the NRS Medical College and Hospital, who said their colleague was assaulted in the presence of police, have accused the cops of inaction.

The junior doctors this morning locked up the hospital gates, stopped work at the Out Patient Department, and started a dharna to protest the attack. They also put up posters at the hospital gates, which read: "Save Doctors, Save Nation".

The agitating junior doctors at the NRS Medical College and Hospital said there will be no work at any medical college and hospital in the state until they are given full protection.

However, patients later broke open the gates to enter the hospital. Scores of patients were seen this morning at the hospital waiting for treatment.

West Bengal Medical Council (WBMC) president and Trinamool MLA Nirmal Maji told news agency Press Trust of India that officials were trying to persuade the doctors to resume work.

"The chief minister has sent MoS Health Chandrima Bhattacharya, Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma, myself and other senior officials to talk to them. We are looking into their demand and hopefully the matter will be solved quickly," Mr Maji said.

Heavy police force has been deployed at the hospital after the attack on the doctor.
