CM sanctions construction of bus stand in Vellalore

Coimbatore: Five years after late chief minister J Jayalalithaa announced an integrated bus stand in Vellalore, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Thursday informed the assembly that the construction of the facility would begin this fiscal.

“Coimbatore, being the next biggest city in the state after Chennai, is seeing an increase in traffic flow. To manage it, Amma had announced a modern integrated bus stand in Vellalore, spread across 61.62 acres at a cost of Rs 178.26crore,” he said. “We will sanction the funds and the work will begin this year.”

The Coimbatore city corporation, which was supposed to execute the project, had handed it over to the national highways wing of the state highways department in May last year. TNN
