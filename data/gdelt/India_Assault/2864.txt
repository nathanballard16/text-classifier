Pulwama Attack: Jaitley Calls Pakistan PM Imran Khan’s Demand For Proof A ‘Shallow Logic’

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s statement to ask India for “evidence or actionable intelligence” that the Pulwama attack was perpetrated by the neighbouring country is a “shallow logic as though the origin of the crime is not known”.

“Here the perpetrators of crime have admitted to the crime. There is a confession by them. Though this confession may be in form on muscle flexing. And those perpetrators are admittedly located in the country of which Mr. Khan is the prime minister,” Jaitley told reporters after a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security.

Khan in a televised speech said his nation would retaliate only if India attacks, adding his country was being “blamed without any evidence”.

Tensions have been simmering between the historic arch-rivals since a militant car bombing, claimed by a Pakistani-based group Jaish-e-Mohammed, on Feb. 14 killed 40 personnel of India’s Central Reserve Police Force in Kashmir. It was one of the deadliest strikes in the region in decades.

India’s Ministry of External Affairs said it was “not surprised” that Khan refused to acknowledge the attack or condemn the killings. “Khan’s demand to provide proof was a ‘lame excuse’,” it said.
