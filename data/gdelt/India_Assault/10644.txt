2 Muslim men thrashed in Gurugram for allegedly smuggling beef, arrested

New Delhi :

Two Muslim men were allegedly assaulted by a mob in Haryana’s Gurugram on the suspicion of smuggling beef. The incident took place on Tuesday when a group of "cow protection unit" near Islampur village intercepted two vehicles allegedly carrying "beef consignment".

Shathil Ahmad, a resident of Palwal district, and Tayaid were caught by the mob and beaten black and blue, while two others managed to escape. Later, the police reached the spot and arrested them, while their atackers continued to roam freely.

"We have registered an FIR under various sections of the Haryana Gauvansh Sanrakshan and Gausamvardhan Act, 2015," police said, adding the search for two others who fled the scene was on.

According to one Savita Kataria, who led the group, residents of the village went on a rampage after “they saw beef inside the vehicles” and thrashed Ahmad and Tayaid. The police said the accused were on their way to deliver the beef consignment in Delhi, adding that the two vehicles had been seized.

The incidents of lynching by cow vigilantes have been on the rise across the country in the last few years. Recently, a Muslim man in BJP-ruled Jharkhand was lynched to death by a Hindu mob. He was also forced to chant “Jai Shree Ram” when the mob found out about his religion.
