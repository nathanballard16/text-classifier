The 17-year-old boy who died in the attack around noon was identified as Mohammad Sharik, son of Intijar Ahmed of Haridwar. He worked in Jammu as a labour hand, according to officials.

Jammu IGP M K Sinha said that Yasir Javed Bhat, a resident of Khanpora-Dassein village in Kulgam, was tasked by Hizbul Mujahideen Kulgam district commander Farooq Ahmad Bhat alias Umar to carry out the attack. He said Bhat came with the grenade to Jammu Thursday morning after he left Kulgam the previous night. He had brought the grenade in a tiffin box. He was fleeing after the attack when he was arrested by policemen at Nagrota on the outskirts of the city, Sinha said.

The boy was identified on the basis of eyewitness accounts and recordings of CCTV cameras installed in the area. He was travelling in a Tavera at the time of his arrest. All police checkpoints were alerted about a man wearing a blue jacket and carrying a red rucksack.

Since May 2018, this was the third grenade attack at the Jammu bus stand. While two policemen and a civilian were injured in grenade attack at general bus stand on May 24 last year, another grenade was hurled at a local police post in the area in December by some unidentified people. However, no one was injured in this attack as the grenade fell short of the intended target and exploded midway.
