Commentary: Why the huge problem of rape in India isn’t going away

SINGAPORE: Seven years ago this week, India witnessed one of its most horrific crimes against a woman.

The brutal rape of Jyoti Singh, a 23-year old physiotherapy intern in a bus on her way back home from a movie with a male friend, shocked many across the world.

The six perpetrators, brutally raped her, going as far as inserting an iron rod and left her to die. She eventually succumbed to her wounds in a hospital in Singapore.

The case rocked India. Thousands took to the streets to protest, candle-lit vigils were held and fresh demands for new laws and stiffer penalties were made.

LITTLE HAS CHANGED

One may think the incident would produce a sea-change in sexual violence against women. Sadly, not much has changed after seven years.

In 2017, the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) reported 32,559 rape cases, amounting to nearly 90 a day across the whole of India. This was 30.7 per cent more than the cases reported in 2012.

This and other cases have dubiously propelled the capital city New Delhi as the “rape capital” of the world.

In 2014, the number of rape cases proportionate to the women population was higher than in any other city or state in India with 1,813 reported rapes.

But the capital alone is not to be blamed.

In recent weeks, in particular, two cases elsewhere in India have taken the country by storm.

In Hyderabad, a young 27-year old vet returned to her scooter parked behind a truck, only to be dragged by the four occupants of the truck into a nearby compound, where she was raped and killed.
