Patients demand solution to Manipur doctors' strike

Imphal March 25 : As the resident doctors and students of the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences, Imphal, continued their agitation for the second day on Monday, thousands of patients from Manipur and neighbouring states were denied medicare.

Suffering patients have demanded an early resolution of the impasse.

The resident doctors went on strike on Sunday after three medical practitioners, including a women, were allegedly thrashed by the relatives of a patient who died in RIMS on Saturday.

Family members of the diseased blamed medical negligence for the death.

Later, the resident doctors of J.N. Institute of Medical Sciences (JNIMS), a state-run medical college, also joined the protest.

Dr A. Santa, RIMS Director, informed the agitators a police complaint had been filed. However, no arrest was made.

Dr M. Jiten, JNIMS Medical Superintendent, said: "Doctors are not gods, though they are doing everything possible to serve the people."

Some students said allegations of assault and vandalism were leveled even before a proper inquiry.

Meanwhile, video clips showing assault were telecast on some local channels.

The striking RIMS doctors said they shall abstain from casualty duty till the culprits are arrested.

On the other hand, R.K. Birla, a family member of the deceased, said the resident doctors are agitating "to cover up their negligence". He claimed though the bereaved family members had remained silent, they lodged a police complaint on Sunday in view of the agitation.

Upset with agitating doctors, patients who are left in the lurch said an amicable solution should be reached before the situation gets aggravated.

Most patients can ill-afford the expenses in the private hospitals.
