Kerala CPI(M) leader's son booked in rape case in Mumbai, denies charge

Six months ago, the woman had sent a letter to him demanding Rs five crore and alleging that he had married her and had a child from her, Binoy told television channels in Thiruvananthapuram.

In an embarrassment to the ruling CPI(M) in Kerala, the Mumbai police has registered a case of rape and cheating against the son of the party's state secretary, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan. The case was filed on the basis of a complaint from a 33-year-old woman from Bihar, a former bar dancer, who has alleged that Binoy Vinodini Balakrishnan sexually assaulted her promising marriage and that she has an eight year old son from him. Admitting that he knew the woman, Binoy, however, said the allegation was "baseless".
