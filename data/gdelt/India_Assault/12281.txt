200 booked for pelting stones on cops during protest in Sikka

RAJKOT: A total of 200 people were booked on Wednesday for allegedly pelting stones at a police party, injuring a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and three cops including women police officials in Sikka of Jamnagar district on Tuesday evening.Of the 200 accused, 19 have been identified. According to the police, residents of Nagani Sarmat Bhunga locality in Sikka were protesting against the construction of a wall to be built by Gujarat State Fertilizer Corporation (GSFC). When its foundation stone was being laid on Monday, the locals started to protest, forcing the GSFC staff to stall the work and seek police protection. They decided to complete the work in presence of police and the SDM.The locals are against the construction of the wall as they claim that it would not only block their way to the Dargah, but also result in waterlogging.“After work resumed on Tuesday evening, the locals again started gathering at the site. When about 200 had gathered at the spot, the mob suddenly started pelting stones. We had to resort to mild lathicharge to disperse the crowd,” said K R Sisodiya, sub-inspector with Sikka police station.Police said SDM Yogesh Chaudhary and constables — Bhagwati Makwana, Rupal Matiya and Dharanant Chandrawadia — were injured in the attack.“We promised the locals to construct a road leading to the Dargah and build the wall in such a way that it would not cause waterlogging. Yet, the locals remained persistent with their protest and did not allow the work on the wall to be resumed,” said GSFC official Dilip Gandhi.
