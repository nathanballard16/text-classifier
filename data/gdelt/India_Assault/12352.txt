Rajiv Gandhi assassination case: Nalini Sriharan released on parole for her daughter’s marriage

Nalini Sriharan, one of the seven convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, was on Thursday released from Vellore Central Prison on month-long parole to make arrangements for her daughter’s wedding. The Madras High Court had on July 5 granted permission to release her on parole for a month to attend her daughter’s wedding.

The order was passed by the division bench of Justice MM Sundresh and Justice M Nirmal Kumar which granted her parole on the condition that she would not meet political leaders, give interviews to the media or post on social media.

Nalini will remain in Vellore town, which is around 140 kilometres from Chennai, where her family has hired a house at Sathuvachari for the wedding.

She has not been allowed to visit her house in Royapettah in Chennai.
