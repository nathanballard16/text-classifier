Her death led to protests across Bangladesh with people on Thursday forming human chains and holding demonstrations seeking justice for the victim.The demonstration sought stern punishment for the victim's murderers and expressed condolences to her bereaved family, the Dhaka Tribune reported.Online news portal bdnews24.com quoted police as saying that Siraj orchestrated the killing of Rafi from jail after his arrest on March 27 in the case.Deputy inspector general Ruhul Amin, who is heading the probe committee, said the investigation will take several more days to wrap up as investigators are examining various documents.He said Siraj had a history of condemnable behaviour that was known to the madrasa governing body.The police officer also also hinted at involvement of political leaders in the murder."Local politics is linked with the Nusrat incident. Two councillors from a party organised human-chain programmes for and against the principal," he said.According to the report, the police is also investigating whether there has been negligence on the part of police while investigating the murder case."We have found preliminary evidence against the former officer-in-charge of Sonagazi police station and senior police officers.
