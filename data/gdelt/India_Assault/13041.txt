Unnao rape survivor critical, won't be shifted to Delhi, SC asks govt to move uncle to Tihar

SC has deferred its order to shift the Unnao rape survivor to Delhi.

The Supreme Court was informed on Friday that the Unnao rape survivor is completely unconscious and in a critical condition. After the lawyer pleaded that she should be shifted once her condition stabilises, the court agreed and deferred the earlier order to airlift her to AIIMS Delhi for further treatment.

The Unnao rape survivor is currently undergoing treatment at the KGMU hospital in Lucknow.

In its latest medical bulletin on the rape survivor and her lawyer, the hospital has said that both are stable but critical. The rape survivor is on ventilator and has developed a fever. The lawyer has been taken off ventilar support.

The court has also asked Uttar Pradesh government to move the girl's uncle to the Tihar jail from Rae Bareli.

Although UP government argued that her uncle is perfectly safe in the Rae Bareli jail and there are no security concerns, the court said that he should be immediately shifted to Tihar.

The UP government advocate then said that since he is a prime witness in the case, they have no objections to him being shifted out of the state.

After the Supreme Court order on Thursday, UP government on Friday informed the court that they have handed over a compensation cheque to the family.

The court had ordered the Yogi Adityanath government to immediately pay a compensation of Rs 25 lakh to the girl and her family.

The court had also ordered CBI to finish probe into the Unnao survivor's accident case within 14 days. It has also asked trial in all five related cases to be finished with 45 days.

The matter of the Unnao rape will now be heard before a different bench of the Supreme Court. The bench will monitor the case proceedings from now.
