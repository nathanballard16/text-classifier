All five cases linked to Unnao rape to be shifted to Delhi, says Supreme Court

The survivor and her lawyer may be airlifted to Delhi, CBI gets 1 week to investigate the woman's accident

The apex court also directed the Uttar Pradesh government to provide Rs 25 lakh to the rape survivor as an interim compensation.

The Supreme Court on Thursday directed the transfer of all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a court in Uttar Pradesh to a court in the national capital.

It also directed the CBI to complete within seven days the investigation of the fifth case relating to the accident in which the woman and her lawyer are critically injured.

A bench headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi made it clear that the agency can only seek extension of time for probe in the accident case in exceptional circumstances.

The court also took note of the oral instructions received by the CBI from the doctors of the King George Medical College Hospital that both the woman and her lawyer are in the condition to be airlifted to AIIMS, New Delhi.

It will, however, pass the order in this regard after receiving instruction from their family members.
