Parliament Winter Session: Been told I am the worst FM, says Nirmala Sitharaman in LS

LS: Verbal duel over Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's comments on PM, BJP chief

There was a verbal duel in the Lok Sabha today over Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury's remarks -- made over the weekend -- that Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were "infiltrators" in Delhi. (On Sunday, Chowdhury had said the duo were migrants since they had homes in Gujarat but lived in Delhi.)

During the Question Hour, when Chowdhury rose to ask a supplementary related to the Steel Ministry, ruling alliance members tried to mock him by shouting the word "infiltrator" several times. Chowdhury immediately tried to counter by saying: "Yes, I am an infiltrator, I am a 'deemak' [termite]. Modi is an infiltrator. Amit Shah is an infiltrator. LK Advani is an infiltrator".

Union Petroleum and Steel Minister Dharmendra Pradhan shot back, saying Chowdhury's "design would be exposed soon".

"The country will not run by your definitions," the minister said.
