India carried out 3 air strikes outside borders in 5 years: Rajnath

Mangaluru: India has carried out a total of three air strikes outside the country’s borders during the past five years, said Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday.

“During the past five years, we have gone out of our borders to carry out air strikes thrice. I can speak about two strikes, but can’t reveal about the third one,” said Singh without disclosing details of the air strikes.

Singh was addressing a Bharatiya Janata Party rally in this port city, about 350km west of Bengaluru.

His remarks came about two weeks after the Indian Air Force had said on February 26 that it carried out an air strike against terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) training camp in Balakote in Pakistan.

The air strike was after JeM on February 14 claimed suicide bombing at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir, which killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers.
