Surat minor rape-murder: Gujarat HC gives convict death penalty

The Gujarat High Court has given the death penalty to a man accused of raping and murdering a three-year-old girl in Surat last year.

The accused, Anil Yadav, is from Bihar and is in his early twenties. The victim's family knew him.

Yadav committed the crime in October last year; the victim went missing from her home and was later found packed in a plastic bag in a locked building.

The incident happened soon after the rape of a 14-month-old girl in Sabarkantha, which triggered attacks across Gujarat on migrants from Bihar and UP.

Anil Yadav escaped to Bihar, but was soon arrested there.

He was later given a death sentence by a special court in Surat, which took into account statements from 38 witness, as well as medical and circumstantial evidence.
