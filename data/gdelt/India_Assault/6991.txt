MC officer’s assault triggers political storm in Ludhiana

LUDHIANA: A day after MC officer was assaulted by a real estate developer, political parties joined the bandwagon to criticize the state government, alleging security lapse.SAD-BJP candidate Maheshinder Singh Grewal and Lok Insaaf Party MLA Balwinder Bains extended support to protesting MC employees and joined their dharna at the MC zone D office on Thursday.Both the leaders condemned the attack on the woman employee and attacked the Congress government for poor law and order situation that has left even government employees unsafe. Grewal said when police could register an FIR against the developer and 8 other, then why can’t they arrest him.He alleged that developer enjoyed patronage of Congress MP Ravneet Bittu and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan and this is the reason why he attacked government employees.SAD district president Ranjit Dhillon along with former councillor Bhupinder Bhinda and a few other party workers also visited zone D to support MC employees. Congress councillor Parvinder Lapran also visited employees in the morning. Former cabinet minister Bikram Majithia also condemned the incident.Meanwhile, leaders of Youth Akali Dal (YAD) alleged that developer Gurnam Singh was affiliated to Congress and he is very close to Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh.The YAD leaders also highlighted a few past incidents where women employees had been attacked during the Congress regime in the past two years and claimed that neither women employees in the government nor other women in the state are safe under the Congress rule.The YAD leaders also staged a protest outside the temporary residence of developer in Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. YAD district presidents Gurdeep Gosha and Meetpal Singh Dugri alleged that the realtor enjoyed support from many senior Congress leaders, including MP Ravneet Bittu and cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu. They claimed that there are pictures of realtor with CM Amarinder Singh.The leaders alleged that women are not safe in Congress rule as it was not the first incident of assault and misbehaviour with women officials. They said earlier, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu had misbehaved with district education officer; Congress MLA Davinder Singh Ghubaya misbehaved with female SHO. Now, an “office-bearer” of Congress slapped and misbehaved with lady officer, they alleged. They added that if officials were not safe in the state, then how will common people feel safe in Punjab.The leaders claimed that they were supposed to stage a protest outside residence of developer in BRS Nagar, but that house is under construction and he is living in SBS Nagar but the house was locked when they reached there to protest.The protesters including Meetpal Singh Dugri, Gurdeep Singh Gosha, Prabhjot Singh Dhaliwal, Tanvir Singh Dhaliwal and many others sat on a dharna outside the locked house and demanded immediate arrest of the developer.However, mayor Balkar Sandhu said, “A businessman is affiliated to power and it does not matter to him which party is heading the state. Similar is the case with Gurnam Singh and such pictures do not prove anything.” He said the YAD leaders were trying to use it in the elections to help their candidate as they do not have anything else to give a strong fight to Congress’s MP and candidate Ravneet Bittu.
