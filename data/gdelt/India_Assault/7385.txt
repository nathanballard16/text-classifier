Rajinikanth's Darbar crew attacked with stones by college students?

The entire crew of AR Murugadoss is furious over the leak of the pictures from the sets of the upcoming Rajinikanth film Darbar. Photos from the sets of the film in Mumbai went viral on social media recently.

Superstar Rajinikanth's look from the film has now been revealed. In addition to that, we have also seen a photo of Rajinikanth batting with Nayanthara beside him. The crew, which was wondering how the photos got leaked, seems to have stumbled upon the answer.

The shooting of Darbar is currently on in a college in Mumbai and it is said that the college students seem to have clicked the photos and recorded videos from the sets. This didn't go down well with the crew members, who stopped the students from getting near the sets.

Students were not allowed to get near the shooting spot, which seems to have angered them. Reportedly, there were altercations between the crew members and students.

The students allegedly pelted stones at the crew from the terrace of the college building. Now, AR Murugadoss has taken the issue to the college management. It is said that he is also thinking of changing the location of the shoot.
