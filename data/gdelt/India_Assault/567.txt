Lawyers initiate agitation for Kolhapur circuit bench

Kolhapur: Lawyers from the Kolhapur district have initiated their agitation for their demand of a circuit bench for Kolhapur. We do not want the government to cite this reason and not take any decision regarding the circuit bench for Kolhapur. The circuit bench is for the people from all these districts. The decision was unanimously taken by the lawyers from the Kolhapur district under the banner of the Kolhapur District Bar Association (KDBA), in a meeting organized on January 11.“From the last three years we are fighting for a letter from Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to be sent to the Bombay High Court authorities, regarding the setting up of a circuit bench at Kolhapur. This will benefit the litigants from all these districts,” added the KDBA member.
