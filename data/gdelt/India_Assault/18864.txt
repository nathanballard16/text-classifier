Two killed, seven injured in Kashmir grenade attacks

Srinagar: At least two people were killed in grenade attacks in Kashmir on Tuesday and two militants shot dead by Indian forces, officials said, in one of the region’s most violent days since New Delhi imposed a security clampdown.

Amid heightened tensions, suspected militants staged two grenade attacks on Tuesday, a top police official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP.

One was thrown at a group of village councillors and government officials waiting outside an administration building in the village of Hakura, south of the main city of Srinagar. Two people were killed and at least four injured.

The second grenade was lobbed into a store next to an entrance to the University of Kashmir in Srinagar, injuring three people, the official added. (AFP)
