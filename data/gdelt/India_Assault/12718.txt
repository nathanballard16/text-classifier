Admitted to hospital, prisoner escapes from police custody

Nabbed in 2015, man ‘used sharp object to cut window open’

An undertrial prisoner who was getting treated at a government hospital in west Delhi escaped from police custody on Sunday night, the police said on Tuesday.

DCP (West) Monika Bhardwaj said Raju alias Mango, a resident of west Delhi’s Raghubir Nagar, was arrested in 2015 under Section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) of the IPC.

He was admitted to DDU when he complained of illness. He allegedly cut the net of the hospital window and fled, the police said. “The information was received at 10.10 p.m. in Hari Nagar police station about the escape of an undertrial prisoner, who was lodged in Tihar jail. He was in custody of two constables,” Ms. Bhardwaj said.

A senior officer said it is suspected that the accused managed to steal a sharp object during his treatment, which he used to cut the window open. Constables Sandeep and Mahesh of the third Battalion were on duty at that time, the officer said.

A report on the incident has been sent to DCP of the third Battalion and a case under Section 224 (Resistance or obstruction by a person to his lawful apprehension) of the IPC has been registered.
