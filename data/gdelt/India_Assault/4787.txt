According to the newspaper it was the first instance of action against a violation of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) on social media.

"The EC is learnt to have flagged the content to Shivnath Thukral, Director, Public Policy for India and South Asia, at Facebook, based on a complaint received on its cVIGIL app," the paper said.

Abdhinandan was released by Pakistan as a peace gesture last month when tensions spiked between the two countries following Pulwama attack in Occupied Kashmir.
