2012 Delhi gang-rape case: Hope SC turns down convict's review plea, deliver speedy justice, says victim's mother

New Delhi [India], Dec 17 (ANI): Ahead of the Supreme Court hearing on the review plea filed by one of the convicts in the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case, Akshay Kumar Singh, the victim's mother hoped that the apex court will turn down his petition and deliver speedy justice to the family.



"We believe that we will get justice because we have no other option. I hope that the Supreme Court will reject his (Akshay's) petition today," Asha Devi, the victim's mother, told ANI here.

"The convicts do not have anything left to defend themselves and they are just taking such moves to stretch the case. I trust the judiciary and believe that justice will be served soon," Devi added.

The mother also said that if expelled BJP lawmaker Kuldeep Sengar, a convict in the 2017 Unnao rape case, and the four convicts get capital punishment, then a strong message will be sent across the society.

The apex court will hear Akshay's plea seeking review of its decision on the death penalty in connection with the 2012 Delhi gang-rape case.

According to an official circular, a three-judge bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde, Justices R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan will hear Akshay Kumar Singh's petition at 2 pm.

A three-judge bench of the top court had in May 2017, dismissed the appeals filed by the four convicts against the death sentence awarded to them.

The four convicts -- Mukesh, Akshay, Pawan and Vinay -- had knocked the doors of the apex court against a Delhi High Court order which confirmed the capital punishment awarded to them by the trial court in September 2013.

The 23-year-old paramedical student was gang-raped in a moving bus in south Delhi by six persons on the night of December 16, 2012. Out of the six, one was a minor and appeared before a juvenile justice court, while another accused had committed suicide in Tihar Jail. (ANI)
