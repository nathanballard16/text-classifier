2 gang-rape sister-in-law, arrested

Greater Noida: Two men were arrested in Bulandshahr on Monday, days after their widowed sister-in-law alleged that the duo gang-raped her several times after her husband’s death.

According to police, one of the accused is the younger brother of the 21-year-old complainant’s husband, while the other is the husband of her sister-in-law. The woman’s family said she got married two years ago, but her husband died in January due to a prolonged illness. Since then, she was being subjected to cruelty and assault by the two brothers-in-law, who also allegedly gang-raped her.

“After the death of my sister’s husband, we requested his family to let her live with us, but they refused. They didn’t let us talk to her for 20 days, saying she is ill. We approached police and managed to rescue her with their intervention on Thursday,” the woman’s brother said.

Cops said the duo had fled to their hometown in Pandavnagar village after the woman filed a police complaint, from where they were arrested on Monday evening.
