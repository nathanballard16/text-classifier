Karnataka assembly speaker Ramesh Kumar compares himself with a rape survivor

BENGALURU: In a case of insensitive and crass humor in the legislative assembly, Karnataka speaker K R Ramesh Kumar compared himself with a rape survivor who had to undergo the torment of explaining the heinous crime time and again in the court of law.During the discussion on the controversial audio clips that mentions Kumar’s name for having allegedly taken Rs 50 crore in a purported conversation between opposition leader B S Yeddyurappa, BJP MLA Shivangouda Naik and Shravangouda Kandakur, son of JD(S) MLA Naddangouda Kandakur, Kumar tried to crack a joke of how his name has been recorded time and again in the debate over the last two days.The insensitive joke of a rape survivor being raped again and again when cross examined in the court of law, was received with loud laughter from the male-dominated legislators, even as the ten women legislators including chief minister H D Kumaraswamy's wife Anitha Kumaraswamy remained mute spectators.On Tuesday, as former chief minister Jagadish Shettar presented his case on behalf of the BJP as to why the audio clip investigation should not be handed to an SIT for investigation, a laughing Kumar intervened and said: “Basavaraj... I just recalled the case of a rape victim (survivor) when she has to go to the court to speak on the case. The judge and the court will ask her about the incident as to where rape took place, how the rape took place and so on. After she comes out and I ask her, what happened in the court, she would say that the rape may have happened once but the questions in the court had raped her a 100 times over. This appears to be the situation in my case too.”The house erupted in laughter, with the women legislators remaining mute spectators and none raising their objections.No sooner did Kumar cracked the “joke”, BJP legislators tried to quip with comments over how the treasury bench has been passing compliments about him and keep speaking of his name being involved in the audio clip.To this, Kumar continued with his line of insensitivity and said: “What can I do, both sides of the aisle keep passing compliments on me and then continue to climb on me.”BJP legislator and former deputy chief minister K S Eshwarappa added fuel to the fire by making another crass joke and said: “Now, we know how the ruling coalition continues to rape you over and over again with them mentioning your name time and again.”
