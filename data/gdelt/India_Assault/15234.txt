Ahmedabad: Woman elopes with lover, alleges rape

In an interesting case of honey trap, a 36-year-old married woman was lured by a man, identified as Rishi Parmar, who met via Instagram. Soon they both turned out to be best of buddies.

As their relationship turned sour, the woman lodged a complaint at the Sabarmati police station, alleging rape by her lover.

According to the police, the lady was not in stable mind as the couple would fight on regular basis. The woman, a mother of two daughters, came in contact with the accused Rishi Parmar, and they got into physical relationship. She blindly fell for the accused and eloped with her lover on the pretext of getting married.

The accused promised to marry her and took her to Dahegam, where they started living in a rented house. After spending quality time with the accused, she was asked to go back to her to her husband.

The woman returned to Ahmedabad and started residing at her parent’s house, who later narrated the entire incident to her mother. On her mother’s advise, the victim lodged a case against the accused at the Sabarmati police station. Right now the accused is absconding and search for him is on.
