Calls for Indian hero pilot's facial hair to be made 'national moustache'

The facial hair of an Indian pilot captured by Pakistani forces who was later returned should be declared a "national moustache", a political leader has said.

Abhinandan Varthaman's facial hair has inspired many to copy him when he returned two days after he was captured by Pakistan when his MiG-21 crashed in the country.

Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, leader of the Indian National Congress in the Indian parliament, said: "Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman should be awarded and his moustache should be made 'national moustache'."

Mr Varthaman's handlebar-shaped facial growth has become known as the "Abhinandan" in barbershops around the country.

India was gripped by the pilot's story after Pakistan's interior ministry released videos of him in custody but appearing completely calm and sipping tea.

He has become a symbol of peace between the two countries for many on both sides, while his handlebar tash has become a patriotic symbol for Indians.

Dairy giant Amul was also inspired by Mr Varthaman's whiskers, with an advert bearing the slogan "mooch nahin, toh kuch nahin", which loosely translates to "without a moustache, you don't have anything".

Mr Varthaman was released on 1 March and he received a hero's welcome in his native India - and became a national phenomenon with his facial hair.
