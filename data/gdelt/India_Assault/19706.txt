No rapes before mobile, TV: Rajasthan minister's bizarre statement on crimes against women

A day after a filmmaker advised women to carry condoms and accept rape, here comes another incomprehensible comment on rape. A Rajasthan minister says that the advent of TVs and mobiles have given rise to heinous crimes like rape.

Congress leader Bhanwarlal Meghwal, Minister of Social Welfare of Rajasthan, has said that there were no rapes before TVs and mobiles were invented. "Now youngsters are moving towards wrong trends by looking at mobile TV."

Speaking to media in Jaipur, Bhanwarlal Meghwal said that courts must decide on rape cases within three months and culprits should be hanged publicly. The comments came in connection with the Hyderabad doctor rape and murder case. The 26-year-old veterinarian was raped, battered and burned to death when she was on her way back from clinic to home in Telangana's Cyberabad police area.

Indian politicians are notoriously known for making bizarre comments on rape and its causes.

Months before the Delhi gangrape incident in December 2012, a Haryana khap leader said Chinese fast food chowmein was the cause of rape. In 2015, Binay Bihari then minister in Bihar said that mobile phones and non-vegetarian food are reasons for a surge in rape cases. In 2014, Babulal Gaur, then BJP minister from Madhya Pradesh said that item numbers in Bollywood films were responsible for creating an atmosphere for such crimes. He also indicated that women are raped with their consent. A year earlier, Babulal Gaur had blamed women wearing jeans for a rise in rape cases.

The Anjuman Muslim Panchayat in Salumbur town in Rajasthan has decreed that girls should not use mobile phones outside their own homes or dance at weddings so that they do not get involved with boys.

Former Mumbai Police Commissioner Satyapal Singh said in 2013 that countries with sex education in their curriculum only had an increased number of crimes against women.
