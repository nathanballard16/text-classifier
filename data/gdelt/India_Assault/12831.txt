CJI to take up Unnao rape survivor's letter on 'threats' today, says it didn't reach him

NEW DELHI, July 31 (Agencies): Supreme Court Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi on Wednesday took suo moto cognisance of a letter written by the family of the Unnao rape survivor, alleging threats from Uttar Pradesh MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar's men. The court will hear the case on Thursday.

The Supreme Court also sought a report from its secretary general as to why a letter written by the Unnao rape victim to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, apprehending threat to her life, was not placed before him.

"Unfortunately, the letter is yet to see the light of the day and yet the newspapers flashed it as if I have read the letter," Justice Gogoi said.

The observations came when senior lawyer V Giri, who is assisting the court as an amicus curiae in child rape cases, sought urgent listing of the Unnao rape case.

The court also asked the Uttar Pradesh authorities to file a status report by Thursday on the accident of the Unnao rape case victim.

The 19-year-old woman, who was allegedly raped two years ago by BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar at his residence in Unnao, was critically injured in a car crash on Sunday.

She was travelling with her family when their car was hit by a speeding truck in the northern state's Rae Bareli district.

Two of her family members were killed in the accident while her lawyer also sustained serious injuries. The woman's family has filed a complaint alleging "conspiracy" behind the car crash.
