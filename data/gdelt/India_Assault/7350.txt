From the Archives (May 2, 1969): Three killed in police firing in Hyderabad

Three persons were killed and 12 others were injured according to official sources when police opened fire at three places in the city [Hyderabad] to-day [May 1] to disperse violent crowds which indulged in stoning and arson. The Telengana Praja Samithi, which has been spear-heading the separate Telengana State agitation, however, claimed that besides the three killed, 15 persons including a woman had received bullet injuries. According to them, over 30 persons had been admitted in various hospitals with lathi-injuries. An unspecified number of persons, including policemen and some officers, were injured in lathi-charges and stone-throwing at several places. A number of vehicles, including a military van and Government jeeps, a police station and a post office were set ablaze by mobs in various localities of the city. The Telengana Praja Samithi and the Students’ Action Committee had given a call for observance of “Telengana Demands Day” to-day all over the region to press their demand for a separate Telengana.
