Praveen, a district functionary of the RSS, and his accomplice Sreejit, a worker, threw bombs at the Nedumangad Police Station during the January 3 shutdown protesting against the entry of two women into the Sabarimala Temple, they said.

The duo was arrested from the a railway station in Thiruvanthapuram, they added.

Police had issued a look out notice against Praveen after CCTV visuals showed him hurling at least four bombs at the police station during a clash with the Communist Party of India (Marxist) workers.

A Special Investigation team was also constituted to arrest the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) functionary, they said.

Guarded by four policemen in civil dress, the two women, Kanakadurga, 44 and Bindu, 42, created history by entering the hill-shrine on January 2.

A 12-hour shutdown was called by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and other Hindu outfits to protest against their entry.

The Supreme Court had on September 28 lifted the ban on entry of girls and women between 10 and 50 years of age into the shrine dedicated to Lord Ayyappa.
