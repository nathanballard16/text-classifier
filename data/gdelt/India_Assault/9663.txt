RIYADH, June 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia announced on Wednesday "the injury of 26 civilians in a terrorist attack that targeted Abha International Airport," Saudi Press Agency reported.

A hostile projectile fired by Houthi militia on Wednesday early morning hit the arrival hall in the Abha International Airport in southwestern Asir province, said Col. Turki Al Maliki, spokesperson of Saudi-led coalition involved in a war in Yemen.

A total of 26 civilian passengers of different nationalities were injured by the projectile, including three women from India, Yemen and Saudi as well as two Saudi children, al-Maliki added.

Eight of the moderately injured were transferred to hospital for treatment while 18 were treated at the site for minor injuries. There was also some physical damage to the airport lounge.

The military and security forces are working to determine the type of the projectile used in the attack, said al-Maliki, adding that the Iran-backed Houthi militia said that it used a cruise missile.

"The Houthis claimed through its media full responsibility for the attack, which constitutes a clear recognition for targeting civilians and civilian objects that are subject to special protection under international humanitarian law, thus could amount to a war crime of targeting civilians and civilian objects in a systematic manner," according to al-Maliki.

Thousands of passengers of different nationalities pass through the Abha International Airport daily.
