Binoy Kodiyeri’s anticipatory bail plea verdict on Tuesday; court says no arrest till then

Mumbai: The verdict on Binoy Kodiyeri’s anticipatory bail plea, in connection with the rape complaint of a Bihari woman, was deferred to Tuesday by Mumbai Dindoshi Sessions Court. It also said that he can’t be arrested until a decision is taken on the plea.

Court had instructed the complainant woman to submit in writing, if there is anything more she wanted to add to her arguments. As per the instruction her lawyer submitted the arguments.

The case was takenup by the court on last Thursday and the verdict was deferred to Monday. Prosecution had said in the court that there are strong evidences against Binoy and argued that if bail is granted to him, it will affect investigation.

Senior counsel and lawyer at Mumbail HC, Ashok Gupta had appeared for Binoy. He pointed out in the court that the woman’s statements are contradictory. The woman had said in the complaint sent to Binoy that he married her and she wanted Rs 5 crore as compensation. But according to the statement given to the police, she was raped on false promise of marriage.

Binoy’s lawyer emphasised on the point that rape charge cannot be imposed if he married the woman. The rape allegation and FIR will not be valid if they are married. He also argued that the case was fabricated for blackmailing.

On the alleged day of marriage cited by the woman, Binoy was not in Mumbai. He was in Gulf. The woman alleges that they were in relationship between 2009 and 2015. Why hadn’t she complained before 2019, the lawyer further argued.

Meanwhile, the prosecution argued that Binoy should be taken into custody in order to conduct a DNA test to determine the child’s paternity.

The Bihar woman lodged the complaint with Oshiwara police against Binoy on June 13.
