Nagpur Police gives a twist to Abhinandan Varthaman's statement to Pak Army, wins the internet

Every single Indian breathed a sigh of relief when Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman finally returned home on Friday night after endless hours of tension, through the Wagah-Attari border.

Abhinandan, who was captured by Pakistan Army after his aircraft was shot down, had become a symbol of bravery and grit.

After the IAF hero was captured many videos and pictures of him had surfaced on social media.

One of the videos, which captured people’s attention, was of the Wing Commander refusing to divulge any details of his operation.

The clip showed Abhinandan being inquired about his mission, to which he had replied, "I am sorry, I am not supposed to tell you this."

After the video and Abhinandan’s reply went viral on Twitter, people praised him and even paid him tribute using the line.

And now, Nagpur police seems to be following steps with Abhinandan’s fans.
