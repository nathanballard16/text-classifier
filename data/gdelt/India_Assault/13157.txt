A team of CBI officials and the central forensic agency again the reached the site of the accident on Saturday to investigate.

On July 28, a truck rammed into the vehicle in which the Unnao rape survivor, her counsel and two aunts were travelling to Raebareli. While she and her lawyer sustained grievous injuries, her aunts died.

The Uttar Pradesh Police filed a case of murder against Uttar Pradesh MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and nine others in connection with the accident.

The Supreme Court has transferred all cases related to the Unnao rape incident, barring the accident near Raebareli, to the national capital. The top court has said that a final decision on transfer of the accident case to New Delhi will be taken after the investigation is completed by the central agency. The CBI has been given 7-14 days to investigate the accident.
