Petitioner sought increased time limit forThethrew out a PIL on Friday seeking amendments to existingin the country and increasing the time limit for the termination of pregnancies from the current 20 weeks, especially whereare concerned.A division bench of Chief Justice Pradeep Nandrajog and Bharti Dangre said that a blanket order allowing rape victims to terminate their pregnancies would result in danger to the woman’s life.The order was passed on a PIL filed by Association for Aiding Justice, a Pune-based trust, which said that in rape cases, especially those involving minors, pregnancies are often discovered very late, due to which victims are forced to deliver children.“With the rape victim’s consent, the foetus should be allowed to be aborted,” argued Dipesh Siroya, the advocate for the petitioner.The court said that usually in such cases (where pregnancies are discovered late) rape victims are ignorant, so they would not be in a position to give consent. “There are some problems that have no solutions. At 30 weeks she realises I am pregnant. It’s like the girl saying I want to commit suicide and the court says do it,” the bench said.Legally, abortions are allowed until 12 weeks. Section 3(2) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act bars abortions beyond 20 weeks. Between 12 and 20 weeks, two doctors are required to opine in good faith of the risks to the life of the pregnant woman or grave injury to her physical or mental health. The doctors’ opinion that there is a risk the child would be born with serious physical or mental handicap is another permissible reason for an MTP between 12 and 20 weeks.The MTP (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which proposes changes in law permitting termination of pregnancy up to 26 weeks, promising greater reproductive rights for Indian women, is expected to be presented before the Union cabinet soon.
