Ludhiana: The 20-year-old survivor identified all the six accused during the resumed hearing in the February 9 Issewal gang-rape case in a local court on Monday.

After recording evidence, the court fixed August 7 as the next date of hearing.

According to the prosecution, on February 9, a group of miscreants had allegedly gang raped the woman in Issewal after holding her friend captive.

Special public prosecutor B D Gupta said during the in-camera proceedings, the six accused were produced in the court and the survivor identified them. The juvenile was being treated as an adult in the case, he added. During an earlier hearing in the case, the prosecution had examined two doctors from civil hospital.

Manu Purang, the counsel for the accused, said he would like to cross-examine the survivor in the next hearing after the court’s permission. He added that during the last hearing, the court had allowed their plea to provide them a copy of CD and pen drive containing videography of identification parade conducted at central jail.

The police had booked 10 accused in the case and arrested six, including Jagroop Singh, a private vehicle driver of Jaspal Bangar; Ajay of Tibba, also a driver; a juvenile from Jammu and Kashmir and three of his kin (two from Ludhiana and one from Nawanshahr).

The cops found during investigation that only six accused, not 10, were involved in the case. Police claimed that from the DNA sample reports, call records and evidence on record, only six accused were found involved in the case. The chargesheet also mentioned that the survivor and her friend had got sketches made of only six accused.

The police had presented a chargesheet against the accused in the court on April 4.
