Defence Minister Rajnath Singh speaks to Gen Bipin Rawat after Army destroys 4 terror launch pads in PoK, kills 20 terrorists

New Delhi: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday spoke to Army Chief General Bipin Rawat over the situation after Indian Army, responding to ceasefire violation by Pakistani troops, destroyed four terror launch pads in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir (PoK) and killed at least 20 terrorists in artillery gun attack.

According to sources, the Defence Minister is personally monitoring the situation and has asked the Army Chief to keep updating him over it.

The counter-attack by the Indian Army came after the Pakistani troops violated the ceasefire and resorted to unprovoked firing targeting the civilian areas in Jammu and Kashmir`s Tangdhar sector on Sunday morning. Two Indian soldiers and one civilian were killed, while three other civilians were injured in the firing from the Pakistan Army in Tangdhara sector of Kupwara.

The Indian Army gave a befitting response to the unprovoked ceasefire violation by the Pakistan forces. The Indian side escalated the scale of attacks and started targetting the terrorist camps situated inside PoK in retaliation to the support provided by Pakistan Army to push terrorists into Indian territory.

According to sources, four to five Pakistan Army soldiers were killed and several others injured after Army launched artillery gun attacks on terrorist camps situated in Jura, Athmuqam and Kundalsahi in the Neelam Valley in PoK.

It may be noted that Athmuqam is the district headquarters of Pakistan Army.

The Indian Army used 155 mm Bofors Guns in the operation in which several Pakistani Army bunkers were also destroyed. However, during the ceasefire violation by Pakistan, two Indian soldiers and a civilian were killed in Tangdhar sector of Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir.

"Indian forces caused heavy damages and casualties to Pakistan after two Indian soldiers and one civilian were killed in ceasefire violation by Pakistan Army in Tangdhar sector," an Indian Army spokesperson said.

The bridge has been named after a highly-decorated soldier of the Indian Army, Colonel Chewang Rinchen, who belonged to Ladakh.

Meanwhile, Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs today summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia after Indian Army conducted artillery fire on terror launch pads in the PoK.
