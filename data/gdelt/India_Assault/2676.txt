Tea exports to Pakistan to take a hit post-Pulwama terror attack; exporters say business secondary-Business News , Firstpost

Tea exports to Pakistan grew marginally in 2018 to 15.83 million kilograms from 14.73 million kilograms in 2017.

Enraged by the killings of CRPF soldiers by a Pakistan based terror outfit in Jammu and Kashmir Thursday, major tea exporters said they stood by the government and business has now become secondary.

"We are not even thinking of trading with Pakistan now. We stand firmly behind the government and waiting for what the government is going to do", chairman of India Tea Exporters Association (ITEA) Angshuman Kanoria said.

Following the terror attack at Pulwama that left 40 CRPF personnel dead, India has withdrawn the most favoured nation (MFN) status to Pakistan.

“Exports to the neighbouring nation may reduce,” Vivek Goenka, chairman of Indian Tea Association, said to Economic Times. “What is more important is to protect our country from this sort of ghastly terror attacks.” He said the industry will look for other destinations like Egypt, Middle East and Russia to export Indian tea,

Gopal Poddar, one of the leading tea exporters to Pakistan, said, "We are not bothered about business now. Commerce is secondary now," he told PTI.
