A woman was raped by an occultist, said police on Tuesday. He was invited by the victim and her husband to perform a religious ritual in their home to drive away their poverty.

Gurgaon ACP (Crime) Shamsher Singh said the victim (27) and her husband had come in the contact of one Amit of Ballabhgarh in Faridabad.

Occultist boasted of having divine powers to the couple, cop added.

"As the couple was suffering from financial distress, they shared their problems with Amit, who recommended them to perform a ritual in the house to bring peace and prosperity to their lives,” said the ACP, reported PTI.

"Following the Amit's suggestion, the couple invited him to their house Monday evening to perform the ritual. After reaching the victim's place, Amit sent the husband to market to bring in some materials for the ritual," the police official said.

As the victim's husband left home to bring the requisite materials, Amit raped the woman. He then fled from the place.

Before leaving, he also threatened the victim of dire consequences, if she disclosed the incident to her husband or report the matter to the police.

However, the female narrated her ordeal to the husband.

The husband reported the matter to the police. A manhunt was launched to nab the culprit.
