Lucknow: At least 14 persons, including an 8-year-old boy, have died so far in Uttar Pradesh as protests against Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) continue to engulf the state, confirmed officials on Saturday.

According to official reports, four people have died in Meerut, two each in Sambhal, Bijnor and Kanpur while one casualty each has been reported from Lucknow, Ferozabad and Muzaffarnagar.

Reportedly, the 8-year-old boy died after getting crushed in a stampede following police's crackdown at the anti-CAA protesters in Varanasi.

Earlier on Friday, over 15 districts in Uttar Pradesh witnessed violent protests against the contentious law. The protesters hurled stones at police personnel while some even fired shots at them. There were reports that six policemen had received bullet injuries yesterday.

In order to control the violent riots, police had to resort to lathi-charge and the use of water cannons in some parts of the state.

Section 144 has been imposed in several districts in the wake of protests against CAA and National Register of Citizens (NRC). Internet services continue to stay shut in many prominent cities like Ghaziabad, Lucknow, Bareilly, Muzaffarnagar, etc.

The recently-passed citizenship law provides citizenship to members of six non-Muslim communities from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh living in India. The protesters have been calling the amended law discriminatory in nature and anti-Muslim.
