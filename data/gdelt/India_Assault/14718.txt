Kolkata, August 30

The West Bengal Assembly today passed a Bill to check incidents of mob assaults and lynching and criminalised such actions.

The West Bengal (Prevention of Lynching) Bill, 2019, was tabled in the House and supported by the Opposition Congress and CPM.

The BJP, which has emerged as the main Opposition party, neither supported nor opposed the Bill as it felt the legislation might be used for settling political scores.

“Lynching is a social evil and all of us have to come together to fight it. The Supreme Court has given direction to take action against lynching,” Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said. “The Centre should have brought a law against it. But as it is yet to do so we are we are bringing this law in our state to fight against this social evil.”

The legislation also pitches for a jail term, which may vary from three years to life for those involved in assaulting and injuring a person. — PTI
