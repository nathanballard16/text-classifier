Fatehgarh Sahib, June 14

The Punjab Civil Medical Services Association unit of Fatehgarh Sahib, on a call of the PCMSA, observed a strike and strongly condemned the brutal attack on Dr Paribaha Mukherjee of the NRS Medical College and Hospital and subsequent attacks on medicos in Kolkata.

Unit president Dr Satnam Banga said they stand in solidarity with the protesting doctors. Together in arms, president of the District Pharmacist Union Sandeep Singh, Nursing president Harneet Kaur and Class 4 president Jasbir Singh demanded strict law against assault on healthcare workers.

PCMSA state general secretary Dr Gagandeep Shergill said the association had pledged to carry out an extensive study across all hospitals and medical colleges in Punjab to collect the data regarding various aspects of this evil problem - assault on healthcare givers - and will provide the data to the Chief Minister and the Health Minister and demand a solution to a logical conclusion.

He demanded security from the Punjab Police at all district hospitals and sub-divisional hospitals across the state. — OC
