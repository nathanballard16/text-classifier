The Gujarat High Court (HC) on Thursday enlarged two convict aides of self-styled godman convicted of rape, Narayan Sai, on regular bail. Sai and four others were convicted on charges of rape in April this year.

Sai’s two female devotees and aides – Ganga alias Dharmishta Mishra, a resident of Motera ashram in Ahmedabad, and Jamna alias Bhavna Patel, a resident of Gopalpuri street in Jaipur Rajasthan – who were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for being held guilty of conspiracy.

The two had moved the HC last month, appealing for suspension of their sentence, while challenging their conviction by a Surat sessions court. Ganga was arrested in 2013 while Jamna surrendered in 2014.

A Surat sessions court order of April 30 by additional sessions Judge PS Gadhvi, sentenced Narayan Sai to life imprisonment along with convicting four other aides of Narayan. Of the four, three associates – Ganga, Jamna and Hanuman, a resident of Bihar – were sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment. Another aide, Sai’s driver, Ramesh Malhotra, was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.

In October 2013, a rape case was lodged by a former devotee of Sai with the Surat police. In her statement, the woman said that she feared political, financial and muscle power of Sai and his father Asaram Bapu, due to which she could not muster courage to approach police initially.
