Indian police arrest teenager paid by terror group to carry grenade in his lunch box

Indian police arrested a minor over a grenade attack in Kashmir that killed two and left more than 30 people injured, saying the suspect claimed he was paid by a terror group to carry out the bombing.

The 15-year-old suspect carried the grenade in his school lunch box to evade detection at checkpoints and was paid Rs50,000 (£550) by a member of the militant group Hizbul Mujahideen, Indian police said on Friday.

The attack took place on Thursday lunchtime, resulting in the death of a 17-year-old boy and and injuries to 32 others. A second man died from his injuries on Friday morning.

Indian officials said this meant that terror groups were using minors for terror attacks in Kashmir, a tactic used in the past but not in recent years.

Terror groups in the state were known to use teenage boys in the early 2000s for attacks against Indian security forces for cash rewards, but the practice waned after police engaged parents in prevention policies.
