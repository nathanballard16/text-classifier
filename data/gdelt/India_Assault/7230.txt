Man arrested for sexually abusing minor girl

Coimbatore: A 53-year-old man was arrested on Monday for sexually assaulting a class VI girl in his vegetable shop located at Pattanampudur near Sulur last week.

The arrested person was identified as S Nallakannu of Thiruvalluvar street at Pattanampudur. “The 11-year-old victim visited a relative’s house near the shop a few days ago. Nallakannu lured her into the shop and sexually abused her. The girl ran to her home and told her parents about the incident. Meanwhile, Nallakannu went to the house and requested the parents not to lodge a police complaint and sought their apology. Subsequently, the parents decided not to approach police,” a police officer said.

But on Sunday, the girl’s father told a relative about the incident while having drinks. “The relative and his friends ransacked the vegetable shop on Sunday night and beat up Nallakannu,” the officer said.

Police reached the spot after informed by the villagers and picked up Nallakannu.

Inspector Vinothini of all women police station in Perur received a complaint from the victim’s mother and registered a case against Nallakannu under Sections 7 and 8 of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 and arrested him. He was remanded in judicial custody.

Meanwhile, the Sulur police picked up two youths, who ransacked the shop. More than 70 villagers picketed the police station on Monday night, demanding their release.
