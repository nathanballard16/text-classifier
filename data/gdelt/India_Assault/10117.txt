Anantnag, June 17

A Major and a Pakistani militant were killed, while another officer of the same rank and a soldier were injured during a daylong gunfight in Anantnag district today.

In another incident, at least five Army personnel were injured when militants triggered an improvised explosive device fitted in a vehicle near an Army patrol in the militancy-hit Pulwama district of south Kashmir today.

The slain Major, who hailed from Meerut, has been identified as Ketan Sharma of the 19RR. "More information about him will be shared after his family is informed about the incident," an Army officer told The Tribune. He said the injured soldiers, including Major Rahul Verma, were being treated at the Army’s base hospital in Srinagar. “We will be sharing further details about their condition soon,” the officer said. The gunfight took place in Bidoora village of Achabal in Anantnag, around 67 km from Srinagar city.

“An operation was launched around 7 am and the militant started firing around 7.15 am. His initial firing left the Major and another soldier injured, but later in the day Major Ketan Sharma was killed in exchange of fire,” a senior police official said. He said the unidentified militant was killed after several hours of gunfight when the house, where he was hiding, was blown up using explosives.

Meanwhile, an Army patrol vehicle was targeted around 6 pm with a car bomb in Arihal area of Pulwama, leaving at least five soldiers and a civilian injured. “The bomb went off, leaving the army vehicle damaged and some soldiers injured,” a local police official said, adding that a civilian working in a nearby field also sustained injuries.

Defence spokesman Rajesh Kalia called the IED attack a “failed attempt”. “It was a failed attempt and reports of attack on Army convoy are unfounded and baseless. All troops are safe. Just a few suffered minor injuries,” he said.
