Dist cops pulled up over slow pace of rape probe

Bhubaneswar: Police in some districts have failed to adhere to the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2018, that stipulates completion of probe into a rape case within 60 days of its registration.This has been revealed after the Crime Branch (CB) recently issued an advisory to all superintendents of police (SPs), asking them to complete the investigation of all rape cases within 60 days and submit the final documents in court.A few districts have failed to submit the relevant documents within 60 days of the registration of a case, the advisory issued by the additional director-general of police (CB), Santosh Upadhyay, said on May 10.The CB did not reveal the names of the districts that reportedly underperformed in the investigation of rape cases. Police sources said the registration of rape cases had increased to 2,502 in the state in 2018 as against 2,221 in 2017.“We have categorically asked the SPs to personally supervise investigation into rape cases. The investigating officers (IOs) should be sensitised about the amended law. Any pending action shall not be a bar for submission of the final form in court within the deadline,” Upadhyay said.The CB said if an ongoing investigation is likely to take more time, the IOs should submit a preliminary charge-sheet in court. If one fails to submit the preliminary charge-sheet and the final form, then it may facilitate the release of the accused on bail. The CB said those IOs who flout the law will face disciplinary action.The IOs have also been given a 23-point checklist, highlighting procedures of collecting evidence and probing rape cases. The checklist includes the visit of a DSP-rank officer to the crime (rape) scene, seizure of clothes or any other article of the woman and the accused for forensic test, date of medical examination of survivor, age proof of survivor, seizure of bidi/cigarette/liquor bottle (if any) used by the accused from the crime scene, digital evidence and call details of the accused, among others.The CB has further asked the IOs to prevent minor rape survivors from getting into any confrontation with the accused during court trial. In Section 273 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, there is a provision that says there should be no eye-contact between minor rape survivors and the accused in court.“We have asked the SPs to consult public prosecutors and take permission from court to hold such trials through video-conference for the comfort and convenience of the women/girls. Another advisory has been issued to the SPs to produce criminals in court via video-conference to prevent their possible escape from police custody,” a CB officer said.
