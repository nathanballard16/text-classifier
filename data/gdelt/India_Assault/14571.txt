Kandla port on terror radar, security upped

AHMEDABAD/RAJKOT: Hardly did the security agencies let down their guard after the input about four terrorists having entered India on Afghan passports, another fresh intelligence input about a possible terror attack on Kandla port has once again rung alarm bells across the security agencies who have beefed up security along the port and border areas.The fresh alert from intelligence agencies said that Pakistan-based terror outfits might be planning a suicide attack at Kandla.“Persons from all security agencies have reached Kandla port and security arrangements have been tightened. The Coast Guard, Navy, Marine Police and local police have been sensitized about the situation and steps are already in place. Security at all ports on the Gujarat coastline has been beefed up,” said a top Gujarat police official.Nearly 60 SRP jawans have been posted at cover checkpoints armed with light machine guns. “We have also armed them with tyre-killing belts to stop rogue vehicles that may try to break the barricade,” a top police official said.Meanwhile, an armed contingent of over 100 Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) commandos, led by an Assistant Commandant-rank officer, has taken over counter-terror security duties at the country's second-largest single-site oil refinery in Gujarat's coastal district of Jamnagar on Tuesday. The refinery in the Vadinagar area is owned Nayara Energy Ltd (formerly Essar Oil) and the 10th installation in the private sector to get an armed cover."The location of the refinery is strategic considering the high value of investment in the region and proximity to the busiest sea route. In the light of the threat perception, security of the installation is of utmost importance as this vital installation is contributing to national economy," CISF spokesperson and assistant inspector general Hemendra Singh said.CISF commandos will provide round-the-clock security in a quick response team (QRT) pattern as part of which they keep vigil from vantage positions using sophisticated assault weapons and use vehicles for swift movement.The other nine private sector units being guarded by the CISF are: Electronics City in Bengaluru and Infosys campuses in Bengaluru, Mysore and Pune, Reliance Refinery and Petrochemicals in Jamnagar, Coastal Gujarat Power Ltd project executed by the Tata group in Mundra, Tata Steel project based in Odisha's Kalinganagar, Yoga exponent Baba Ramdev's Patanjali Food and Herbal Park Private Limited in Haridwar and the Navi Mumbai-based Reliance Corporate IT Park.
