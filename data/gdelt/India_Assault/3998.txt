New Delhi: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman went through a series of debriefings by security agencies in New Delhi even as his routine medical checkup continued for the second day at a military hospital.

Many senior Indian Air Force (IAF) officials also met Varthaman who was brought to Delhi after Pakistan returned him to India through the Attari-Wagah border late Friday night.

As per the initial reports, the debriefing by the security agencies will continue for the next couple of days. As part of a cooling down process, the IAF pilot also underwent several medical tests. All these procedures are being carried out to ensure that the pilot returns to the cockpit soon, a senior military official said.

Wg Cdr Abhinandan was captured by the Pakistani Armed Forces after his MiG 21 Bison fighter jet was shot down during a dogfight during an aerial action with Pakistani jets. During the aerial skirmish, the pilot managed to shoot down one PAF F-16 fighter. As per media reports, “R-73 selected” was the last radio transmission of the pilot before his jet was brought down.

Vympel R-73 is a short-range soviet-made air-to-air missile which shot down the Pakistani F-16 jet.

After entering India, Varthaman was flown to the national capital by an IAF flight at around 11:45 pm Friday.

Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after 40 CRPF jawans were martyred in a suicide bombing attack in Jammu & Kashmir’s Pulwama. In response to this attack, the IAF launched a pre-emptive strike against JeM terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.
