A FIJIAN studying in Goa, India was assaulted by a group of men on Wednesday night.

Shoheel Rosheel Narayan now fears for his safety and wants to either return home or have his university changed.

The Rakiraki resident is studying for a Bachelor of Science program at the Goa College of Arts, Science and Commerce.

Speaking from Goa, Mr Narayan said he was traumatised.

“There were about eight people who approached my friend and I while we were going home at about 9.30pm,” he said.

“One of them asked us what we were doing here and said we don’t belong here.”

The group then proceeded to assault them.

“My friend was attacked first and he managed to flee and then they came for me and asked me to get on a scooter.”

He was punched on the stomach after he refused.

“That’s when I knew I was in trouble and I ran towards a restaurant but they caught up and were forcing me to get on to their scooter,” said the 18-year-old.

Mr Narayan said the restaurant owner raised the alarm and the assailants left.

He has informed his family about the incident.

“I fear for my safety here and I want to come back or have my university changed.

“We are going to have a meeting with our sponsors The Indian Council for Cultural Relations to sort this out,” said Mr Narayan.

There has been an increase in attacks on foreigners recently, forcing the State’s Chief Minister Pramod Sawant to issue an appeal for people to stop looting and thrashing tourists coming to the State.
