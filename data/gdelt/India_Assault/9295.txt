Amritsar, June 5

A day ahead of the 35th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, the Akal Takht sought an apology from the Centre for carrying out an “Army assault” on the Darbar Sahib, Akal Takht and simultaneous attack on various other gurdwaras.

Seeking to assuage the sentiments of Sikhs, Akal Takht acting Jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said Parliament should accept that the attack conducted on the directions of the ‘Indian’ government was a blunder and should submit an official apology for it.

“The Indian Parliament should bring ‘maafi da matta’ (a resolution of apology) for the execution of “Ghallughara” (Operation Bluestar) in 1984,” he said.

Recently, Delhi BJP MLA and Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee president Manjinder Singh Sirsa had also demanded a similar apology from the Centre.

In August 2005, then PM Manmohan Singh had apologised in Parliament for the 1984 anti-Sikh violence, saying he was not standing on any ‘false prestige’ and bowed his head in shame.

Giani Harpreet Singh has appealed the Sikh organisations and public to maintain peace during the “ardas divas” organised to commemorate the Operation Bluestar anniversary on June 6.

“I appeal that this most sensitive and emotional occasion should be observed to feel the pain through which the Sikh community had to pass. No activity should be carried out by any outfit to vitiate the environment and sanctity of the Golden Temple complex,” he said.

Dhian Singh Mand, the controversial 2015 Sarbat Khalsa-appointed acting Jathedar of the Akal Takht, has announced to deliver a parallel public address from the Akal Takht premises.

Meanwhile, security has been beefed up in the city in view of lakhs of Sikh devotees expected to throng the Akal Takht.
