When Zarina Wahab said 'girls are equally to be blamed' on Aditya Pancholi-Kangana Ranaut's controversial relationship

Zarina Wahab has defended husband Aditya Pancholi time and again, and stood by him like a rock despite trying times with Kangana Ranaut

Zarina Wahab is probably the image of an ideal wife or quite the opposite. She has often supported her husband Aditya Pancholi no matter what. Kangana Ranaut and her sister Rangoli Chandel have currently accused the actor of raping the actress.

For the uninitiated, Kangana Ranaut and Aditya Pancholi were in a live-in relationship more than a decade back. Zarina Wahab, despite knowing it all, has always supported her husband. In fact, she filed a defamation case against Kangana and Rangoli and has openly spoken that whatever her husband did, was no crime.

Zarina Wahab even went on to question Kangana's sincerity towards the case. Rangoli Chandel instead, also accused Wahab of being a silent spectator and wishes to see both Pancholi and Wahab behind bars. The case between Aditya Pancholi and family vs Kangana Ranaut and family goes on.
