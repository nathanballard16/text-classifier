16-year-old gang-raped; one arrested

Rajkot: One of the three accused of a gang rape case was arrested from the new bus stand in Rajkot on Sunday morning.

Police said three accused, Vijay Sapara (25), Sanju alias Jayesh and Gopal, had allegedly raped a 16-year-old girl.

After abducting the survivor from her home, Sanju and Gopal took her to Morbi-Rajkot highway and taken turns to rape her in the car on Wednesday evening.

“The accused duo then dropped the survivor at the new bus stand in Rajkot on Wednesday night. Then came Vijay Sapara, an autorickshaw driver, in his rickshaw on early Thursday morning. Sapara offered her a lift to her home and took her to Sant Kabir Road where he offered her breakfast and tea. Then he took her to Morbi by-pass where he allegedly raped her,” said A L Acharya, inspector with Gandhidham police station.

The survivor along with her mother then approached the police and lodged the complaint, after which the cops swung into action and nabbed Sapara.

“The survivor did not know Sapara. However, she had read Jhanjhmer, the name of a village, with a cellphone number written inside the rickshaw. Though she could not remember the number, she had recalled Jhanjhmer. We took the survivor to the new bus stand and when we inquired about the rickshaw with that particular name written inside, we found that it belongs to Sapara. We also learnt that Sapara drives his rickshaw only during nights. So we waited till Sapara came at night, got his rickshaw identified and nabbed him,” described Acharya.

Meanwhile, the police have launched a manhunt for Sanju and Gopal.
