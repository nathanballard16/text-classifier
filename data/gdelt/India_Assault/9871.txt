Allahabad: An eight-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a teenager when she went to a forest to graze goats in Lalganj block of the neighbouring Pratapgrah on Thursday.

The girl was found by shepherds in an unconscious state and was bleeding profusely. They rushed her to a community health centre (CHC) and informed her family.

An FIR was lodged and police arrested the accused who lived in the same village. Lalganj SHO Harish Tiwari said, “The girl had gone to graze goats in the morning. Finding her alone, a 17-year-old boy of the same village raped her. She was spotted by some shepherds who took her to the CHC, from where she was shifted to the district hospital. However, when her condition deteriorated, the doctors referred her to a government hospital in Allahabad. The condition of the girl is now said to be stable.”

“The accused has been charged under relevant sections of IPC and POCSO Act,” he added.
