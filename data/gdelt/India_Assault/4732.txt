Chennai: Police in the state capital of Tamil Nadu on Monday arrested a 50-year-old man for killing his own son, allegedly after suspecting him of having an affair with his wife. Identified as Sakthivel, the accused lived in a rented house in Senthamil Nagar area of Ramapuram with his 45-year-old wife, son and a daughter.

Shockingly enough, the feud between father and son stemmed from the fact that the accused regularly suspected his wife's fidelity and even stalked her to work, reported Deccan Chronicle. Sathish, aged 22, often got into arguments with his father which eventually led the accused to suspect his own son of having an affair with his wife.

Police officials familiar with the matter said that fuelled by rage, Sakthivel one night took a knife to his son Sathish and stabbed him. The daughter and wife tried to stop him but he inflicted cut injuries on them and fled the spot, added investigators. Sathish was rushed to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him 'dead on arrival'. A complaint was later registered in this regard at the Royala Nagar police station against Sakthivel.

An inquiry revealed that the accused, Sakthivel worked as a painter while his son Sathish worked as a typist. They along with Sakthivel's daughter and wife who worked as a housekeeping staff at a private nursing home had been living at the house in Ramapuram for the past year-and-a-half. An investigation into the matter is still underway and more details are awaited.
