New Delhi: A 22-week pregnancy of a 14-year-old rape survivor has been terminated by All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) after the Delhi High Court sought its opinion on the matter.

Earlier on June 2, the girl’s family had filed a petition in the court seeking permission for the medical termination of the pregnancy.

According to a report in PTI, AIIMS informed the court on Monday about the termination of the pregnancy citing mental and physical trauma the girl would have faced if the pregnancy was allowed to continue.

The premier hospital also informed the court that it has preserved the foetus for DNA analysis in the rape case. The AIIMS lawyer had made the submission on Monday before Justice Najmi Waziri of the Delhi High Court.

The Delhi High Court on June 14 had asked the AIIMS to set up a medical board and expeditiously decide whether it was necessary to terminate the pregnancy of the rape survivor. The court had also asked the AIIMS medical board to place a report before it in this matter.

According to the petition filed on behalf of the rape survivor on June 2, the mother of the victim came to know that the girl was raped and that she was pregnant. The ultrasound report of the girl stated that she was 22 weeks pregnant. It was after this that the family of the victim approached the court seeking termination of the pregnancy.

The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1971 stipulates that a fetus can't be terminated if the gestation period extends 20 weeks.
