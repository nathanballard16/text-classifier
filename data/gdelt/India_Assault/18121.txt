Maha Cong condemns removal of Gandhi family's SPG cover

Senior Maharashtra Congress leaders on Friday condemned the Centre's decision to withdraw Special Protection Group (SPG) cover of UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and senior party leaders Rahul and Priyanka.

The decision to withdraw SPG cover given to the family of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, who was assassinated by LTTE terrorists on May 21, 1991, was taken after a detailed security assessment, officials had said.

Calling it vendetta, former Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan said there was no place for personal hatred in a democracy.

"But the current Prime Minister considers political opponents as personal enemies. The government should have remembered that two members of the Gandhi family have been assassinated in terror attacks. But it is blinded by political vindictiveness and hatred," he said.

"The blessings of people and love and affection of party workers across the country will act as a shield of the Gandhi family," Chavan said.

Congress leader Milind Deora tweeted, "A family that lost two members to brutal assassinations while serving India and is now leading the opposition, deserves SPG protection. I have travelled with Rahul Gandhi and seen SPG professionalism first hand. aside, the state is duty bound to protect endangered persons."



Maharashtra Congress chief Balasaheb Thorat also hit out at the decision.
