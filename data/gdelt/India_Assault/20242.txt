Congress General Secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra also hit out at the BJP government and said, "Victim's whole family has been constantly harassed since last year. I have heard that the culprits have some BJP connection. That is why they were being shielded. There is no fear among criminals in the state."

"Chief Minister is saying there is no place for criminals in the state but what he has turned the state into, I think there is no place for women here," she added.

Meanwhile, on the direction of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, ministers Kamal Rani Varun and Swami Prasad Maurya is also visiting Unnao to meet the family of the rape victim.

Also, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed grief over the death of Unnao rape victim saying that all the accused have been arrested and the case will be taken to a fast-track court.

The Unnao rape survivor passed away at 11:40 pm on Friday after suffering a cardiac arrest, Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital confirmed. She was on Thursday airlifted to the hospital where she was undergoing urgent medical treatment for the burns on her body.

"This is an extremely unfortunate incident, I can't even imagine what the family of the victim is going through. I assure them that we will not spare the culprits, will get them punished at the earliest," Keshav Prasad Maurya, UP Deputy Chief Minister said.

On Thursday, the rape survivor in Unnao, some 60 km from state capital Lucknow, was set ablaze by those accused who are out on bail.

The attack on the rape survivor has created a massive outrage in the country with demands for strict punishment to the culprits. The incident resonated in the Parliament, with Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu assuring the House that he has spoken to UP chief secretary on the matter.

The five men who raped her in March this year are suspected to be behind the incident. All of them have been arrested, the police said. Out of them, two are accused of raping her.
