Six Hindu men convicted over rape and murder of Muslim girl, 8, in case that fanned Kashmir tensions

An Indian court on Monday convicted six men over the rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in Jammu and Kashmir state, a case that fanned communal tensions in the disputed region.

Asifa Bano belonged to a nomadic Muslim community – the Gujjars - that travelled around the forests near to the Hindu-majority city of Kathua.

She was drugged, held captive in a temple and sexually assaulted for a week before being strangled and battered to death with a stone in January 2018.

It is believed the attack took place after groups of Hindu farmers had become angry with wayfaring Muslims who they claimed were settling on their land and using resources.

The 15-page charge sheet said that the murder of Asifa was part of a plan to remove the minority nomadic community from the Kathua area.

The case sparked angry protests in Kashmir and criticism of India's ruling party after some of its members opposed charges being laid.

Two ministers from Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) even attended a rally in support of the accused, who included a Hindu priest and local police officers.

India has long been plagued by shocking levels of violence against women and children. The reported number of rapes rose by 60 per cent to 40,000 annually from 2012 to 2016 according to government statistics.
