Advocate rapes his client, arrested

Rajkot: An advocate was arrested on Friday for allegedly raping his female client who through his services were fighting a case seeking alimony from her husband in Porbandar.

Police said the accused, Bharat Singrakhia (35), had allegedly raped the survivor several times after taking her to different guest houses in Porbandar, Jetpur, Dwarka and Diu. The accused had promised to marry the survivor besides getting her a handsome alimony from her estranged husband.

The survivor had separated from her husband two and a half years ago and had filed an alimony case.

Singrakhia, who is himself married, allegedly developed physical relationship with his client after promising to marry her and getting her alimony. He also allegedly threatened to kill her, if she did not have relationship with him.

“However, after two and a half years, when the survivor did not get any alimony from her husband, nor did Singrakhia fulfil his promise to marry her, the survivor lodged a police complaint against him,” said S N Jadeja, inspector with Kamlabaug police station.

Meanwhile, the police, after arresting Singrakhia, sent the survivor for medical examination. Singrakhia is married.
