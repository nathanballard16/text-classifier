Indian Envoy Briefs US Lawmakers on Kashmir Situation Behind Closed Doors

India’s envoy to the United States Harsh Vardhan Shringla brought US legislators up to speed on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and the steps New Delhi has taken to restore order there. The restive Muslim-majority state was stripped of its decades-old special status in August and divided into two federally-administered districts amid a military lock-down. This enraged Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan, who asserted that India had violated United Nations mandates guaranteeing the region's partial self-rule.

Thank you for providing me with an opportunity to share facts on developments in Jammu & Kashmir with you and other Congressmen @MEAIndia https://t.co/r96r1yldvv — Harsh V Shringla (@harshvshringla) October 17, 2019

Earlier this week, US Democratic Senator Maggie Hassan, after meeting with Pakistani leaders and a visit to the Pakistan-administered part of Kashmir, had called upon both Islamabad and New Delhi to take urgent steps to de-escalate tensions in the Kashmir region.

Many Congressmen, who were not members of the Committee, also attended the briefing; the majority of them were Democrats.
