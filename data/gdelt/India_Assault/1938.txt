Karol Bagh fire: Emergency exit of hotel was locked, says Union Minister Alphons

Though there have been several cases of fire in the national capital but the Karol Bagh hotel tragedy has claimed most lives in recent past. "When I headed to the emergency exit, I found that it had been locked yesterday (last night). Union Tourism Minister KJ Alphons on Tuesday said the emergency exit of the Arpit Palace hotel, a 3-star hotel on Gurudwara Road at Karol Bagh in Central Delhi where 17 people were killed in a fire that broke out early today, was ‘too narrow’ and also locked. Obviously, even if people came to the emergency exit, they could not have escaped as it was too narrow and it was locked anyway," he said. Earlier, seventeen people were killed and several injured in a massive fire that broke out in Delhi’s Karol Bagh area in the early morning hours today.
