FRIDAYS ARE FOR FRANK: “Come Fly With Me” — Continental Army Edition

Let Freedom Ring-A-Ding-Ding!!!

In a rousing speech in our Nation’s capital on the 4th of July, President Donald J. Trump gave a shout out to the Continental Army—”named after the great George Washington“—on their glorious victory in the American Revolution.

“Our Army manned the air, it rammed the ramparts, it took over airports, it did everything it had to do. And at Fort McHenry, under the rockets’ red glare, had nothing but victory. When dawn came, the Star-Spangled Banner waved defiant.” – The President of the United States of America; July 4, 2019

Well, we suppose we could fact check all that… but what’s the point, right?

USA! USA!! USA!!!

Composed by Jimmy Van Heusen with lyrics by Sammy Cahn, “Come Fly with Me” was written for Frank Sinatra and was the title track of his 1958 album of the same name. The peppy song sets the tone for the rest of the album, as Frank plays travel agent by offering getaway adventures in far off locales like Bombay, Peru and Acapulco Bay.

He speaks of “exotic booze”—which was actually a legitimate recruiting pitch for Revolutionary War-era personnel…

God Bless America!
