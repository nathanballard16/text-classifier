New Delhi: The parents of the 23-year-old paramedic student, who was brutally gang-raped on December 16, 2012, in a moving bus in Delhi, on Thursday approached a court in Delhi to expedite the procedure to hang all the convicts in the case.

The plea, which will be heard on March 2, said that it is the need of the hour and law that the death sentence be executed as early as possible and not delayed any further.

"Not only the entire nation is awaiting the execution of the sentence awarded to the convicts, but the entire world is curiously looking at the Indian judicial system," said the plea, filed through lawyer Jitendra Kumar Jha.

On July 9, the SC had dismissed the petitions of three convicts -- Mukesh (31), Vinay Sharma (25) and Pawan Gupta (24) -- seeking review of its 2017 verdict which upheld the capital punishment awarded to them by the Delhi High Court and the trial court.

Akshay Kumar Singh (33), the fourth death row convict, has not filed a review plea in the SC.

Ram Singh, one of the six accused, had hanged himself in the jail. Another accused, the juvenile, was convicted of rape and murder. He was given the maximum sentence of three years' imprisonment in a reform facility.

The girl was thrown out of the vehicle along with her male friend by the convicts. The victim, who succumbed to her injuries on December 29, 2012, at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore, has subsequently come to be known as 'Nirbhaya' (fearless).

The incident had led to huge protests across the country and pushed the government to overhaul the anti-rape laws.
