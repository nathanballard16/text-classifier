Hoshiarpur man booked for rape of ‘live-in partner’

Ludhiana: Ludhiana police have booked a person for the rape of a woman with whom he was allegedly in a live-in relationship, but dumped her after she got pregnant. The accused was identified as a man from Hoshiarpur in his twenties.

The 30-year-old complainant told cops that she met the accused through Facebook in July or August last year, and became friends with him, adding that she started living with the accused after both went deeper into a relationship. She further said that after living with him for more than three months, she got pregnant, but when the accused got to know about her pregnancy, he left her in the lurch and ran away, though she claims he had married her in a temple before she got pregnant.

The woman further told cops that she had a miscarriage, but kept the foetus as proof. The accused, however, claimed it was not he who had made her pregnant, after which she asked him to give a DNA sample to ascertain the truth. But he refused to listen to her, and even stopped receiving her calls after he left her.

After the woman lodged a complaint against the accused with the police commissioner, an enquiry has been marked. Police officials said that after a probe by the ADCP, a case of rape and cheating was registered against the accused at Division 6 police station. But the accused is yet to be arrested.

The complainant also added that she had divorced her husband — from whom she had a seven-year-old son — about eight years ago.
