Amid Escalating Protests Against India's New Citizenship Law, Modi Appeals for Calm

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has appealed for calm as protests escalate against a new citizenship law that critics have slammed as anti-Muslim and part of a "Hindu-first" agenda being pushed by his Bharatiya Janata Party.

College students in cities like Mumbai, Chennai and Bengaluru took to the streets Monday, a day after police forced their way onto the campus of a prestigious university in the capital, New Delhi, and fired tea gas shells, injuring dozens of students.

Opposition party leaders staged protests in several states while tensions ran high in the country's northeast that has been engulfed with angry demonstrations due to worries that the new law will allow tens of thousands of Hindu immigrants to settle in the region.

The new law will fast track Indian citizenship for religious minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs and Christians who faced religious persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan, but exclude Muslims.

The government denies any religious bias, saying that Muslims have been left out because they are not minorities in these Islamic countries. Opponents of the new law, the Citizenship Amendment Act, fear it will weaken the secular foundations of the world's largest democracy by introducing religion as a factor for citizenship.

Calling the violent protests against the citizenship act deeply distressing, Modi called on the country to maintain peace, unity and brotherhood. "I want to unequivocally assure my fellow Indians that CAA does not affect any citizen of India of any religion. No Indian has anything to worry regarding this Act. This Act is only for those who have faced years of persecution outside and have no other place to go except India," he tweeted.

The prime minister blamed opposition parties for inciting violence against the new measure while Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad criticized the Congress Party for stoking "communal fires."
