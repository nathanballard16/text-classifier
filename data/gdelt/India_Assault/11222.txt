Intrigue, secrecy and an angry poetic outburst surround reports of runaway Gulf princess

London: The plotline reads like an international high-society drama: A glamorous princess, fleeing her marriage to an aging Gulf potentate, is said to seek shelter in the poshest precincts of London.

From the husband scorned comes an online outburst of floridly furious poetry.

In the background are two intermingled Mid-east monarchies, a looming court battle and a dark tale of the abduction and abuse of at least one other female royal.

The princess in question is Haya bint al Hussein, 45, half-sister to the king of Jordan, an Oxford-educated equestrienne with Olympic credentials who is a glossy fixture on the circuit of iconic British society events such as the Royal Ascot.
