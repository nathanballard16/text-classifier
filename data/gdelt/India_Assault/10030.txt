WB doctors' strike: Mamata to meet 2 representatives from each medical college

As doctors' strike enteres the seventh day in West Bengal, Chief Minister will meet two representatives from each medical college of the state in Nabanna later on Monday.

Banerjee on Saturday had extended an olive branch to the agitating doctors by promising not to invoke the stringent Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) and appealed to them to resume work immediately.

She also said that the state government would bear all medical expenses for the treatment of the two junior doctors, who were assaulted in a Kolkata hospital that triggered the strike.

Meanwhile, while attacking the TMC supremo, BJP leader and Union Minister Babul Supriyo said, "Doctors are unwilling to speak to They think that they made be threatened by her inside a closed room. This shows a lack of trust the people have on "

Both the junior and senior doctors are on strike from the past five days after two of their colleagues were attacked and seriously injured over an issue of alleged negligence at the NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata on June 10.

Several doctors across the country have been protesting against the violence.

The Centre has sought a report from the state government on measures taken to resolve the ongoing strike by doctors.
