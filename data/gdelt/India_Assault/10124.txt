Mumbai: A sexual assault and rape case was filed against Binoy Vinodini Balakrishnan who is CPM state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s eldest son.

A Bihari woman has filed a complaint of rape and false promise of marriage at the Andheri Oshiwara police station.

The 33-year-old complainant belongs to Bihar and the assault took place when she was working at a dance bar in Dubai. Binoy used to frequent the dance bar and the relationship bloomed from there. According to the complaint, Binoy had told the woman to quit her job and promised to marry her.

Their relationship led to the woman becoming pregnant in 2008. Binoy also had promised to the woman’s parents that he would marry her. In 2010, a flat was rented in Andheri and they were staying there. Binoy used to visit the flat regularly. Money was given every month. But in 2015, efforts to abandon her began. In 2018, the woman came to know about Binoy’s earlier marriage and when confronted with this, the relationship ruptured and death threats followed.

An FIR under Section 376, 376 (2), 420, 504, 506 for sexual assault, cheating, intimidation were registered against Binoy based on the complaint. Police opine that further probe is necessary as the incident took place years back.
