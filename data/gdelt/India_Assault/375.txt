Loan sharks abduct elderly man

Vadodara: A senior citizen living at Ajwa Road was allegedly kidnapped on January 5 by four moneylenders who had lent money to the victim’s son for business.

Accused Bajrang Gupta, Ramdevji Swami, Pankaj Swami and Kiran Swami abducted 66-year-old victim Arvind Joshi after they took the latter to Bapod police station on January 5 to file a case against him. A police officer on duty allowed Joshi to go saying that the case can be resolved through court and it is not fit to be a criminal case.

As Joshi left the police station, the accused abducted him in their car and took him to Ramdevji’s house on Waghodiya Road. They asked Joshi to call his son Banwari from Surat to return Rs 7.5 lakh which he had borrowed for his business. Joshi told police that Banwari ran into losses due to which he shut his business and moved to Surat.

On the next day, they asked Joshi to call his wife to make the couple sign on a blank stamp paper. When Joshi’s wife reached there, they allowed them to leave after making them sign on the stamp paper.

Joshi then approached Bapod police on Monday to register a complaint of kidnapping and confinement against the four accused.
