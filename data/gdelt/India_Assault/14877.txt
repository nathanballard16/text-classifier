The victim, hailing from Unnao, had alleged that Uttar Pradesh MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar had raped her in 2017 when she was still a minor. Sengar was expelled from the BJP only last month.

Her uncle has alleged the hand of people close to Sengar in the collision.

The statement of her lawyer is yet to be recorded as he is still in the intensive care unit in a critical condition, officials said.

The lawyer was in the car with the victim when a speeding truck approaching in the wrong direction rammed into it at Gurubakshganj in Rae Bareli, about 60 km from the state capital Lucknow, resulting in the death of her two aunts, they said.
