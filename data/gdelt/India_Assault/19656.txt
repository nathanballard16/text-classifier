BJP MP Sushil Kumar Singh has givena Zero Hour Notice in Lok Sabha over the 'demand to include Magahi language in eighth schedule of Constitution'. Congress Chief Whip in Lok Sabha Kodikunnil Suresh has given an Adjournment Motion Notice on 'tariff hike by telecom companies'.

Former finance minister and Congress leader P Chidambaram reached the Parliament complex to attend the Rajya Sabha proceedings, a day after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the INX Media case. He is also slated to address a press conference at 12.30 pm.

The Indian Union Muslim League (IUML) has given an Adjournment Motion Notice in the Lok Sabha over the Citizenship Amendment Bill, which received a Cabinet nod on Wednesday and is likely to be tabled in the Parliament on 9 December, according to sources. Congress and IUML have given an Adjournment Motion Notice in the Lower House over 'incident of killing of ITBP personnel'.

Ahead of the Parliament proceedings, Congress leaders, including P Chidambaram, protested against the rising onion prices all over the country. Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Gaurav Gogoi and other leaders held banners and a basket full of onions and shouted slogans demanding that the government reduce the prices and "stop harassing" the poor. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the government had taken several steps to check the rising prices of onions and initiated steps to improve technology for better storage.

The House was adjourned amid protests by Opposition MPs over the incident reported today in which a 20-year-old rape survivor was set afire by a group of men in Uttar Pradesh's Unnao. The woman has been hospitalised and is in a critical condition. The Upper House was adjourned till 12 pm shortly after the names of 18 out of 80 MPs with 100 percent attendance were read out by House Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu as a token of appreciation.

Senior Congress leader hit out at Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman over her comment during a debate on rising onion prices in which she said that she does not belong to an "onion-eating family". "What does the finance minister mean when she says she does not eat onions? Does she eat avocados?" Chidambaram asked .

Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raises concern of killing of five ITBP personnel in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar by another soldier at the paramilitary force’s camp on Wednesday. He demanded that the government takes serious note of the incident and takes steps to ensure the safety of India's jawans.

Addressing the media for the first time after being released from Tihar Jail in the INX Media case, former finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said, "As I stepped out and breathed the air of freedom at 8 pm last night, my first thought and prayers were for the 75 lakh people of the Kashmir Valley who have been denied their basic freedoms since 4 August, 2019." Expressing particular concern for leaders detained without charges in Jammua nd Kashmir, Chidambaram said, "Freedom is indivisible. If we must preserve our freedom, we must fight for their freedom."

Congress leader P Chidambaram said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been unusually silent on the economy. "He has left it to his ministers to indulge in bluff and bluster. The net result, as the Economist put it, is that the government has turned out to be an incompetent manager of the economy," he said. In a press conference, he said that his record as a minister and his conscience is absolutely clear. "Officers who have worked with me, business persons who have interacted with me and journalists who have observed me know that very well," he said.

Former finance minister p Chidambaram pointed out in the press conference that even after seven months into the fiscal year, the BJP government believes that the problems faced by the economy are cyclical. "The government is wrong. It is wrong because it is clueless. It is unable to look for the obvious clues because it defends its catastrophic mistakes like demonetisation, flawed GST, tax terrorism, regulatory overkill, protectionism, and centralized control of decision-making in the PMO," he said. "8, 7, 6.6, 5.8, 5 and 4.5 are the quarterly growth rates of GDP in the last six quarters. The third and fourth quarters of 2019-20 are not likely to be any better. We will be lucky to end the year if growth touches 5 per cent," he added.

Rural consumption is down according to NSSO, rural wages and producer prices for farmers are down, former finance minister P Chidambaram said in the press conference. "Daily wage earners get work for no more than 15 days a month. FMCG — both durable and non-durable — are selling less. Wholesale prices are up. CPI is going up. Onions sell at Rs 100 a kg. What do these point to? There is less demand among the people because they have less money and less appetite to consume due to uncertainty and fear," he said. Chidambaram pointed out that the UPA government had lifted 140 million people out of poverty between 2004 and 2014, while the NDA government has, since 2016, pushed millions of people below the poverty line. "The economy can be brought out of the slowdown, but this government is incapable of doing that. I believe that the Congress and some other parties are better equipped to pull the economy out of the slowdown, but we have to wait for better times," he concluded.

Congress leader P Chidambaram, who addressed a press conference on Thursday, got emotional while answering a question on rapes and lynchings. Chidambaram's statement comes in the context of the gruesome rape and murder of a vet in Telangana's Hyderabad last week, which has sent shockwaves across the nation.

Javadekar referred to one of the apex court's conditions for the ex-finance minister's bail, which was to not make public statements on the case. He said, "P Chidambaram ji has violated his bail conditions on the very first day. The court had asked him to not give any public statement on the case as a condition for bail but Chidambaram ji today said that his record as a minster was very clear."

Union Minister Prakash Javadekar responded to Congress P Chidambaram's press conference on Thursday, a day after he was granted bail by the Supreme Court in the INX Media corruption case filed against him.

"There is lack of policy and lack of timely execution. There is no declaration of any special package.

The BJP government is a failure and their idea of Indian farmers are seen as perishable communities," he was quoted as saying by The Hindu.

"The onion crisis has left the people in distress. Are the farmers getting any benefit from the issue? Black markets are on the rise. Farmers are being killed. BJP government ignored the farmers and raised MSP.

He said, "This entire House condemns the incident. I got in touch with the Chief Secretary of Uttar Pradesh, he has explained to me that the culprits have been arrested. What is needed, is not a mere arrest in one case. We must send out a signal to the entire country and society that in such incidents action should be taken promptly, swiftly, and adequately, so these things are not repeated again."

We are living in an era of QSQT, not qayamat se qayamat tak; It is quarter se quarter tak. I am not a believer in QSQT. Because economies grow in long term. But when you have 6 consecutive quarters of GDP decline, it is cause of worry. The assumption of the bill is fundamentally flawed."
