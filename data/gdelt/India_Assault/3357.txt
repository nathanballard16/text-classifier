The Hindustan Times reported that the accused, Karamveer Dumra, used to live with his sister and mother in a slum pocket. Dumra and his sister, Parbi Chavria used to pick up fights on the ownership of their mother's house.

Though Dumra and Chavria were married, they did not live with their partners. Dumra allegedly threatened his mother and sister last week. He also stated that he will teach the duo a lesson if he doesn't get the ownership of the house. The accused even asked his sister to return to her husband's house.

On Saturday morning, Dumra stabbed his sister six times with a knife. After the incident, people from nearby areas informed the police about the incident. The sister was taken to a hospital and is said to be stable now. The police arrested Dumra under Section 307 of the Indian Penal Code.
