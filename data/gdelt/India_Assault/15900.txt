HC judge's daughter-in-law alleges pressure to withdraw plaint in assault case

The video of the attack had gone viral

Even as the video clip allegedly showing retired Madras High Court judge Justice Nooty Rammohan Rao and his family members assaulting their daughter-in-law Sindhu Sharma went viral, the victim made fresh charges that an attempt was made to delete the video footage.

Speaking to a TV news channel, the victim claimed that she also had the video clips showing the retired judge along with other family members trying to delete the video clip from the digital video recorder connected to the cameras in their house. She said she had those video clippings and would release them if required.

Meanwhile, her father charged that the retired judge had mounted pressure on him and his daughter to withdraw the criminal complaint lodged with the Hyderabad Central Crime Station.

“The former judge even offered a huge sum to drop the charges and restrain my daughter from making any adverse statement in court,” he charged.

According to him, some middlemen and politicians too tried to intervene in the matter and persuade him to accept the deal offered by the former judge.

After all their attempts failed, the former judge’s son Vasista moved the Nampally family court here for divorce. The court has directed the victim’s counsel to file a counter and posted the next hearing for Tuesday next, Mr. Sharma said.

The video clip tweeted by Ms. Sharma was actually recorded on April 20 on the surveillance cameras installed in the former judge’s house.

While there has been little progress in the investigation pertaining to the assault, the court notice for divorce has apparently disturbed the victim more. “Actually my daughter had hopes of reunion and reconciliation,” Mr. M.V Sharma said.
