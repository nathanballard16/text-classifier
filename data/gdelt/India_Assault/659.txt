In UP’s Gonda, mother of 2 commits suicide after her rapists get clean chit in police probe

The Uttar Pradesh police suspended two personnel after a 35-year-old rape victim allegedly committed suicide at her residence in Kernalganj area of Gonda district on Monday, reportedly after the two accused were given clean chit by the police.

According to a Hindustan Times report, the woman hanged herself from the ceiling of her home, two weeks after the police gave clean chit to two men she had accused of raping her.

A distraught husband claimed that she did not get justice as police failed to conduct a thorough investigation in the matter.

The couple has two children.

Superintendent of Gonda police RP Singh said two police personnel have been suspended while further probe into the matter has been ordered.

"We have received the information about her suicide. Both the investigating officers have been suspended. We are investigating the matter in detail and will ensure that the accused are punished," he said.

According to the HT report, the victim and her husband had attempted self-immolation outside Vidhan Bhawan in Lucknow in September last year to highlight her plight. They had accused the police of laxity in the investigation.

The woman had accused Shankar Dayal and his brother Ashok Kumar of raping her several times in August last year. The husband said that the accused not just raped her but also made a video clip of the act.

"She was very upset when police gave the accused a clean chit, and so committed suicide,” he said.

After her complaint, the police had registered an FIR in August under section 376D (gang rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC along with relevant sections of IT Act against the accused.

First, the local police and then the district crime branch investigated the matter and gave a clean chit to both accused in December.
