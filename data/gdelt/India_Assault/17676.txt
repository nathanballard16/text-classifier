A 15-year-old boy was apprehended for allegedly raping a 21-year old woman on the “pretext of marriage” on Wednesday.

The alleged victim recorded her statement under Section 164 of the CrPC at the local police station, after which the minor was sent to a juvenile home.

In her complaint, the woman alleged that the accused minor kept her at a hotel in Mumbai, where he physically exploited her.

Police said that a medical examination of the woman had confirmed rape. However, the kin of the juvenile claimed that the two had eloped and were brought back from Mumbai by both the families.

Sources said the woman and the juvenile were known to each other and had eloped one and a half months back.

A case was registered in the matter on the complaint of the victim’s mother.

A police officer said, “We acted on the complaint of the woman. A report was filed and we informed the kin of the accused minor to shed light about the sequence of events in the Sector 43 District Court and before the Juvenile Justice Board. As the suspect is a minor, the case will put up before the Juvenile Justice Board.”
