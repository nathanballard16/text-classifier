Malaika Arora has an apt reply for trolls and their negative opinions says, ‘Spare me your crap’

By now, all the Bollywood lovers knows that Arjun Kapoor and Malaika Arora are dating each other and if reports are to believed, the lovebirds are all set to tie the knot sometime in April. That said, a few days back, Malaika Arora had jetted off to Maldives for a girls vacation and grapevine was abuzz that this is Malaika’s bachelorette trip before she walks down the aisle with rumored beau Arjun Kapoor. As soon as Malaika reached Maldives, she set the internet on fire with her hot pictures- from one monokini photo to another swimsuit picture, Malaika Arora’s social media was literally on fire.

And today, Malaika posted her picture, dressed in a gorgeous floral bikini, but it is her caption that had all our attention as she slammed all the trolls for spreading negative comments and this Chaiyya Chaiyya girl said that she is 43 and happy and has no time for people and their crap. Malaika wrote, “Being happy is a choice .n I choose to be happy ..... also I think happiness looks good on me ...... so keep ur opinions n ur negativity to urself n spare me ur crap #notinterested#toobusybeinghappy#notimefornegativity #tuesdaythoughts#43nhappy.” Well, we totally agree with you girl!

While everyone believed that Malaika is off to Maldives for her bachelorette trip but when Malaika returned to Mumbai, rumored boyfriend Arjun Kapoor was spotted with Malaika at the airport. While we were only conjecturing if Arjun had crashed Malaika’s girls trip, Arjun sealed the stamp as he posted a solo picture from Maldives and thus, providing enough fodder to the grapevine that he had indeed accompanied Malaika to Maldives. According to latest reports, Arjun and Malaika are planning to take their relationship to the next level and get married on April 19, 2019.
