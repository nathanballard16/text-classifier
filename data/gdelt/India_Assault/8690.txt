Robbers strike at Urban Estate house, hold 11-mth-old hostage

Ludhiana: Two masked goons robbed a house after holding an 11-month-old infant hostage at knife-point in Urban Estate, Jamalpur, on Wednesday evening.

Tanvi Kalra, 27, was alone at home with the child when the miscreants struck.

“My husband, Deepak Kalra, a hosiery businessman, was at work. My domestic help left around 5pm. An hour later, two miscreants barged into our house after scaling the boundary wall,” Tanvi said in her police complaint.

She was in the lobby with the baby when the two brandished a knife and asked for cash and jewellery. “When I said I had nothing, one of the goons threatened to stab my son. In the meantime, his aide went inside my bedroom and stole all the cash and jewellery kept in the almirah. The duo then escaped,” she added.

ACP Industrial Area-A Harjinder Singh said, “We are scrutinising the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area, as those in the society were not functioning. It seems to be the handiwork of an insider as the goons directly went to the room where jewellery was kept.”

The house is 200 metres from a police checkpost in Urban Estate.
