Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has defended his country from blame for the terrorist attack that claimed the lives of dozens of Indian paramilitary personnel last week.

In a televised address, Khan asked how Pakistan would benefit from such an attack, and sought to undermine claims of Islamabad's involvement by pointing out that the attack coincided with the visit of Saudi Arabia's crown prince, and by saying terrorism had claimed tens of thousands of lives in Pakistan.

On February 14, a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Kashmir's Pulwama district, killing 40 jawans and leaving India enraged.

The attack was masterminded by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

In his address, Imran Khan accused India of blaming Pakistan without proof, and promised action if New Delhi provided actionable evidence against Islamabad. He threatened retaliation in the event of an attack by India, and said his country was ready to hold talks on terrorism.

Earlier, at a press conference held in Srinagar, the Indian Army briefed reporters on Monday's encounter in Pulwama, in which the mastermind of last week's attack was killed.

Three terrorists were killed in total, and 15 Corps Commander Lt Gen Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon said the JeM's leadership in Kashmir had been eliminiated in less than 100 hours.

The Army also warned parents of young Kashmiri terrorists that anyone who picked up a gun in the Valley would be killed, and asked them to request their children to surrender.

IN A NUTSHELL: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan accused New Delhi of blaming his country for the Pulwama terror attack without proof, and threatened to retaliate in the event of an attack by India.
