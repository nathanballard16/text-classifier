Two minor girls, who are cousins, from Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur told the police that they were tortured by family members for their association with boys who went to the same school as them.

The Times of India reported that the girls told the police they were burnt with hot tongs and fed excreta. They narrated the horror story after they were brought back from Nepal, where they had fled to escape their family.

Reports say the girls were presented to the Child Welfare Committee after they were brought back from Nepal.

The Gorakhpor police, according to a report in Hindustan Times, had sent their family to Nepal to bring them back. However, when a Nepal NGO called Gorakhpur’s Manav Seva Sansthan, the girls were saved from being returned to their family.

“The victims told us that they were burnt with tongs and force-fed human excreta, for which investigation is underway. One SI with a team of the NGO brought them back to Gorakhpur from Nepal,” Pipiganj’s station house officer Dinesh Mishra told Hindustan Times.

The girls have now been put in a shelter home on direction of the Child Welfare Committee.
