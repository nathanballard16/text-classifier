Two arrested for abducting 10-year-old boy

Surat: Police arrested two youths for abducting a 10-year-old boy from Bhatar area of the city on Thursday. The accused were nabbed by Maharashtra police when they were taking the child to sell him. The accused were nabbed from Bodwad of Maharashtra around 380km from here. Kiran Patil, 20, and Ajay Gawai, 18, were arrested for allegedly abducting Yash, son of contractor Vilas Kharate, a resident of Vesu. The accused, who took the boy to Bodwad on a motorcycle, were arrested thanks to the alertness shown by the child.

Yash was taken by his father to market to buy him new clothes after which the latter asked him to go to his mother’s incense stick kiosk at Bhatar. However, the boy didn’t reach his mother’s kiosk and went missing. The boy’s parents lodged a complaint at Khatodara police station when they didn’t find him.

Yash had met Kiran and Ajay while going to his mother’s kiosk. “The accused offered to take him on a joyride. The accused took the motorcycle on Surat Dhuliya highway. The duo told the boy that they will return soon,” said a police officer at Khatodara police station.

When they reached near Bodwad, Yash found an opportunity to seek help of a person, who turned out to be social worker and local police. Maharashtra police contacted the boy’s parents and city police.

Both the accused were brought to the city and produced in a local court on Sunday. The court sent them to judicial custody. The duo admitted to police that they had planned to sell the child to make some quick money.
