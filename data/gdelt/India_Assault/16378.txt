Lucknow: The bail applications of BJP leader Chinmayanand and the law student who had accused him of sexual harassment have been dismissed by an Uttar Pradesh court on Monday.

Chinmayanand's advocate Om Singh said that they would move to the Allahabad High Court against the district court’s order.

"District judge Rambabu Sharma heard the bail application of Swami Chinmayanand, and also the bail plea of the girl in an extortion case. The court dismissed both the bail applications," government counsel Anuj Kumar Singh told PTI.

The former Union minister, who was arrested on September 20 after a case was registered against him under section 376C, a charge short of rape, on the basis of the complaint filed by the 23-year-old woman who studies at a college run by his ashram.

Chinmayanand is currently admitted in a Lucknow hospital. He was shifted to Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute (SGPGI) last week after he complained of chest pain.

The law student was arrested last week for allegedly trying to extort Rs 5 crore from the BJP leader. The woman was booked on the charges of extortion, following a complaint by Chinmayanand's lawyer that she and three others were demanding money from the leader.

A case under Indian Penal Code Sections 35 (criminal act done with a criminal knowledge or intention), 385 (extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation), 201(disappearance of evidences) and Section 67 of the Information Technology Act was registered against the woman, her friend, Sanjay Singh, and two cousins, Sachin Sengar and Vikram, who were allegedly involved in the extortion calls made to Chinmayanand.

Following their arrest, Chinmayanand and the woman were sent to judicial custody for 14 days.
