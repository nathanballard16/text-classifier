Kashmir suicide bomber radicalized after beating by Indian troops

It would be fun to see how some lame Indians here would defend this Reuters news and how would they tell that it was actually ISI who sent operatives in IA uniforms to beat those boys returning from school.

But I hope some sane real secular Indians would be able to see that its an outcome of heinous crimes committed by Indian Army that has brought Kashmir to such a bloody mess and the way IA has stepped up its offensive same way Kashmiris have stepped up their resistance.



Even a superpower like US couldn't withstand Vietnam guerrilla warfare India stands no chance if Kashmiris decide to go all out against oppressors.
