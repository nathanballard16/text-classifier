EC acting as handmaid of Governments, says CPI (M) leader

Balakrishnan accuses Palaniswami of playing ‘Kongu CM’ card

The Election Commission was acting as the handmaid of the Governments at the Centre and State, alleged CPI (M) leader K. Balakrishnan here on Sunday.

Alleging that in a recent video clip PMK youth wing leader Anbumani Ramadoss had incited cadres to handle polling booths because “they will be the only people present in them”, Mr. Balakrishnan asked, “Why hasn’t Anbumani been arrested, or even an FIR filed against him? The Election Commission received a complaint and is sitting on it.”

At an interaction with journalists, Mr. Balakrishnan wondered how cash seized was traced only to the opposition, but no cash has been seized from the ruling parties or traced to them. “No raids were carried out on BJP leaders, who have already hoarded cash,” Mr. Balakrishnan alleged.

The CPI (M) leader also accused Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami of playing the “Kongu CM” card, and asked what has the latter done for the Kongu region? Almost all of the projects of the Modi government dispossessed farmers of the Kongu region – be it the eight lane Salem-Chennai expressway project, Power grid project that ran through the Kongu farmlands, or the GAIL pipeline that has the court’s nod. “The latest is his protection to the criminals, who assaulted Kongu women in Pollachi. Yet, he’s seeking votes in the name of Kongu region,” he alleged.

With the Madras High Court set to pass orders on the slew of petitions challenging the much contested Salem-Chennai expressway on Monday, Mr. Balakrishnan said, irrespective of the ruling, the mobilisation of farmers will continue on various forums. According to him, the ruling will expose the contradictions in the PMK-BJP-AIADMK alliance.
