New Delhi: Former Union minister and BJP leader Chinmayanand, who has been accused of rape by a 23-year-old Uttar Pradesh law student, has been summoned and would be questioned, NDTV quoted police officer on Thursday.

The police official said that the BJP leader was summoned three days ago but couldn’t appear due to health reasons. “We hope to interrogate him in the next few days," added the officer.

The woman has alleged that she was filmed, blackmailed and raped repeatedly by Chinmayanand, who has not been questioned by the police so far. No complaint has been registered against the politician either.

"Media reports said we interrogated the girl for nearly 11 hours. That's not true. We spoke to her father for about five hours and then the girl (accompanied by her father) for another four-five hours. We are treating her as a survivor and we did not interrogate her, but tried to help her to plug any loopholes in her statement," the police officer said.

In a statement to the Delhi Police and magistrate, the 23-year-old woman has described what she alleged was a year of sexual assault by the leader, who runs several ashrams and educational institutions.
