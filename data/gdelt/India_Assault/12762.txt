BJP To Hold Compulsory Workshop Over The Weekend For Party Lawmakers; Aims To Enhance MPs Behaviour, Public Conduct

As Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been particular about stressing the need of discipline, punctuality and to avoid foul mouthing among the lawmakers, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has initiated a weekend workshop in this regard, reports NDTV.

The two-day orientation programme for the young and newly elected BJP MPs will be held on 3 August and 4 August . The move is aimed at enhancing parliamentary behaviour and public conduct among them.

The workshop named, “Abhyas Varga,” is already in effect in many states including Himachal Pradesh to impart basic ethos among the representatives. According to a senior BJP leader, all MPs have to attend the workshop.

It can be recalled that Bhopal MP, Pragya Thakur was summoned by the BJP working president JP Nadda over the former’s remarks that she was not elected to clean drains and toilets.

Madhya Pradesh’s BJP MLA Akash Vijayvargiya was caught on cameras while assaulting the on-duty government officials with a bat. The PM was reportedly furious on Akash’s deeds and his father jumping to defend his son’s act.

Such embarrassing incidents have compounded the ruling dispensation frustration over many of its stakeholders skipping the parliament sessions. This list includes the actor-turned-netas like Hema Malini and Sunny Deol.

During his first tenure, PM Modi used to address meetings of the BJP parliamentarians on various occasions about the ethics and etiquette. Modi has raised the bars after being sworn-in for the second time.
