Kolkata, July 27

A Jadavpur University professor was allegedly assaulted by a former student near the university main gate here, officials said on Saturday.

Professor Abdul Kafi of the Bengali department was having tea on Friday afternoon when a former student, identified as Rajesh Santra, hit him repeatedly, the officials said.

As Kafi fell to the ground, he was rescued by students and by-standers and Santra was detained by university employees and taken to the main administrative building Aurobindo Bhavan, they said.

Santra, who had passed in 2015, later told the university authorities that Kafi had allegedly “discriminated” against him when he was a student of the department, sources said.

Jadavpur University Teachers’ Association general secretary Partha Pratim Roy said on Saturday, “We want strict action against Santra who had been stalking Prof Kafi for long and finally carried on such an audacious attack.”

Vice Chancellor Prof Suranjan Das said, “The university informed the police and will always take a stern view of such incidents.”

Santra, a resident of Arambagh in Hooghly district, was arrested, an officer of Jadavpur police station said. PTI
