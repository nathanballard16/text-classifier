Chennai: Police officials probing the brutal murder of a 45-year-old autorickshaw driver in the state capital of Tamil Nadu have reasons to believe that he may have been killed as an act of vengeance for allegedly reporting a case of child marriage in his locality of Ayanavaram. The victim, Jebaseelan was hacked to death by a gang of rowdies on Sunday evening, minutes away from his house in Thikkakulam area.

Going by reports, Jabaseelan was heading to the wedding reception of his own daughter when he was intercepted by a gang of assailants who hacked him to death in front of his entire family. Eyewitness accounts assert that the assailants even physically assaulted the victim's wife when she tried to rescue him. Prescilla, aged 42, is currently undergoing treatment at a local hospital.

An official probing the matter told The New Indian Express that the victim, Jabaseelan, stopped a child marriage in his locality in Ayanavaram. On April 17, he saw posters announcing the wedding of a 16-year-old girl and informed the local police about it. Acting on his complaint, police officials reached the venue and managed to stop the wedding along with Jebaseelan. They then warned the girl's family to only get her married after she completes 18 years of age.

A police investigation into the murder has led polcie to arrest one Magesh, a member of the gang which hacked Jebaseelan to death. As per the latest reports, investigators are on the lookout for 21-year-old Vinodh who allegedly executed the autorickshaw driver's murder. They also have reason to believe that Vinodh had initially planned to murder Jebaseelan on the day of the latter's daughter's wedding but then decided to commit the murder on the day of the reception. More details are awaited in this regard pending an extensive police investigation.
