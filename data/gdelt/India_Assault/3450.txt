Mumbai: In a mind-numbing instance which has come to light from the city of Mumbai, a 21-year-old newlywed couple was allegedly held captive by two men. In their complaint to the police, the couple claimed that they were held captive for two weeks during which their captors thrashed the husband and raped the wife multiple times.

One of the two accused reportedly went to the newlywed couple's Nalasopara residence on February 6, posing as a cop. He then told the wife that her husband was under arrest and she must accompany him to the Tuling police station to secure his bail. The man then took her to a location in Malad in an autorickshaw where her husband was being held captive by another man, reported Times of India.

The two accused then held the couple captive at an undisclosed location in Malad where they allegedly tortured the husband and raped the wife. They were then taken to another location in Mira Road where the wife was raped again before the captors decided to let the couple go on February 18 following which an official police complaint was registered in this regard.

A similar incident had come to light from Ambala in Haryana in September of last year where a newlywed couple was kidnapped by the husband's former wife and her kin. The captors were accused of raping the woman before she, along with the husband, was rescued from Bahadurgarh.
