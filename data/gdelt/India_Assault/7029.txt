A Surat sessions court on Friday convicted Narayan Sai, son of jailed self-styled godman Asaram, in a rape case.

The quantum of punishment will be pronounced by the court on April 30.

Two Surat-based sisters had approached police in 2013 alleging that they were raped by Asaram and Narayan Sai.

One of the victims accused Sai of raping her multiple times between 2002 and 2005 while she was staying at his ashram.

Sai, 47, was arrested in December 2013 from Pipli in Haryana.

Asaram is serving a life sentence after being convicted in a rape case in Jodhpur.
