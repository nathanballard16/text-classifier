Five Police Officers Killed in Militia Attack in Kashmir

"Three paramilitary police, one local police officer and one passer-by were injured. Meanwhile, a militia was killed when police returned fire," a senior local police official said on Thursday (06/13/2019).

The attack that took place in Anantnag City was claimed by Al Umar Mujahideen, a hardline militia group based in Kashmir. It was the deadliest attack in Indian Kashmir since February, when a suicide bomber crashed his car, which was set up by an explosive device on a bus. In the incident 40 paramilitary police were killed.

The bombing increased tensions between nuclear-armed neighbors India and Pakistan, which part of its border crossed the majority of the disputed Muslim region.

Kashmir is fully recognized by Pakistan and Indian forces have been struggling to quell rebellions at the site for decades.
