The incident took place in Wadgaonsheri on Tuesday where Salvi’s in-laws reside. The victim has been identified as Sandeep Rasal, a resident of Wadgaonsheri.

Salvi was assigned the task of taking prisoners to the court at Chandannagar police station. It was on Tuesday that he jumped over the boundary wall of his father-in-law’s residence, identified as Balkrishna Vibhute, onto his neighbour’s premises. The neighbour, Rasal, and some women family members noticed Salvi loitering on their premises under suspicious circumstances.
