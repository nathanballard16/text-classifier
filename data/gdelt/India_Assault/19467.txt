PATIALA: Six months after he raped a four-year-old girl at a private school in Dhuri, a 27-year-old bus helper was sentenced to life imprisonment without remission. Sangrur sessions judge B S Sandhu on Monday ordered the convict to spend the rest of his life in prison, while acquitting three members of the school management.

The incident had outraged people across Punjab and several protests were held in Dhuri for justice. The FIR was registered on May 26, 2019, for rape and under the Pocso and Juvenile Justice acts against the main accused. He was arrested the same day. Under pressure from public, police also booked two members of the school management and woman in charge of the school for allegedly failing to provide information to authorities.

The judge passed the conviction on Friday. The helper-cum-conductor of the private school’s bus raped the child while the parent-teacher meeting was going on in the school on May 25. He took the child away on the pretext of playing with her, but raped her to keep her engaged. He, however, took her to a toilet in the school and raped her.

The matter came to light the next day morning when the girl complained of pain in her abdomen. Her parents gave her some medication for temporary relief, but she again complained of pain the next morning. They then took her to the local government hospital where the doctors observed signs of sexually assault, which were later confirmed in the medical examination. Police were informed and accused arrested.

(The victim's identity has not been revealed to protect her privacy as per Supreme court directives on cases related to sexual assault)
