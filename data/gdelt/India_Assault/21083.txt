PM Modi should apologise for his silence on Unnao incident: Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury

New Delhi [India], Dec 13 (ANI): Prime Minister Narendra Modi should apologise for his silence over the Unnao rape incident, said Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury on Friday in response to BJP's demand for an apology from Rahul Gandhi over his remarks on rape.



"Prime Minister Narendra Modi should apologise. He did not utter a single word when the Unnao incident happened," Chowdhury said when his response on the BJP's demand was sought.

Both the Houses of Parliament on Friday witnessed uproar as the BJP members demanded an apology from the former Congress president over his "rape in India" remark.

Addressing a poll rally in Jharkhand, Gandhi said on Thursday, "Narendra Modi had said 'Make in India' but nowadays wherever you look, it is 'Rape in India'. In Uttar Pradesh, Narendra Modi's MLA raped a woman. Then she met with an accident but Narendra Modi did not utter a word," he had said.

Gandhi has denied to apologise for his comments, saying that the issue is being raised in Parliament by the BJP to deflect the attention of the people from protests in the Northeast over the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. (ANI)
