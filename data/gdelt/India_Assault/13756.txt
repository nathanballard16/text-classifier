J&K police complain to Twitter about Pak politician's 'malicious' post

Srinagar/New Delhi, Aug 13 : The Jammu and Kashmir Police on Tuesday said they have taken up with Twitter the "malicious content" posted by senior Pakistani lawmaker Rehman Malik who had tweeted that the Indian Army was using "helicopter gunships" to fire on villagers in Kashmir.

"This malicious content is strongly rebutted. We have taken up matter with @TwitterSupport," the Jammu and Kashmir Police tweeted, tagging the posts of Malik.

Malik had shared a fake video claiming that Indian armed forces were using helicopter gunships on protesters in Jammu and Kashmir after its special status was revoked.

"Indian Army have used gunship helicopters to attack villages in IOK (Indian Occupied Kashmir). With complete blackout, brave Kashmiris are managing to send the videos. This attack left dozens of men, women and children killed. Where is the mediation of President @realDonaldTrump & action by @UN," he had posted.

In another tweet, Malik appealed to US President Trump "and other human rights bodies to take notice of this Indian gunship attack on innocent Kashmiris who are demanding their right of self determination as per UN resolution," he wrote, tagging Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Human Rights Watch.

The video shared by Malik is actually from October last year when some people were injured in a shell explosion in Kulgam, according to reports.
