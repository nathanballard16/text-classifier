Akshay Kumar claims he liked tweet mocking Jamia Millia University protest by mistake

The recent passing of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India has resulted in protests all around the country.

Reportedly, in Delhi, over 100 students and activists protesting against the contentious law were injured on Sunday; the police used excessive force and tear gas, getting violent with students from Jamia Millia Islamia University, among others with harrowing videos doing the rounds on social media of them storming into the university.

Only a handful of Bollywood celebrities have expressed solidarity with Jamia Millia Islamia University students. These include Konkona Sensharma, Anurag Kashap, Rajkummar Rao, Richa Chadha and Pooja Bhatt to name a few:

However, it is Akshay Kumar who has found himself in the middle of controversy despite remaining silent on the matter initially.

The actor liked a tweet mocking the entire situation; it read "Badhai ho...Jamia mein Azaadi mili hai (congratulations, Jamia has won independence)" and showed the police in riot gear on the campus without a student in sight. He swiftly unliked the post but not before someone took a screenshot.

Kumar took to Twitter to clear the air, claiming that he had liked the tweet by mistake. "I was scrolling and accidentally it must have been pressed and when I realised I immediately unliked it as In no way do I support such acts," he wrote.

There seems to be deafening silence on the matter from Bolly bigwigs otherwise; even SRK hasn't publicly condemned the attack yet even though he's a Jamia Milia Islamia University alumnus himself.
