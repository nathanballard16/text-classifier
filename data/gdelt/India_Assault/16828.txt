Issewal gang-rape case adjourned to Oct 19

Ludhiana: A local court on Thursday adjourned the infamous Issewal gang-rape case, and is expected to hear the arguments on the revision petition of the juvenile on Friday. The next date of hearing of the main case in the court of additional sessions judge Rashmi Sharma is October 19.

On February 9, a group of miscreants had allegedly gang-raped a 20-year-old student after holding her and her friend hostage, as they had gone to Issewal to celebrate Chocolate Day. Police had booked 10 unidentified accused in the case and arrested six accused, including Jagroop Singh, a private vehicle driver of Jaspal Bangar; Ajay of Tibba, who originally belonged to Gonda in Uttar Pradesh, and worked as a driver at a petrol pump; and four nomads (two from Ludhiana, and one from Nawanshahr), including a juvenile from Jammu and Kashmir.

The defence counsel for the juvenile said that after cross-examination of the prosecutor by defence counsels concluded on October 1, cross-examination of her friend was to be done by the defence counsels on Thursday. He added that the prosecutor’s friend did not turn up in the court, and the case was adjourned to October 19.

The defence counsel said the argument on their revision petition for trial of the juvenile by the Juvenile Justice Board, instead of with the other accused, will be coming up in the court on Friday. He added that the prosecution and defence sides were expected to argue on the petition, and the court might take a decision on the petition after that on Friday itself.

The cross-examination of the prosecutor by the defence counsels was concluded in the court on October 1, and the prosecution had averred that she had fully supported their case. Defence counsel for the juvenile had said that as per the matriculation certificate of his client, he was born in April 2002, so at the time of commission of offence, he was not even 17 years old. Taking that as the main plea, the defence counsel had pleaded for trial of the juvenile by the Juvenile Justice Board, and not with the other accused, as ruled by the previous Juvenile Justice Board.
