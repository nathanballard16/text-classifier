Second arrest in Coimbatore IS module case

Members from various muslim outfits petitioned Coimbatore Police Comissioner related to NIA search

NEW DELHI: The Islamic State-inspired terror module busted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) following Wednesday's raids in Coimbatore, has turned out to be larger with four persons other than the six accused being questioned for being its members. On Friday, NIA made a second arrest in the case, that of accused Shiek Hidayuthullah.

Earlier on Thursday, NIA had arrested Mohammad Azarudheen, leader of the 10-member module and a Facebook friend of Sri Lankan suicide bomber Zahran Hashim. NIA on Friday said that Shiek was arrested based on the facts revealed thus far, regarding his pro-IS activities. tnn

He is aged 38 years and is a resident of South Ukkadam locality in Coimbatore. Scrutiny of the documents from his house shows that he is also associated with proscribed terrorist organisation Student Islamic Movement of India (SIMI).

While Shiek will be produced before the special court, Azarudheen was sent to judicial custody on Thursday. NIA expects to get their police remand early next week.

NIA sources said while the nearly 10-member module was following and sharing radical content attributed to Hashim on social media, it was not really close to executing any terror attack. NIA will be sending the computer resources seized during Wednesday's raids for forensic examination, which will help it trace any links with similar IS-inspired elements in Sri Lanka, including those connected with Easter Sunday attacks.

The module - comprising around 10 men from Coimbatore who were well known to one another -is suspected to have propagated IS ideology on social media with the intention of recruiting vulnerable youth for executing terror attacks in Tamil Nadu and Kerala.
