Youth held for labour contractor’s murder

Buguda: Buguda police cracked the murder of a labour contractor at Golia village as it arrested a youth in this connection Monday.

Rama Chandra Dalai is accused of murdering Mineketan Samal at a shrine in the village. He hacked Samal to death when he was offering pujas at the shrine. The murder took place after Samal went back on his promise of paying Rs 10, 000 to Dalai as compensation towards the death of his brother in-law who was working as a migrant labourer in Mumbai. A case was registered in this connection and Dalai was produced in court.

Sources said the deceased a labour contractor used to send labourers to work in a factory in Mumbai. Dalai’s brother-in-law Lakshman Pradhan was one of the labourer engaged by Samal in the factory. Pradhan while working in Mumbai died of some disease following which Samal without informing his family members cremated the body.

This created a rift between Dalai and Samal following which the latter assured him to pay Rs 10,000 as compensation for Pradhan’s death. Dalai demanded the money from Samal but each time the latter dodged of his request on some or other pretext.

This led to a heated brawl between the two following which Samal refused to give him the money and asked him to do whatever he may like. Enraged, Dalai hacked Samal to death when he was offering pujas at the village shrine. He fled from the spot and remained in hiding on a farmland the whole Saturday night. The next day he boarded a bus to his in-laws house at J Chhachina village and was hiding there when a police team conducted a raid and arrested him.
