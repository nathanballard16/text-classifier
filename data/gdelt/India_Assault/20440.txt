New Delhi: Concerned about rising incidents of crime against women in various parts of the country, Congress interim chief Sonia Gandhi has decided not to celebrate her 73rd birthday on Monday.

The senior Congress leader, who will turn 73 on Monday, took the decision in the wake of rampant incidents of rape in several parts of the country, news agency PTI quoted its sources as saying.

Gandhi will not celebrate her birthday as she is concerned about women's security, and is also saddened by rape incidents and assaults on women in various parts of the country.

The Congress veteran’s decision comes amid public outrage over two recent incidents of crime against women – the Unnao rape case and the Telangana rape and murder case.

On Friday night, the Unnao rape victim, who was set on fire, died at a hospital in Delhi while in Telangana’s Cyberabad, a 27-year-old veterinary doctor was gang-raped and charred to death by four men.

The two incidents sparked nationwide anger and also raised questions over women’s safety in the country.

Several other incidents of assaults on women have also been reported from other parts of the country in the recent past, triggering outrage among the people.

The Congress leader had earlier too dropped her birthday celebration plans in wake of some tragic incidents. In 2014, she decided no to celebrate her birthday after terror and Naxal attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh, respectively. Gandhi had asked Congresspersons not to celebrate her birthday to show solidarity with the martyred Army and police personnel there.

She had also not celebrated her birthday in 2013 following the demise of Nelson Mandela, former South African president.
