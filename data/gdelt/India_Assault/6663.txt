Pragya Thakur is among the seven accused in the 2008 Malegaon blast case in which six people were killed and over 100 injured on September 29. Hemant Karkare was heading the probe and Pragya Thakur was arrested as the motorcycle used in the blast was registered in her name.

In May 2016, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) gave a clean chit to Sadhvi Pragya. However, the trial court refused to let her off, saying the motorcycle used in the blast was registered in her name.

Meanwhile, a Malegaon blast victim’s father has moved the special NIA court seeking a ban on Sadhvi Pragya contesting the Lok Sabha election. In his petition, the complainant Nisar Sayeed, who lost his son in the 2008 Malegaon blast, said Pragya Thakur should attend court proceedings in Mumbai and be barred from contesting the Lok Sabha election.
