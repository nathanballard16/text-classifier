However, when she resisted the attack, the accused thrashed her with the butt of a country-made pistol. So badly was she beaten up that the cot she was tied to broke under the weight of her and the accused,” said an official from Thorala police station.The accused had chosen to target the survivor when she was alone at home. Her husband, an autorickshaw driver, was away and she was alone with her three children.After the attack, when the survivor raised a cry and the neighbours rushed to her rescue, the accused fled the spot.
