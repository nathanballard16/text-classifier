Bhopal: Police in Madhya Pradesh have arrested two minor boys for the alleged gang-rape of an eight-year-old girl. The horrific incident took place in Singrauli district of the state on Tuesday evening when the child had stepped out of her home to bathe in the village canal. More details in this regard are awaited as the matter is under active investigation by police.

A preliminary investigation has revealed that the minor was dragged to a deserted spot by the accused where they took turns raping her before fleeing the spot. Covered in blood and in immense pain, the survivor managed to return home but could not narrate the incident to her parents due to the shock.

Suspecting something unusual, the parents took her to a local hospital where doctors conducted a medical examination of the girl and confirmed sexual assault. The girl's parents then approached the Kotwali police station where a 'zero FIR' was registered against the accused boys. Based on a complaint by the victim and her parents, police immediately arrested the two boys who are reportedly neighbours of the minor girl.

Station in-charge (SI) of the Kotwali police station, Manish Tripathi told Times of India that the girl was shifted to a bigger hospital on Wednesday where she is currently undergoing treatment. Her condition is improving, added the police officer.

Earlier this month, a five-year-old girl was abducted, raped and murdered by a 19-year-old boy who she referred to as her uncle. The accused reportedly abducted the minor from her home on June 7 and raped her before bludgeoning her to death, aiming to destroy all evidence against him. The girl's body was later found floating in the river Kshipra. A special investigative team (SIT) was formed which led to the arrest of the accused, Shiva Rao Maratha.
