Recognizing minority rights brings protections and reinforces differences.

Minority recognition has also made the very groups these laws are designed to protect more vulnerable to violence, stereotyping and demagoguery. Members of dominant groups rail against minorities in manifestos and actively kill and drive out those whom they blame for all the problems in society. This was the apparent motivation of the shooter in the massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh which was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history. That same motivation drove the assailant in El Paso, who targeted Hispanics, and the shooter who murdered nine African Americans at a church service in Charleston, S.C., in 2015. In India, an ascendant movement of Hindu nationalists targets and assaults minority Muslims. All around the globe, practitioners of violence share a common goal: the creation of an exclusive, homogeneous society by eliminating minorities.
