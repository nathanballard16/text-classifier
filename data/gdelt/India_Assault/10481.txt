‘Insecure’ man stabs friend, her son at Goregaon (E), held

Mumbai: The inability to accept rejection and insecurity, drove a 29-year-old man to stab a young woman and her five-year-old son at Goregaon East on Friday evening. The victims were rushed to the hospital, where they are recuperating. Vanrai Police arrested and booked Devendra Waghel under relevant IPC sections for attempt to murder.

According to police, the victim, Sunita Jadhav, a mother of two kids, separated from her husband since six years ago and had been living with her mother. She befriended Waghel, who developed hard feelings for her. However, these feelings were not reciprocated by Jadhav, but the duo decided to remain friends. Waghel, a waiter at a restaurant, suspec­ted she had other male friends, which made him insecure.

Police said at 7.15pm on Friday, when Jadhav was out with son for an evening stroll at Jayprakash Nagar, they were intercepted by Waghel, who stabbed them with a knife bef­o­re fleeing. The locals rushed the mother-son duo to the Bal Thackeray Trauma Hospital in Jogeshwari (E) for treatment. They sustained serious injuries, but are now stable and recuperating, said police. Vanrai Police arrested Waghel from Goregaon for attempt to murder. He confessed to the crime. On Saturday, he was produced in a court, and was sent to custody.
