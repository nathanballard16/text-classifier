Huge cache of explosives seized in Bengal

The West Bengal CID has seized a huge cache of explosive materials from a village in Bankura district during a raid, a senior officer said on Thursday.

Acting on a tip-off, a CID team raided the village under Saltora Police Station in the district, and seized around 106 cartons of gelatin sticks weighing 2,650 kg, 6,650 kg of ammonium nitrate sacks and 52,500 pieces of electric detonators, on Wednesday night, he said.

A four-wheeler and a two-wheeler have also been confiscated.

"The seized items were procured from Odisha, Telangana and Jharkhand, and were meant to be used in illegal stone quarry. We are conducting an investigation," the officer added.

The Kolkata Police had last week seized nearly 1,000 kg of potassium nitrate -- also used in making explosives -- from Chitpur area of the city.
