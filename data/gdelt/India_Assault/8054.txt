Man wanted in murder case arrested soon after stepping out of pooling booth in Delhi

A 27-year-old accused in a murder case was arrested as he stepped out of a polling booth in south Delhi after casting his vote, police said Monday.

Badal (27) and his accomplices, Satender (26) and Asfak Ahmed (24), were arrested Sunday for their alleged involvement in the killing of a rival gang member outside the Saket court last week.

Acting on a tip-off, police personnel, who were on the trail of Badal, laid a trap outside the Government Boys Senior Secondary School Number 1 in Khanpur village of South Delhi and arrested him.

On May 6, Prince, a Chirag Delhi resident, had come to Saket Court to attend his case where he was ambushed by some unidentified persons, waiting outside the court premises, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Ram Gopal Naik said.

Prince, affiliated to a gang, was involved in more than five criminal cases and the modus operandi of the killing was indicative of rivalry between the two gangs, the officer said.

During investigation, it was revealed that gangster Rohit Choudhary, along with his associates, had killed Prince. The victim had abused and threatened Choudhary publicly, following which he plotted to kill Prince, Naik said, adding Prince had earlier managed to escape two attempts on his life.

"We laid a trap inside the polling booth. Our officers in plain clothes were in the same queue as Badal's. The moment left the booth after casting his vote, we nabbed him," Naik said.

After Badal's arrest, the police also nabbed Satender and Ahmed. The three were allegedly leaking information about Prince's arrival at the court to their gang members who shot him dead.
