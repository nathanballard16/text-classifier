Srinagar

A civilian was injured Monday as Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by targeting forward posts and villages along the Line of Control (LoC) in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.

Reports said that a civilian identified as Mohammad Sharif was hit by splinters of a mortar shell which exploded near his house at Haveli village in Shahpur sector, the officials said.

They said the civilian injured was rushed to the hospital.

A defence spokesperson said the Pakistani Army initiated the unprovoked ceasefire violation by shelling with mortar and firing by small arms from across the border in Sahahpur and Kernai sectors at around 750 hours.

The Indian Army retaliated befittingly, he said, adding that the cross-border firing between the two sides was still continuing intermittently. (GNS)
