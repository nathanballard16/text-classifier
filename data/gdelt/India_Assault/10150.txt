Health services hit hard as doctors go on strike in India

NEW DELHI (AA): Healthcare services across several states of India were hit hard on Monday after doctors went on a strike to demand workplace safety. The Indian Medical Association, a national doctors’ body, decided to withdraw non-essential services for a day to express solidarity with their colleagues in the state of West Bengal who are protesting the assault of two doctors by the family of a deceased patient.

Doctors also staged a protest in the capital New Delhi. They boycotted the outpatient department (OPD), routine operations and ward visits for 24 hours starting Monday morning. Meanwhile, healthcare services continued to remain affected in West Bengal for the seventh day on Monday. West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has agreed to meet representatives of the protesting doctors to hear their grievances.

Also, the Supreme Court will hear on Tuesday a plea seeking safety and security of doctors in government hospitals across the country. Last week, two doctors were assaulted at the NRS Hospital in Kolkata, the capital of West Bengal, allegedly by family members of a patient.
