Kashmir: Pakistan’s View - The New York Times

To the Editor:

Re “Pakistan Finds Few Options in Its Dispute With India” (news article, Aug. 10):

The most obvious option is for India to loosen its stranglehold on Kashmir and act in the spirit and the letter of international law and United Nations Security Council resolutions.

India, while taking actions consistent with the aggression and repression it has perpetrated in the internationally recognized disputed region of Kashmir for decades, has gone a dangerous step further by totally renouncing those legal commitments and thumbing its nose at President Trump’s offer to Prime Minister Imran Khan to mediate the dispute.

Pakistan stands ready to do what is right for the Kashmiri people, who have suffered enough.
