Hyderabad police arrested a man on Saturday on sexual assault charges after he lured a nine-year-old girl with sweets and raped her at his house on Friday evening.

The police have arrested 28-year-old Mohan*, who is currently unemployed, based on complaints made by the child's parents. Police say the Mohan lured the child, who was playing with her brother outside her home, with sweets.

“The survivor and the assaulter were known to each other. Mohan knew the child’s parents were not at home and lured the child to his home by offering her sweets,” M Sudarshan, ACP Malakpet, told the Times of India.

The sexual assault took place sometime after 7:30 pm on Friday, but the parents of the child learnt about the incident only the next day. At around 4 am, the child complained to her mother about stomach pains. The parents took the nine-year-old child to a hospital where she underwent a medical examination. Doctors then informed the parents that the child had been sexually assaulted.

"The girl then told her mother about the incident and identified Mohan as the perpetrator, which is when the family approached us. The child was taken to a Bharosa Centre," the Malakpet ACP stated.

The police have booked a case against Mohan under Section 376 (Rape) of the Indian Penal Code as well as several sections of POCSO Act. He has been arrested.
