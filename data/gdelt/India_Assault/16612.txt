India is Not 'Inn' for Illegal Infiltrators, Ruling BJP Reiterates

BJP President and federal Home Minister Amit Shah had made it clear more than once that no infiltrators would be allowed in India.

"I promise not even one infiltrator will be allowed to remain in India", he said in the eastern city of Kolkata earlier this month.

Reiterating his party Chief's stand, Working President of the BJP Jagat Prakash Nadda said on Friday, 4 October, that the country is not a destination for illegal immigrants.
