As injured teen dies, curbs return to Valley

SRINAGAR: The J&K administration reimposed restrictions on movement in parts of the Valley on Wednesday after an 18-year-old boy died from injuries that police said were inflicted by a stone-pelting mob on August 6, a version his family contradicted by saying he was struck by pellets fired by security forces.Asrar Ahmed Khan of Soura had been undergoing treatment at the Sher-i-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences here for almost a month after being brought in with multiple injuries, doctors said.There was no official word on the nature of those injuries except additional DGP Munir Khan's statement that Asrar was caught in a clash between stone-pelters and security personnel the day after the Centre moved a bill in Parliament to nullify Article 370 and revoke J&K's special status."We will still investigate (what caused his death), and get his medical report and other details," Khan said during a presser. "Five civilian deaths have been reported since August 5 and not a single one was caused by any action taken by security forces."The additional DGP (law and order) said three persons, including 65-year-old wholesale trader Ghulam Mohammad, were killed by terrorists. Besides Asrar, a truck driver was fatally injured in stone-pelting by protesters, he added.
