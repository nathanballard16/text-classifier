Tables turned on Anant Singh

The tables have been turned on independent Bahubali MLA Anant Singh after a state police team recently recovered an AK-47 rifle from his house at Ladma in rural Patna. The muscleman-politician who once inspired awe and fear, now has his back to the wall.

Having been forced to surrender in a Delhi Court, Anant Singh is now cooling his heels in Patna's Beur jail where he has former RJD MLA Raj Ballabh Yadav, former MP Vijay Krishna and RJD MLC Ritlal Yadav for company.

Anant Singh has been booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and Arms Act, which may dash his hopes for a quick legal reprieve, said police sources.

As a privileged prisoner owing to his status as a legislator, Anant Singh (prisoner number 13613) is entitled to a chair, charpoy, bedsheet, a fan and a separate washroom, but no air conditioner or home-made food have been made available to him in Beur jail.

Among other politicians in Beur Jail, Vijay Krishna is serving a life sentence in the kidnapping and murder of a Patna transporter, Satyendra Kumar Singh while Raj Ballabh Yadav, once a trusted lieutenant of incarcerated RJD chief Lalu Prasad, is serving life sentence in a minor's rape case in 2016.

On the other hand RJD MLC Ritlal Yadav, who too is lodged in the high security prison for his alleged involvement in a double murder case, is an under trial prisoner like Anant Singh.
