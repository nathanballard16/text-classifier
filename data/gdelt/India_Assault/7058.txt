Yasin Malik rallying point for National Conference & Peoples Democratic Party

Incarcerated Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) chairman Mohammad Yasin Malik has become a rallying point for the pro-India National Conference (NC) and Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) to pander to a huge separatist constituency in an apparent bid to woo the voters.

"Poor Yasin Malik is in jail because he is not ready to budge from his stand. Kudos to him because he prefers death rather than sell out," said Farooq Abdullah, NC president, while addressing a poll rally in Devsar area of Kulgam district.

The statement has evoked a sharp reaction from his political opponents who blamed for creating Malik in the first place. "In 1987 rigged elections Yasin Malik was polling agent of MUF candidate Muhammad Yousuf Shah when Farooq Abdullah ordered police to arrest, torture him. Let's not forget that Farooq Abdullah forced youngsters like Yasin Malik to pick up the gun", tweeted Tahir Syeed, spokesman of PDP.

Separatist turned pro-India leader Sajad Lone accused Farooq Abdullah of imprisoning and torturing Malik right from 1987.

"Do you really have the nerve to be talking about Yasin Malik? Was it not you as Chief Minister who imprisoned him before and after 1987 elections? Was it not you as Chief Minister who ordered his third-degree torture and tortured him so badly that his heart ailment worsened?" Lone asked Farooq.

Malik has been arrested by NIA in terror funding case and shifted him to Tihar jail from Kot Bhawal jail where he was already detained under Public Safety Act (PSA).
