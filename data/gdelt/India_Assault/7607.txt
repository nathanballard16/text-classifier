Blank: Karan Kapadia’s film rakes in Rs 3.72 crore on the first weekend

Last week, we saw debutant Karan Kapadia’s first film, Blank arrive in theatres, and today the film has completed its first weekend at the box office. The film currently stands at Rs 3.72 crore. The film also stars Sunny Deol, alongside Karan.

Blank released on May 3 and has garnering mixed response from the audience and critics. The film, which is an action-drama, features Karan in the lead and has earned Rs 3.72 crore in the first three days. Considering that the film also stars superstar Sunny Deol, the expectation was more than what it has earned, but at least it touched an average. The film on its first day minted to Rs 97 lakh. The numbers escalated on day two with the film earning Rs 1.17 crore. The good news for Blank, however, is that out of all the three films led by debutants that we saw this year – Blank, Mard Ko Dard Nahin Hota and Notebook – Blank is the highest first-weekend earner.

Let’s see what the film manages to do in the coming days. For more updates and gossip from Bollywood, stay tuned to CineBlitz.
