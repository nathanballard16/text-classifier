Witch doctor rapes teenage girl

Rajkot: A 14-year-old girl has been allegedly raped by a witch doctor in Bhatvadia village of Kalyanpur taluka in Devbhoomi-Dwarka district. Though the crime was committed on Saturday, the complaint was lodged on Monday. The accused, identified as Bharat Sonagra (50), who practices witchcraft in Bhatvadia village, told the girl’s parents that a spell of black magic was cast on her.“Convinced by Sonagra’s diagnosis, the survivor’s parents left the girl in his care. Then Sonagra allegedly took the girl to a farm and raped her. We have launched a manhunt for Sonagra, who absconded after the crime,” said an official from Kalyanpur police station.
