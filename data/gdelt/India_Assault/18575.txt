BJP Leader Escorted out of Summit for Disrupting Pak’s J&K Speech

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Vijay Jolly stirred a controversy when he was escorted out by the security at the Asia Pacific Summit 2019 in Cambodia for interrupting Pakistan leader Qasim Suri's speech on Jammu and Kashmir.

A video has surfaced online showing Suri, who is the Deputy Speaker in the National Assembly talking about the Kashmiris' right to self-determination at the summit in Phnom Penh, Cambodia.

Talking about the crackdown in the Valley, Suri said, “I want to direct your attention towards the human rights violations in Kashmir. Almost 100,000 Kashmiris have been martyred and thousands are missing.”
