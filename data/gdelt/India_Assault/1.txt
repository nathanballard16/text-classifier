Maharashtra: Second tiger dies in 24 hours, most probably poisoned

In a severe jolt to tiger conservation efforts in Maharashtra, two tigers were found dead within around 24 hours at the same location in a protected tiger habitat near Nagpur. The deaths of the tigers, of which one was a male and the other a female, are suspected to have been caused by poisoning. This has taken the number of tiger deaths in Maharashtra to 21 this year.

Ravikiran Govekar, chief conservator of forests and field director of the Pench tiger project, the carcass of a female tiger was found in a search operation by forest staff early on Monday. "The locality is close to the site where the dead male tiger was found," he added.

The tigress has been identified as T4 and her death may have happened at the same time as that of the male.

A partially-eaten carcass of a wild pig and that of a common Indian civet was also found nearby. "In both cases, it was observed that tigers had consumed the wild pig meat," he added, stating that prima facie , it seemed that the pig carcass was poison-laced. The samples were collected for forensic testing to ascertain if the cause of death was poisoning. "The scene of crime is around 100 to 200 meters from agricultural fields," said Govekar.

A male tiger was found dead on Sunday morning in the Paoni range of the Umred Paoni Karhandla wildlife sanctuary near Nagpur. Sources said the carnivore, whose motionless body was discovered by tourists, could have died of poisoning as it was found to have vomited, had froth around its mouth and its stomach had puffed up. The tiger may be the offspring of Maharashtra's iconic tiger 'Jai', who went missing from the tiger habitat in 2015.
