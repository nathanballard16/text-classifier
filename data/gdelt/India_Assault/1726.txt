In India, the cow is a revered animal with religious and social significance in the Hindu-majority society of the country. For rural households, the "Holy Cow" is treated with reverence, as it provides milk for nourishment, helps in agrarian work, and cow dung is collected to be stored as manure for the crop as, well as that the dried cow dung cakes come handy as an energy source for burning during rainy days when the wood supply is limited.
