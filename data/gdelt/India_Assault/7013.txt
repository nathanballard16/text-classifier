Asaram Bapu’s son Narayan Sai found guilty of rape, sentencing on April 30

Narayan Sai (40) and his father Asaram Bapu are currently lodged in jail in connection with rape cases. While Sai is lodged in Lajpor jail on charges of the rape of a lady in Surat, Asaram is lodged at a Jodhpur jail.

A local in Surat court on Friday held self-styled godman Asaram Bapu’s son Narayan Sai guilty in a rape case of two sisters. The quantum of punishment will be pronounced on April 30.

Narayan Sai (47) and his father are currently lodged in jail in connection with rape cases. While Sai is lodged in Lajpor jail on charges of the rape of a lady in Surat, Asaram is lodged at a Jodhpur jail.

Sai was arrested from Kurukshetra in Haryana in December 2013 after two Surat sisters filed rape complaints against him and Asaram in October the same year. One of the sisters had alleged that she was raped by Sai multiple times between 2002 and 2005 when she was living in his ashram.

Last April, a Jodhpur court convicted Asaram Bapu for raping a minor girl at his ashram in 2013 and sentenced to a life term.

Asaram, 78, was convicted under Section 376 of the Indian Penal Code, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act and the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act.

Asaram is also facing trial in another sexual assault case in Gujarat.

The self-styled godman was arrested in 2013 from Indore after a teenaged girl from Shahajahanpur in Uttar Pradesh filed a complaint and accused him of rape at his ashram in Manai village near Jodhpur in August 2013.
