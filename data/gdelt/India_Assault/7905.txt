Kolkata: The BJP’s Lok Sabha candidate for Diamond Harbour has been charged for allegedly sexually assaulting 17-year-old girl last month, reported NDTV.

Nilanjan Roy has been charged under the POCSO Act.

The incident took place on April 26 and the complaint was filed the next day.

Ananya Chatterjee Chakrobarti, the chairperson of West Bengal State Commission for Protection of Child Rights said, “A complaint was lodged at the Falta police station. Medical examination of the girl was done and her statement recorded, but the police did not arrest Roy.”

As soon as the Commission was informed about the incident, they wrote to the Election Commission to immediately arrest Roy.

The state BJP Vice-President Jayprakash Majumdar, however, blamed the Trinamool Congress for a "false case."

Majumdar said during primary investigation, police did not find a prima-facie case so they did not proceed.

“Now the TMC is using the Child Rights Commission, who has sent a letter to the EC to arrest him, which is beyond their jurisdiction," he added.

The Election Commission is yet to take a decision in this case.

Nilanjan Roy has been fielded against Mamata Banerjee's nephew Abhishek Banerjee from the seat. Diamond Harbour will go to polls on May 19.
