Daughter of 52-year-old businessman stabbed to death in Delhi is 'shocked and traumatised'

His family has alleged that the locals did not come to his aid and instead filmed the incident. "Even though children are employed, the entire family was emotionally and financially dependent on my brother. The two daughters are still unmarried and even though my brother wanted them to be financially independent, he nurtured dreams about their marriage too. "The business will have to be looked after. We are trying our best to support them and stand by them but nobody can fill the void of the person they have lost," the family member said. Senior officials of Delhi Police -- Joint Commissioner of Police (West) Madhup Tiwari and Deputy Commissioner of Police (West) Monika Bhardwaj -- met the family of the deceased on Wednesday. The family members requested the officers to intensify patrolling in the area to ensure peace and tranquillity so that no such untoward incident takes place in future. There are police personnel still deployed in the area and the senior officials have also ensured door-to-door verification of tenants in the area to ensure safety. Family members of the 52-year-old businessman met Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday. A 45-year-old man and his 20-year-old son have been arrested in connection with the killing. Two other sons of the 45-year-old man, who are juveniles, have been apprehended.
