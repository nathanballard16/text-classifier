A man accused of trying to rape a four-year-old girl was stripped naked and paraded through the streets by a vigilante mob.

Jawahar Vaidya, 35, is a debt collector for a bank in the city of Nagpur, India.

According to police, he was visiting the girl's home on Sunday evening to collect money. When he found her alone in the house, he then "tried to sexually assault her", a police official said.

The girl's mum then suddenly returned home and called her neighbours over when she realised what the man was doing.

A crowd of outraged locals apprehended Vaidya and beat him. They then stripped his clothes off, tied his hands together and forced him to walk through the streets to a local police station.

A criminal case against him has been registered under several sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act at Pardi police station, India Today reports.

The shocking incident comes as India is rocked by yet another brutal gang rape and murder. Priyanka Reddy, a 27-year-old veterinarian, was killed after a group of men offered to help her with her motorcycle's flat tyre.

Four suspects have been arrested in connection with the horrific crime, which has sparked protests in cities across the nation.
