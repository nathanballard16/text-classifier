Writer who accused Trump of sexual assault sues him for defamation

E Jean Carroll publicly described the alleged assault for the first time in June, in a published excerpt of a memoir.

: A writer and longtime women's advice columnist has sued US President Donald Trump, accusing him of defaming her this summer after she claimed he sexually assaulted her two decades ago in an upscale New York City department store.

At that time and in the new lawsuit, she said that after running into the then-real estate developer at Bergdorf Goodman in late 1995 or early 1996, they chatted and shopped together before he attacked her in a dressing room. She said he knocked her head against a wall, pulled down her tights and briefly penetrated her before she pushed him off and ran out.

Trump has denied ever meeting her and has said she was trying to promote her book. The White House did not provide immediate comment after the suit was filed.

"I am filing this on behalf of every woman who has ever been harassed, assaulted, silenced, or spoken up only to be shamed, fired, ridiculed and belittled," said Carroll, who is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, in a statement.

"No person in this country should be above the law -- including the president."
