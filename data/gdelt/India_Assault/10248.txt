Urvashi Rautela bashes former PR manager for assassinating her character; read post

Mumbai: Bollywood's bold actress Urvashi Rautela has recently slammed former PR manager for assassinating her character.

The 'Great Grand Masti' actor shared a message of her Instagram handle. She wrote, "Its really catastrophic that media has given integrity to my ( ex pr for 5 yrs) cocaine-alcohol addict, who was in jail because of blackmailing me, without checking the record who the person is. It’s really sad how cheap people go in assassinating people’s character when you discontinue the service. I have enjoyed an impeccable reputation after years of hardwork & efforts."

Earlier, Urvashi was trolled for posting a cosy picture with Virat Kohli's wax statue on social media. Meanwhile, the 25-year-old actress has featured in films like Hate Story 4, Sanam Re, Great Grand Masti and many more.

The diva will next be seen in Aneez Bazmee's film, 'Pagalpanti'. The film also features John Abraham, Ileana D'Cruz, Arshad Warsi, Anil Kapoor, Pulkit Samrat and Kriti Kharbanda in key roles.
