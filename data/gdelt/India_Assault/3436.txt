Pulwama avenged: India is safe under PM Modi - BJP leaders on IAF air strike

In the wee hours on Tuesday, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out multiple aerial strikes at terror launch pads at various places in Pakistan occupied Kashmir, destroying control rooms of terrorist organisations including Jaish-e-Mohammed and some other infrastructure, 12 days after the Pulwama terror attack.

The terror camps in Balakot, Chakothi and Muzaffarabad, capital of PoK, were struck by 12 Mirage 2000 jets with 1000 kg of explosives at around 3:30 am, IAF sources said.

The targets included the control rooms of JeM outfit which carried out a terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14 in which 40 security personnel were killed and five injured.

The JeM control room was completely destroyed in the air strike, sources said.

Pulwama terror attack had led to nationwide outrage and Prime Minister Narendra Modi had vowed to punish those behind the attack.

And today, with the air strikes carried out by the IAF, India sure has avenged the Pulwama terror attack.

While saluting the valour of the brave hearts who carried out the strike and praising PM Modi for his leadership, here's what the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders have to say about the successful attack.
