On the other side, in his anticipatory bail, Desai has refuted the rape allegation, saying he was in a "consensual relationship" with the actress for last few years.

To back his claim, Desai had submitted before the court evidence in the form of photographs and WhatsApp chats. He had told the court that the facts of the day when the alleged incident took place were being purposefully misrepresented by the complainant.

Desai’s counsel Parvez Memon said they were happy with the order. “The so-called victim has resorted to the abuse of process of law with ulterior motives which was exposed by us in the court through cogent evidence suggesting a consensual relationship,” he said.
