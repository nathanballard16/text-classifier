Pak to deal firmly with all terrorists: Bolton

Washington: Pakistan has assured the United States that it will deal firmly with all terrorists and take steps to de-escalate tensions with India, according to National Security Adviser, John Bolton. He said Monday here that the assurance was given by Pakistani Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi during a telephonic call.

“Spoke with Pakistani FM Qureshi to encourage meaningful steps against JeM and other terrorist groups operating from Pakistan,” Bolton said in a tweet.

“The FM assured me that Pakistan would deal firmly with all terrorists and will continue steps to de-escalate tensions with India,” he added.

Bolton’s call with Qureshi came during the ongoing visit of the Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale. On the first day of his official visit, the top Indian diplomat met the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

The United States continued to maintain pressure on Pakistan, according to a statement of the meeting issued by the State Department.

“Secretary Pompeo and Foreign Secretary Gokhale discussed the importance of bringing those responsible for the (Pulwama) attack to justice and the urgency of Pakistan taking meaningful action against terrorist groups operating on its soil,” State Department deputy spokesperson Robert Palladino said.

“They noted the strength of our partnership and discussed ways to further enhance cooperation, including on counter-terrorism,” Palladino added.

Tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) killed 40 CRPF personnel in Kashmir’s Pulwama district, February 14.
