New Delhi: Amid a raging debate in the country over the safety of women and the justice system after the dual rape-murders in Hyderabad and Unnao, PM Narendra Modi addressed the top brass of the police.

PM Modi while addressing the 54th conference of the Directors General of Police (DGPs) and Inspectors General of Police (IGs) in Pune asked them to build an image that inspires confidence in people and especially women.

Modi said the role of effective policing was to make sure that “women feel safe and secure”. Modi also lauded the police forces for their efforts in maintaining the peace and tranquillity and ensuring normalcy in the country.

"We must not forget the contribution of their families who stood firmly behind them," the prime minister said while emphasising the role of effective policing in making sure that women feel safe and secure.

Modi urged the police officers to carry the spirit of the conference to the lowest ranks from state to the district police station.

Modi urged the DGPs of the north-eastern states to make extra effort to create a conducive environment for development there as the region remains critical for India’s Act East Policy.

The prime minister also touched upon the pressures and challenges facing the police officers while carrying out their daily duties.

"Whenever they are in doubt they should remember the ideals and the spirit with which they appeared for the civil services exams and continue to work in the national interest, keeping in mind the welfare of the weakest and poorest sections of society," Modi said.

The prime minister awarded the President's police medals for distinguished service to officers of the Intelligence Bureau. The conference which was earlier a one-day affair was changed to three days starting 2015.
