Noida: Four cops, three police drivers part of extortion gang, held

NOIDA: As many as 15 people, including a police post in-charge, have been arrested for allegedly extorting money from targets by framing them in false rape cases.The accused, including the Sector 44 chowki in-charge, three constables and three PCR van drivers, were produced in the Meerut anti-corruption court on Tuesday and sent to jail.The three constables, Manoj Kumar, Ajayveer Singh and Devendra Kumar, who were deployed at the Sector 44 chowki, were allegedly caught “red-handed” as they were taking money from one of their targets by a team led by the Noida SSP and including the circle officer 1 and the Sector 39 SHO between 9pm and 1am on the intervening night of June 10-11.Chowki in-charge sub-inspector Sunil Sharma was not present at the scene but was arrested later. The SSP claimed that Sharma’s name was taken by the arrested constables.PCR van drivers Vipin Singh, Durvesh Kumar and Rajesh Singh, six other individuals, Satish alias Ankit, Hariom Sharma, Suresh Kumar, Deshraj, Anoop and Salim Khan, and two women, Vineeta (Satish’s wife) and Pooja, were subsequently arrested.According to police, SSP Vaibhav Krishna received information about a gang operating in the Sector 44 police chowki area under the patronage of Sunil Sharma. The gang members allegedly trapped high-profile businessmen and blackmailed them on the pretext of settlement of rape cases.The SSP had specific information about one of the targets, a Faridabad-based businessman who worked as a contractor in the Yamuna Expressway area.“The women would seek a lift from their target in the Sector 44 area and ask to be dropped at a spot where a PCR van would be parked. They would then complain to the constables in the van that they had been raped by the target and demand that a case be filed against him,” said the SSP.Next, the target would be taken to the police chowki, where Satish and Deshraj would enter the scene. “Satish would claim to be a lawyer and start writing an application on behalf of the women. Deshraj would enter the scene as a chairman and mediate between the accused and the women, suggesting that money be paid to settle the case. The gang would keep the vehicle in their possession till the money was paid,” he said.The latest target, the Faridabad-based businessman, approached the SSP, saying his Honda City was being kept at the Sector 44 police chowki.The SSP said that the accused would take money of up to Rs six lakh from their targets. He added that the gang extorted money from as many as 15 people, but police have identified only three complainants, so far.Police have also recovered Rs 50,000, a Honda City car, a Verna car and a Grand i10 car from the accused.An FIR has been lodged against the accused under IPC sections 384 (punishment for extortion ), 120b (criminal conspiracy), 411 (dishonestly receiving stolen property) and Sections 7/13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act at the Sector 39 police station.According to police, a departmental inquiry would be initiated against the accused police officers.Police also said that the gang had been active for the past six months but Sunil Sharma joined the chowki only in March, this year.Three of the accused, Satish, Vineeta and Pooja, had been arrested by Faridabad police in 2014 and 2017 for framing and cheating people in a similar manner. Those cases are still pending in court, according to police.
