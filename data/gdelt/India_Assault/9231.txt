Chennai: Cops to pay Rs 5L to man for death of son

Chennai: The State Human Rights Commission has directed two cops to pay a compensation of Rs 5 lakh to a worker for death of his son due to custodial torture at Madurai nine years ago. The commissions recommended the government to initiate disciplinary action against the duo. In the petition, A.Muniyandi, working as scavenger in Virudhunagar municipality, submitted that after coming back from work on December 2, 2011, he found his son Suresh had not returned the home till late night. His family members searched for him at various places and he could not be traced.

Ten days later, police officers of Virudhunagar West police station informed his relative on December 13 that two constables from Karimedu police station Madurai came in search of the complainant and his wife. When he went to Madurai, the cops told him that Suresh died and his body was kept at Government Rajaji Hospital, Madurai. They told him to receive the body. Muniyandi saw injuries on his left leg. The police informed him that Suresh and his friend David attempted to steal a two-wheeler on December 5, 2011, at Arapalayam. The public chased them and Suresh sustained grievous injury and hence he was admitted to hospital for treatment. Suresh died on December 13 despite treatment. When his advocate met the co-accused David at the Central Prison, he came to know that the police made false statement against Suresh and David. David informed advocate that Suresh was assaulted brutally in custody.
