The Uttar Pradesh law student who has accused former Union Minister and senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Chinmayanand of rape, has been arrested in the extortion case against her, from Shahjahanpur. The matter of the law student's anticipatory bail hearing being heard by the Allahabad High Court, was to come up for hearing on Thursday, but the SIT did not wait for the court's ruling, as certain phone calls traced revealed that the victim was planning to escape. The woman was arrested from her home here and taken to the Kotwali police station. She was then taken for medical examination and would later be produced in court.
