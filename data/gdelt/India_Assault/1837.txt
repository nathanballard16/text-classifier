It is yet again proved that children are not safe in the national capital. In a horrific incident on Saturday, a seven-year-old girl was kidnapped and murdered in Delhi's Nihal Vihar.

The incident took place when the seven-year-old girl had gone out to buy momos with her specially-abled younger sister around 9 p.m on Saturday.

However, soon after they left, the younger sister returned home crying. The parents asked the younger girl about her sister but they did not get any proper response.

After the family could not find her, they registered an FIR with the Nihal Vihar police station.

On Sunday morning, the minor's body was found dumped near a park in Nihal Vihar.

According to reports, a passerby had spotted the body and informed the Nihal Vihar police station at around 7.30 am, following which the officials rushed to the spot.

Police said that the victim was kidnapped and murdered after being hit by a stone.

The girl had sustained several bruises on the head and her hands were tied.

It is not yet clear whether the girl was raped before being murdered.

Police are awaiting the postmortem report.

Meanwhile, blaming the police, the victim's family said that if they had taken action on time the girl would have been alive. Police said that further investigation is underway.
