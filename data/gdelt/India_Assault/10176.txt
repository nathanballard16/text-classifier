Lucknow: Activist files complaint against Waseem Rizvi; accuses him of assaulting his wife

Lucknow (Uttar Pradesh) [India], June 18 (ANI): A police complaint was registered against UP Shia Waqf Board chairman, Waseem Rizvi by a social activist on account of women harassment here on Tuesday.

The complainant, Farhat Naqvi, alleged that Rizvi routinely beats his wife and keeps her as a captive. She said she had been receiving information about his wife's condition over the past 2-3 months and finally decided to meet her.

"I went to the Shia Yateem Khana to meet his wife to seek her well-being but was instead confronted with 15-20 goons sent by Rizvi who abused, attacked, and threatened me. Later on the premises, he contacted me through his servant's phone and threatened to kill me", she told ANI.

Naqvi, president of Mera Haq foundation, now, also plans to register a complaint in National Commission for Women (NCW), UP state women commission, and also plans to take time from the Chief Minister to talk about the issue. "I hope that I get support from the authorities and UP Police takes action at the earliest," she added.

Waseem Rizvi, on the other hand, refuted the allegations made by Farhat Naqvi. He said, Maulana Kalbe Jawad, the shia muslim cleric, had conspired against him as he had supported a sexual assault accusation against Jawad.

"The woman (Farhat Naqvi) arrived at the Shia Yateem Khana and posed herself as a sister of Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi (Union minister for minority affairs) and chairman of UP commission for women. Upon being stopped, she and her companions assaulted and misbehaved with children of the orphanage. I will take this complaint to CM Yogi Adityanath," Rizvi said. (ANI)
