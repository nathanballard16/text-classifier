Mumbai: Middle-aged pastor hypnotises, rapes 21-year-old on pretext of curing her

A pastor in Maharashtra's Vasai city was arrested for allegedly raping a 21-year-old woman. The pastor, who runs a prayer centre, allegedly hypnotised the woman and raped her.



The woman, according to the leading daily TOI, was suffering from depression.

It all started when the woman started visiting the pastor with her parents in August last year.

The accused advised the woman's parents not to accompany her to the centre. On the pretext of curing her, the pastor occasionally took the woman to various places in Vasai and sexually abused her.



The incident came to light when a family member of the woman saw the accused leaving from a hotel with her in August this year.



Following that, the woman finally revealed the truth to her parents.



The parents approached the police and a rape case was registered against the accused at the Vasai police station.
