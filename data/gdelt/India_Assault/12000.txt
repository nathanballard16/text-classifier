"Four suspected cattle thieves were caught by villagers, three were beaten badly and they died on the way to the hospital. One was seriously injured and was admitted to a hospital. Police have arrested the three accused in the case, but it was not a case of mob lynching," said Saran Superintendent of Police Hari Kishore Rai.
