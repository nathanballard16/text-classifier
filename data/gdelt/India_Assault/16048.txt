Not Just NCM. Last Year, SC Commission Too Called For NIA Probe Into Kidnappings Of Girls Citing Terror Use

On 23 September, the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) vice-chairman George Kurian wrote a letter to Union Home Minister Amit Shah stating that Christian girls in Kerala are increasingly becoming the target of “organised religious conversion and using the victims for terror activities by trapping them through ‘love jihad’”.

Kurian requested Shah for intervention of National Investigation Agency (NIA).

He wrote,

“The issue is serious as it could lead to communal disharmony in the state. It was found that in most cases the victims were brainwashed and in some cases they were used as courier for terror activities. Many a time the victims’ families refuse to come out and report the issue fearing threat from the organised religious conversion terror activities.

“It is important that the Union Home Ministry takes note of this alarming trend and order a probe by National Investigating Agency and bring in an effective law to curb such fraudulent activities of radicalised elements.”

Few know that months before the minority commission, the National Scheduled Castes Commission (NCSC) also made a similar request to the Home Ministry.

On 4 September 2018, the NCSC called a meeting of top officers of the Delhi Police in relation to abduction and rape of a minor Dalit girl from Delhi’s Sultanpuri area.

The 14-year-old girl was kidnapped by her 32-year-old neighbour Saddam Ansari on 13 August 2018, and had not been recovered yet. Eyewitnesses – including the girl’s two sisters – told the family that they saw Ansari taking her away from school, telling the sisters that he would drop her home later.

As recorded in the minutes of the meeting (a copy of which is with Swarajya), the NCSC vice-chairman L Murugan stated that it expects the Home Ministry, under which the Delhi Police functions, to get the NIA involved in cases of abduction of minor girls.
