Kanpur: Police in Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh has registered a complaint of rape against a police home guard. The accused allegedly raped a 35-year-old deaf and mute woman under Gajner police station limits on January 29. However, the case came to light only after the woman's kin lodged an official complaint with the police on Monday.

In his complaint, the rape survivor's brother has alleged that the accused barged into the verandah of the house where she was asleep and raped her. Sharif, the accused home guard even thrashed the woman's 13-year-old minor son when he rushed to his mother's rescue, claims the complainant.

Police officials familiar with the matter said that the woman upon gaining consciousness explained her ordeal to her neighbours and relatives through sign language. Based on a complaint by her brother, police registered an FIR against the accused under section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

The accused police home guard, Sharif, has been arrested and the woman has been sent for medical examination, Station House Officer (SHO), Gajner, Shashibhushan Mishra told Times of India. The officer also confirmed to the national daily that the accused indeed works as a police home guard.

A similar incident had come to light from Gwalior in Madhya Pradesh last year where a 25-year-old deaf and mute girl was raped at a facility run by a foreign-funded NGO in September of last year. Following the incident, authorities at the facility were also accused of forcing the woman to abort the child conceived as a result of the rape.
