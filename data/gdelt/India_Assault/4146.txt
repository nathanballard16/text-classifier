2 Bengal lawyers suspended for 6 months for anti-India comments

Kolkata: Two lawyers of the Barrackpore Court in West Bengal’s North 24 Parganas district have been suspended for six months for allegedly sharing an ‘anti-India post’ on their social media profiles, a senior member of the state’s bar council said. Monday.

Lawyer Wais Goni and his junior practitioner Ananya Mukherjee allegedly shared an Urdu post on their respective Facebook accounts, which contained alleged derogatory remarks about the country’s armed forces.

The post allegedly contained disparaging remarks against Abhinandan Varthaman, the Indian Air Force (IAF) pilot who was captured by the Pakistan Army after his fighter jet crashed, February 27. Varthaman was released from captivity, March 1.

“Goni had received a link in Urdu on the day Varthaman was captured. His junior Mukherjee shared the link on Facebook from Goni’s profile,” Rabindra Nath Bhattacharya, president of the Barrackpore Bar Council, told this agency.

“After translating the Urdu post into Bengali, it was found that it contained derogatory remarks about India and its armed forces. This was brought to the notice of the bar council. Both of them have been suspended for six months from practicing in this court,” Bhattacharya added.

He also informed that both Goni and Mukherjee have apologised for sharing the post. They have said it was done ‘by mistake’ and that neither of them knew Urdu.

“Both said they did not know what the content meant as none of them knew Urdu. But the bar council felt both of them should have been more responsible and refrained from sharing something, which can be considered anti-national in nature. That’s why they have been suspended,” Bhattacharya pointed out.
