India is the third largest salt producer in the world and most of it can be traced back one region — the western state of Gujarat. And, now the salt bearing region was captured from space.Gujarat accounts for three quarters of India’s annual salt production and is home to half of the country’s salt workers.The image captured by the Operational Land Imager ( OLI ) aboard the Landsat 8 Satellite shows the city of Bhavnagar — one of the leading salt-producing districts in Gujarat — on February 28, 2019.The colourful rectangles in the image are salt evaporation ponds, according to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Earth Observatory. It’s a feature often found in major salt-producing areas.The Gulf of Khambhat is also seen in the image. In the past, it was responsible for 24% of the salt production in the state. Because of the abundance of salt in the area, it is also home to the Central Salt and Marine Chemicals Research Institute.
