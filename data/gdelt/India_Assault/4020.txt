Made in Amethi, AK-203 rifles will help jawans fight terrorists: PM Modi

Tearing into Rahul Gandhi, without specifically naming him, the Prime Minister said between 2009 to 2014, demands of providing 1.86 lakh bulletproof jackers for defence forces was neglected.

AMETHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday laid the foundation stone of a manufacturing unit for AK-203 assault rifles in Uttar Pradesh's Amethi. It was his first rally in Amethi, the Lok Sabha constituency represented by Congress president Rahul Gandhi, since coming to power in 2014. Modi said Amethi, which has traditionally been loyal to the Gandhi family, was the best example of his government's 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas' (together with all, development for all) motto. "Those who voted for us and those who did not all are ours," Modi said. After laying the foundation stone of the unit, he said these modern rifles will be manufactured in Amethi under a Russia-India joint venture. The AK-203 will replace the INSAS rifles being used by the Army and other forces. The immediate target is to produce 7,00,000 AK-203 rifles in the facility, PTI reported quoting official sources. These rifles will be known as 'made in Amethi' and will help our jawans in encounters with naxals and terrorists, he said. He accused previous governments of neglecting the armed forces and their needs. He also said the UPA government sat on the Rafale deal for years.
