US-India strategic interests 'broadly aligned, structural and deep', ties will continue to thrive: official

On Feb 14, a suicide bomber of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad group rammed his explosives-laden vehicle into a bus carrying CRPF personnel in Pulwama district, killing 40 of the soldiers.

Indian foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale's US trip ended on a successful note as a top US official termed the strategic interests between India and the United States are "broadly aligned, structural and deep" and said that the diplomatic ties between the two nations will continue to thrive. The three-day visit of Gokhale, which he started by meeting US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and concluded by calling on National Security Advisor John Bolton, demonstrated the "transformation of our strategic" relationship, the senior State Department official said Friday. The visit came amid simmering tensions between India and Pakistan following one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir in nearly three decades.
