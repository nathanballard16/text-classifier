Nadia Jamil urges South Asian countries to eliminate child abuse

Actress and philanthropist Nadia Jamil is deeply concerned about what is happening with children around the world.

She wants South Asian countries to focus on eliminating child abuse and sex trafficking.

Following the murder of three minor boys in Punjab’s Kasur district on Tuesday who were sexually assaulted, Nadia Jamil said this scourge needs serious planning to eliminate.

Taking to Twitter, she requested Prime Minister Imran Khan to take action. “I’ve worked in Kasur and all over Punjab with children who have been sexually abused for over 20 years. I have buried babies less than six months old sodomised to death,” she wrote highlighting how vulnerable children are in the country.

The activist known for raising voice for different issues said that laws are just not enough but we need to “Put strategies in place that have every child in our nation on our database; watched by a trusted system, with checks and balances.”

Jamil shared a child rape case from India and said the region must take necessary steps to protect its children. “It’s NOT just Pakistan. Sadly it is a regional issue. We need to take care of our kids. All of them matter.”

On the work front, her upcoming drama ‘Damsa’ will shed light on child protection.
