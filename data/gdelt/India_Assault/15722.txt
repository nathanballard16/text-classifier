Main Bhi Ardhangini’s Ankit Raaj suffers injury on the sets

MUMBAI: The television show Main Bhi Ardhangini has made an audience for itself. It stars Ankit Raaj in the role of Adhiraj and Heena Parmar as Mohini. Recently, an incident happened on the sets of the show. While rehearsing a scene, Ankit got injured.



He was taken to a private hospital in Jaipur after the actor injured himself during the shoot on Tuesday midnight. Ankit and Heena were rehearsing for a romantic scene when one of the focus lights fell on Ankit’s leg.



Speaking about the same, the actor told TNN, “We were so engrossed in the rehearsals that we didn’t pay heed to anything around us. One of the focus lights fell on one of my legs. I was taken to a nearby hospital and got two stitches below the knee. This happened on Tuesday midnight and on Wednesday morning, we had to shoot for a water sequence. However, the doctors advised me to stay away from the water because of the stitches. But since the episode has to go on air on Thursday, I covered my wound with a plastic wrap and shot for the sequence.”



We wish Ankit speedy recovery!
