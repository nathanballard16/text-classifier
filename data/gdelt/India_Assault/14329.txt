Delhi court grants 2-day transit remand of Mokama MLA Anant Singh to Bihar Police

A Delhi court on Saturday granted two-day transit remand of independent MLA Anant Singh to Bihar Police in connection with the case of recovery of an AK-47 rifle from his home in Patna.

The 'baahubali' Mokama MLA had appeared in a Delhi court and moved his surrender application on Friday. He had been absconding for a week after an FIR was lodged against him under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), following a raid at his residence in which an AK-47 and over a dozen rounds of live ammunition were recovered.

Before surrendering, he had shared a video stating that he would surrender before the court and not before Bihar Police.

"I won't surrender before the police. I will surrender before the court. I trust the judiciary and will appear before the court but not the police," Singh said in the video.

After his surrender on Friday, he was sent to judicial custody for the night.

In a raid at Mokama MLA's residence on August 16, Bihar police had recovered an AK-47 rifle among other items.

Singh is an independent MLA from Mokama Assembly segment in Patna district. A gangster-turned-politician, he was earlier in the JD(U) but contested the 2015 assembly election as an independent. He got his wife to contest on a Congress ticket from Munger Lok Sabha constituency in recently-held general elections.

He was believed to be close to Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar but quit the party ahead of 2015 Assembly polls after he was arrested in a case of kidnapping and extortion.

He made his electoral debut in 2005 and won the Mokama seat against another gangster-turned-politician Suraj Bhan Singh.
