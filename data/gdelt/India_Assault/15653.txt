Mumbai: 5 cops booked for hitting helmet-less biker

On Tuesday, nine months after the incident, the Amboli police registered a case against five police officers for beating up a man.



On December 14, 2018, Andheri-resident Sameer Shaikh was riding his bike without a helmet at SV Road at around 10 am. The cops nabbed him at a nakabandi, and though he offered to pay the fine, the police officers took him to the nearest police chowky and allegedly beat him up so badly that his nose broke and his genitals were injured. The FIR names Police Inspector Gajanan Sargar, Police sub-inspector Sontakke and Constables Sarad Sanap, Kodvilkar and Sangita Kamble as those responsible.



He took the matter to court, and the cops also filed a charge sheet against Under Section 353 of the Indian Penal Code for using criminal force to deter a public servant from discharging his duty. However, Shaikh was granted pre-arrest bail by the magistrate's court.



In the High Court, Shaikh submitted the medical report, which proved that he had suffered serious injuries due to the police assault. A joint bench of Justices Ranjan More and N J Jamadar passed the order that pushed the police to book their brothers (and sister)-in-uniform.



"We have registered an FIR under sections related to hitting a person and causing grievous injury," said Police inspector Radheshyam Sharma of Amboli Police Station.
