New Delhi: The Defence Ministry, on Saturday, dismissed as “incorrect” reports of the abduction of an Army jawan by terrorists from his residence in central Kashmir’s Budgam district.

On Friday, reports emerged that Mohammad Yaseen Bhat, who is posted with the Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry (JAKLI) Regiment, was kidnapped by suspected terrorists from his residence at Qazipora Chadoora.

However, a spokesperson of the defence ministry, in a tweet, said that Bhat was safe and reports of his abduction were incorrect.

“Clarification. Media reports of the abduction of a serving Army soldier on leave from Qazipora, Chadoora, Budgam are incorrect. Individual is safe. Speculations may please be avoided,” the defence spokesperson tweeted.

Bhat's family members had, on Friday, told the Police that the Army jawan was taken towards a jungle area which is a few kilometres away from his home. Bhat was on leave from February 26 to March 31.

In June last year, Rifleman Aurangzeb was abducted from his home and killed by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district. His bullet-ridden body was found in the Gasu village of Pulwama. The 24-year-old, who hailed from Salani village in Poonch, had joined the Army in 2012.

In September 2018, three police personnel were abducted from their homes and killed in the state's Shopian district.
