Ishtiyaq Shaikh in jail: Man who got 26-year jail term abroad to spend rest in India

THE CASE

MUMBAI: The Union home ministry on Monday informed Bombay high court that it had rejected the plea of an accused, convicted in Mauritius for drug-related offences and serving his prison term in Thane Central jail , for early release. Ishtiyaq Shaikh, sentenced to 26 years’ imprisonment for possession of heroin, was transferred from a prison in Mauritius in 2017 to serve the remainder of his term in India.A division bench of Justices Bhushan Dharmadhikari and Revati Dhere was hearing Shaikh’s petition seeking pre-mature release, saying he had already served around 10 years in prison, the maximum he would have got under Indian laws for a similar offence. Union government counsel, Hiten Venegaonkar, said the home ministry had rejected Shaikh’s plea in December 2018. The court allowed Shaikh to challenge the government order.Shaikh, an Aurangabad resident, was arrested in 1996, on his first visit to Mauritius and charged with drug-trafficking. In 2014, a court in Mauritius sentenced him to 26 years. Following his sister’s application, he was transferred to India under Repatriation of Prisoners Act. The law provides for a prisoner who has committed a crime abroad to be repatriated to India to serve his prison term.Shaikh, in a fresh plea, said he was eligible for release once he serves 10 years, as that was the maximum term for the offence under India’s Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The home ministry said in an affidavit that as per an agreement between India and Mauritius, a convict who is transferred has to serve as far as possible the sentence he was given by the court in that country. The affidavit pointed out that Shaikh had committed a serious offence and “given the nature and gravity of his offence, he ought to serve the sentence imposed by the Mauritius court”. The government said the law was to take care of the human aspect and ensure a convict was near his family and relatives, and will have a better chance of social rehabilitation. “Transfer to one’s native country is not intended to subvert the judicial process and cannot be used as a tool to undergo a sentence much shorter than what he would have served in the country where he was sentenced,” the affidavit said.1996 | Aurangabad resident Ishtiyaque Shaikh arrested in Mauritius for drug-trafficking2014 | Supreme Court of Mauritius sentences Shaikh to 26 years in jail2017 | Shaikh is repatriated to India on a plea by him and he is lodged in Thane jail to serve the remainder of his prison term2017 | Shaikh’s sister files a plea urging that he should be released as the maximum term in India for the offence is 10 yearsDecember 2018 | Union government rejects the application
