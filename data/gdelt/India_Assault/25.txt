Gurugram, December 31

The Gurugram police today arrested five auto-rickshaw drivers hours after a 42-year-old Delhi widow alleged gangrape in the Manesar area. The incident occurred on December 29, but the victim approached the police this evening.

The police arrested Ankit, Deepak, Mahipal, Ajit and Sunnu after the woman approached the Manesar woman police station.

The victim, mother of two, told the police that she had gone to Manesar for financial settlement with her deceased husband’s company but was raped by five men after she hired an auto-rickshaw.

In her complaint to the police, the victim said: “My husband used to work for a company. I had come to Manesar to settle his account. I got down at Nakhrola Chowk, where auto-rickshaw driver Ankit agreed to take me to the company.

“A youth was already seated beside him. Realising that I was new to the area, they took me to a room in Bhangrola village where they called another youth. While two of them raped me, the third molested me.” The two later drove her back in the auto-rickshaw in the dark and allegedly handed her over to two other auto-rickshaw drivers at Rampura Morh.

They called another man and two of them allegedly raped her in the moving auto-rickshaw, while the third drove it around for an hour. The victim was allegedly dumped by the roadside in a semi-conscious state.

The police later got her medically examined at a hospital and booked the five for abduction, illegal confinement and gangrape.
