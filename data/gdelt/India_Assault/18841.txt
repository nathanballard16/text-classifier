Indians gripped by political drama in Maharashtra state

The western state of Maharashtra, India's richest, usually grabs the headlines because it is home to the country's financial capital, Mumbai, as well as its movie-making machine, Bollywood.

Since last Saturday, Indians have been glued to their television sets watching a power struggle for control of the state between Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and an alliance of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), the Congress and the Shiv Sena.

Political developments have been akin to a soap opera, with breathtaking twists and turns including a nephew backstabbing an uncle in the tight-knit, family-run NCP, alliances between former rivals, weekend shenanigans leading to the swearing-in of BJP's Devendra Fadnavis as chief minister and legislators seemingly hopping between rival parties by the hour.

Yesterday, the dramatic developments continued with Mr Fadnavis resigning as chief minister, saying he did not have the numbers to actually form a government.

"The BJP will work as an effective opposition," he said.

Mr Fadnavis' decision came after the Supreme Court on Monday stepped in following a petition filed by the opposition alliance.

It ordered a floor test in the legislature so that Mr Fadnavis could prove his majority. The court said the vote was necessary to bring an end to the political twists to "uphold democratic values and constitutional values".

Maharashtra is an important political prize. Those who rule the state have a finger on the financial pulse of the country.

For now, the state has provided some sort of fillip for the opposition parties, which have suffered a series of political setbacks recently, including a landslide victory by the BJP in federal elections early this year.
