Biharsharif: In a horrific incident, two people were beaten to death by a mob on Wednesday after a local Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader was found murdered in Bihar's Nalanda district. The deceased included a 13-year-old boy.

On Tuesday night, unidentified assailants ambushed Indal Paswan - an office-bearer in RJD's SC/ST cell - and sprayed him with bullets while he was en route to his home after attending a function.

The incident took place at Maghanda Sarai village which falls under the Deep Nagar police station area of the district.

The family members of Paswan filed a complaint with the local police station when he did not return at night. As per PTI sources, the RJD leader’s bullet-riddled body was recovered in the fields during a search operation.

Sources added that a number of Paswan’s supporters began raising slogans, claiming that a local resident, named Chunni Lal, was behind Paswan’s murder.

The infuriated mob beat Chunni Lal at his residence and set his home ablaze. Later, they brutally thrashed two of Lal's associates - Ranjay Yadav and Santu Malakar.

As per sources, Santu Malakar died while being rushed to the Patna Medical College and Hospital while Ranjay Yadav succumbed to injuries at a local hospital.

Senior police officials, including Sub Division Police Officer (Sadar) Imran Parvez and Deputy SP (law and order) Sanjay Kumar, controlled the mob and dispersed the crowd from the site.
