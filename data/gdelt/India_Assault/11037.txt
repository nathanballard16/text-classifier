Hauz Qazi still tense after communal clashes; 3 held

Stone pelting continued despite police presence. Harsh Vardhan and a VHP delegation visited area



NEW DELHI Amid scattered stone pelting sparked by a communal rift, Hauz Qazi in Old Delhi remained tense on Tuesday, with police appealing to people to maintain calm. So far, three people have been arrested for rioting. Police officials are scanning CCTV to identify other culprits. Police said they were using drones to monitor the situation. Union Minister and Chandni Chowk MP Harsh Vardhan visited the area on Tuesday.



People from both the communities continued pelting stones at each other on Tuesday morning despite the deployment of police and paramilitary personnel, some residents said. “The situation is not normal. People get agitated at the drop of a hat and start hitting each other. The slogans raised by both sides are communal and demeaning,” said a resident.



A fight over parking a scooter late Sunday night took a communal turn and a temple was vandalised in the locality.



A delegation led by VHP’s Delhi unit working president Alok Kumar Tuesday met Police Commissioner Amulaya Patnaik on Tuesday and demanded the arrest of those involved in vandalising a temple. Alok Kumar, a member of the VHP delegation, said: “We have given four days’ time to the police to arrest the people who vandalised the temple, failing which the VHP will be free to take the matter in its own hands. We have told the Police Commissioner that when the fight was over the parking of a scooty, then why did they vandalise the temple. This is a conspiracy to create communal tension in the area,” he said.
