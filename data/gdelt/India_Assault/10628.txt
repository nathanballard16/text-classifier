Look out circular issued against Binoy Kodiyeri

Mumbai: The Mumbai police issued a look out circular against Binoy Kodiyeri in the alleged rape case filed against him by a Bihar woman. The look out notice comes at a time when the Dindoshi branch of Bombay City Civil and Sessions Court is scheduled to hear Binoy Kodiyeri’s anticipatory bail plea on Thursday. Police issued the notice only to prevent Binoy from leaving the country.

Though the police team from Mumbai reached Kerala to nab Binoy in connection with the rape charges, they are yet to trace him. Binoy went underground ever since the case was registered against him after the woman filed a complaint.

A Bihar woman filed a rape complaint against Binoy, the eldest son of Kodiyeri alleging Binoy raped her for years on the promise of marrying her and that she has an eight-year-old child born out of the relationship. The police have booked Binoy under IPC Sections 376 (rape) and Section 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property on the complaint).
