Washington, March 12

Pakistan has assured the US it will deal “firmly” with all terrorists operating from the country and take steps to de-escalate tensions with India, according to National Security Adviser John Bolton.

Such an assurance was given by Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi during a phone call on Monday, Bolton said in a tweet on a day when Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale called on US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo here.

“The FM (Qureshi) assured me Pakistan would deal firmly with all terrorists and will continue steps to de-escalate tensions with India,” he tweeted.

Tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammad killed 40 CRPF personnel in Pulwama on February 14.

In Islamabad, Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the purpose of Qureshi’s call was to provide Bolton Pakistan’s perspective on the “recent regional developments.” Qureshi said that Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan decided to hand over the Indian pilot as a gesture of goodwill towards India. Pakistan wished peace and stability in the region, he was quoted as telling the US National Security Adviser. — PTI
