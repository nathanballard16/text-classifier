Many parts of India are burning and the rest are on the edge as protests against new Citizenship Act spread

Jamia Millia Islamia, one of the most prestigious public universities in India, turned into a war zone after a protest against the CAA triggered clashes between Delhi police and students.



Protestors reportedly torched DMRC buses and threw stones at the police and damaged public property. The other side claims that police entered the university without permission, assaulted students and used tear gas.

There are no confirmed deaths yet. However, hundreds of students are reportedly injured. As many as 28 Jamia students were detained. This isn’t the only horrifying protest in Delhi, as a similar scene played out in Aligarh Muslim University on the same day.
