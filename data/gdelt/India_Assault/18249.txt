Woman strangled in hotel room

A 33-year-old woman was strangled to death, allegedly by a 21-year-old man, at an OYO hotel room in North Delhi’s Alipur after she asked him to marry her, said police.

Police said the woman lived with her husband and two children at Khera Kalan village, and had been in touch with the accused for about two years.

“She had checked into the hotel with him on Monday to celebrate his birthday. While they were consuming alcohol, an argument ensued. He allegedly assaulted her and she lost consciousness,” an officer said.

Police said he allegedly strangled her and fled the hotel, leaving her body in the room. “With the help of CCTV footage, police found the accused,” an officer said. He told police he met the woman online two years ago, and that he was unwilling to marry her.

An OYO spokesperson said: “Since the matter is under investigation, we are cooperating with the authorities and providing all possible support.”
