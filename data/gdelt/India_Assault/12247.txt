Pakistan Summons Indian Envoy Over Alleged Kashmir Ceasefire Violations

The Pakistan Foreign Ministry has summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia and condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by the Indian Army along the Line of Control (LoC) on 22 and 23 July 2019.

The foreign ministry has claimed that in the last two days two civilians were killed while four others were injured in the firing.

"The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation", the ministry said in a statement.
