‘Head constable threatened minor rape survivor’s family’

MYSURU: A day after the horrific tales of a 15-year-old rape survivor came to light, it has been revealed that a head constable , a friend of the moneylender who took the girl hostage, had threatened her family and also used abusive language against them.The head constable’s threat has shocked the family, the latter told the investigators as well as counsellers.According to sources, prime accused Padhma had taken the girl hostage on January 7. She was a friend of the head constable. The girl was subsequently raped by at least five men over a period of five months. The policeman also knew about the entire episode of money-lending to the girl’s mother and then the girl being taken hostage by Padhma. Police have named five persons– four men, accusing them of rape, and one woman for procuring a minor girl and then misusing her. The head constable, however, is yet to be named in the FIR.So far, the police have arrested two persons and a search is on for the others. Deputy commissioner of police (law and order) M Muthuraju said the role of the head constable is being probed. Though there is no allegation against him in the rape incident, the cop is suspected to have some connection with money-lending, he said.Meanwhile, the child welfare committee, a quasi-judicial body, on Friday extended support to the family of the minor rape survivor by providing her family a temporary accommodation.CWC chairperson Kamala HT said the girl’s family—parents and grandfather—requested them for a temporary shelter claiming they’re feeling threatened after the incident. The family stayed in a town away from Mysuru city but now has been shifted to a recognized child care and protection centre in Mysuru.“Since the minor girl didn’t want to live separately from parents and there was no facility to keep the family together at a government centre, we have ensured them protection at a recognised centre,” Kamala said.The district child protection officer on Friday extended an assistance of Rs 5,000 to the family towards temporary expenses as the family’s financial condition is poor.
