Pune: Police have arrested an administration staff member of a residential school for disabled children in Maharashtra's Pune city for allegedly raping a 14-year-old girl. The accused, a 58-year-old was taken into custody by police after the girl's parents registered an official complaint with the Kothrud police station.

The matter came to light when the minor girl returned home and refused to go back to the residential school complaining of sexual assault. According to a report by Hindustan Times, the girl had been studying at the school for the last four years while the staff member joined just a few months ago.

A case has been registered against the accused under relevant sub-sections of section 376 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Based on the case, police arrested the accused from his residence in Katraj area in the wee hours of Thursday. He was produced before a local court and remanded to police custody.

Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), zone-III, Mangesh Shinde and senior police inspector Pratibha Joshi are overlooking the investigation. The accused and the minor girl will be taken for a medical examination at the Sassoon General Hospital in the coming days.

However, the director of the 25-year-old three-storeyed residential school for disabled children claimed that the minor girl is a "habitual liar". He also said that the school is equipped with 18 CCTV cameras which can be checked to confirm signs of any wrongdoing in this regard.
