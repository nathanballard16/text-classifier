Man strangles wife over suspected illicit affair

Ludhiana: Suspecting her of having illicit relations, a man allegedly strangulated his wife to death at their house in Basant Avenue on Thursday night.

Pawan Kumar, 30, had tied the knot with Aarti, 28, seven years ago. The couple was issueless.

“Pawan suspected Aarti of having an extra-marital affair. They often wrangled as their relationship turned sour. They had words on Thursday night, too, after which Pawan strangulated Aarti to death. After committing the crime, he fled from the spot,” said Basant Avenue police post in-charge ASI Gurbakhshish Singh.

The murder came to light on Friday morning when neighbours found their house door open and Aarti lying dead on floor. On being informed, police reached the spot.

“They lived on the first floor of their employer’s house. The employer is a property dealer, who lives in Assam. Pawan is the caretaker of his house,” said a cop.

The body has been sent to civil hospital for the post-mortem and the woman’s parents informed, the ASI added.
