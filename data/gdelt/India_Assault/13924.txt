Barbaric Hindutva

HINDUTVA is an ultra-extremist ideology whose radical leitmotif is to wipe out the Muslims in particular and non-Hindus of India in general. Establishing a uni-national identity — Hinduism — in India is its main agenda.

Also, stripping Muslims of Indian citizenship, mob lynching, rapes, mass murders and genocide of the Kashmiri people are all its tactics to achieve its sinister objectives.

Brainwashed by this rabid ideology, its adherents like Modi have become brutal beasts in India who have been preying on innocent lives unhindered. The so-called Indian secularism and the world’s largest democracy have now dwarfed before this barbarism.

The recent expansionist and unilateral move by the Modi government about Kashmir has laid bare its ugly face. The day is not far off when this ideology will boomerang and meet its nemesis in a befitting manner.
