4 of 5 hostages return from Ethiopia

NEW DELHI: IL&FS Transportation Network Limited ( ITNL ), a part of the beleaguered IL&FS Group, on Monday said four of its employees who were held hostage for three months by workers in Ethiopia have returned home.The firm managed to “secure” their safe return after paying severance pay of four months to workers who were involved with road projects being executed by ITNL, through its subsidiary Elsamex SA. But at least one employee, Chandra Sekhar, is still in Ethiopia as the authorities have barred him from leaving the country till IL&FS clears statutory dues.The employee is currently out on bail with no certainty on when the group will clear the dues, enabling his return to India. Since mid-2018, under instructions of ITNL, several Indian employees working in its project companies had returned to India. Seven employees were held hostage by unpaid local workers in November with three of them managing to return home between December 2018 and January 2019.The Indian employees have also not received salaries for six to seven months and there is no clarity on when and how much IL&FS will actually pay them. “The company thanks all the agencies including the MEA... for their efforts towards facilitating the safe return of its employees,” IL&FS said on Monday.
