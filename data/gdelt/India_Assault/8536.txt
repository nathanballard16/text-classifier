Kashmir rights groups seek UN probe into hundreds of cases of torture by Indian Army

Human rights groups have called for a UN investigation into the more than 400 cases of torture allegedly carried out by the Indian Army in Jammu and Kashmir since 1990.

A report published by the Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons (APDP) and the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS) said at least 40 people out of 432 case studies documented died “as a result of injuries received during torture.”

APDP and JKCCS said detainees described being raped, sodomized, waterboarded and electrocuted by the Indian authorities.

In total, they claim tens of thousands of Kashmiri citizens have been tortured over the past three decades.

Conflict between India and Pakistan has regularly erupted in the autonomous state since Partition in 1947.

Increasingly, militants supporting self-sovereignty and Islamic fundamentalists have also clashed with the Indian Army.

However, the 560-page report titled “Torture: Indian State’s Instrument of Control in Indian Administered Jammu and Kashmir,” found that 70 per cent of those subjected to torture were in fact civilians, and this number included political and human rights activists, as well as children.

For example, Muzaffer Ahmed Mirza and Manzoor Ahmad Naikoo from Tral were both subjected to horrifying abuse, leading to the rupture of their internal organs. Zubair Ahmad Turray, a 13-year-old boy from Shopian, was forced to sit on a burning heater and beaten so badly he was unable to move his arms.
