Nalini Sriharan, Rajiv Gandhi assassination convict, released on 30-day parole

Nalini Sriharan, serving life term in Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, was released on parole from Vellore central prison, Tamil Nadu. Nalini Sriharan has been granted parole for 30 days. She has been in prison since 28 years and it is for the first time when she was able to see the world outside prison.

Court had granted her parole on July 5 when Nalini argued for parole in the front of the bench. It is important to know that Nalini is the longest-serving woman convict in the country.

Court’s decision

The Madras High Court granted her month-long parole to attend her daughter’s wedding. The Court said that the state government will bear the escort expenses for Nalini. In the 28 years of her imprisonment, Nalini had been given just one day parole at the time when she attended the last rites of her father. Nalini will remain in Vellore town only which is around 140 kilometres away from Chennai. She will stay here for a month with her daughter Harithra Sriharan, mother Padmavati, sister Kalyani and brother Bhagyanathan, among other relatives. Nalini had given birth to Harithra in prison.

Arrest of Nalini

Nalini was arrested in 1991 in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case. She was sentenced to death by a TADA court and the Supreme Court. The death penalty, however, was commuted to life imprisonment by the Tamil Nadu government in 2000. Besides Nalini, her husband Murugan, AG Perarivalan, Santhan, Jayakumar, Robert Payas and Ravichandran are serving life term in the case.
