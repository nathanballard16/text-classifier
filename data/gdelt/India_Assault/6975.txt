Sri Lanka still faces possible terror attacks, authorities now focussing on 'sleepers': PM Ranil Wickremesinghe

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka still faced more attacks and authorities were now targeting "sleepers" — terrorists who could activate to initiate another round of bombings, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe warned on Thursday.Facing public criticism for not acting against Islamist extremist groups in the island nation, Wickremesinghe said some of the suspected attackers responsible for the Easter Sunday bombings were being monitored by the country's intelligence services.But authorities did not have "sufficient" evidence to place the suspected attackers in custody prior to the attacks, he said.Authorities have accused the little-known National Thawheed Jamaat(NTJ) of carrying out the devastating blasts that tore through three Catholic churches and three luxury hotels on the Easter Sunday, killing over 350 people, including 11 Indians and injuring nearly 500 others.After the country's worst terror attacks, the prime minister has acknowledged that he was not privy to prior intelligence inputs about possible terror attacks in the country.Wickremesinghe told CNN that he did not rule out the possibility of more attacks in the country.He said authorities were now focussing on "sleepers" — terrorists who could activate to initiate another round of attacks."Police and security forces are rounding up those involved, but they're also rounding up the sleepers, those used on second and third rounds (of attacks)," he said."The danger has come down drastically, (but) we do have to pick up some more sleepers, which we will do in the next few days."He said that security services were acting out of an abundance of caution, and that should even one militant slip through the net, the damage could be widespread."It is a precaution that we are taking, we want to be sure we have everyone in," Wickremesinghe said."They are worried that one or two could get into a church — (even) one person can do a lot of damage."The Archdiocese of Colombo Thursday suspended all Catholic church services because of security concerns.The prime minister reiterated that the attackers were middle- and upper-middle class and had been educated abroad. He added that the profile of the suspected bombers was "surprising."A prominent spice trader and father of two suicide bombers, Mohamed Yusuf Ibrahim, is in custody on suspicion of aiding and abetting suspects, Sri Lankan police spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera said.Ibrahim is the founder of Colombo-based Ishana Exports, one of the country's largest exporter of spices.Ilham Ahmed Ibrahim — one of the two sons of Ibrahim, who blew himself up in Sunday's attacks — detonated a device at the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo.Ilham Ahmed Ibrahim and his brother Imsath Ahmed Ibrahim were previously identified as two of the suicide bombers in Sunday's attacks, which left at least 359 people dead across the country.
