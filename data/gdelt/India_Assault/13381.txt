WATCH: US woman infuriated over bail granted to rape convict in India

A US woman, who was sexually assaulted by an Indian politician's nephew in New Delhi back in 2013, has now come out against the “corrupt" Indian legal system for granting him bail and claiming that the country does not support women who go through the tragic ordeal.The victim posted a video on social media, in which she said she had found out that her attacker had been granted bail.She said she had gone all the way to India to testify in the case but now the culprit was awarded bail by a “corrupt judge”.In the video, shot in front of the Indian Consulate in San Francisco, the woman said she would now file a fresh plea against the decision in the high court.She had come to the Indian consulate to get the papers notorised to appeal in the higher courts of the country.The victim also criticised the “corrupt Indian bureaucracy” as the consulate allegedly told her to get the papers notorised from the Indian consulate in Sacramento, California.She claimed that New Delhi does not support rape victims and sought help to ensure that justice was served.The Consulate General of India, San Francisco, responded to her in the Facebook video itself and clarified that all the attestations were provided on the same day.“Our deepest sympathies and our support are with you. As you know, all attestations were provided on the same day [Tuesday] after you spoke to the Consulate officials and we waived the requirements of the Hague Convention that requires apostilling of legal documents.We hope that you obtain the justice you seek and deserve at the earliest,” the consulate's response read.Back in 2013, Rajeev Panwar, the nephew of former Delhi mayor Jayshree Panwar, was arrested for the crime committed at his flat, which he would rent out to foreigners.According to the complaint, Panwar broke into the victim's room and 'sexually assaulted' her while she was asleep.Panwar was found guilty of the US national's rape and sentenced to seven years behind bars by a Delhi court in February.https://twitter.com/santoshspeed/status/1157433384815099905This article originally appeared on The Week
