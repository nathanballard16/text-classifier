Factory worker held for raping woman

Ludhiana: The police on Tuesday arrested a factory worker for raping a woman on the pretext of marriage.

The 22-year-old woman said in her police complaint, “The accused, who lives near my house, raped me for over six months on the promise of marriage. After he refused to tie the knot with me, my parents fixed my marriage with a Ludhiana resident. But the accused went to my would-be in-laws house to defame me.”

After her marriage was called off, the accused, 29, visited her again and threatened to attack her with acid. “He would often beat me up and force me to have relations with him. Around 11pm on Tuesday, he barged into my house. As I raised the alarm, he tried to escape but neighbours caught hold of him,” she added.

On being informed, police reached the spot and arrested the accused.

Investigating officer assistant sub-inspector Satinder Singh said a case has been registered under sections 376 (rape), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 341 (punishment for wrongful restrain) of the IPC.
