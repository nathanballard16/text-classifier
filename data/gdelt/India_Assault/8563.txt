New Delhi: The Indian Army jawan on the Line of Control (LoC), constantly threatened by Pakistani sharpshooters, will now fight fire with fire. A proposal for the purchase of nearly 12,000 telescopic sights for new assault rifles is likely to be cleared by a high-level committee very shortly.

These telescopic sights will be fitted onto the new generation Sig Sauer assault rifles that India wants. A contract for 72,000 rifles have already been signed and the delivery is likely within a year. These 7.62 x 51mm sights will cost about Rs 170 crore.

The purchase of the sights comes in the wake of reports of Pakistani jihadis being given sniper training. The new rifles and the telescopic sights are expected to be an effective counter. Besides the sights, 50 Field Artillery tractors are also likely to be bought, to add to the 100 already acquired and also, for the Indian Air Force (IAF) crypto modules for its Software Design Radios.
