National media ignoring rural issues: HC

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday observed that the national media was not giving equal importance to rural and urban issues.

A Division Bench of Justices N. Kirubakaran and S.S. Sundar, which was hearing a public interest litigation petition that sought a direction to provide adequate relief to Cyclone Gaja-affected people, said the coverage given to Chennai floods was not given to Cyclone Gaja that left the delta region devastated.

Similarly, the court said, the Pollachi sex scandal case was largely ignored by the national media in contrast to Nirbhaya sexual assault case that brought people to the streets in Delhi.

The court was hearing the petition filed by S.R. Sambasivam of Thanjavur who sought adequate compensation for the loss incurred by farmers due to Cyclone Gaja. The court sought a report on the compensation granted by the State so far and adjourned hearing in the case.
