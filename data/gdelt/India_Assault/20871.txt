BHU teachers, staff take out protest march

VARANASI: Agitated over alleged attack on Dalit assistant professor Shanti Lal Salvi by the students of Sanskrit Vidya Dharm Vigyan (SVDV) faculty, teaching and non-teaching staff belonging to SC/ST and OBC communities took out a protest march from BHU gate to Lanka police station on Wednesday.They demanded strict action against the accused to discourage targeting of Dalits on the campus.On reaching Lanka police station, the protestors submitted a memorandum to circle officer, Bhelupur, Sudhir Jaiswal, who is also the investigating officer in the case.The protestors, including Mahesh Prasad Ahirwar, Sujata Gautam, Sarvesh Kumar, Sushila Bharat and Manoj Verma alleged that some anti-social elements were also present among SVDV students who were protesting against the appointment of Prof Firoz Khan.Alleging involvement of some senior professors in the attack on Salvi, they said due to the incident, Dalit and OBC teaching and non-teaching staff members were living in fear.They claimed that inaction in past incidents of attack on Dalit teacher Manoj Verma and students Shashikant Sonekar and Chandan Sagar has emboldened anti-social elements.After the protestors returned to the campus, a police team led by circle officer reached SVDV faculty and met Salvi.On December 9, Salvi had lodged an FIR through university’s proctorial board against acting dean of SVDV faculty Prof Kaushalendra Pandey, protestors Munish Kumar Mishra, Shubham Tiwari and six unidentified persons under sections 147 (rioting), 504 (intentional insult and provocation), 352 (assault) of IPC and relevant sections of the SC/ST Act.Vice-chancellor Prof Rakesh Bhatnagar strongly condemned the incident and assured that a committee would be formed to investigate the matter.
