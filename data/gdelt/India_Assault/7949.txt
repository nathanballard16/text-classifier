Mayawati: EC failed to act on leaders defaming women

Lucknow: Continuing bitter criticism of the Congress party, BSP supremo Mayawati on Saturday alleged that the party’s government in Rajasthan attempted to suppress the case of gang-rape with a Dalit woman in Alwar till elections in the state. The former Uttar Pradesh chief minister also lashed out at the election commission stating that they are not taking appropriate action against politicians using derogatory language against women.

“The election commission is not taking appropriate and strict action against the big and small leaders of some political parties, who are using filthy, derogatory and abusive language against women,” the BSP chief said.

She added that the Supreme Court should take suo-moto cognizance of such matters and give strict punishment to leaders who cross the limit so as to set an example for the future.

Accusing the Rajasthan government of suppressing the gang rape of Dalit girl for political gains, she said, “The Congress government suppressed the matter of gang rape for their politics. They didn’t let it come to fore till elections were over and even threatened the victim’s family. Our party had to struggle given the very little action Congress government took in the case.”

The BSP leader said her party believes the victim will not get justice under the Congress regime and demanded a SC inquiry along with a death penalty for culprits.

“The Supreme Court should take suo-moto cognizance and hear it in a fast track manner. All accused should be given death penalty and state government, police, and administration should also be held accountable for the delay and given strict punishment,” Ms Mayawati said.

A woman was allegedly gang-raped by five men while her husband was beaten up in Thanagaji area of Alwar district in Rajasthan on April 26. A video footage was also shot by an alleged accused.
