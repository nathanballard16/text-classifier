World News: India imposes curfew in Kashmir after clashes during religious procession

SRINAGAR (REUTERS): India on Sunday imposed curfew in several parts of the Indian-administered Kashmir, after clashes between security forces and Muslims taking part in a procession, officials and eyewitnesses said.

At least 12 locals and six troops were injured on Saturday evening, officials told Reuters, as the worshippers on the traditional mourning procession of Muharram clashed with troops trying to stop it.

Troops used tear gas and pellet guns on the crowd, which insisted on carrying on with the procession, and pelted stones at security forces, an Indian official who declined to named told Reuters.

"The clashes continued till late night during which the troops fired tear gas and pellets," he added.

A spokeswoman for India's interior ministry did not respond to a request for comment.

"Reasonable restrictions are necessary for peace and protection of life," India's national security adviser had said on Saturday.

The most recent clashes occurred in Rainawari and Badgam, two muslim majority areas of Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir's main city.

The five km procession route that passes through the city centre has been barricaded by armed troops wearing helmets and bulletproof vests.

On Sunday, police vans fitted with loudspeakers announced curfew-like restrictions in Srinagar's city centre Lal Chowk and adjacent areas, according to two Reuters witnesses.

"People are advised to stay indoors and not venture out of their home," the police announced.

Suhail Ahmed, a Rainawari resident, said that there have been frequent clashes in the area for last three to four days as troops have been trying to block the procession.

"We hear deafening sounds of tear gas being fired for last few evenings. We mostly stay indoors but the gas comes into our homes making it difficult to sleep," Ahmed said.
