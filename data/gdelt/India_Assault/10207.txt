Dowry death: Husband and in-laws jailed for 10 years

GREATER NOIDA: A man, his father and brother were sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing his wife over dowry in 2013. The case was filed by Mahesh Prasad, a resident of Ghaziabad and father of the deceased woman, on February 3, 2013.His daughter Kavita was married to Vivek Kumar, a private firm employee, in 2011 and she had been staying at her in-laws’ house in Salarpur village in Noida.Rohtash Sharma, the government counsel, told TOI that the complainant had alleged that his daughter’s in-laws would often torture her for not bringing enough dowry.“A day before her death, the woman had her called her father to inform that her phone had been taken away by her husband and that the in-laws had been beating her over Rs 60,000 that they wanted as an extended dowry,” said Sharma.The lawyer said Kavita’s in-laws informed them the next day that his daughter had committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling.There were, however, no injury marks on her body, he pointed out.Sharma added that sessions court judge Ved Prakash Sharma relied on circumstantial evidence and testimonies to give his verdict.“The court sentenced the husband Vivek, the woman’s father-in-law Vijay Kumar and brother-in-law Manish to 10 years’ imprisonment. They were sentenced under sections 304 B (death of a woman is caused by any burns or bodily injury or occurs otherwise than under normal circumstances within seven years of her marriage) and 498A (dowry death) of IPC ,” said Sharma. In his complaint, Prasad had also accused Kavita’s mother-in-law of torture but the charges against her were abetted after she died a natural death on October 10, 2016. The government counsel said the defence lawyer failed to produce any evidence to counter the allegations against his clients.“They failed to produce any solid proof other than a few witnesses who denied the dowry part to counter the allegations. The defence lawyer, in his argument, said the deceased woman had been suffering from tuberculosis, and committed suicide due to depression,” said the lawyer.
