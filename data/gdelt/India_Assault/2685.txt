Kulbhushan Jadhav Case: India slams Pakistan at UN

New Delhi : India on Monday told the United Nation court that Kulbhushan Jadhav was sentenced to death after a farcical trial by a Pakistani court; barring consular access to India, the Pakistan has breached Vienna Convention.

Advocate Harish Salve, representing India at the international court of justice, said Pakistan has no substantive defence in the case and it hasn’t even divulged fundamental details of the so-called offence.

In April 2017, a Pakistani military court had sentenced Kulnhushan Jadhav to death on charges of spying and terrorism. While, Pakistan claims that he was arrested from its restive province Baluchistan in March 2016, India says he was abducted from Irna, where Kulbhushan had gone on a business trip.

India is likely to ask the UN court to direct Pakistan and revoke his death sentence.

Salve said since March 30, 2016, India sent 13 reminders for consular access to Jadhav on various dates but received no positive response from Pakistan.

He told the court that Pakistan also didn’t share any details of the investigation and the alleged “confession” was obtained from Jadhav even before registering an FIR.
