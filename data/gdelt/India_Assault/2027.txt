Bengaluru: Karnataka Assembly Speaker Ramesh Kumar, on Wednesday, apologised for his 'feel like a rape victim' remarks. Blaming the media for adding 'masala' to the statement, Kumar apologised for the comments. Expunging the remarks from the House, Kumar sought pardon from them. "It's all media which hyped this issue. If my comments have hurt you (MLAs), I apologise for it," he was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

"I'm directing my office to expunge all the comments made circumstantially from the records. I am clarifying that I had no intention to cause any pain to any woman from the Chair....if anyone has felt so, kindly pardon me...all of you are like mothers and sisters. I have always respected you and continue to do so," Kumar said.

"Yesterday, during the proceeding circumstantially I had spoken about the situation of a rape victim and even more insult the victim has to undergo during inquiry and reason why laws made are getting destroyed... "As I made this statement a few of them (MLAs) laughed and few in the media have termed it as causing disgrace to women. For the last two days they (media) had not got any masala, they too have to lead life right, so they are doing this," he said," he further added.

On Monday, during a discussion on an SIT probe into a purported audio clip involving BJP chief BS Yeddyurappa and a JD(S) MLA, Kumar had referred to the conversation and said that his "situation was like that of a rape victim, as they too are supposedly questioned about the incident repeatedly."
