Headmaster rapes 8-year-old student in Hyderabad

Hyderabad: A 42-year-old headmaster of an upper primary school in Krishna district, approximately 275 kilometres here, was arrested Thursday for allegedly raping a class two student. The incident with the eight-year-old minor happened Tuesday, but fearing repercussions, the family of the girl initially was hesitant to lodge a police complaint.

According to reports in a couple of websites, the headmaster took the girl to an empty room of the school and allegedly raped her and threatened her with dire consequences if she narrated the incident to anyone. Traumatised and bleeding, the girl then went home and narrated her ordeal to her parents. Sources also said that she needed four stitches to stop the bleeding. When her mother took her to a private hospital doctors informed that the girl had been sexually assaulted.

Initially the mother did not register a complaint with the police. However, some social activists came to know about the incident, Thursday and persuaded her to lodge a police complaint. It was then the police arrested the headmaster.

District education officer MV Rajya Lakshmi informed Friday that the accused has been suspended with immediate effect. She added that an inquiry has been ordered.
