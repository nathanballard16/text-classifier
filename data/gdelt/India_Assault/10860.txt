Jalan Buroh fire: Worker's family arrive in Singapore for funeral rites

SINGAPORE - The wife and child of a Chinese worker who died in a massive fire in Jurong have arrived in Singapore to collect his remains and perform funeral rites, the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) said in a Facebook post on Saturday (June 29).

The fire broke out on June 21 at a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) facility at 43 Jalan Buroh. Mr Wei Xiaoyong was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic. He was 43, police said.

MWC said Summit Gas Systems, a subsidiary of Union Energy Corporation which occupied the facility, was able to expedite travel arrangements for Mr Wei's family.

They flew in to Singapore on Thursday and collected Mr Wei's remains on Saturday morning.

The funeral rites and cremation were scheduled on Saturday.

MWC added that Mr Wei's wife would receive a cash token of condolence from the company before she returns to China and said that "this amount will be more than adequate to help the loved ones tide through till the work injury compensation is paid out".

MWC is working with the company, the Chinese embassy and the Ministry of Manpower to settle Mr Wei's compensation payments.
