A constable of the UT police was stabbed thrice in her back by her husband, a sepoy in the Army, near the Kishangarh roundabout here today. The accused, who used a stolen scooter to commit the crime, has been arrested in a case of attempt to murder.

The victim, identified as Bhupinder Kaur (25) of Kishangarh, who is posted at the Traffic Lines in Sector 29, was heading towards her workplace on an Activa when her husband Samsher Singh (21) stopped her and stabbed her following heated arguments.

The police said they had received information regarding the incident near Dashmesh Nursery, Kishangarh, around 8.55 am.

The injured cop was rushed to the PGI. Her condition is said to be stable. The accused was caught by people and handed over to the police.

The police said the couple had a matrimonial dispute.
