Priyanka Gandhi Vadra slams UP government for going slow in Chinmayananda rape case

New Delhi: Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra attacked Friday the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh over the Chinmayanand case. She alleged that the Yogi Adityanath dispensation’s ‘antics’ have made it clear that it has ‘nothing to do with women’s security’.

BJP leader and former Union Minister Swami Chinmayanand has been accused of sexually exploiting a law student. He was interrogated close to seven hours late Thursday evening and has been placed under house arrest since then.

“The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh, through its antics, has made it clear that it has nothing to do with women’s security,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said in a tweet in Hindi. She asked why the UP police has adopted a ‘lax approach’” in dealing with the case.

“After all, why did the complainant girl had to come before the press to seek security? Why is the UP police going slow? Is it because the accused is from the BJP?” the Congress general secretary said.

Priyanka Gandhi also tagged a media report on why a rape case is not being registered by the UP police against the BJP leader.
