Congress MLA counters SAD dharna in Patiala, accuses Akalis of spreading lies

PATIALA: As the Shiromani Akali Dal leaders launched a frontal attack on the state government while accusing its MLAs of ‘oppressing’ the people, Congress legislator from Ghanour, Madan Lal Jalalpur went all out accusing the arch-rivals of spreading lies and misinformation.Madan Lal Jalapur, whom the SAD leaders accused of ‘misusing’ the police to get false cases registered against 42 individuals of Takhtumajra following clashes between the Akali and Congress supporters, said the case had been registered following police investigations and he was being falsely implicated for influencing the probe.Putting certain facts before the media during a presser, Madan Lal said “Around 20 people entered Kheri Gandian police station and attacked Congress sarpanch Harsanget Singh, 40, of Takhtumajra before assaulting him again inside the emergency ward of a hospital in Rajpura. The videos of same went viral and all saw what exactly happened inside the emergency ward when men armed with swords attacked the sarpanch,” the Congress legislator said.Jalalpur, who had gone vocal against the delay on part of the police in taking action against the accused persons during the district grievance redressal committee meeting chaired by Sadhu Singh Dharmasot last month, said, “If the police were taking orders from me, why would I have raised the issue in the meeting? No action was taken till I spoke up at the meeting,” he said.However, after the meeting, Kheri Gandhia SHO Sohan Singh was suspended and the individuals against whom the case had been registered went underground. In their absence, wife of one of the accused Ameer Singh died due to lack of medical attention. This escalated the matter with the SAD accusing the MLA of using the police to target the families of the accused persons.Madan Lal said the SAD for its own political interests was using this issue to target the home district of CM and attempts were being made to label it ‘ most notorious’. But the truth was far from what the Akalis were trying to project, he said maintaining that no Congress leader or workers had created any unfavourable circumstances in the said village.Jalalpur had landed in a controversy after a video of him suggesting that the police should arrest the family members, especially females, of the accused went viral on the social media. The Punjab State Women Commission also had taken note of the issue and ordered an inquiry, but he was later given a clean chit.Jalalpur said the SAD, which had lost its political base in the state was now trying to resurrect itself by fabricating ‘issues’ which otherwise are a part of the routine working of the police department.He also condemned the Akalis for associating his name with the illegal mining, drug and gambling business.
