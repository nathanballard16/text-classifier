Adityanath's information advisor blamed the WB CM Mamata Banerjee.

Mritunjay Kumar, Information Advisor to CM Yogi Adityanath told ANI: "Ye UP CM ki lokpriyata ka hi asar hai ki Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal CM) ne helicopter landing ka permission tak nahi diya."

Adityanath had two programs in Bengal today.

The BJP had earlier alleged that the TMC government in West Bengal tried to obstruct party president Amit Shah's rally in Jhargram amid reports that Shah's chopper was not allowed to land in the district. The government approved the chopper to land at a nearby helipad on January 23.



Earlier Banerjee had said on Adityanath’s comments: “They need not think about West Bengal, which is capable of looking after itself, it does not need anybody from outside. Ask Narendra Modi to look after New Delhi. Will Modi be able to win from Varanasi? Ask Yogi Adityanath to look after his own state (Uttar Pradesh)," she said.
