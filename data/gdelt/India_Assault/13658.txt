On August 11, 2019, a 15-year-old girl from Warangal, Telangana committed suicide after she was raped by two men.

The 2 men are the neighbors of the 15-year-old girl.

It is reported that the 2 brought the teen to a secluded area in their neighborhood and raped her there.

One day after the incident, the 15-year-old was found dead inside her room.

The two men have been arrested by the police.

Officer Raju said that the police have launched an investigation for the case and are currently trying to see if there was anyone else involved in raping the teen.

Earlier this week, a 13-year-old girl who was gang-raped in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh committed suicide after women in her neighborhood bullied her and after being upset with the fact that the police did not arrest the accused men.

The state government has suspended Station House Officer Satya Dev Sharma, Cooperganj police post-in-charge Umesh Kumar, Head Constable Urmed Singh and Constable Sanjiv Gautam for failing to do their duties.

The police also arrested the rapists and the women who bullied the girl.
