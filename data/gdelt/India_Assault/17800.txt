6 booked for gang-raping 42-yr-old

Ludhiana: Six persons have been booked for allegedly gang-raping a 42-year-old woman at knife point.

The alleged incident occurred in March and the woman lodged a complaint with the police in Bihar on August 4. She also sent a copy of the complaint to DGP Punjab, home minister Punjab, Ludhiana police and SC/ST Commission.

In her complaint, the woman claimed that four of the accused were her co-workers in a factory where she was employed with her husband.

In February last week, her husband went to his native place in Bihar and she was alone in the city. On March 31, she took half-day at factory. When she going back home, four of her co-workers and two others intercepted her way and one of them grabbed her and started assaulting her.

The accused then dragged her into a field, pointed a knife at her, and threatened to kill her. She added that they tied her hands with her saree and stuffed the same in her mouth. The accused then gang-raped her and made a video of the entire incident, the woman alleged.

She was traumatized after the incident and could not share the incident with her husband. Following this, on April 9, the woman went back to her native place. When she gained courage, she told her husband about the incident, and immediately talked to the factory owner, who asked them to lodge a complaint with the police.

Sub-inspector Balwinder Singh, investigating officer in the case in Ludhiana, said the matter seemed suspicious. He said, “After receiving the complaint, the police approached her to record her statement. But, she has been ignoring our calls since then, which is why the matter seems suspicious. As Bihar police have lodged a zero FIR, Ludhiana police have also registered a case and started an investigation.”
