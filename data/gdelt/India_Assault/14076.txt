Absconding Bihar MLA Anant Singh assures his 'surrender'

Bihar MLA Anant Singh, who has been charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, has released a video message, claiming he is not absconding, but just visiting an ailing friend. In the video released late on Sunday night, the Independent MLA from Mokama alleged that he was being framed by Barh ASP Lipi Singh.

The controversial MLA has also assured that he will surrender before a court within three-four days.

About the arrest of his accomplice Chhotan Singh, the lawmaker said that he was a relative and hence staying at his residence in Patna. Singh further claimed that both Chhotan and he were accused in the case. "How is it possible that the police freed me in the case and kept him as accused?" asked Singh in the video.

This comes even as the Bihar Police has constituted a SIT to ensure Singh's arrest.

During the searches conducted at the MLA's residences on Saturday, the police found a diary from under Singh's bed, wherein they found names and phone numbers of several of Singh's accomplices. Coded names of as many as 15 weapons, that reportedly belong to Singh, are also mentioned in the diary. Additionally, the police also recovered an AK-47 assault rifle, along with grenades and bullets.

On Sunday, the Patna police issued a lookout notice against the gangster-politician after he was found to be missing.
