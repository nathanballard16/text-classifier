Pakistan needs to pursue aggressive diplomacy to pressurize India to stop brutalities in IOJ&K:

Lt Gen Retd Naeem Khalid Lodhi (Former Defense Secretary ): It is highly unfortunate that Indian troops are committing worst war crimes in Indian occupied Kashmir and justifying their acts. It is high time for Pakistan to accelerate its diplomatic efforts to exert more pressure on India. Pakistan needs to pursue aggressive diplomacy to pressurize India to stop brutalities in Indian occupied Kashmir. We should not expect more from international community and the Kashmir issue can only be resolved with vigorous freedom movement. The United Nations should intervene to avoid catastrophic consequences of confrontation between two nuclear states and resolve Kashmir issue in accordance with the United Nations resolutions.
