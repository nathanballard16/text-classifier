There is no need for me to keep it under wraps. This is a blackmailing ploy from the complainant,” he said.Binoy said he filed a complaint in May against the woman with the IG of Police, Kannur. The complaint was forwarded to then Kannur SP for further action.But with the Lok Sabha polls going on and due to jurisdiction issues, no further action could be taken, police sources told PTI.
