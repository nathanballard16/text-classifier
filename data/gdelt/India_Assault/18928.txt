PIO girl’s killer got angry after she repeatedly ignored his catcalling

Investigation into the coldblooded rape and murder of an Indian-American teenager, with roots in Hyderabad, revealed that the accused, Donald Thurman, stalked and catcalled her, but the honours student of University of Illinois, Chicago, rushed to her car in a garage on the campus. Angry as he was, Thurman, who resided near the university but was not connected to it, went behind her, held her tightly by the neck, dragged her into her car’s back seat and sexually assaulted her, police said.

The crime took place around 1.35 am on November 23. While Thurman confessed to the murder, he told police that he did not have sexual intercourse with her, though a used condom was found in the victim’s car itself. Police suspect that Thurman had used the condom and disposed it in the car before fleeing.

On November 26, Cook County Assistant State’s attorney James Murphy gave a detailed account of the crime, narrating how Thurman had sexually assaulted the victim after she fell unconscious. The 19-year-old victim had attended a semi-official event for health fraternity students and another student had accompanied her to the garage up to a point. From there, the student went to her dormitory while the victim walked alone to the garage.

“The victim walked past the blue line and the defendant noticed her. The defendant tried talking to her but the victim ignored him. The defendant catcalled at her. The victim continued to ignore the defendant and kept on walking to where her car was parked,” Murphy said. “The defendant was angry that he was being ignored,” Murphy said about Thurman, who then grabbed her around her neck from behind and put her in a ‘chokehold’. The girl fell to the ground and Thurman dragged her, opened the backseat door, put her there and committed the crime, he added.
