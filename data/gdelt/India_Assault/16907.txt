AIMPLB to hold important meeting today

Lucknow: All India Muslim Personal Law Board executive body will hold an important meeting in Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama in Lucknow today i.e. October 12. Issues such as Babri Masjid Case, Triple Talaq, Uniform Civil Code & others will be discussed in the meeting.

As reported by the Inquilab Daily, Board Secretary and senior members Maulana Khalid Saifullah Rahman said that Court decision will be acceptable in Babri Masjid dispute case.

When asked about appeal by Lt Gen Zamir Shah to hand over the disputed 2.77 acres of land in Ayodhya to Hindus as a goodwill gesture, Maulana without naming the former said that is uncalled for firstly, because Masjid is the house of Allah. Secondly it seems that such statements are given to discourage Muslims.

Maulana Rahmani said rumours are also making rounds that if the verdict comes in favour of Muslims government will make a law. If such a thing is actually done, it would be the worst example of injustice.
