Indian jailed in UK for sex assault on plane

LONDON: An Indian tourist who sexually assaulted a woman aboard a UK-bound plane has been sentenced to one year in prison by a British court. The incident took place on a flight from Mumbai to Manchester in February.Hardeep Singh, 36, from Hoshiarpur , pleaded guilty to three counts of sexual assault before the Manchester Minshull Street Crown Court on Thursday. He had initially denied the charges.On February 23, Singh, who was visiting Britain on a six-month tourist visa, first tried to start a conversation with the woman, who was sitting beside him. Later, when she got up to use the facilities, he refused to move aside, forcing her “to squeeze” past him.After the aircraft lights were dimmed, the woman and other passengers on the flight went off to sleep. The woman, feeling uncomfortable, woke up to find Singh sexually assaulting her. She tried to push him away but he persisted, forcing his hands underneath her clothing as well as trying to kiss her.The assault lasted for around 15 minutes before she was able to free herself and move to the back of the plane where she reported Singh to a cabin crew member. He was moved away from the woman for the remainder of the flight. The cabin crew contacted Greater Manchester Police , whose officers were waiting at the airport when the plane landed. Singh was arrested on suspicion of sexual assault. Singh will be deported back to India after he has served his sentence.
