Pollachi Rape News: Pollachi sexual abuse case transferred to CBI

CHENNAI: The Tamil Nadu government on Wednesday issued an order transferring the Pollachi sexual assault case and a related assault case from the Crime Branch CID to the Central Bureau of Investigation.An order to this effect was issued by the home department after DGP T K Rajendran requested the government to transfer the case registered at the Pollachi East police station from the Crime Branch CID to the CBI for further investigation.In a communication to the state government on Tuesday, the DGP stated that the two cases were transferred to the Crime Branch-CID on March 12. Since the investigation involves technical issues, including analysing Facebook data IP logs/addresses and internet usage logs, the communication with Facebook service providers and other internet service providing places in various countries, nature of the crime is extremely serious, thereby demanding some specialised attention and requires more laborious and dedicated investigation with technical expertise.“After careful examination, the government has decided to accept the proposal of the DGP and to transfer the case… to CBI for further investigation by issuing a notification under Section 6 of Delhi Special Police Establishment, 1946,” home secretary Niranjan Mardi said in his order.A girl student from a city college in Pollachi complained to Pollachi East Police Station on February 24, that she was physically and sexually harassed and robbed of her one sovereign gold chain worth Rs 20,000 by a group of men inside a car.
