RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi Arts Council (RAC) arranged a photographic exhibition based on Indian atrocities in Kashmir to show solidarity with the people of Kashmir on Friday.



The exhibition was inaugurated by Pir Charaghuddin Shah.



Speaking at the occasion, Shah said that Kashmiri people have been held hostage by India for the past three months. He added that it was imperative that the entire nation puts aside all differences and unites to stand with the people of Kashmir.



He lamented the complete silence of the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU), Amnesty International and Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on violation of human rights.



The RAC director said that violation of human rights in Kashmir went heavily ignored by the international community and so could not be found anywhere in human history.
