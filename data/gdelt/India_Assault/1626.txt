Sixty Brahminy ducks found dead in Bharuch district, Gujarat

Vadodara, Feb 6 (PTI) Over sixty Brahminy ducks were

found dead under mysterious circumstances in Bharuch district

of Gujarat, a forest official said Wednesday.

The cause of their death was being investigated, said

V Z Tadvi, a forest official based in Jhagadia.

The birds were found dead in the riverbed of the

Narmada across three villages Tuesday.

After the local people noticed a large number of dead

birds, they contacted the forest department.

Another official said on the condition of anonymity

that contaminated water may have caused the deaths, but

reports of autopsy and forensic laboratory tests were awaited.

He ruled out the possibility of the deaths being the

result of any epidemic.

Brahminy ducks, also called `ruddy shelducks', are

migratory birds which travel to Nalsarovar in Gujarat from

Europe and Central Asia in winter. PTI CORR
