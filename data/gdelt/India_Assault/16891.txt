Bittu visits DMCH, meets injured securitymen

Ludhiana: Ravneet Singh Bittu, Member of Parliament from Ludhiana, visited the DMC hospital on Thursday evening and met the injured security personnel of former cabinet minister Bikram Majithia.

The gesture of Bittu is being hailed by social media users. Bittu also shared the pictures of his visit to the hospital on his Facebook page and also posted a message which read: “The most unfortunate tragedy happened last night near Moga bypass road in which one of the Z security constable died and the rest were injured. As Z security personnel protect me, I mourn the death of the young man and pray to god that the wounded young javans be healed soon.”

Three security personnel got injured while another died after their car met with an accident Wednesday late night near Moga-Baghapurana bypass when Majithia’s convoy was travelling from Jalandhar to Muktsar.

After the accident, Majithia accompanied the injured security personnel to Ludhiana and got them admitted to DMC hospital. Interestingly, minutes before Bittu’s visit to DMCH, Majithia too was in the hospital to ask about the wellbeing of the security personnel.

Three days ago, Bittu had launched a scathing attack on Majthia after the latter conducted a press conference in Dakha and levelled allegations on SHO of Dakha of helping Congress candidate Captain Sandeep Sandhu and also alleged that Congress was using outsiders to disturb the situation in Dakha.

Bittu had taken a dig at Majithia and referred to him as an outsider as well.
