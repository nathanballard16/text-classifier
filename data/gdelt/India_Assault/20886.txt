Rajkot: Leopard suspected to have killed 10 shot dead

RAJKOT: The forest department on Wednesday shot dead the leopard, which had terrorized villages of Dhari and Bagasara talukas of Amreli district and Visavadar taluka in Junagadh district for the past nine months.The forest officials claimed that the leopard had turned a man-eater and was responsible for 10 deaths in these three talukas since March this year.The leopard’s movements were recorded near a gau shala (cow shelter) near Bagasara at around 3am. The leopard, whose age is estimate to be around 6-7 years, had entered the shelter and preyed on three cows, officials said.The forest team had to patiently wait for nearly 16 hours for the leopard to come out of the gau shala which they had cordoned off. When the big cat came out, a team of seven veterinary doctors present with the team first tried to tranquilize it. However, it was extremely aggressive and started charging at the forest team. Ultimately, they had no choice but to shoot it dead.Ashwin Parmar, conservator of forest, Rajkot told TOI: “We confirmed that it was the same leopard which had killed 10 people in three talukas. The pug marks found near the spot of victims’ death as well as the size as described by eyewitnesses completely matched with this big cat. This leopared has injured 15 people too. We matched the pug marks found outside the gau shala with the previous ones.”After the leopard attacked and killed two people in Munjiyasar and Lundhiya villages of Bagasara taluka last week, the forest department had mounted a major operation involving over 150 foresters, trackers and officers armed with weapons to capture or shoot the leopard.Besides setting up nearly 30 cages in an area of 10 sq km around these villages, night-vision cameras and drones were also used extensively to trace the killer cat.Parmar, under whose jurisdiction this area falls, added, “We had instruction for the three months to shoot this leopard as it had become a man-eater. Despite an elaborate operation, it was evasive and difficult to trap.”The forest department has already caged 14 leopards in Dhari, Bagasara and Visavadar talukas in the last one month, but this one had evaded all traps.The most brutal killing was that of 50-year-old farmer Vaju Borad in Munjiyasar village on December 5 when the leopard had torn apart his abdomen after dragging him out of his cot.
