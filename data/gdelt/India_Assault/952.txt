100 migrant workers stranded in Telangana

Purushottampur: In a shocking incident, as many as 100 migrant workers are stranded in Telangana and being inflicted mental and physical torture by their employers, reports said.

The matter came to light after three migrant workers from Kolidaspur under Hinjilicut police limits in Ganjam district managed to escape and reached their home safely.

“Yes, many people like us from Berhampur, Golanthara in Ganjam district, Umerkote, Jharigaon in Koraput district are still stranded. They are tortured and made to work under extreme pressure,” the three workers said.

“Many of them are taken ill due to the pressure and torture,” one of the workers added.

According to sources, the three workers – Hina Behera, Tukuna Behera and Santosh Nahak, were on their way to Chennai in search of work December 9, 2018. However, two unidentified persons approached them at Vijayawada railway station and called them on the pretext of providing job with attractived wages.

Unaware of their intentions, the three went along with them. However, the workers were engaged in fishing without any pay.

When the workers expressed their wish to return home, the employers snatched their phones and assaulted them. After much effort, a worker managed to get out of their clutches and alerted his family members who sought the help of Hinjili police and Labour Department December 14.

However, no one paid heed to their pleas. A report was published in these columns after which a team went to Telangana and rescued the three labourers at the behest of the District Collector.

“The stranded workers were not given proper food. They were made to fish for more than 12 hours in the sea. Even as the employer had assured of Rs 12-14,000, per month, they were not given a rupee so far,” the workers said as they demanded immediate intervention of the authorities to rescue their colleagues before anything untoward happens.
