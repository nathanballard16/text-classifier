Aaj aap hamaray dil ki baat keh di: Omar Abdullah hails PM after he decries violence against Kashmiris

NC leader and former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah hailed PM Modi for his comments on violence against Kashmiris at a public rally. On Saturday, Omar Abdullah took to Twitter to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for condemning incidents of assault against residents of Jammu and Kashmir in various parts of India. "Thank you @narendramodi Sahib. Aaj aap ne hamaray dil ki baat keh di. It’s been more than a week since the terrible attack in Pulwama & more than a week that Kashmiris have been bearing the brunt of the public anger. Perhaps finally after PM @narendramodi Sb has spoken these forces targeting Kashmiris will stop in their tracks."

Abdullah's reaction came after PM Modi addressed a public rally in Tonk, Rajasthan and said, "Our fight is against terrorism & enemies of humanity. Our fight is for Kashmir not against Kashmir, not against Kashmiris. What happened to Kashmiri students in the last few days, such things should not happen in this country.”

Lately, National Conference leader had hit out at PM Modi and the opposition Congress for not speaking out against assaults on Kashmiris. Ex-CM of Jammu and Kashmir at a press conference said, "We didn't have much expectation from the BJP but we had expectations from the prime minister. We had hoped he would keep politics aside and say something."
