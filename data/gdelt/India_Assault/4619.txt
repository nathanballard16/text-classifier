200 Muslim homes burnt down in India's Meerut





NEW DELHI: Attacks against Muslims and their properties have significantly grown in India and IoK after Pulwama assault. In the latest act of brutality more than 200 homes of Muslims in Meerut, not far from Delhi, were set on fire allegedly by cops during an operation against encroachments in the area.



The security officials alleged the unknown miscreants for heinous act, saying: "Some of the shanties were set on fire by some miscreants when they were trying to evict the encroachers."

However, a video, which is being widely circulated, shows a Muslim man, accusing the police for the shanties being set on fire. The chaos that ensued even took a minor communal colour, thereby escalating the tension.



Instead of taking action against the culprits involved in burning down the homes police filed FIR against unknown men and arrested around six Muslim men in this case.

According to some critics, Modi government has totally failed to protect the lives, properties of the Muslims and other minorities.



Social activists blame police and media for not highlighting Meerut-like incidents. In most of the cases the Muslim population are being targeted and Hindu extremist are being used to incite the violence with the sole agenda of instilling fear in Muslims so that they leave that area.

While a retired police chief was reported to have said that the slum dwellers will not set their own houses on fire. This case needs an independent probe.

On being asked, why the issue is not being much reported by mainstream media, he said, “Both media and police are prejudiced towards Muslims.
