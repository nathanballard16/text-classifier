Theparty has claimed there was a breach in theof party Presidentin Uttar Pradesh, alleging that his life was endangered as a result.The claim has been made by three top Congress leaders in a letter to Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh. A joint letter has been signed byThe MHA, however, stated that it had received no such letter from the Congress and that it had conducted an investigation and found that the "green light" shown in the clipping was from a mobile phone used by the AICC photographer, who was video graphing the press interaction of Rahul Gandhi near the collectorate at Amethi.According to Congress, a laser (green) was pointed at his head, intermittently on at least seven separate occasions in a short period during his interaction with the media after filing his nomination in Amethi. Rahul Gandhi is seeking a re-election from Amethi, the Gandhi family's bastion.The Congress also attached a video clip of his media interaction along with the letter sent to Home Minister Rajnath Singh.In the letter, the Congress gave examples of the assassinations of former Prime Ministers — Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi and said that the incident is an alarming lapse on part of the UP administration which is responsible for the peripheral security of Rahul Gandhi."Despite prior intelligence inputs and on account of serious lapses in the security of shri Rajiv Gandhi, he was assassinated by terrorists at Sriperumbudur, on May 21, 1991 during the General Elections to the Lok Sabha," reads the letter.The top Congress leaders have asked the Centre to 'probe and neutralise the threat, if any,' and ensure that the protocol relating the Congress president’s security detail is strictly followed.The Congress claimed that a perusal of the video by various persons including former security personnel leads to a prima facie conclusion that this laser could emanate from a potential weapon such as a sniper gun.Expressing shock and distress at the possibility of the Congress President being targeted, the Congress said, "Even a possibility like this is a cause of serious alarm and concern pointing towards a breach in the security of Rahul Gandhi."The party also said that Rahul Gandhi’s security was the 'first responsibility' of the central government and the home ministry."Rahul Gandhi being a high risk target is especially vulnerable during the extensive electioneering," the letter said.For the second consecutive time, Rahul is contesting against Union Textile Minister and BJP leader Smriti Irani from Amethi.Besides Amethi, Rahul Gandhi will also be contesting from Wayanad seat in Kerala. He filed his nomination for the seat on April 4.The seven-phase Lok Sabha election started with voting taking place for 91 seats on Thursday. The result will be announced on May 23.- With input from PTI
