Rights group urge UN investigation into violations by Indian army

The Association of Parents of Disappeared Persons and the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society released a report Monday calling for a UN investigation into torture in the Indian states of Jammu and Kashmir perpetuated by the Indian State.

The report creates a comprehensive understanding of the patterns, targets and impacts of torture by tracing the historical background from 1947 to today through 432 case studies.

More than 300 of the victims studied were civilians. Forty individuals died as a result of injuries received while they were tortured. The report also acknowledges the psychological damages that are ever constant for the victims with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Despite the widespread nature, there have not been any prosecutions for human rights violations.

The organizations urged India to ratify the UN Convention Against Torture and end the phenomenon of torture. The report further recommended that the UN Security Council refer the situation to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, upholding its obligation to maintain international peace and unity. The groups also urged the UN Human Rights Council to establish a Commission of Inquiry to investigate the allegations of human rights violations in Jammu and Kashmir.
