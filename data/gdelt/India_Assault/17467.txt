A hoax bomb threat caused panic at the Income Tax Department, Karnataka and Goa region office at Infantry Road in Bengaluru on Wednesday.

Police officials searched the premises for two hours after the hoax threat was received late on Wednesday night.

As per Deccan Chronicle, an email was sent to the Deputy Commissioner, Income Tax at around 10:45 pm on Wednesday after which a bomb disposal squad and a dog squad was pressed into service to search the offices on Infantry Road.

The email was sent by a person who identified himself as Govind, who claimed that there was a bomb in the Goods and Services Tax (GST) building which could set off any time.

Commercial Street police officers were alerted about the email and after a two-hour search involving a bomb squad and a dog squad, police revealed that the email was a hoax.

However, Income Tax employees hesitated to enter the building on Thursday morning when they turned up for work. Senior police officials had to give them assurances to enter their offices and resume work.

Police officials also believe that the threat is the work of an insider. Cyber Crime police officials will attempt to track the IP address of the person who sent the email, Times of India reported.

Incidentally, Wednesday was the last day in office for DCP (East) Rahul Kumar Shaharpurwad and police officials planned to meet him before his transfer was formalised. However, the hoax threat meant that officials including Rahul had to rush to the spot to oversee the operations.

As a precautionary measure, police installed a metal detector at the entrance on Thursday and subjected workers arriving to work to checks.
