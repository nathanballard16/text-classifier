New Delhi: Almost a week after she was brutally assaulted by her neighbours allegedly for throwing garbage outside their home, a 65-year-old woman succumbed at a government hospital in northeast Delhi on Wednesday. The deceased, identified as Hamidan was a resident of Munga Nagar near northeast Delhi's Dayalpur.

The matter was reported to the police on February 28 after the victim's kin registered a case in this regard against five of her neighbours. The accused were booked under sections 323 and 341 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which correspond to charges of causing hurt and wrongful restraint. Deputy commissioner of police (DCP), northeast, Atul Kumar Thakur told Hindustan Times that a case was registered on the basis of a daily diary (DD) entry since the injured woman was taken to the hospital and was unfit to give a statement.

Following the woman's demise, police arrested one Mohammad Ubesh and another suspect the same day and booked him under section 302 of the IPC which corresponds to charges of murder. Meanwhile, three of the accused neighbours are still at large.

An argument broke out between the elderly woman and three of her neighbours after she allegedly threw garbage from the terrace of her house towards theirs. As a result, the neighbours thrashed Hamidan and left her bleeding on the main porch of their house. She was rushed to the Guru Teg Bahadur hospital where she was undergoing medical treatment until she succumbed to head injuries on Wednesday.
