Kolkata, May 14

BJP chief Amit Shah’s massive roadshow in north Kolkata today was marred by violence as students affiliated to West Bengal’s ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) tried to show black flags to him at the entrance of the Calcutta University campus.

Members of the ABVP, student wing of the BJP, also gathered at the site and the two sides clashed soon after Shah’s cavalcade passed by.

The events took a serious turn at Vidyasagar College in the same locality where several motorcycles parked outside were vandalised and set ablaze. Shards of broken glass littered the lobby of the college where a bust of Bengali writer and philosopher Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was smashed, prompting the TMC to seek a meeting with the EC.

“There was an attempt by TMC hooligans to attack me. Mamata Banerjee (West Bengal CM) tried to provoke violence. But I am safe,” Shah said. Banerjee hit back: “Is Shah God that no one can protest against him?... They (BJP men) are so uncultured that they destroyed the bust of Vidyasagar... Those who insulted him won’t be spared.”

Shah said he was told by the police that the permission for the roadshow ended near the college and that he would be taken to the ancestral home of Swami Vivekananda on Bidhan Sarani. “They (police) deviated from the planned route and took a way where there were traffic jams,” he said. Calling Shah a “goonda”, Banerjee said: “If you lay your hands on Vidyasagar, what will I call you other than a goonda?” (With PTI inputs)
