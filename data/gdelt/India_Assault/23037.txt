VADODARA: A 19-year-old woman from Botad has levelled rape charges against her former tuition teacher who she had later married. In her complaint, she accused the man of indulging in domestic violence for a year before abandoning her.“An offence was registered at Mahila police station in Vadodara and they have transferred the case to Botad. The accused Arjunsinh Chudasama has also been arrested,” said her lawyer Neeraj Jain.The woman told police that Chudasama used to come to her home to teach when she was 14 years old. During that time, Chudasama allegedly raped her and also indulged in unnatural sex. He kept threatening and blackmailing her with photos due to which she had to succumb to his demands, she told cops. These threats also prevented her from informing her parents until November last year when she became pregnant.The woman’s parents gave a complaint against Chudasama but a couple of days later he offered to settle the matter by marrying her. “He struck a settlement to save himself from police case,” Jain said.However, Chudasama and his family members beat up the woman and abused her. He also asked her to leave his house due to which she had to live with her parents for four months this year. In April, Chudasama accepted her back again but resorted to violence again and asked her to go back within a few months only. The woman later learnt from her uncle-in-law in November that Chudasama was romantically involved with some other woman and was planning to live with her.The woman came to Ajwa Road in Vadodara to her cousin’s house and lodged a complaint here, said Jain. “She has gone through torture at a very young age and for several years. Although the case has been transferred to Botad, we will approach high court to transferring it to Vadodara,” Jain said.
