Kalyan man stabs wife to death, injures daughter

Police launch manhunt for accused

The Bazarpeth police are on the lookout for a 52-year-old man who allegedly murdered his wife and attacked his daughter at 10.30 p.m. at their home in Thankar Pada in Kalyan on Thursday.

The police said that the accused, Mohan Mahajan, attacked his wife Manisha (45) and daughter Gauravi (24) with a kitchen knife during an argument.

“Gauravi intervened and tried to save her mother, but ended up sustaining injuries,” said Assistant Police Inspector Pramod Sanap.

The commotion attracted the attention of neighbours and the accused fled the scene. The neighbours then rushed the mother and daughter to Shreedevi Hospital in Kalyan, where Manisha was declared dead before admission.

Mr. Sanap said, “We haven’t been able to record Gauravi’s statement as she is still under treatment. The motive is still unclear. Prima facie, we suspect that a marital argument led to the incident. Three teams are working on apprehending the accused.” The police have booked Mr. Mahajan for murder and assault under the Indian Penal Code.

The police are trying to map his cellular locations to gain leads regarding his whereabouts, officers said.
