Youth thrashed for rape attempt on minor

Ludhiana: Residents of Kakowal Road thrashed a 20-year-old youth, after tying him with an electric pole when he attempted to rape a minor girl, who was his neighbour, on Monday evening. The 13-year-old minor girl was present alone at home when the accused barged into her house and attempted to rape her. Thereafter, residents sounded the police, who took him in custody. The accused also sustained injuries, following which he was taken to the civil hospital.

Assistant commissioner of police (ACP-North) Mukhtyar Rai said the family of the minor girl worked as labourers. “On Monday evening, when the girl was alone at home around 4pm, the accused who is her neighbour, barged into the house and attempted to rape her. He also stuffed a piece of cloth into her mouth to suppress her screams. However, she resisted and managed to set herself free. When she raised an alarm, the neighbours gathered at the spot and nabbed the accused. Then, they tied him to an electric pole and thrashed him. The police took the accused in custody, but the statement of the minor girl is yet to be recorded,” said ACP Rai.
