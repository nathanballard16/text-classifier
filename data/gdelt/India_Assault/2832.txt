The days of free move of JeM chief Masood Azhar could be numbered as France too is ready with a proposal to United Nations to ban him as India has been urging the same to international community.

In 2017 US, UK and France moved with a similar proposal to UN’s Sanctions Committee 1267. It was then blocked by China.

A senior French source said, “At the UN, France will lead a proposal to put Masood Azhar on the terrorist list… It will happen in a couple of days.”

The French decision comes in the wake of fresh attack by JeM terrorists on Indian force in Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. A suicide bomber drove a SUV laden with 200 tons of explosives into a CRPF vehicle killing 40 jawans on February 14.

The decision to propose a ban on Masood Azhar was discussed Tuesday morning between Philippe Etienne, Diplomatic Advisor to the French President and Indian National Security Advisor Ajit Doval.

The French leader expressed sincere condolences and said both India and France should coordinate diplomatic efforts in the fight against terrorism.

Meanwhile, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said his government is open to investigation into the fresh attack and ruled out any involvement of the country’s agencies.

Khan said, “This is a New Pakistan… we want stability. We do not benefit by attacking India… It is in our interest that nobody from our soil spreads violence. I want to tell Indian govt that we will take action if evidence is found against anyone from Pakistan.”
