Delhi Gang Rape and Murder: No Mercy from Supreme Court for Four Convicts, Death by Hanging Stands

The Supreme Court refused and the men remain on death row. One of them – Vinay Sharma – filed a mercy petition before the President. The ministry of home affairs has recommended to the President that the mercy plea be rejected. However, soon afterwards Vinay Sharma denied signing a mercy plea in the first place.

President of India Ram Nath Kovind had said that there shouldn't be mercy pleas in cases like these.

Meanwhile, the convicts are imprisoned in Tihar Jail in the national capital and rumours of preparations to hang the convicts have been doing the rounds.

The jail authorities have written to the prison department in the state of Uttar Pradesh, requesting that they keep the hangmen on standby for possible hanging(s) at Tihar. Tihar does not have hangmen on its payrolls while the Uttar Pradesh jail department employs two. The chief of the Uttar Pradesh jail department has confirmed that Tihar jail sent such a request and has said that the hangmen will be made available to the prison whenever needed.

Ram Singh and a minor were among the six convicts in the brutal gang-rape and murder of the 23-year-old physiotherapy student who came to be called Nirbhaya.

While Ram Singh killed himself in prison, the minor involved in the crime served a three-year term at a reformation centre and was released.

The 2012 Delhi gang-rape case involved a rape and fatal assault that occurred on 16 December 2012 in Munirka, a neighbourhood in South Delhi. The rape and murder of the 23-year-old woman had led to country-wide outrage over the safety of women in the country.
