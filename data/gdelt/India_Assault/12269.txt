Majhab nahin sikhata aapas mein bair rakhna..., Trinamool Congress MP Nusrat Jahan used the famous couplet from poet Iqbal's poem Sare Jahan Se Achha to argue the case of unity in diversity in India as she backed the open letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi by 49 members of the civic society.

The letter, signed by 49 eminent personalities such as filmmaker Shyam Benegal and director Mani Ratnam, raises concern over the growing incidents of hate crime in India in the name of religion.

Nusrat Jahan, who is a first time Lok Sabha MP from Basirhat in West Bengal, shared a post on social media applauding the efforts of 49 intellectuals.

"There are numerous incidents of citizens being attacked by so-called "cow vigilantes" over rumours of eating beef, or cow-smuggling, etc and government's selective silence and inaction hits us hard," Nusrat Jahan said in the post.

The TMC MP claimed that the lynch mobs had turned "Lord Ram's name into murder cry" and termed mob lynchers "nothing but enemies if our country" and "terrorists".

"As young MP, representing new age secular India, I request government and all lawmakers to frame a law to stop such assaults on democracy by mob lynchers," Nusrat Jahan said in her post.

"Sirf insaaaniyat ke naate, gaay ke naam pe, bhagwan ke naam pe, kisi ki dari pe, toh kisi ki topi pe - khoon kharaba bandh kare (In the name of humanity, please stop bloodshed in the name of cows and religion)," she said, while concluding with the famous lines from Iqbal's Sare Jahan Se Achha Hindustan Humara.
