The National Commission for Women on Wednesday wrote to Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan seeking his intervention to ensure the protection of the victim nun and witnesses in the rape case against Bishop Franco Mulakkal.

In a letter to the Kerala CM following complaints by case witnesses, nuns Neena Rose and Ranit Pallasseril of St Francis Mission Home, Kuruvillangadu, Kerala, NCW chairperson Rekha Sharma said the two witnesses feared for their lives and alleged that they had been transferred out of their convent to split them up and sabotage the evidence.

“The two nuns have been directed to leave their convent in Kottayam district in compliance with the transfer order issued by their congregation last year. The complainants allege that the transfer orders were aimed to split them and to sabotage the case against Bishop Franco Mulakkal, which is pending trial.

“Further they alleged that the same were issued to pressurise and threaten them as they were prominent witnesses in the case. The complainants also apprehended danger to their lives if transferred to distant regions,” NCW said in the letter.

Sharma also wrote to the Kerala CM saying, “As you are aware of the seriousness of the issue we urge your personal intervention in the matter to ensure safety of complainants, victim of the case under trial and fellow nuns.”

She said, “I urge you to take prompt action to ensure prevention of sabotage of material evidence and witnesses in pending case against Bishop Mulakkal so that justice can prevail.”
