All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi on Saturday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the deadly Pulwama terror attack, and asked if the prime minister had eaten 'beef biryani and slept', while the attack took place.

"Indian Air Force dropped bombs in Balakot. On this, BJP chief Amit Shah said that 250 terrorists were dead and Home Minister Rajnath Singh said that NTRP tapped 300 cell phones," Asaduddin Owaisi said.

"You can see that 300 cell phones were there in Balakot, but you failed to see how 50 kg RDX was moved to Pulwama under your nose, Owaisi said while addresssing a meeting on saturday.

"I want to ask PM Modi and Rajnath Singh whether they ate beef biryani and slept," Asaduddin Owaisi added, as quoted by ANI.

Asaduddin Owaisi, who will contest the upcoming Lok Sabha elections 2019 from Hyderabad, also said that his fight was against the forces who were trying to end secularism and brotherhood in the country.

If anyone says that there are two national parties in India, I will say no to them because one national party is BJP and the other is 1.5 BJP," he said.

"There is no difference between BJP and Congress," Asaduddin Owaisi asserted.

At least 40 CRPF personnel were killed in one of the deadliest terror attacks in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir when a suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus.
