VIT staff, students pay homage to martyred CRPF personnel

India will have to give a fitting response to the loss it has suffered because of the terrorist strike, he said, adding that he wished to convey his deepest condolences to the bereaved family members of the slain personnel.

VELLORE: The staff and students of Vellore Institute of Technology (VIT) paid homage to the memory of at least 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel who fell prey to the dastardly terrorist suicide bomber attack at Pulwama district of Jammu & Kashmir on Thursday.

At a solemn ceremony held at the Foody's lawn in the VIT campus, Dr Sekar Viswanathan, vice-president of VIT paid floral tributes to the portraits of the 40 slain para-military personnel on Saturday. He said that the Indian soldiers who were guarding our borders toiled in the snowy Himalayan region, unmindful of the biting cold, only to ensure the peace and happiness of the people of India.

They worked hard with a spirit of unity as Indians, transcending religious, linguistic, caste and all other barriers. India will have to give a fitting response to the loss it has suffered because of the terrorist strike, he said, adding that he wished to convey his deepest condolences to the bereaved family members of the slain personnel.

Dr Sandhya Pentareddy, executive director and Dr S. Narayanan, pro-vice-chancellor of VIT, besides the security personnel, NCC cadets, professors and students of VIT paid floral tributes to the martyred CRPF personnel at a moving ceremony.
