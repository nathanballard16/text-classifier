Chennai: The M.K.B. Nagar police have arrested a teenager and are searching for two other boys who gang-raped a 65-year-old woman by breaking into her house in Vyasarpadi, in the early hours of Tuesday.

Police said the victim had been sleeping alone at home, when the trio, all aged 17 years and also her neighbours, barged into her house and committed the crime at knifepoint.

The victim was identified as Lakshmi, resident of Sathya Moorthy Nagar, Vysarpadi, and a domestic worker. Before fleeing, the teenagers had threatened the bleeding woman not to disclose the incident to anybody. But, the woman informed her neighbours, and she was rushed to the Stanley government hospital where she is under treatment.

A resident of Vysarpadi, Devi said, "A poorly maintained community hall in the locality was being used by youngsters and criminals alike as their den. Teenage boys in the area use the hall for illegal activities like drinking and peddling ganja. We have filed several complaints with the police and asked them to either close down the hall or provide security to the place, but our requests have been ignored."

A case has been registered with the M.K.B Nagar All Women Police Station. On Tuesday, police arrested one of them and are questioning him. Based on his inputs, they have trying to nab the other two boys.
