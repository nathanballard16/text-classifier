LUCKNOW: The survivor’s brother was going to Rae Bareli with her to meet the lawyer to know about the progress in case and to decide future course of action in it.

“We had to start our journey at 4am, but I couldn’t go due to some compulsion. But my younger sister decided to go all by herself. Barely, six-seven minutes had passed when villagers came running to our residence, screaming my sister had been set ablaze,” he told TOI over phone.

“I rushed out and was told that my sister had been set ablaze and a UP 112 team had taken her to primary health centre. I was then informed that she was referred to Sadar hospital. When I reached hospital, I went numb on hearing her screams. A chill went down my spine on seeing her in a badly burnt state. My younger sister was writhing in pain and I could do nothing to ease her agony,” he recalled.

“We are seven siblings, including me. She is the fourth among five sisters, including three who are married. She has always been very courageous and hardworking. She was keen to study and has completed her BEd after which she taught in some primary schools,” he added.

“She stayed at home to look after our youngest brother who is mentally challenged. We are landless, my father and I are the breadwinners of family,” said the survivor’s elder brother.

“I wish she survives and is able to lead a happy life,” he prayed.
