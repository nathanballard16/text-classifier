Kidnapped Man Rescued; Three Arrested

Patna: Patna police on late Thursday night rescued a property dealer who was kidnapped on May 29 from Makhdumpur under Beur police station and was held captive in the Naxal-infested forest in Nawada district.

As reported, 56-year old Ramjanam Bhagat was reported abducted by his son Rohit after he failed to return home last Tuesday. Soon the kidnappers called Bhagat's family and informed them about his abduction and their demand for Rs. 20 lakh in ransom money.

Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manu Maharaj, at a press conference in Patna on Friday, identified the criminals as Rana Pratap Singh, a man known to Bhagat and a resident of Kauakol in Gaya district, Alok Kumar of Jamui and Ravindra Yadav of Nawada.

"Based on the evidence available at this time, it seems like Bhagat owed some money to Singh. When he failed to repay him back, Singh plotted with Alok and Ravindra to kidnap Bhagat to retrieve his money," the SSP said.

After kidnapping Bhagat, the criminals then took him to Patna Junction from where they reached Kauakol in Gaya district. He was then taken to the Sarkanda Khirki jungles at the border of Bihar and Jharkhand that also serves as a safe hideout for Maoists, Maharaj said.

"From their hideout, the kidnappers made several calls on Rohit's cell phone to press for their demand. The police then formed a team and lured Alok and Ravindra to meet with Rohit at a market in Govindpur to receive the ransom money.

As soon as the two reached the market, police jumped into action and arrested them. Based on the information provided by them, police raided an area in the jungle and rescued Bhagat and arrested Singh without any incident.
