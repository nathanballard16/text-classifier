Six injured in Makarpura GIDC factory explosion

VADODARA: Six persons were injured in a massive explosion that ripped through a factory in Makarpura GIDC on Monday evening. The explosion happened when the company was testing a newly developed machine and the pressure in one of the tanks increased beyond the prescribed limit.According to the fire department , the blast took place at an engineering company named Chemshell around 6.30pm during demonstration of a newly developed machine.The injured persons have been identified as Khumansinh Bhabhor, Subhash Chitre, Rajesh Jain, Bhaskar Nanakde, Vishwas Sol and Shrikant Borse. Two of them are said to be critically injured. They were given primary treatment at SSG Hospital and then shifted to a private hospital.“The company’s owner had developed a machine and two persons had come to witness its demonstration. During testing, they had heated 100 litres of liquid plastic to develop bio oil from its vapour. But as the oil was not developed, the pressure of vapour increased in a tank due to which it exploded,” said deputy chief fire officer Parth Brahmbhatt.“In technical terms, it was a boiling liquid expanding vapor explosion (BLEVE) which is caused by the rupture of a vessel containing a pressurized liquid that has reached temperatures above its boiling point,” he explained.Fire officials added that the injured also included the two persons who were there to witness the demonstration.“There was no fire, just an explosion but we sprinkled water for a while until the machine cooled down,” said fire officer Nikunj Azad of Makarpura GIDC fire station.
