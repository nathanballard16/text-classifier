HYDERABAD: The principal of a private school in Sehwan, Jamshoro district, has been arrested for attempting to rape two female students. Ghulam Mustafa Mughal allegedly tried to rape a nine-year-old student and a 10-year-old student.



The police said that the parents of the students caught him from the school and later handed him over to the police. An initial report of the offence was registered at the Sehwan police station.



The police later seized the principal's computer and laptop. The parents told the police that their daughters have been traumatized by the rape attempt and that they are too afraid to return to the school.



Although Mughal maintained while talking to the media that he is being falsely framed, the police said they had received similar complaints of harassment against this principal in the past as well.
