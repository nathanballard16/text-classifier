CAA stir: HD Kumaraswamy donates Rs 5 lakh each to kin of two killed in Mangaluru police firing

MANGALURU: Former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy handed over cheques of Rs 5 lakh each to the kin of Nauseen Kudroli , 23, and Jaleel Bengre, 49, who died in Thursday’s police firing during anti-Citizenship Amendment Act protests in Mangaluru.He also offered to take the responsibility of those who were injured in the lathicharge and police firing if the government did not come forward.Many innocents, including a student from Shivamogga who was on his way to apply for scholarship and a welder from Bihar, are in hospital with injuries, Kumaraswamy said, adding that no official had visited the hospital yet.The state president of JD(S), after visiting hospitals, where those injured in police firing and lathicharge are admitted, told reporters that the state government had lost its humanity. “The chief minister has not had the courtesy to visit those who are injured in the incident, and has forgotten his responsibility of immediately announcing compensation to the next of kin of those who died in the police firing. None of the government officials have visited hospitals to collect information about those who are injured, but the police attacked the hospital where the injured were admitted,” he said.On chief minister B S Yediyurappa announcing Rs 10 lakh compensation to the kin of two victims who died in police firing, Kumaraswamy said that he announced it only after HDK decided to visit Mangaluru.
