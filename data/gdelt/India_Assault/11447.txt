A man killed his 78-year-old wife over a property dispute by setting her on fire at their house in Kerala's Kottayam district on Monday.

According to reports, there was a long-standing dispute between the couple over their property. Varghese, who was working in Pune, had bought land in Manimala in his wife's name and constructed a house.

The couple has three children - two sons and a daughter. Shoshamma had given a portion of the property to her daughter without her husband's knowledge which was the root cause of the problem.

In March, the local police had also intervened in the dispute after the situation worsened between the couple. After that, Varghese went to live with his sons and his wife lived with their daughter. He recently returned to Kerala after which his wife also came back home.
