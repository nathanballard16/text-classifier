Nine killed as Indian security forces battle Kashmir militants after suicide bombing

Nine people including five troops died in a fire fight in India’s disputed Kashmir region on Monday, days after a suicide bomber killed 42 paramilitary force members in the insurgency-ridden state.

Police said the gun battle erupted after security forces surrounded Pinglan village in Pulwama district, 20 miles south of Kashmir’s summer capital Srinagar, following a tip-off that militants were hiding there.

As the forces launched search operations in the village, they came under heavy gunfire from militants hiding in a house. An Indian Army major, three other soldiers, a policeman, three suspected militants and a civilian were killed in the shootout.

Police said the two militants killed in the attack were involved in last Thursday’s bombing of the paramilitary convoy in nearby Awantipora, the deadliest single attack on the Indian security forces in nearly 30 years in Kashmir.

They claimed both of them were Pakistani nationals and members of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM or Army of Mohammad) Islamist group that has claimed responsibility for last week's bombing.

India holds the Pakistani military’s Inter Services Intelligence Directorate responsible for planning the strike that was executed by a 19-year old Kashmiri student from Srinagar.

"The ISI's fingerprints are all over the bombing as the 19-year old suicide bomber could not have organised such a major operation by himself" a senior security official said on condition of anonymity.
