Not scared, want to return to the sea: Naval officer Tomy

New Delhi [India], January 17 (ANI): "I would like to sail in the sea rather than sit on land", ace naval officer Abhilash Tomy, who was injured in an adventure race in high seas, said here on Thursday.

Talking to media, Tomy said: "I am almost 80 per cent recovered and would like to work on my fitness. It may take another six months but I do intend to go back to the sea".

Brushing aside the harrowing incident, the officer said: "I am neither afraid of the sea not hate it. I would love to go back to the sea than be on land".

The officer also thanked his family for encouraging him to return to the sea after the near death incident.

"I am grateful that I have such a supporting family," the sailor said.

The officer who loves sailing also had a suggestion for all, "Sailing should not be only for sailors but also for those who do not sail".

When asked about whether he had lost hope that he would not be saved, Tomy said: "I never had that I will not be rescued. I had faith in the sailing community."

He said that he was little disappointed that he could not make to the finish line.

When asked about what happened to his boat Thuriya, the officer said that "most probably she might have sank".

The Naval officer said that he was overwhelmed when he got a call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who enquired about his well being.

Tomy who was circumnavigating was hit by a extremely rough weather condition in the South Indian Ocean.
