Pakistan on Wednesday summoned Indian Deputy High Commissioner Gaurav Ahluwalia over alleged ceasefire violations by Indian forces across the Line of Control (LoC) which it said killed three civilians.

Mohammad Faisal, Director General at the South Asian desk of the Foreign Office, said that apart from the deaths, two civilians were also injured on May 2 and May 5 along the LoC.

"On May 2, 15-year old boy Tahir Hafeez was martyred, while his nine-year-old sister Tahira sustained serious injuries in the Rakhchikri Sector along the LoC," said a statement by the Foreign Office.

"Three days later on May 5, two innocent civilians, including a woman Nasreen Bibi and 12-year old Muhammad Zahid were martyred, while a woman Sonia Bibi sustained injuries,"said a statement by the Foreign Office.

It said that "the ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation".

Faisal urged the Indian side to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement and investigate the incidents of truce violations, the statement added.

He said the Indian side should permit the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan to play its mandated role as per the UN Security Council resolutions.
