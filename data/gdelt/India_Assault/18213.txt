On Sunday, attendants of a patient attacked a resident doctor in the cardiac ward. At that time, there was no guard. Now, deployment of bouncers will bring some relief to the doctors. We are also in talks with the hospital administration over other pending demands to strengthen the security measures,” said Dr Ajeet Bagra, president, Jaipur Association of Resident Doctors.Hospital administration accepted that a security agency, which had been roped in to take care of security, was not performing well. “The main reason for deploying the bouncers is that the security agency has failed to provide efficient guards. We cannot terminate the contract of the agency with immediate effect,” said Dr DS Meena , medical superintendent, SMS hospital.Dr Meena said the deployment of the bouncers was on a temporary basis and once the agency deploys efficient guards, these bouncers would be removed.The resident doctors had gone on day-long strike on October 28 after two resident doctors were beaten up by 10 attendants of a patient who died at the gastroenterologist ward. After the incident, the hospital took measures to intensify security measures for doctors in addition to installation of sirens and CCTVs.
