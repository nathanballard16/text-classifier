New Delhi: Days after a suicide bomber of the banned terror outfit, Jaish-e-Mohammad, attacked a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in south Kashmir, the Indian Air Force on Tuesday morning executed an air strike in Pakistan. The Indian Air Force carried out air strikes at multiple targets.

The terror camps at Balakot, Muzaffarabad, Chakothi across the LOC were completely destroyed after the Indian Air Force dropped 1,000 kg bombs in Balakot, Pakistan, destroying terror camps. The strike took place at 3.30 am. The terrorist camps belonged to the Jaish-e-Mohammad.

The Times of India reported that this is the first time that the Indian forces have acted across the Line of Control (LoC) since the 1971 war.

After JeM terrorists attacked India and took the lives of 40 CRPF jawans, the pressure on the Indian forces to act against Pakistan was constantly rising. The IAF aircrafts crossed the LoC in the 1971 war. Even during the Kargil war in 1999, the forces made a conscious decision to stay within the LoC, this air strike, however, came as an exception with the IAF aircrafts entering into Pakistan's territory and bombing terrorist camps.
