Lucknow: A Class 8 student was allegedly raped by her cousins several times for over two years within the school campus in Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh. The cousins were allegedly jealous of her being good in academics.

The crime reportedly came to light only after the accused uploaded the video clips on WhatsApp and forwarded to family members. The accused gang also included a teacher, who often participated in the sexual assault of the minor.

According to a report in The Times of India (TOI), the gang filmed every assault and some of these videos were circulated within the family members as well. After watching one of these videos, the family was informed about the incident and they lodged a complaint against all five accused in the case on Saturday.

The 16-year-old victim reportedly was sedated and then raped. A police officer told TOI that once the minor was sedated and the gang took chances to rape her. After she regained her consciousness, she was told that she fainted on the playground and hence she was brought to the staffroom.

The preliminary investigation by the police revealed that the accused cousins were jealous of her excelling in studies while they flunked their exams. They all lived together in a joint family and were often humiliated by other family members for failing in exams. Reportedly, the sexual assaults often happened during recess time and had been happening for the past two years. The accused used to offer food laced with sedatives to the victim in the school's staff room.

However, the girl's medical reports are still awaited. Further police probe in the case is underway.
