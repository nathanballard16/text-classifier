Twelve tourists including Brits were injured in a horror speedboat crash that killed the captain in southern Thailand.

Police Colonel Prasert Srikhunnarat, superintendent of marine police sub-division 8, said several vessels had been dispatched around the area of the crash.

He added: "Police divers are also searching for the missing crew member and the operation will continue until we can find him.

"There is a chance he is still alive. There are 12 divers involved with the search."

Kittipong Samanbut, the worried father of the missing crewman, said his son had only been working on the vessel for one month.

According to Bangkok Post, the speedboat captain was involved in a fatal crash at sea in 2014.

The speedboat collided with a fishing trawler off Krabi, killing two South Korean tourists and leaving a dozen injured.
