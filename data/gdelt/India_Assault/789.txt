BBMP panel poll held amid BJP boycott

Bengaluru: As the members of the BJP boycotted the standing committee elections, members of Congress and JDS coalition won unopposed to the 12 posts.

Vrushabavathi Nagar corporator Hemalatha Gopalaiah was elected as the chairman for the standing committee on taxation and finance.

Elections were postponed twice due to the ruckus created by JD(S) and BJP corporators. They tried to win plum posts by supporting each other, thereby hijacking the plans of the Congress-JD(S) coalition.

On Thursday too similar fights were expected, but this time elections were held in the Mayor's chamber as Mayor Gangambike realised that a third postponement will severely affect the plans of civic body in drafting the upcoming BBMP budget.

BJP candidates alleged that the Mayor was conducting the elections violating the Karnataka Municipal Councils Act, which governs the civic body, and boycotted the elections.

Each of the 12 standing committee will have 11 members. BJP said that at least six members should elect chairman, but only 4 or 5 were present to elect the chairman and Mayor Gangambike declared their names.
