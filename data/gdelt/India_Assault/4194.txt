Pakistan vows militant crackdown after Kashmir bombing

Dozens of members of militant groups have been locked up in a new security crackdown, including close relatives of the leader of the banned outfit claiming last month's Kashmir bombing, Pakistan said.

Pakistan's interior ministry said 44 members of proscribed organisations, including a brother and son of the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader Masood Azhar, were “taken into protective custody”.

The announcement came a week after India launched air strikes against what it said was a JeM training camp inside Pakistan plotting an imminent attack. The strike and a later jet dogfight brought the neighbours to their worst military confrontation in two decades.

Pakistan is widely accused of harbouring and sponsoring militant groups to project power in India and Afghanistan. Western officials have judged previous crackdowns to be mainly for show. JeM has been banned in Pakistan since 2002, but according to a US State Department assessment last year, it was still able to recruit, fundraise and train freely.
