Possible Terror Attack in South India After Boats Found Abandoned at Sir Creek: Army

Three weeks ago, Pakistan Army deployed its Special Service Group commandos along the Sir Creek area in Gujarat. Government sources had then told ANI that the post where the SSG commandos have been deployed is known as the Iqbal-Bajwa. The SSG commandos may be used for anti-India activities in the region, sources said. The SSG commandos are also said to be a part of Border Action Teams (BAT) known for carrying out ambushes against the Indian patrol teams along Line of Control. The development comes in the wake of India's decision to scrap Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

New Delhi: The Army on Monday said it had received inputs on a possible terror attack in south India after having found some abandoned boats at Sir Creek in Gujarat. “We have inputs that there may be a terrorist attack in the southern part of India. Some abandoned boats have been recovered from Sir Creek. We're taking precautions to ensure that designs of inimical elements and terrorists are stalled,” Lt Gen SK Saini, General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Army Southern Command was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. Sir Creek, a narrow marsh area, divides the Gujarat state of India from the Sindh province of Pakistan.
