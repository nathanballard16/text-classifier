HC orders IG to probe against SI accused of custodial torture

The Madras High Court on Thursday directed the inspector general (IG) of police, central zone, to conduct an inquiry into an allegation of custodial torture of a BJP functionary by a sub-inspector 15 years ago.

Justice V Bharathidasan, who disposed of the petition from G Tamilazhagan of Ariyalur Taluk, Perambalur district, seeking to initiate appropriate disciplinary action against an SI, said in his order that "the materials available on record prima facie show that the petitioner was subjected to custodial violence."



In 2004, sub-inspector G Kosalram in Perambalur district, along with constables, went to the petitioner's house in search of the latter's brother in connection with a case.

As the brother was not there, the policemen allegedly assaulted the petitioner in front of his family, stripped him to his undergarments and paraded him about 1 km through the village, took him to Vikrimangalam police station where he was again brutally assaulted and a criminal case was registered against him.

The petitioner was taken to the government hospital in Ariyalur wherein he was given treatment and was produced before the Judicial Magistrate at Ariyalur and remanded to judicial custody.

He then sent a complaint to the Magistrate on the custodial torture by the SI but no action was taken on his complaint, it was submitted.

The petitioner also submitted he was later released on bail. His representations to all higher authorities on the matter went in vain, he said.

Since the incident took place in 2004, the judge directed the petitioner to file a fresh representation before the IG within four weeks.

"..Thereafter the IG is directed to conduct an inquiry and pass final orders within a period of eight weeks," the judge said.
