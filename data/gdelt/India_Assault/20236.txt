Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had directed the ministers to visit the family of the victim, who died last night at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital. The 23-year-old woman was set ablaze by men accused of raping her when she was on her to attend hearing in the case on Thursday.

Following the gruesome incident, Yogi Adityanath government was slammed by the Opposition parties. Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, who visited the family member of the deceased Unnao rape victim, said that the accused had tortured her father and had been threatening her uncle for over a year.

"The family told me about the ordeal that they are going through since last year. The culprits have threatened and harassed them. They even threatened a 10-year-old in their family, and burned their farm," she said and asked authorities why no action was taken against the accused for harassing the family.

The Congress leader also claimed a connection between the ruling BJP and the accused. "Victim's whole family has been constantly harassed since last year. I have heard that the culprits have some BJP connection. That is why they were being shielded. There is no fear among criminals in the state," she alleged.

Former chief minister and Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav sat on a dharna outside the Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly in Lucknow, demanding the resignation of Yogi Adityanath. "The chief minister had said in this very assembly, 'apradhiyon ko thok diya jayega' (criminals will be shot), they could not save the life of a daughter," Yadav said.

Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh government has announced a compensation of Rs 25 lakh and a house for the kin of the deceased rape victim. Yogi Adityanath said that culprits will be punished and the case will be tried in a fast-track court.
