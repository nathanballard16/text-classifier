New Delhi: An Internal Complaints Committee of the Customs department has opened a probe into the sexual harassment allegations against two customs officials by an Uzbek woman. The woman had visited India in May when she allegedly faced sexual assault at the hands of officials at Indira Gandhi International (IGI) Airport.

In June, the two accused officials were suspended by the authorities pending an inquiry.

According to a report in PTI, the panel has started the probe under the provisions of The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013. The panel will look into allegations of sexual assault against the two officials and will come out with a probe report.

The matter was first reported by a whistle blower to airport authorities, who later started an inquiry into the matter.

The shameful incident happened during the woman's arrival in New Delhi from Tashkent in May this year. The woman had come to India for the treatment of her sister's child in Delhi.

According to the victim, a customs official took her to a room in the name of baggage checking. The officer, who was reportedly in his 50s, sat with the woman in the room for 30 minutes and allegedly assaulted her. The room allegedly had no CCTV cameras.

The victim also wrote a complaint to the revenue secretary explaining her ordeal and seeking a probe into the matter. According to reports, the victim had filed a complaint with the customs department at the IGI airport, but retracted it later after she was allegedly threatened she would be implicated in false cases of smuggling. The victim also reportedly faced a threat to her life by the accused customs officer.
