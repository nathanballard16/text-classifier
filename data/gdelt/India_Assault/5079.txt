Lawyers to boycott court proceedings

Vadodara: The lawyers’ body in Vadodara has decided to stay away from court proceedings on Monday after the Vadodara Taluka police station booked a female lawyer along with the president of Baroda Bar Association (BBA) in a case of robbery and assault.

After lawyers learnt that an offence was registered against BBA president Hasmukh Bhatt and the female lawyer, office bearers of the BBA held an urgent meeting in the bar room of the district court complex on Sunday and passed a resolution demanding that senior police officials conduct an enquiry and act against those who have given false complaint against Bhatt the female lawyer.

The woman lawyer had approached the police station on March 14 with a complaint of robbery, molestation and assault against her daughter in-law following a dispute between her husband and the daughter in-law. Since the offence was allegedly not registered, she called Bhatt to the police station to help her. Bhatt talked to senior police officials who agreed to register the case after conducting an investigation.

The lawyer’s case was registered on Saturday and two hours later a case was registered against the female lawyer and Bhatt. The lawyers’ body alleges that the second offence against Bhatt and the female lawyer has been cooked up by officials of the Vadodara Taluka police station.
