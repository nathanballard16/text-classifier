Members of Taranaki's Indian community gathered over the weekend for a vigil to remember lives lost in a deadly attack in their homeland.

On February 14, 40 Indian central reserve police force members were killed in the Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir in northern India after a suicide bomber attacked the group's convoy.

On Sunday night, 50 people gathered at New Plymouth's Huatoki Plaza to remember the dead.

President of New Plymouth's Indian community Ashwani Kumar said the group's thoughts were with the families of those who had lost loved ones along with the rest of India.

Due to bad weather, a candle light vigil could not take place but Kumar said those present used their mobile phone lights instead while they sang tributes in honour of those killed.
