Petrol bombs, wet blankets on tear gas shells: Cops say Jamia protests well-planned

The Delhi Police says Sunday's protests near Jamia Millia Islamia, one of the city's best known varsities, appear to have been well-planned rather than spontaneous.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police Kumar Gyanesh (South East) said he personally witnessed protesters placing wet blankets on tear gas shells to reduce their impact.

He also said demonstrators hurled petrol bombs at the police.

Such things don't happen on the spot, he told ANI, adding that it pointed to a conspiracy.

After Sunday's ugly outbreak of violence near Jamia Millia Islamia -- which the varsity's students said they had no hand in -- police entered the campus.

Testimonies from those present on campus at the time suggest the police targeted individuals indiscriminately, lobbing tear gas shells in a library and even attacking a cleric and a former Army man who works as a guard.

The police said they entered Jamia Millia Islamia's campus only to control the situation.

They said some of their personnel had been injured in attacks by protesters.

Nationwide protests against the police crackdown - some peaceful, some violent - erupted on Monday.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi called these demonstrations "deeply distressing" and appealed for peace.

Ten people have been arrested in connection with the violence near Jamia. None are students.
