Delhi HC provides protection to Jammu and Kashmir rape victim, husband

Relocated to the Capital as they fear threat to their lives

The Delhi High Court has given police protection to an alleged rape victim and her husband, who have temporarily shifted here from Jammu and Kashmir apprehending threat to their lives.

Justice Najmi Waziri directed the Deputy Commissioner of Police concerned to look into the matter and provide due protection to the couple.

The Justice also asked the police officers to give their numbers to them so that they can reach out for help in case of any exigency. The court was informed by the couple that personal circumstances forced them to leave their hometown. They also made serious allegations against a few police officers and political workers.

The couple claimed that the woman was allegedly physically assaulted and raped and the man was kept in detention for several days by the Jammu and Kashmir police. He is now out on bail, they said.

The court also asked the DCP to not disclose the couple’ address to any other person except the government counsel.

“The petitioners’ [couple] residence in the NCT of Delhi shall not be disturbed except by due process of law and with prior intimation to this court,” said Justice Waziri.

J&K High Court

The couple said they had approached the Jammu and Kashmir High Court in September 2018 seeking protection. The court then had directed the State to look into the matter.

However, they claimed that no protection was accorded to them and they apprehend a grave threat to their life, limb and liberty and were constrained to temporarily shift to Delhi.
