50-year-old sexually assaulted at Delhi shelter home

The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) said that it had an FIR filed for the sexual assault of a 50-year-old woman at a private shelter home in Delhi's Qutub Vihar.

A team of the DCW led by its member Promila Gupta had visited the shelter home on January 23. During the visit, many irregularities were found at the shelter home.

The number of inmates living in the home was more than the number mentioned in records of the home, the team found. It was also observed that the residents were punished for not doing the work assigned by the caretakers.

The 50-year-old victim told the DCW team that officials at the shelter home tortured and molested her. She said that she was stripped in front of shelter home workers and chilli powder and salt were inserted into her private parts. She also said the caretakers used to beat her regularly and on occasions poured hot water on her.

The DCW team alerted Delhi Police about it and the woman was then taken to a police station. After the DCW's intervention, an FIR was registered at the Chhawala police station under IPC Sections 354, 354B, 323 and 34.

The victim has levelled allegations against five people including a married couple. She was produced before a magistrate and is currently lodged at another shelter home.

The shelter home has had a dubious record. Earlier, the DCW rescued four minor girls from the same shelter home who were being sexually harassed. The commission has recommended that the shelter home's license be cancelled.

DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal said, "The condition of shelter homes across the country needs to be improved. The commission believes that people who commit atrocities on shelter home residents, like in this case, should be given the strongest punishment. Further, their license should be withdrawn."
