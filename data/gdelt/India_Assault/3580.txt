Chennai: A 37-year-old man in the area under Teynampet police station jurisdiction has been arrested for issuing a threat of planting a bomb in the Chennai Central (railway) Station. He had done this in an inebriated state to implicate his wife.

The Police Control Room received a call on Tuesday, and the male voice on the other side named a certain woman and alleged that she was planning to plant a bomb at the Chennai Central railway station. He disconnected the phone abruptly after claiming the bomb will explode in a few minutes. Taken by surprise, the police called up the explosive experts and the security at the railway station was also beefed up. Police used sniffer dogs to check throughout the station and ensure there was no bomb planted.

Following this, the cyber crime police helped in detecting that the call had come from a man named Saravanan from Teynampet area. It was on arresting and questioning him that the police learnt he was under the influence of liquor when he issued the threat to the Police Control Room.

His wife had fought with him when he was heavily drunk. He wanted to somehow implicate her in a legal complication and only with that objective, he had made that threat call. He has since been arrested and is being interrogated. Chennai Central is one of the most bustling locations in the city and a bomb threat there created quite a panic there.
