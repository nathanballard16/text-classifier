When would sexual relations induced on a broken promise of marriage amount to rape? SC answers

The Supreme Court has ruled that all broken promises of marriage would not fasten a charge of rape. If a woman’s consent for sexual relations is obtained on the basis of a genuine promise of marriage, it would be viewed as legally valid consent. In such cases, there would be no offence of rape if the promise of marriage made in good faith is subsequently broken.
