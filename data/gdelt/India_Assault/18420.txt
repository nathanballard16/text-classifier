PUSU Campaign Heats Up; Sitting President Beaten Up

Patna: Campaigning for the student union election of Patna University continues to heat up as candidates from various political outfits ratcheted up their canvassing efforts going from campus to campus seeking support for their candidates for various offices in the union.

Meanwhile, the Patna University central election committee on Thursday rejected nominations of seven aspirants on various technical grounds, including lying on their official papers.

Among the rejected applications, two were for the post of General Secretary, one for Joint Secretary, and the remaining four were for the council membership.

At some point before the election on December 5, there will be a live debate between all the hopefuls for the President's post.

Ironically, the incumbent President of Patna University Students' Union (PUSU) Divyanshu Bhardwaj was assaulted by a group of students of rival group in which he was seriously injured and had to be rushed to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) with gash on his head.

Two of Divaynshu's associates were also hurt in the attack just outside Patna Women's College where they had gone to campaign for the PUSU election.

Divyanshu, who was elected as an independent candidate, had later joined the Janata Dal – U. Today's assault is said to be carried out by the members of Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the student wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), though the BJP flat out denied its involvement in the incident.

Authorities are investigating the case.
