CBI books former Samajwadi Party MP Ateeq Ahmad over abduction of businessman

The Central Bureau of Investigation has booked former Samajwadi Party MP Ateeq Ahmad and his son Umer on the charge of plotting the kidnapping of a Lucknow-based businessman to extort money from him and take over his business.

According to the CBI, real estate dealer Mohit Jaiswal was abducted from Lucknow and taken to a jail in Deoria in Uttar Pradesh, where he was assaulted by Ahmad and his aides, who were lodged there, and forced to transfer his business to them.

Gangster Ahmad was an SP member in the 14th Lok Sabha from Phulpur from 2004 to 2009. Jaiswal had alleged that Ahmad, also a five-time MLA, was threatening him for extortion for the last two years.

The shocking nature of the crime had prompted the Supreme Court in April to order shifting Ahmad from UP to Gujarat. The top court also ordered that cases pending against Ahmad be expedited status reports quarterly to the Allahabad High Court.

The CBI said there were 109 cases registered against Ahmad between 1979 and 2019, including 17 murder cases, 12 cases under the UP Gangster Act, eight under the Arms Act and four under the UP Goondas Act. Eight cases, including two for murders, were registered against Ahmad between 2015 and 2019.
