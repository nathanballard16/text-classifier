Only PM with 56-inch chest could nullify Art 370: Amit Shah

KOLHAPUR: Union home minister Amit Shah credited "PM Narendra Modi with a 56-inch chest" for the nullification of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir saying none of his predecessors showed courage to take such a step."No other prime minister had the courage to abrogate Article 370. ...It was PM Narendra Modi with a 56-inch chest who showed the courage to abrogate Article 370," Shah said at a poll rally here.At rallies in Kolhapur and Sangli, Shah attacked NCP president Sharad Pawar for questioning the government's move on Kashmir saying the latter did not understand the pain of the families of 40,000 people who had lost their lives to terrorism."Kashmir was disconnected from India and Pakistan resorted to terrorist activities because of Article 370. Its nullification has made Kashmir an integral part of India," he said.The Union home minister also alleged that Congress leaders did not have a national security policy. "Rahul Gandhi opposed the nullification of Article 370. However, (then PM) Manmohan Singh never uttered a word when Indian jawans were beheaded by terrorists. It was only because of Modi's decision that the Indian Army opted for a surgical strike," he said.
