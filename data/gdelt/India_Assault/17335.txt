Indian Army Attacks 4 Pakistan Terror Camps: Dozen Terrorists Killed:- The Indian Army staged an artillery attack across the border on four terror camps which killed at least dozen terrorists along with six soldiers. The attacks were staged across the Neelam valley opposite to the Tangdhar sector. The artillery used in the Indian response has a range of 24-30km. This is a counter-attack by India after two Indian Army soldiers lost their lives along with a civilian on Saturday firing by Pakistan at Karnah in Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara district. Three others were injured in the incident.

Indian Army revealed that all the four terror camps were badly destroyed in the attack. The exact number of Pak terrorists killed in the attack are not known. The army chief briefed defense minister Rajnath Singh about the Indian response on Sunday. Singh congratulated General Rawat and his men for their actions against the terrorists. The development follows India’s August 5 measures to nullify Article 370 of the Constitution, stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status.
