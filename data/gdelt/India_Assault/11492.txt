Ahmedabad: Wife's family kills Dalit man in police presence

The brutal killing of Solanki – in the presence of police personnel – on Monday added to the growing statistics of gruesome crimes emanating from the country's caste divide. Six months ago, Solanki married his then girlfriend Urmilaben, from Darbar community that considers itself superior to Dalits, much against the wishes of her parents. "Urmilaben's father brought her to his home in Mandal taluka of Ahmedabad district saying her mother was ill," said Rajendra Asari, superintendent of police. "The officers then went inside Urmilaben's home and tried to persuade her father to send her back to Solanki," said Asari. Three years ago, seven members of a Dalit family were assaulted by a group of self-professed cow protectors in Una of Gujarat.
