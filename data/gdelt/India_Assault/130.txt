Lucknow: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has issued a stern directive to the state officials to resolve the growing nuisance of stray cattle by January 10. He has also said that those who come to rescue their cows should be heavily penalised for letting them roam around.

He had previously directed the officials to create a better shelter for proper care of stray cows. The CM has allotted Rs 10 crore to each of the 16 municipal corporations, and Rs 1.2 crore to every district for setting up gaushalas. He also said that proper fodder, shed and drinking facilities should be provided to the cows both in rural and urban areas.

His statements come in the wake of several instances of stray cattle going into farmer fields and destroying their crops. Farmers in Goari had locked more than 700 cows inside government schools and health centre on December 24 and 25. The school teachers were forced to conduct classes outside the school premises. "The cows are destroying crops. We've been demanding cow shelter from the government but no action is being taken," a farmer said to ANI.

Police officials who had gone in to rescue the cows inside the government school were pelted upon with stones by local residents. While the opposition parties have criticised the UP government for its 'misplaced priorities', the move to construct cow shelters will apparently be beneficial for farmers whose crops are destroyed by stray cattle.
