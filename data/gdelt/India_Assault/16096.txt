Young boys tortured in Kashmir clampdown as new figures show 13,000 teenagers arrested

A new report claiming thousands of Kashmiri children have been incarcerated has cast doubt on claims life is returning to normal in the state. After visiting Kashmir, activists found around 13,000 boys have been detained since its autonomous status was revoked on Aug 5.

The report, led by the National Federation of Indian Women, detailed claims that boys - some as young as 14 - had been imprisoned for up to 45 days.

It also claimed that families were paying up to 60,000 rupees (£678) for their children’s release.

The Muslim-majority state has been under a rigid curfew and communications blackout since Article 370 and Article 35A were removed last month.

The Jammu and Kashmir government said there is “no centralised figure” for numbers of Kashmiris who have been arrested during the crackdown.
