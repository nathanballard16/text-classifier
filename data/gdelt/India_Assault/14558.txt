Unnao case: court records statement of victim’s uncle

Recording remains inconclusive and will continue on September 2

A Delhi court on Wednesday recorded the statement of Unnao rape survivor’s uncle in the case in which expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar is a key accused.

District Judge Dharmesh Sharma was presiding over the in-camera hearing in the 2017 case of alleged kidnapping and sexual assault of the woman, who was a minor then, by the MLA.

The uncle of the rape survivor had been transferred to Tihar jail in Delhi from a prison in U.P. to ensure his safety. He has been convicted in a 19-year-old case and sentenced to 10 years in jail in a case filed by Mr. Sengar’s brother, Atul Singh.

The recording of the statement remained inconclusive and will continue on September 2.
