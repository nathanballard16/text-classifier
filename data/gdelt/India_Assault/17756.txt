Modi-Merkel Meet: German Chancellor Prioritised Profit Over People

In the face of massive profits, it seems virtually anything and everything that Modi does will fall under the category of an “internal matter for India.”

Modi’s actions in Kashmir and Assam are not enough to cause her to turn up her nose at him. Nor, indeed, does Merkel appear bothered that RSS (with the BJP as its front) rules India, despite the fact that the fascist paramilitary was founded in 1925 — the same year that Hitler published Mein Kampf, reformulated the Nazi party, and founded the Schutzstaffel — and developed with direct inspiration from the Nazis.

Today, supremacist violence is on the rise in Germany. The victims there are of the same category as the victims in India — minorities (often, but not always, Muslims) and immigrants. Just last month, on October 9, a gunman stormed a German synagogue, killing two people. In June, a neo-Nazi assassinated Walter Luebcke, a member of Merkel’s own party. It marked the first right-wing political murder of a German politician since the end of the Second World War.
