Ranchi: In the latest development in the Kochang gang-rape incident, a court in Khunti on Tuesday convicted six priests, one of the juvenile, members of the banned rebel outfit People's Liberation Front of India (PLFI) and Pathalgarhi leaders for the crime.

Kochang gang rape incident became national news when last year on June 19, five anti-human trafficking activists, who worked with an NGO supported by a Christian missionary, were abducted and taken to a nearby forest area where they were assaulted and raped brutally.

The accused even video-graphed the act and forced the victims to drink urine. The victims were released after three hours of torture. The abductors were armed men from RC Mission School in Khunti's Kochang block. As per the reports by the Hindustan Times, the prime accused, Father Alphonse Aind, who ran a missionary school, was convicted for cooking stories and not reporting or informing police about the incident.

Police told the media that besides Aind, the perpetrators, one of them being a juvenile, were members of the banned rebel outfit People’s Liberation Front of India (PLFI) and Pathalgarhi leaders.

The court has fixed May 8 to hear arguments on the quantum of the sentence which would be further announced on May 15. A charge sheet was submitted in September last year by the police and trial commenced on October 24 the same year.

The court of additional judge Rajesh Kumar convicted Aind under the relevant sections. He was charge-sheeted under Section 376 (D) 354 b, 363, 365, 341, 323, 109, 111 and 120 B of IPC and 67 and 67-A of IT Act 2000
