New Delhi: Four days after at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans were martyred in the dastardly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district, Times Now on Monday accessed a Bomb Data Centre report, which hints at a larger plot.

Interestingly, unlike what was believed so far, the blast did not happen because of the ramming of the explosive-laden SUV into the bus ferrying CRPF jawans, but there was a proper switch-enabled IED in place to trigger the huge quantity of explosives.

As per the report, the quantity of the explosive is believed to be between 75-135 kg and not all of which was RDX but ammonium nitrate base mixed with incendiary explosives and RDX is the configuration.

A larger conspiracy is believed to be behind the attack as the involvement of more sophisticated players is suspected. Right from the assembly of the device to making of a vehicle-borne IED, it all hinted at the involvement of more sophisticated players.

The explosives are believed to be assembled over a period of time, indicating the intelligence failure.

Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed responsibility for the attack. JeM terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar, who hailed from south Kashmir's Pulwama district, carried out the attack.

This was the first suicide car bomb attack in Kashmir since the 2001 strike on the Jammu and Kashmir Assembly in which 40 CRPF jawans were martyred.
