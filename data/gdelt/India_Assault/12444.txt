Opposition Leaders Unite in Delhi against Sexual Abuse Case in Bihar

Patna: Opposition leaders led by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejaswi Yadav gathered at Delhi's Jantar Mantar on Saturday to bring the Muzaffarpur girls' shelter home sexual abuse and rape cases on the national stage with an eye on the next year's Lok Sabha elections.

Yadav, who is hoping to expand his support base outside Bihar for a potential bigger role in the national politics, called the dharna of a smorgasbord of parties including Congress, Samajwadi Party (SP), Trinamool Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Loktantrik Janata Dal (LJD) and different shades of the Communist Party, to condemn heinous acts committed at the shelter home saying the whole thing was not only an embarrassment for Bihar for the entire nation and culprits should be hanged without any delay.

Besides the former Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar, among those present at the dharna included Congress President Rahul Gandhi, AAP leader and Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Trinamool leader Dinesh Trivedi, CPM General Secretary Sitaram Yechury, CPI's D Raja and Atul Kumar Anjan, and LJD leader and former Nitish Kumar ally Sharad Yadav.

Taking credit for forcing Nitish Kumar of breaking his silence over the Muzaffarpur rape case, the RJD leader said that instead of just saying that he was ashamed and pained by the horrific acts that took place in the girls' shelter home, he should take quick action and arrest the culprits and order them hanged without any delay.

Yadav also accused the Nitish administration of protecting Brajesh Thakur who ran the girls' shelter and failing to sack his own party leader and Social Welfare Minister Manju Verma whose husband Chandrashekhar Verma's name has cropped up among those who had visited the shelter for sexual activities.

Gandhi, who, by most estimates, is going to go against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and sitting Prime Minister Narendra Modi head to head in the 2019 Parliamentary elections, said that the Congress stood with the victims and their family members and the party was not 'going to back an inch' from the its stand on the safety issue of Indian girls and women.

The Congress chief also shot down any chance of an alliance with Nitish Kumar's JD-U in future saying he was proud to be standing with the opposition parties and its leaders and Nitish Kumar had no place in this grand alliance since he walked out of it at his own volition.

Kejriwal also demanded hanging by death for all the accused in the case within three months and demanded resignations of all who, despite knowing what was happening at the shelter, protected them from being brought to justice.

"One Nirbhaya brought down the UP government; now 40 Nirbhayas will wipe out the NDA from Bihar for the next 40 years," the Delhi CM said alluding to the much-publicized gang rape case of Nirbhaya, not the victim's real name, in Delhi in 2012.
