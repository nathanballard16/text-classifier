Three held for hatching conspiracy to kill businessman's son in Delhi

Inspired by crime shows on television, three men hatched a conspiracy and demanded ransom from a businessman after threatening him to kill his son in southeast Delhi, but were arrested, police said Thursday.

Vijendra Singh (22), Ritik Srivastava (19) and Amit Kumar Yadav (23), threatened the businessman and demanded Rs 30 lakh from him as ransom to earn quick money, police said.

The three were inspired by crime shows, police said.

On January 30, the complainant reported that when he reached near Palla in Faridabad, two bike-borne men broke the window glass of his car and fled the spot. After some time, he received a phone call from an unknown number wherein the caller demanded ransom of Rs 30 lakhs.

The caller also threatened to kill his son if the money was not paid, Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (southeast) Ghanshyam Bansal said.

As part of investigation, CCTV footage of the area was scanned and technical surveillance was also mounted, he said.

Based on a tip-off, police apprehended three persons on Sunday, he added.

During investigation, they revealed that they used to go to Palwal, Faridabad from Jaitpur in Delhi to mislead police and to make threatening and ransom calls, police said.
