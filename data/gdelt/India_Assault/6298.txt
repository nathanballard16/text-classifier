4 arrested for 'abducting' employer in India

The Bengaluru police arrested four employees of a private IT company for allegedly kidnapping their boss for not paying salaries for several months.

According to The Hindu, seven employees of the private firm – a start-up – abducted the 23-year-old owner Sujay and took him to a farm house.

They allegedly kept Sujay in confinement and tortured him demanding payment of their pending salaries. He was let off only after he promised to pay the salaries.

Sujay filed a complaint at the Halasuru police station following which four of the employees were arrested. The four have been identified as Sanjay, Rakesh, Niranjan, and Darshan.

Three others are yet to be arrested.

The Hindu reports that Sujay tried to take his own life after he returned home following his release and was rushed to the hospital. It was at the hospital that the police recorded his statement.

According to the Police, the firm was started in January but wound up in March due to financial loss.

Sujay had assured the employees that their salaries will be paid. He failed. It was then that the employees plotted to abduct him to recover dues.

The four accused have been remanded in judicial custody.

It is not clear from reports the total number of employees Sujay's firm had.
