Security agency owner booked for attempt to murder

He had allegedly assaulted two employees

The HSR Layout police are searching for the owner of a security agency who was allegedly caught on camera torturing and beating up two employees in his office.

The accused, Salim Khan, is the owner of Bangalore Security force. He is from Assam and was running the agency for two years.

He had employed a person from Assam, Farizuddin, who allegedly hatched a plan with his associate to abduct Salim Khan to extort money.

However, Farizuddin was exposed when other staff members heard him discussing the plan and brought it to the notice of Salim Khan who summoned them and allegedly assaulted the duo.

One of the staff members recorded the incident on camera and uploaded it on social media.

The police took up a suo motu attempt to murder case against Salim Khan.

On Tuesday, the police detained six staff members in connection with the case, but Salim Khan managed to escape.

Isha Pant, DCP (South East), said that efforts are on to track down the two employees who were allegedly assaulted by Salim Khan to ascertain the reason behind the attack.

Inquiries revealed that Salim Khan was earlier booked for assault and theft. The police are contemplating writing to the authorities concerned to cancel the licence of Salim Khan.
