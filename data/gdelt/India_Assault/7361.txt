Hyderabad: A 65-year-old doctor was arrested by the Chilkalguda police for sexually assaulting a woman patient who had gone to him for a consultation. He was sent to judicial custody on Wednesday.

Police said the victim was suffering from a skin disease for the last three months and consulted Dr Koshka Chandra Mohan at his clinic, Sri Homeopathy Clinic, in Malargadda, Chilkalguda, Secunderabad.

The doctor recommended medication and asked her to visit him again to check the progress of the medicines. Gopalapuram division assistant commissioner of police K Srinivas said, “On Wednesday when the victim approached the doctor to check the progress, Mohan asked her to come inside the check-up room. He checked the pulse and heartbeat, and after making sure that there was no one inside the check up room, he misbehaved with the victim.”

The woman was shocked and ran out of the clinic. She told her husband what had happened and the couple lodged a complaint with the Chilkalguda police.

The doctor was arrested from his residence in Padmarao Nagar, Chilkalguda, and sent to judicial custody.
