Gurugram: A manhunt has been launched in Haryana's Gurugram for a man who claims to be an 'occultist'. Police officials said that the suspect who identifies himself as Amit of Ballabhgarh in Faridabad allegedly raped a 27-year-old woman after she and her husband invited him to their home to perform a religious ritual to 'drive away their poverty'.

Assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Gurugram, Shamsher Singh told news agency PTI that the couple got acquainted with the accused who claimed to have 'divine powers' which is when they invited him to perform a religious ritual at their residence. The couple is facing financial duress and thought that the accused could bring peace to their lives which is why they shared their problems with him and he advised them to organise a religious ritual, added Singh.

The couple reportedly invited Amit to their home on Monday evening to perform the ritual. According to a complaint registered by the survivor, he sent her husband to the market to buy things he claimed were required for the ritual. Once he was alone at home with the woman, Amit raped her and fled the spot after threatening her of dire consequences if she were to share the incident with anyone.

However, the woman told her husband about the incident and the couple approached Gurugram police in order to file an official complaint in this regard. On the basis of their complaint, police have launched a search operation to nab the accused. More details in this regard are awaited.
