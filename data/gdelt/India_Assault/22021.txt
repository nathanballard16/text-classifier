Punjab: Bizmen flay PSPCL for seeking tariff hike

LUDHIANA: Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) which has been constantly under fire from city businessmen for various reasons has once again come under attack from businessmen after seeking revision in the power tariffs from Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC).PSPCL has recently filed a petition before PSERC for sanction to hike tariffs on the pleas of suffering losses. However according to businessmen if rates of power are hiked even by 1 paisa per unit it will prove to be huge setback for the industry.Speaking to TOI Sunil Mehra , state general secretary of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal , said “PSPCL is proving to be the biggest enemy of businessmen as every other day the department comes out with new plans to harass us. Few days ago they slapped backdated power factor penalties on us, prior to that there unauthorized use of electricity cases were made against businessmen and now they want to increase power tariff and loot us. Our association has decided to raise the issue with chairperson of PSERC and urge commission should not allow PSPCL to go ahead with its devious plan to hike the rates”According to Svinder Singh Hunjan, general secretary of Janta Nagar Small Scale Manufacturers Association (JSMA), “PSPCL has recently filed a petition before Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) demanding increase in the power charges for both industrial and domestic consumers. If PSERC allows this to happen it will prove to be disaster for us as our cost of production will be hiked significantly which is already rising day by day due to several factors. Moreover the rate of industrial power in Punjab is already very high as compared to other states, so we will not let this happen at any cost.”According to Inderjit Navyug, former president of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association , “It is very shocking how PSPCL has filed petition for tariff hike without even thinking about the consequences of this decision. On one side even after promising us state government has failed to provide us power for Rs. 5 per unit and three years have passed like this only, on the other side PSPCL is not leaving any chance to pass on the burden of its losses caused due to mismanagement on us. But this time businessmen will not sit silent and any kind of hike will be opposed by us even if we have to come on the streets or sit on hunger strike”
