Health Ministry drafts a bill to curb assault on doctors

In an attempt to deal with the cases of assault on doctors at a hospital, the Health Ministry has drafted a bill, according to which, anyone who attacks a doctor at a hospital, while at work, may be sentenced for jail for up to 10 years or fined Rs. 10 lakh.

The move comes after cases of assault on doctors on duty are increasing day by day. The Health Ministry said in a statement that it has become necessary to provide punishment for acts of violence and curb the assault cases.

The Health Ministry has asked public to give its feedback and suggest ways to improve the draft Healthcare Service Personnel and Clinical Establishments (Prohibition of Violence and Damage to Property) Bill, 2019. A Health Ministry official said, “We want to reduce increasing cases of violence against doctors. We are looking for suggestions on the draft legislation before the bill is finalised. The objections or suggestions may be forwarded within 30 days. The maximum punishment will be 10 years imprisonment with Rs. 10 lakh fine.”
