Delhi: Two senior citizens were found dead at their residence in Rana Pratap Bagh, North Delhi. The two deceased were siblings. The incident came to light on Wednesday, June 13. The police said that illness or heat could have caused the deaths.

The incident came to light after a relative of the deceased went to check on them. According to the police, the man was in his 90s and was paralysed. The man was allegedly dependent on his sister, who was in her 70s. It is being suspected that the sister passed away first.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (north-west) Vijayanta Arya told Hindustan Times,"It is possible that the woman died first leaving her older brother alone and with no one to tend to him. One or both the deaths could be due to illness or heat."

Preliminary investigation revealed that the two deceased did not have spouses. The police are yet to ascertain the exact causes of the deaths.
