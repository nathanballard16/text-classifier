Missing teenage factory worker found dead after 3 days

Ludhiana: An 18-year-old factory worker was found dead in Gurbakhsh Colony of Salem Tabri on Saturday evening, three days after he had gone missing. The decomposed body was identified from a tattoo inked on its arm. Though his family has alleged it to be a murder, police are waiting for the post-mortem report for further action.

The deceased has been identified as Jatinder Kumar (18) of Aman Vihar Colony of Jassiyan Road. He was a labourer at a knitwear factory in Kundanpuri. According to officials, Jatinder was missing since July 10, and the family had filed an FIR against unidentified accused for hiding him in a secret place on July 12 at Division 8 police station.

Salem Tabri SHO inspector Vijay Kumar said some commuters saw the body in a vacant plot and sounded the police. Rainwater was accumulated in the plot due to which the body got decomposed. It was impossible to recognize Jatinder, but his tattoo of JK (Jatinder Kumar) inked on his right arm helped in identification. Salem Tabri police thereafter transferred the case to Division 8 police station.

Investigating officer for Division 8, ASI Iqbal Singh, said Vijay’s father Ram Kishore Sahni stated that his son had gone to work on July 10, but did not return home. He called him at 9pm on the same day when his son told him that he was going towards Sherpur for some work. After that, Jatinder’s phone was switched off.

Ram Kishor alleged someone had killed his son and later dumped his body in the vacant plot of Salem Tabri. The ASI said the possibility of murder could not be ruled out, but the police will proceed further after getting an autopsy report. The autopsy will be conducted on Sunday.
