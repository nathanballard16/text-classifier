Meanwhile, BJP vice-president Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Sunday told Mr. Kamal Nath to resign as Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister before leading a CAA protest march scheduled in Bhopal on December 25.

Speaking at the BJP’s “CAA thanksgiving” programme, Mr. Singh said Mr. Nath, as Chief Minister, was holding a Constitutional post and the Act had been duly passed by Parliament and signed into law by the President.

‘Constitutional post’

“Kamal Nath is saying he himself will take out a march against the CAA. He should not forget he is holding the Constitutional post of Chief Minister. He is talking of opposing CAA, which has become law through a Constitutional process after approval of Parliament,” Mr. Chouhan, former CM of the State, said.

“If Kamal Nath wants to oppose CAA, he should first leave the Chief Minister’s post,” he said.
