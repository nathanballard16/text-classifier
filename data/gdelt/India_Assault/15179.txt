Ahmedabad: Teen stabs grandfather, mother helps him

A 15-year-old boy and his mother were arrested by the Rakhiyal police for stabbing a 63-year-old man to death on Friday.



As per police official, the incident took place in the Monogram Chawl of Rakhiyal area and the deceased is identified as Harikesh Sinh, a resident of Rakhiyal.



Harikesh's elder son, Sanjay is in jail for committing some other crime, while Sanjay's wife Anjali and 15-year-old son lived in the same house with his three other sons.



On Friday the accused were asked to move to another house by the victim Harikesh after constant fights between Anjali and daughters-in-law.



To sort out the matter, they were asked to move out. The dispute broke out after disagreement on household items.



As per police officers, while shifting their apartment, Anjali and son forcefully tried to take away the refrigerator. But the mother and son continued dragging the fridge outside the house.



This resulted in an argument between Anjali and Harikesh. Things took a violent turn when victim slapped Anjali. While seeing his mother being beaten up, her teenager son pulled out a knife from his pocket and stabbed Harikesh.



Even his uncle was attacked by the teen when he tried to stop him. Anjali then helped her son in stabbing Harikesh to death.



Harikesh died on the spot and meanwhile the mother and son duo was nabbed by their relatives.



The Rakhiyal police was informed about the incident and both were arrested from the spot.



MP Pathan, inspector of Rakhiyal police station said, "We have arrested both accused in the matter and further investigation is on. Primary investigations have revealed that after the husband went to jail, his wife and son were living with the husband's family. A petty fight over a fridge led to 63-year-old man's murder."
