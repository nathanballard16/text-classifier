Delhi: Man jailed for hitting tailor on head with wine bottle

A Delhi court sentenced a man to one-year imprisonment for breaking an empty wine bottle on the head of a local tailor, who tried to talk him out of his drinking habit.

As per court records, the complainant, Sumit, spotted the accused, Devender, outside a stitching factory in Outer Delhi’s Kanjhawala. As Devender frequently consumed alcohol and would abuse people under the influence, Sumit tried to talk him out of the habit. An enraged Devender dragged Sumit by his collar and took him to a vacant plot, where he broke an empty wine bottle on his head and bit his right bicep.

District and Sessions Judge Deepak Jagrota said “every endeavour shall be made that once a person has committed a certain offence, he may be allowed to correct himself and become a productive and proactive citizen of the country,” but added: “At the same time, as the human being has progressed, the crime has also progressed side by side. It also casts a burden on the courts to have a deterrent effect on citizens, so that they may not deviate from the path of righteousness…”

The judge went on to say, “The convict’s act shows he has no respect for the law of the land, and deserves appropriate punishment for the act he has done… the ill-action of the convict not only leaves an indelible scar on the victim’s family, but to some extent, he also puts his own family into a lot of trouble and peril.”
