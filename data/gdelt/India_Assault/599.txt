Rape Survivor Forced To Drink Poison For Refusing To Keep Matter Under Wraps

New Delhi: In a shocking case reported from the national capital, a 17-year-old rape survivor was allegedly forced to drink poison by two bike-borne men. The girl was returning home from her tuition in Dwarka's Hastsal area. The incident took place on Thursday evening.

According to news agency PTI, in the official police complaint, the girl alleged that when she was returning home two bike-borne men intercepted her way and threatened her of dire consequences if she gave statement against the rape accused in the court.

Shockingly, when the girl refused to do so the miscreants caught hold of her and forced her to drink poison. A senior police officer told the agency that the accused duo fled the spot after the incident.

The girl in a semi-conscious state went to Deen Dayal Upadhyay hospital in an autorickshaw. The police officials mentioned that she was now out of danger. The survivor approached the police and a case was registered against the two men in Uttam Nagar police station.

The officer told the agency that prima facie it appears that the associates of the rape accused might have tried to poison her to stop her from giving testimony in the court.

However, the rape accused recently came out on bail. And a case of kidnapping and rape was registered against him at Ranhola police station in 2018, police said.
