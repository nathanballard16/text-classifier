JD-U Youth Wing Demands Resignation of Tejaswi Yadav

Patna: Members of the youth wing of the Janata Dal – U in Patna on Friday took out a rally to demand resignation of Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader and the Leader of the Opposition in Bihar Assembly Tejaswi Yadav accusing him keeping Mani Prakash Yadav, an accused in a flesh trade case, as his personal secretary.

The march began at the JP Roundabout near Hotel Maurya and ended at the Kargil Chowk at the opposite end of the Gandhi Maidan.

Protestors said police had filed a case against Mani Prakash Yadav with the Gandhi Maidan police in 2011 in connection with his alleged involvement in running a prostitution ring.

"The leader of the opposition himself remains accused in multiple cases of fraudulent land deals. His assistant Mani Prakash Yadav is an accused in flesh trade. His own father is a convicted criminal and is a jail bird in Jharkhand. RJD legislator Raj Ballabh Yadav is also out on bail on rape charges. Tejaswi Yadav should tell what actions were taken against these people and why they continue to be members of the RJD. They all need to resign now before they seek resignations of NDA leaders on moral grounds," protestors said.

As noted, RJD and other opposition leaders have been demanding resignation of Chief Minister Nitish Kumar and Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi in the aftermath of Muzaffarpur girls' shelter sexual abuse case that is now being probed by the CBI under the watchful eyes of the Patna High Court.
