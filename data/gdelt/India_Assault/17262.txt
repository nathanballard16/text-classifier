Kamlesh Tiwari murder case: Gujarat ATS probing Pakistan link in killing of Hindu Samaj Party leader

The probing agencies are investigating Pakistani link in the Kamlesh Tiwari murder case, a Hindu Samaj Party leader who succumbed to injuries after he was attacked at his office in Lucknow on Friday.

The investigation in the case is being done by UP police, Gujarat ATS. Also, an SIT has been formed to investigate the case.

On Saturday, the Gujarat ATS had detained three people in the case who later confessed to the crime.

Two others people were also interrogated after a complaint registered by Tiwari's wife who alleged that one of them — a Maulana — had in 2015 announced Rs 51 lakh reward on beheading Kamlesh Tiwari.

For now, the Gujarat ATS is probing the Pakistani link in the murder case.

The three accused who have been arrested in a joint operation by UP Police and Gujarat ATS were identified as Maulana Mohsin Sheikh, Rasheed Ahmed Pathan, and Faizan.

As per the initial investigation, probing agencies are suspecting that Rasheed is the mastermind of the crime.

He used to work in a Dubai company that is owned by a Pakistan national.

Also, the Maharashtra ATS has detained one person in relation to Tiwari's murder case and is being interrogated.

Tiwari's wife and family yesterday said that they won't be performing Kamlesh's last rites till UP CM Yogi Adityanath pays a visit.

Kamlesh Tiwari, a Hindu Samaj Party leader was also a former member of Hindu Mahasabha.

Speaking to media on Saturday, UP DGP OP Singh said, "Prima facie this was a radical killing, these people were radicalized by the speech that he (Kamlesh Tiwari) gave in 2015, but much more can come out when we catch hold of the remaining criminals.”

“All the security arrangements were made, he (Kamlesh Tiwari) was given a gunner and a policeman, both were there with him. There was no laxity on the part of the police administration,” he added.
