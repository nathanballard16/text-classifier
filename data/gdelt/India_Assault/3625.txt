Mumbai: The Shivaji Park Police has arrested a courier boy after he attacked two women with ball pen. The accused, identified as Ibrahim Sheikh, 27, had gone to deliver a parcel in the Gurukrupa building in Dadar.

The woman who was receiving the parcel, identified as one Sujita Pednekar, asked him for a pen to sign in Marathi. The accused told her that he doesn't understand Marathi and asked her to talk in Hindi. To this, the victim asked him how he couldn't know Marathi despite living in Mumbai.

This led to an altercation between the two as the accused replied to her saying that he is just a delivery boy and he is not liable to listen to anything she is saying, a police officer reportedly told Mumbai Mirror.

According to the victim, he then punched her in the head and started abusing her. "My sister Vinita came out to inquire what the matter is when he attacked her with a pen on her face," said Pednekar. She added that they called on the neighbours for help and that's when they nabbed the courier boy.

Sheikh was taken to the Shivaji Park police station where he was booked under IPC section 323 (assault), 324 (assault with a knife), 354 (molestation), 506 (intimidation), and 509 (act intended to insult the modesty of a woman).

Ibrahim is a native of West Bengal. He currently lives in the Matunga. He told the police that he came to Mumbai a month ago. The Police has made an arrest in the case.
