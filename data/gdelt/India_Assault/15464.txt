WAR: Tiger Shroff is set to create new benchmark in action with his upcoming film

Mumbai: Tiger Shroff who is known for his power-packed action films is all ready to set the silver screen on fire once again with his upcoming film 'WAR' where the actor would be seen showcasing some serious amount of action scenes.

Tiger Shroff who already has an action franchise 'Baaghi' under his name is rightfully hailed as 'the youngest action star' and with this upcoming film of his, we can just expect this title to be further justified.

In the trailer, the actor can be seen ushering in a larger than life appeal with the right amount of aggression that he has fabulously emoted to the chasing cars and machine guns. Adding to the wow factor is Tiger Shroff's well-maintained physique and irresistible hot looks. Tiger Shroff nailing the punches, sidekicks and defences like a pro is yet another proof of his passion towards martial arts and action films.

The Indian audiences will see the actor packing a punch once again with ‘War’ and be proud that an Indian actor is doing what a big-budgeted Hollywood actioner delivers. The mega action star has repeatedly been known to acknowledge how action films have given him an identity and how he enjoys doing them, thoroughly. The talented actor works really hard on his fitness and martial arts skills which is evident enough from the stunts he managed to pull off in each of his films without taking the help of a body double.

After the humongous success of Baaghi 2, Tiger Shroff will be next seen in War with Hrithik Roshan, Baaghi 3 and the official remake of Rambo.
