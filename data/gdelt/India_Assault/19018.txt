The 26-year-old’s burnt body was found on the outskirts of Hyderabad. According to Cyberabad Police, the victim was returning home from her clinic a little after 8 pm when she noticed a flat tyre and called her sister, who suggested that she leave her two-wheeler at the toll plaza and take a cab home. But before she could, she was approached by two men, who offered to take her vehicle for repair, police said.

I am shocked beyond belief to know the monstrous rape and murder of #PriyankaReddy in Hyderabad. I can't even imagine the extent of violence unleashed on this young girl. My thoughts and prayers are with the bereaved family.

The victim reportedly agreed, and as she waited for the men to return, she was ambushed and dragged into the bushes barely 50 metres from Tondupally toll plaza, behind a line of trucks that obscured visibility from the road, police said.

According to police, after killing her, the accused took her body to an under-construction bridge a few kilometres away, and set it on fire. According to an officer, innerwear found around 100 metres from the spot has led police to believe she was sexually assaulted.
