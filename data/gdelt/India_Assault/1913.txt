Hotel staff in Delhi assaulted for serving cold food by groomâ€™s friends, complaint filed

New Delhi:

Indian weddings and dramas, they never cease to amaze us for good or bad. This particular wedding in Delhi, however, grabbed attention for the latter after what was supposed to be the ‘happiest day’ turned hellish when the guests were served cold food. According to reports, the wedding havoc occurred at the Piccadily Hotel in Janakpuri, where some guests of the groom went bonkers on receiving cold food. Taking matters of the hotel services into their own hand, some guests at the wedding resorted to venting out their dissatisfaction by smashing the hotel’s crockery and trashing the hotel's staff even resulting to several head injuries. The bridegroom sure must have regretted not filtering the guests with the incident!

Hindustan Times (HT) reports that the Deputy Commissioner of Police, Monika Bhardwaj said that the violence allegedly started after the guests accused the staff of having served 'cold' food. The hotel's manager, however, has denied all allegations and instead claims that the groom's friends misbehaved with the hotel's female staff members.

Following the incident, general manager, Rajesh Batla in a statement claims that the groom and his friends fled the spot without attending the ceremony. Although no identity of the wedding crashers has been revealed to the public, police are reported to have detained two guests from the spot.

The hotel authorities are reported to filed a written complaint at the police station and arrested several of the guests on Monday.
