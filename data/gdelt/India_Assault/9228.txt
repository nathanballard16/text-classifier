He allowed the regularization even after the deadline for applications to regularize was over.Jayesh Solanki, who was also the executive engineer of Varachha zone and at presently posted in Rander zone, had shown criminal negligence by allowing the illegal floor and issuing issuing certificate of regularization (COR). “By doing this, he showed wrongfully obtained impact fee certificate as a valid one,” Sharma said.Naik of DGVCL showed dereliction in duty and criminal negligence as he didn’t care to check if the electricity connection for tuition class was legal or not.“When customers asked for electricity from transformer and particular fuse, he didn’t check its legality and didn’t shut the power for long time even after the fire broke out.
