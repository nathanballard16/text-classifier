US Congress ups pressure to end blockage in Kashmir

WASHINGTON: US Congressional pressure is increasing on India with regards to the situation in Kashmir Valley even as New Delhi is signaling that it is easing restrictions while maintaining that its priority is to prevent violence and loss of life even if it means provisional curtailment of civil liberties in some areas.Two prominent Democratic Senators and the House Foreign Relations Committee have expressed disquiet over the past 24 hours at the slow pace of normalization while implicitly accepting constitutional changes New Delhi has effected to mainstream the erstwhile state where a few districts are sporadically wracked by separatist violence and terrorism The criticism, stemming from constituent pressure and lobbying by Pakistanis, Kashmiri expats and human rights activists, has been respectful of New Delhi’s position, and generally in line with the position of the US government, which has also urged a speedy return to normalcy while not opposing India’s move to end special status for Kashmir.Democratic Senators who expressed concern about the situation included Presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) and Virginia Senator Mark Warner.The Democrat-led House Foreign Relations Committee has also pitched in, saying in a tweet on Monday that “India’s communication blackout in Kashmir is having a devastating impact on the lives and welfare of everyday Kashmiris,” and it’s “time for India to lift these restrictions and afford Kashmiris the same rights and privileges as any other Indian citizen.”The committee’s statement seeking normalization while implicitly recognizing the validity of New Delhi’s move generated pushback from India partisans who pointed out that abrogating Article 370 was aimed at giving Kashmiris the same rights and privileges as any other Indian citizen.Similar pushback followed a tweet by Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Warren who prefaced her statement saying “The US-India partnership has always been rooted in our shared democratic values,” while expressing concern about recent events in Kashmir, including a continued communications blackout and other restrictions. The rights of the people of Kashmir must be respected, she added.When Warren followed it up with a separate tweet about gun violence in the U.S (following another mass shooting in Kansas) and the need for action to end gun violence, she was reminded by pro-India activists that she should allow New Delhi to take steps to curb violence and terrorism even if it meant provisional curtailment of communications, which was in any case restricted to a few districts in the Valley.“J&K is a diverse area with many religions, backgrounds, classes. India and the region can’t allow Taliban and similar groups to terrorize Kashmiris,” she was told by one critic. Indian officials have been making their case along these lines in meetings with lawmakers.Several US lawmakers, while expressing concern about the communications blockage in the Valley, have indicated that as long as India normalizes the situation quickly, they have no problem with New Delhi’s effort to change the status quo. “While I understand India has legitimate security concerns, I am disturbed by its restrictions on communications and movement within Jammu and Kashmir. I hope India will live up to its democratic principles by allowing freedom of press, information, and political participation,” Virginia Senator Mark Warner tweeted.US lawmaker concerns are typically driven by pressure from constituents. Pakistan has mounted a concerted effort to press lawmakers using not only its expat community but also drafting disaffected Kashmiris and malingering Sikh separatists to its cause, even as India is pushing back through offshore nationalists with its own version of events.So while Pakistan partisans are advertising the fact that House Foreign Relations SubCommittee on South Asia has scheduled a “hearing on Kashmir” on October 22 and are hoping to put India on the mat on the occasion, Indian activists are pointing out that the hearing is on “Human Rights in South Asia,” and aside from the focus on the situation in Kashmir Valley, the committee has also said in a September 20 statement that the “hearing will also focus on the Tamils of Sri Lanka, the human rights situation in Pakistan, including the Sindh Province and Muslims in Assam.In fact, Indian activists, seeking scrutiny of the human rights situation in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (POK), Gilgit-Baltistan , Balochistan, and Sindh, are also pressing for witness testimony from these regions, in addition to having from Muslim, Hindu, and Buddhist representatives from Jammu and Kashmir testify at the hearing. The witness list has not been announced so far, but the principal witness is likely to be Alice Wells , the State Department's pointperson for South Asia.
