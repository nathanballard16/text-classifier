Hyderabad: On Friday night, the partially burnt body of a woman was found in Shadnagar area of Hyderabad. According to a recent development, the police have identified the deceased. The police have said that it appears to be a case of suicide. Initially, the cops were suspecting it to be a rape case.

The body was found two days after the gang-rape and murder of a veterinary doctor took place in the same area. Both the incidents sent shock waves across the country. Several protests are being held all across the country, demanding strict action against those persons involved.

Around two days ago, four persons allegedly gang-raped a 27-year-old doctor and murdered her in Shadnagar, Hyderabad. The woman had parked her two-wheeler near the Tondupally toll plaza and booked a cab to go to a dermatologist in Gachibowli. The woman visited the dermatologist and came back to the same spot in a cab.

When she returned, the doctor noticed that the tyre of her scooter had been punctured. Allegedly, the four accused had seen the doctor when she was parking her vehicle and had slyly deflated her tyre while she was gone. One of the accused then offered to lend a helping hand to the 27-year-old woman. At around 9.30 pm, the veterinary doctor had called her sister and had told her about the incident. The 27-year-old also told her sister that a local had offered to help her.

As the doctor did not see any other alternative, she accepted the truck driver's help. Following this, two truck drivers and two cleaners gang-raped her, strangled her to death and set her ablaze. The accused were arrested around two days after the incident.
