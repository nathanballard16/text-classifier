Thiruvananthapuram: In light of recent instances of sexual assaults involving church personnel in the state, the Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) have issued guidelines aimed at curbing such incidents. These norms were released after the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India (CBCI) directed concerned state bodies to ensure a safe environment for minors and 'vulnerable adults' at Christian institutions.

All Catholic presbyteries, churches, educational and religious institutions under the care of the KCBC have been issued these guidelines, said a report by Indian Express. It is also being speculated that this move could have been prompted by the emergence of allegations of sexual assault against former Bishop of Jalandhar Franco Mulakkal. A nun with the congregation, Missionaries of Jesus, had accused Mulakkal of confining her to a convent in Kerala's Kuravilangad and raping her on multiple occasions between 2014 and 2016.

However, a key official with the KCBC has claimed that these guidelines were issued in July of last year, much before allegations of rape surfaced against Bishop Mulakkal. A commission secretary, Father Jolly Vadakken told the national daily that respective bishops and dioceses along with priests have been notified about the guidelines.

In addition, the Church body has also asserted that it has zero tolerance for those accused of sexual assault. Any such cases must be reported to the concerned church and civil authorities, said the body. In fact, these guidelines among other directions, also instruct personnel to exercise a 'high degree of caution' in matters of physical contact between adults and minors.
