The boy gave his statement to the police that he was kidnapped by 4 men as he was walking on Dudahari bridge. He was forced to chant ” Jai Shri Ram” and when he refused to do so, they poured kerosene on him and set him on fire.

The boy has suffered 60% burns and his condition is said to be critical.

The police however are suspicious about the boy’s statement while a senior police officer has said that he is not aware of the incident.
