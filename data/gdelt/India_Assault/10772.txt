The police in Karnataka on Thursday arrested 45-year-old Anand, an RTE activist and president of a pro-Kannada organisation Kannada Siri Sene, for allegedly raping a woman for five days. The accused is currently in judicial custody. The police said that a medical test has been conducted to establish the crime.

According to reports, Anand, a resident of Harohalli in Ramanagara near Bengaluru had befriended the woman (28) when she approached him for his help to find a seat for her son at a private school. Anand had then sexually harassed her and photographed the entire incident. To keep it under wraps, Anand threatened the woman not to approach the police and said that he would upload those images on social media. He also threatened to kill her if she spoke about this to anyone or if she filed a complaint.

Despite the threats, as soon as she left his house, the survivor approached the Byadarahalli Police Station and lodged a complaint. Based on this, the perpetrator was arrested and later produced in court.

In her complaint, the woman said, “He told me to do his household chores, including cooking and washing utensils. Since he had promised me the school seat, I followed his instructions. It was late by the time I finished and he asked me to spend the night there. I slept in the hall. Around midnight, Anand forcibly took me to his room and raped me. He locked me inside the house till June 15 and repeatedly raped me every day. He threatened to kill me and my daughter if I told anyone or filed a police complaint.”

According to the latest statistics from state police, there were 44 rapes committed in the month of May, eight more than May 2018 and six more than April 2019.
