Farmers clash with U.P. police

They are demanding better compensation for their land

Farmers, demanding better compensation for their land acquired for a residential project here, clashed with the police on Saturday when government officials visited the site to clear encroachment.

Several injured

Several farmers were injured as police lathicharged the protesters, used tear gas and water cannons. Many policemen, including the Additional SP, were also injured as the protesters threw stones at them, District Magistrate Devendra Kumar Pandey said.

The farmers are demanding better compensation for their land acquired for the Trans-Ganga City project, an upcoming township near Kanpur.

Mr. Pandey, however, said the farmers have been adequately compensated.

“There is a faction of anti-social elements who are misleading the farmers and others for their selfish motives, despite the fact that their grievances have already been resolved,” he said.

Two arrested

Those who threw stones are mostly anti-social elements, Mr. Pandey said, adding that two people have been arrested in connection with the incident.

Local BJP MLA Pankaj Gupta, who went to the spot on coming to know of the clash, asked officials to resolve the matter.
