SURAT/RAJKOT: A couple was arrested from Khakhareji Gate locality in Morbi on Saturday for allegedly abducting an 11-year-old boy from Tatithaiya of Surat and demanding ransom of Rs 5,000.Police investigation revealed that the accused couple had kidnapped the child in a fit of rage after they fought with his family members. The accused and the child’s father, Nandkishore, are textile mill labourers, who are also related besides being neighbours.Police said the accused, identified as Shivbabu Yadav (28) and his wife Ranidevi Yadav (25), had kidnapped Sachin Yadav from Kadodara GIDC in Surat on September 28 afternoon. However, the offence was registered by Sachin’s father only on Saturday after he got a ransom demand for Rs 5,000 on Friday night.Kadodara police traced the Yadav couple to Morbi on basis of their cellphone location. After locating them, Kadodara police alerted Morbi A division police station of the crime."We traced their cellphone location and checked CCTV footage of the area in which the couple was clearly visible along with the kid. When we arrested the duo, they confessed of abducting the boy for their altercation with his parents," said an official from Morbi A division police station.After arresting the couple and securing the custody of the boy, the Morbi A division police station handed them over to Kadodara police.Police investigation revealed that, Sudhir, nephew of Nandkishore, had complained about the Yadavs to the property owner where they lived and stated that the duo fought with all other neighbours. Following the complaint, Rani fought with the child’s mother, Gaura, and other family members on September 26. After this, the duo then hatched a plan to take revenge by kidnapping the child on September 28.When Nandkishore learnt that his child was with them, he contacted the duo, who told him that they had taken him on a tour and will return soon. The couple even allowed Nandkishore to talk to his child over phone due to which he did not approach the police earlier.“Since the child knew the couple, he went along with them. The father came to the police only when the accused demanded him money,” said Kadodara police official.
