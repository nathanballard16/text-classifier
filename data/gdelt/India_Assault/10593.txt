Gurugram June 25 : Two cattle smugglers were allegedly assaulted by a mob and later handed over to the police in Gurugram's Islampur area on Tuesday.

The incident came to light when a group of cow protection unit of Gurugram received a tip-off about a gang trying to sneak in with a beef consignment.
