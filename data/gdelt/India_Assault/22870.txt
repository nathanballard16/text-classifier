VADODARA: Twenty months after he looted a couple in Navlakhi compound, the special operations group (SOG) arrested 22-year-old Sanjay Jakhaniya from Dumad crossroads on national highway 8 on Thursday.

Sanjay, who originally belongs to Rajkot, was in possession of the cellphone that he had looted from the couple in May last year.

The police said that they had been on Sajay’s trail with the help of IMEI number of the mobile phone he had looted. SOG officials said that Kisan Solanki, who was arrested earlier this month in the sensational gang-rape committed in Navlakhi, too was involved in last year’s loot. Kisan, Sanjay and Vanraj Sadhmiya had approached the couple in May, 2018 posing as security officers.

The trio first threatened the couple and then looted their mobile phone, gold chain, two silver rings and some cash from them before fleeing from the spot.

The boy had filed a police complaint in Raopura police station but the case remained unsolved till Kisan was arrested in the rape case. He told the cops that his relative had looted the couple last year.

The police had left for Madhya Pradesh to track down the accused. The police is now looking for Vanraj. Like Kisan, Sanjay too is a balloon seller and was staying in Tarsali until last year.
