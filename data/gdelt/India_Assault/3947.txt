CHENNAI: The Chennai city police arrested a man on charges of murder after he stabbed a woman to death in Guindy on Friday night, for calling off his wedding with her daughter. The incident occurred when Vinod (27), resident of Masoodi street in Guindy, had gone to visit his fiancée, Jeevitha's house.

Revathi had called off Vinod's wedding with her elder daughter two months ago as she came to know of his gambling and drinking habits. Vinod and Jeevitha had been in a relationship for over five years prior to their engagement. They were engaged in March last year, and were to be married in November, but everything collapsed.

"Even after the wedding was called off, Vinod used to pester the family often. The family had even complained to the All Women Police Station in Guindy, following which he was called to the police station and warned," a source close to the family said.

In order to prevent Vinod from constantly pestering her daughter, Revathi put Jeevitha in a hostel three days ago. Unable to contact Jeevitha, Vinod continued to pester Revathi for Jeevitha's phone number and address, but she did not yield.

On Friday night, when Revathi was returning home from work in a private firm in Guindy, Vinod cornered her and again asked her to give him Jeevitha's phone number and address.

Revathi refused, and an argument broke out. Vinod, who was on his bike, slashed Revathi with a knife and fled the scene. Revathi started bleeding profusely and died on the spot, police sources said.

Guindy police were immediately alerted, who rushed to the spot and arrested him under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (murder).
