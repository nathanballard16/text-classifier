Woman, 24, is kidnapped, drugged and becomes pregnant after being repeatedly gang-raped in India

A young woman was kidnapped by four men for more than a month and became pregnant after being repeatedly gang-raped, it has been alleged.

The woman, aged 24, claims she was fed sedatives every day so that she could be gang-raped when kidnapped for six weeks in Behror, near Rajasthan in India.

She claims the men gang-raped her before robbing her of 6,000 Indian Rupees (almost £70) and her jewelry, a police officer told The Times of India.

She was then taken to a different location and was raped at many locations, according to the police officer. The woman has now fallen pregnant after her ordeal.

The woman was taken from her home on Saturday, July 20th, and her husband filed a missing person report to police on the same day.

She managed to escape from her captors after being kidnapped for more than a month.

The local police force are now appealing for four men- named as Anil Kumar, Dayanand, Ram Avtar and Rohtash to come forward in connection with the incident.

The men have since fled and police are looking to find the four men.
