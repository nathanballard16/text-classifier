Chennai: The Kancheepuram police have launched a search operation for a 28-year-old man, who allegedly raped a class 12 girl on the pretext of marrying her and later fled.

According to the police, Boopathi, (28), was an auto-rickshaw driver from Chengalpattu. Sources said Boopathi had developed a relationship with a 17-year-old girl from the same locality who used to travel to school in his auto.

Meanwhile, on February 16, he had picked up the girl from school on his two-wheeler and the duo did not return to the village until the next evening. Since the girl and Boopathi were distant relatives, the boy’s family had promised to get him married to the girl when she came of age.

However, on February 19, the family left the village and they were nowhere to be seen, the police said. Realising that they had been cheated, the girl’s father lodged a complaint at Chengalpattu all women police station. "We have retained Boopathi’s younger sister who was studying in a college in a district nearby. She was about to leave the college hostel when we reached the place," said the police.

Preliminary investigations revealed that the family had moved out of Kancheepuram and a team of police are tracking the mobile numbers to nab the suspect and the family. Further investigations are on.
