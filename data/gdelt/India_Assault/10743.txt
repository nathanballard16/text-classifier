The CBI on Thursday filed a fresh charge sheet against self- styled godman Virendra Dev Dixit, who ran an ashram in Rohini in Delhi, in a case of rape of one of his followers, officials said.

In its charge sheet filed in a special court, the agency has accused the absconding Dixit and his associate Gyaneshwari Mali of drugging and raping the follower between 2011-15, they said.
