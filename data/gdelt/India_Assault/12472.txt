Two women attacked, robbed in Fatehgunj

VADODARA: Despite frequent claims of heightened nigh patrolling by the city police, robbers and goons seem to be operating fearlessly in several areas.Two women had traumatic experience when they were attacked and robbed of their mobile phones and wallets near Shastri Bridge late on Saturday night. The victims, who are affiliated with Hindu Jagran Manch, have been identified as Megha Purohit and Sushma Solanki. The duo suffered injuries on their faces, legs and arms and are undergoing treatment at the SSG Hospital.According to police, the women were returning home from Fatehgunj police station after counselling a 17-year-old girl who was allegedly abducted by a youth on the pretext of marrying her. When they reached the Shastri Bridge, two bike-borne robbers kicked their scooter. When the women fell down, the two men snatched their wallet containing Rs 1,500 in cash and debit cards and their two cellphones.The victims told police that the robbers beat them up when they resisted the loot bid and fled on their motorcycle.A police official said that they are searching for the accused through CCTV footage. “Prima facie it doesn’t appear to be a pre-planned conspiracy. The robbers targeted the women as the area is deserted and the two women were alone,” the police official said.
