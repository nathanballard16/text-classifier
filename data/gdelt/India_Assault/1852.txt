NYT prominently covers Kerala nun rape, says 'Catholic bastion in India' shaken

On 10 February, the story was on the front page of the international edition of the New York Times highlighting the nuns’ plight against an all-powerful figure.

Bishop Mulakkal, a senior member of the Roman Catholic clergy in India, was arrested last year following allegations by a nun that he repeatedly raped and sexually assaulted her at the Kuravilangad convent between 2014 and 2016, a charge denied by him.

On 10 February, the story was on the front page of the international edition of the New York Times highlighting the nuns’ plight against powerful figures in the Church.

The story documents how the Vatican, where a beleaguered Pope Francis admits that the church needs to do better in dealing with sexual harassment, turned a blind eye to their plight.

The story highlights the uphill battle of the five nuns whose public rallies managed to shine a light on the heinous behaviour and the Church’s attempt to silence the dissent.

The victim’s sister told NYT: “We used to see the fathers of the church as equivalent to God, but not anymore. How can I tell my son about this, that the person teaching us the difference between right and wrong gave him his First Communion after committing such a terrible sin?”

The scandal, the paper observed, has divided the 20 million Catholics in India even as the brave nuns’ struggle has allowed others to speak up against harassment at the hands of those who wear the cloth.

The story also highlights how the nuns were asked to keep quiet by over a dozen church officials including a representative of the Vatican. Other forbade them to not report the matter.
