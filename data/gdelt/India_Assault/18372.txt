Tis Hazari clash: Lawyers call off strike, to resume work from Saturday

Lawyers in Delhi district courts on Friday decided to suspend their strike till December 23, following a Delhi High Court order to resolve the matter.

They were boycotting in protest against the clashes at Tis Hazari court on November 2.

Mahavir Sharma, Chairman of Coordination Committee of All District Courts Bar Associations Coordination committee, said that the work will be resumed from Saturday.

"We respect the order of Hon'ble High Court so the abstinence from work is suspended, work to be resumed from Saturday. We thank all the members for cooperation. Our fight for Advocates Protection Act will continue", he said.

Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court granted interim protection to two suspended cops who allegedly fired at a lawyer during the clashes at Tis Hazari court on November 2.

The court also said that no coercive action should be taken against these policemen till December 23, besides issuing notices to various bar associations that have to reply on the petition filed by Delhi police. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for December 23.

The lawyers had also planned to stage a protest outside the Parliament on November 20, demanding the arrest of the two cops.

A violent clash had erupted between Delhi police and lawyers at Tis Hazari Court on November 2, resulting in injuries to several people.

Some vehicles were also set ablaze by the angry lawyers who were protesting a scuffle between some police personnel and advocates over parking.

Twenty police officials, including an Additional DCP and 2 SHOs, and 8 advocates sustained injuries in the clash, Delhi Police said. Twelve bikes, one police Gypsy and eight jail vans were damaged.

On November 5, at least a thousand policemen gathered outside the police headquarters to stage a protest against the assault on them during the clashes.
