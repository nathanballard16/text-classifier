2 journalists attacked, Assam CM orders probe

Journalists’ bodies seek protection law

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Friday instructed DGP Kuladhar Saikia to ensure prompt and stern action against the miscreants who assaulted two journalists 540 km apart on Thursday night.

Miscreants wielding sharp weapons attacked Rajen Deka, a correspondent of Assamese daily Dainik Asom in western Assam’s Mukalmua, while a group of inebriated youth assaulted News18 TV reporter Upasana Barua Goswami along with her husband at an eatery in Tinsukia.

A bleeding Mr. Deka was admitted to the Guwahati Medical College Hospital where his condition is said to be stable.

One of Mr. Deka’s neighbours, who is absconding, is suspected to have orchestrated the attack over his Lok Sabha election-related reporting. In the Tinsukia case, the youth assaulted Ms. Goswami and her husband after they asked them not to be boisterous and disturb others in the restaurant. The police in Tinsukia said they have arrested the four people in the case.

Condemning the attacks, the National Union of Journalists India and Journalists’ Association of Assam expressed serious concern over the rise of crime against media persons in the State and demanded the introduction of the Journalist Protection Act.
