Unnao rape survivor’s father backs Hyderabad-like swift justice

LUCKNOW: Father of the Unnao rape survivor, who was set on fire on Thursday morning by five people, including two accused of raping her, praised the Hyderabad police action in which all four arrested in the veterinarian’s rape-and-murder case were shot dead in a pre-dawn encounter.“Justice was quick and this is the right move. I wish swift justice is meted out in my daughter’s case too. This will send a strong message that committing a heinous crime would have a bloody end and create fear in monsters like Shivam Trivedi (rape accused), who secure bail and again commit crime,” he said on Friday.While the 23-year-old survivor’s father is still in Unnao, her mother and elder brother have accompanied her to Delhi’s Safdarjung hospital, where she is battling for life with 90% burns.“At 7am, I switched on my mobile phone to get an update on my daughter’s health. After two hours, I received the news about the encounter in which four accused in the Hyderabad doctor’s rape-and-murder case were killed. Once the encounter was confirmed, we erupted in joy,” the father said.“We celebrated because if the same men would have fled, one could imagine how unsafe our sisters and daughters would have been. It will set a good precedent as perpetrators will realize that justice will be instant,” he added.Stating that people have lost faith in the justice system, he said: “I have seen people running from pillar to post for justice when I would accompany my daughter to court (for hearing in the rape case). Why does the legal process take so long? Police must set a deadline in such cases and file chargesheets quickly.”The survivor was beaten up, stabbed and then set ablaze by five men when she was on her way from her village in Unnao to Rae Bareli to meet her lawyers. The five men — Harishankar Trivedi, Ram Kishore Trivedi, Umesh Bajpai, Shivam and Shubham Trivedi — involved in the attack were arrested hours after the incident.
