South Africa: SA condemns deadly Kashmir attack

The South African government has in the strongest terms condemned the attack in Kashmir, India, that saw 40 security personnel killed and dozens others injured on Thursday.

The attack is reported to be one of the deadliest on Indian forces in this area in years.

It is reported that a suspected suicide attacker drove into a bus carrying Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel along a highway in Indian-administered Kashmir's Pulwama district.

In a statement issued by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), President Cyril Ramaphosa has extended South Africa’s deepest condolences, describing the attack as “unjustifiable” and “cowardly”. He said the thoughts of South Africans are with the people and the government of India during this trying time.

“Acts of terrorism have no place in society and constitute a threat to development, peace and security. The South African government wishes to reiterate its solidarity with the Government of India in confronting the scourge of terrorism and will continue to support regional and international efforts to address terrorism in all its forms,” read the statement.

According to media reports, Pakistan-based armed group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), which has carried out a number of suicide attacks against Indian security forces, had claimed responsibility for the Thursday attack.

“Kashmir is a Muslim-majority region at the heart of decades of hostility between the two South Asian nations, who rule parts of the region while claiming the entire territory as theirs,” read an Aljazeera report on Friday. – SAnews.gov.za
