Imran Khan calls Pulwama terror attack an 'indigenous' incident, denies Pakistan's role

Washington | Jagran News Desk: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday claimed that the dastardly Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF jawans, was an “indigenous” incident, carried out by a “Kashmiri boy”.

“It was a Kashmiri boy radicalised by the brutality of the security forces. He blew himself up. But because this group claimed responsibility, which was in India as well, Jaish-e-Mohammed is operating in India — but Pakistan suddenly came in the limelight,” Khan was quoted as saying at an address to the Washington-based think-tank US Institute of Peace.

Early this year, tensions flared up between India and Pakistan after a suicide bomber of terror group Jaish-e-Muhammed attacked the convoy of CRPF personnel in Kashmir's Pulwama district. Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting the biggest JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26.

In a major diplomatic win, Indian efforts on the international front were recently rewarded after Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed's (JeM) chief, Masood Azhar, was blacklisted as a global terrorist by the UN Security Council following the gruesome February 14 Pulwama terror attack.
