VADODARA: Two persons arrested in gang rape of a minor girl have led the police to persons who had looted a couple in Navlakhi Grounds last year.A team of crime branch has left for Madhya Pradesh to track down the three involved in the crime.“Those involved in the loot that happened last year are the relatives of Jasho Solanki, one of the accused in gangrape. During his interrogation, Jasho revealed their names to us. We are hoping to nab them soon,” said D S Chauhan , assistant commissioner of police (crime).Police said that the gangrape accused may not have got courage to commit the crime after last year’s loot case remain undetected.“The rape-accused duo had gone to Navlakhi on the night of November 28 to commit loot. It was only when they didn’t find anything valuable from the couple that they decided to rape the 14-year-old girl. They might have thought that they won’t get caught like their relatives who had looted another couple last year,” a police official said.A boy identified as Hitesh Dabhi had told the police that two men, who identified themselves as security guards, looted two mobile phones, a chain and some cash when he was hanging out with his female friend in Navlakhi.The cops had gone into a tizzy during the incident after the claims of the girl being gangraped began doing rounds.A social worker had contacted the Raopura police following which the girl and her friend too visited the police station in May last year.Police, though, said that the girl wasn’t raped and the boy couldn’t even identity the spot where they were sitting. The case remained unsolved till the gangrape accused were arrested.
