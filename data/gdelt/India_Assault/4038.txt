Mumbai: Man arrested for molesting 12-year-old boy

A 50-year-old man has been arrested by the Mulund police for allegedly sexually assaulting a 12-year-old boy who out of depression, ran away to Pune to escape harassment. The boy has been safely brought back by the police team. On the basis of his statement, the cops have arrested the accused identified as Sudhiya Kamble who is said to be a resident of Mulund west.

According to the police, Kamble, a driver by profession, was the victim's neighbour. "Kamble used to lure the child with chocolates and small gifts and molest him. When the boy realised that it was inappropriate, he slipped into depression," said a police officer.

Kamble who took undue advantage of the victim's silence continued his acts until the boy decided to run away from his family and Kamble. On receiving a missing complaint during the last week of February, a search team was formed to trace him at the earliest.

"When we got to know that he was at Pune, we brought him back and his statement was recorded. The accused was arrested immediately and has been booked under relevant sections of the IPC and POCSO Act," the officer added.
