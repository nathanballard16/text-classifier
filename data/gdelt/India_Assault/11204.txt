A Muslim man in India was beaten for reading from Hindu scripture.



According to The Times of India, the incident took place when Dilsher, who works as a security guard in a local factory in Agra, was reading Gita in his house when he was attacked.



The two men, identified as Sameer and Zakir, beat up Dilsher and took away Gita from his house.



“I am a Muslim but religion doesn’t restrict me from reading holy books of other communities,” Dilsher added.



A case has been filed against the suspects, Sameer and Zakir and some unidentified person under The India Penal Code (IPC) section 298.



Last month, the Indian police arrested 11 people over the killing of a Muslim man who was tortured and forced to chant Hindu slogans.



Two police officers were suspended over the handling of the lynching of Tabrez Ansari, captured in a video that went viral on Indian social media.



The 24-year-old is seen in the video crying and pleading as a mob in Jharkhand state forces him to chant “Jai Sri Ram” – hail Lord Ram – a slogan widely used by Hindu hardliners.
