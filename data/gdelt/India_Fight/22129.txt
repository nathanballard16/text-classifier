JNU scholar set to join Godda poll battle, take on BJP’s Nishikant Dubey

DUMKA: Virendra Kumar, a PhD scholar and former student leader from Jawaharlal Nehru University ( JNU ), is set to contest the Lok Sabha election from the Godda unreserved seat.Kumar, a former para teacher who purchased the nomination papers on Tuesday, will be contesting as the nominee of Jharkhand Jantantrik Mahasabha, which has been in the limelight for organizing a padyatra between October-December last year to draw attention against mob lynchings by cow vigilantes. The outfit also took up the issues of para teachers during their agitation for regularization of their jobs.Like his more famous counterpart, Kanhaiya Kumar , also a JNU alumnus, who is contesting from Begusarai in Bihar, Kumar is also focused on local issues. Kumar said he will be fighting the elections on the issue of driving out Adani from Godda and address problems faced by the electorates belonging to the marginal sections of the society.“People in Godda are aggrieved by the forcible acquisition of land for Adani’s mega power plant. I have decided to take up their cause and drive out the Adanis from here,” Kumar, who belongs to Hasdiha in Dumka district, said.Belonging to a marginal family, Kumar's father earns a living as a carpenter. Having participated in the 430km Jharkhand Bachao, Desk Bachao padyatra from Ghatshila to Ranchi and Godda to Dumka via Deoghar and Madhupur, Kumar said he had been actively involved in student politics for long in JNU and other universities of the country.Asked if his candidature would have any effect on the prospects of the BJP candidate Nishikant Dubey , Kumar said JVM-P’s Pradip Yadav is also banking on leading the movement against Adani. “There is a strong wave against the NDA government,” he said.Drawing inspiration from Kanhaiya, Kumar said he is collecting funds from door-to-door visits, online crowdfunding and through his friends from JNU and other universities — all of whom are likely to join the campaigning soon.
