Islam Religion of Peace, Nothing to Do With Terror: Imran Khan

Islamabad: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Sunday said that Islam is a religion of peace and it has nothing to do with terrorism and the act of one person cannot be attributed to the whole community. Imran Khan was addressing the 56th Convention of the Islamic Society of North America (ISNA) in Houston, USA, through video link. “Terrorism has no religion. Tamil Tigers launched suicide attacks in Sri Lanka, even before the 9/11 attack in the USA. But, India has given the freedom struggle in Kashmir the name of terrorism,” Imran Khan said.

He briefed American Muslims of the situation in Kashmir and alleged that the Modi government has imposed curfew in the Valley and has cut all the communication lines to the area to suppress the protests against the abrogation of Article 370. Continuing his attack on India, Imran Khan said the current Indian regime is a follower of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). He said the West will have to understand the philosophy of the RSS in order to think clearly on this problem which had led to the carnage of Muslims in Gujarat. (IANS)
