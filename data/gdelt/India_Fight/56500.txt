Hadofficials handed over the original drawings of the(FOB) to the consultants to compare the thickness of the beams during auditing, its collapse – and the resultant death of six people – could have been averted, the Bombay High has said.Justice SS Shinde, however, also observed that despite blatant lapses on the part of the civic officials – they failed to conduct proper audits before repairs, and maintain important records and proper documentation – Section 304 (II) (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC, which attracts 10 years of imprisonment, was not applicable to them.If Section 304 (II) is dropped, the accused, if they are found guilty, face maximum two years in prison.The judge justified this by saying that the accused did not have the “knowledge” that a failure to perform these tasks would cause the collapse of the FOB in March this year. Justice Shinde made these observations while granting auditor Neeraj Desai and three civic officials – Sandip Kalkulte, Shitla Prasad Kori and Anil Patil – bail, nearly nine months after they were arrested.“As such, prima-facie material on record does not suggest that the applicants [the accused] had [the] knowledge that alleged act of omission, to verify the thickness of members [beams] of steel of FOB with original drawings and omission to take remedial measures would cause collapse of bridge,” Justice Shinde observed.Six people, including three nurses from, were killed and 34 were injured when the bridge collapsed on March 14.It was the prosecution’s case that an audit done by Neeraj Desai’s firm two years before the collapse had found the bridge in “good condition”, and therefore he along with the civic officials were responsible for incident.Advocate Deepak Salvi, who represented Desai, said his client and the consultancy firm appointed through him were never provided with the actual drawings of the FOB, which would have enabled them to compare the original and current thickness of the beams and properly audit the bridge. The civic officials were represented by advocate Rishi Bhuta and Ashwin Thool.Agreeing with the arguments, the court held that it was not clear if the drawings were even available when the tender for auditing was released. The judge also asked how a tender could be floated without the drawing. “Had [the] corporation’s officer submitted drawings of FOB to consultant, exercise to measure thickness of members of FOB with drawing and further action to strengthen the bridge, possibly could have avoided the mishap…. As to why, the applicants, opted to be passive and turned Nelsons’ eye to the suggestion of M/s Geo Dynamics [the consultants] are the moot questions.”
