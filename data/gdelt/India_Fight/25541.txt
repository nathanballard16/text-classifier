New Delhi: Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG-21 Bison Squadron has got ‘Falcon Slayers’ and ‘AMRAAM Dodgers’ patches to commemorate the February 27 dogfight in which an aircraft of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) was shot down.

Paying a tribute to the hero, the 51 Squadron of the Indian Air Force has brought a new shoulder patch featuring the MiG-21 Bison with which Abhinandan shot down the Pakistani F-16 jet.

The 51 Squadron patch depicts a MiG-21 Bison in the foreground and a red-coloured F-16 in the background under crosshairs.

Also, the Sukhoi-30 Squadron, whose aircraft successfully managed to evade the AMRAAM missiles of the PAF F-16s, have got ‘AMRAAM Dodger’ patches. The patch shows a SU-30MKI with an AMRAAM missile going past it after missing to hit it.

IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's MiG-21 was shot down in a dogfight with PAF jets a day after the February 26 Balakot air strikes. Abhinandan spent two days in the Pakistani custody before returning to India on the evening of March 1.

After his return, Varthaman underwent a few tests in Delhi and was eventually given a posting out of Jammu and Kashmir as part of security reasons and service policy.
