Three women killed in fire at house in Delhi's Shalimar Bagh

Less than a week after 43 people were killed following a massive blaze at an illegal factory in Delhi's Anaj Mandi area, three people were killed in another fire at a residential building in the city's Shalimar Bagh area on Saturday. ANI reported that three women were killed while six people, including three children, were rescued. Earlier on Sunday last week, 43 people were killed following a massive blaze. A massive fire ripped through the four-storey building which housed illegal manufacturing units in north Delhi's congested Anaj Mandi area on Sunday morning. The illegally run factory did not have fire safety clearance and was packed with combustible material like cardboards.
