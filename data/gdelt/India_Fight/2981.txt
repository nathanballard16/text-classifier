Supreme Court gives bail to 4 jailed in Gujarat Riots

4 people that are involved in the Naroda Patiya Case in the 2002 riots that happened in Gujarat have been given bail by the Supreme Court of India.

The four people who are convicted are Rajkumar, Prakashbhai Rathod, Umeshbhai Bharwad, and Harshad are all serving a 10-year jail sentence for the crime of rioting and arson. These crimes were convicted by the High-Court of Gujarat.

The Supreme Court said: “The conviction order is debatable.”

97 Muslims were killed on February 28, 2002, in Naroda Patiya near Ahmedabad, on the same day a train was burned down that killed 59 Hindu passengers.

Last year the High-Court of Gujarat sentenced the convicts to 10-years of imprisonment.

Also, the High-Court convicted 16 more people that includes Babu Bajrangi, 18 others, and former BJP Minister Maya Kodnani.

The High-Court said: “The court cannot set aside the agony and anguish of the victims… Offences are not against individuals but society at large and has consequences of polarising society.” They added “Imposing too lenient a sentence would amount to travesty of justice… Imposition of 10 years of rigorous imprisonment would be adequate punishment.”
