Several prominent faces, including actor Kalki Koechlin, took part in the ‘2020: Walk for the Future’

Nearly 1,800 members of the art, theatre and film community march from Reti Bunder to Carter Road to root for a future without hate.Around 1,800 people, including some very prominent figures, from the world of art, theatre and films on Saturday descended on the city’s streets to send a strong message against all those forces and malaises that are throttlingIt was around 5 pm when the drums rolled — after a half-an-hourdelay — at Reti Bunder in Mahim, signalling the start of the ‘’, a unique participatory performance-parade by the city’s artistes who stepped out to champion for a “future free of hate and war”.The parade was a part of a nationwide programme called by the Artists Unite! For Democracy, Against Hate. It aims to bring together artistes from across the country — Delhi, Indore, Chennai, Bengaluru, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Chandigarh and Pune — to urge people to ‘resist hate and choose love’.The Mumbai phase of the parade was organised by the 2020 Group, a selforganised coalition of city-based artistes, architects, filmmakers, cultural administrators and live art practitioners.Leading the show were wellknown personalities such as Kalki Koechlin, Sanjna Kapoor, Atul Kumar, Sunil Shanbag, Astad Deboo, Faezeh Jalali, Dolly Thakore, Shireen Gandhy, Arshiya Lokhandwala, Geetha Mehra, Jitish Kallat, Reena Kallat, Shilpa Gupta, Rajiv Saini, Archana Hande, Prajakta Potnis, Shreyas Karle, Justin Ponmany, Anjana Mehra, Meera Devidayal, Shaina Anand, Sanjeev Khandekar and Sameera Iyengar. While buoyancy was the leitmotif of the parade, the message was loud and clear — they were all rooting for a future free from violence, hatred and discrimination on the basis of caste, religion and class, and instead, raised a toast to diversity.As the parade moved from Reti Bunder to Turner Road and down to Carter Road, where it culminated with the participants lighting candles at the amphitheatre, the posters, speaking of a hate-less future, served as the perfect backdrop.A number of segments, directed by different artists and directors, were part of Saturday’s choreographed parade, expressing the art community’s collective disgruntlement towards regressive thoughts and practices.Actor and director Atul Kumar directed two of the segments. One of the acts — in which a man dressed in black and walking on stilts shuts up a mob shouting slogans behind him — was directed at the powers that be muffling the common man’s voice.In the other performance, bandwallas were brought in to celebrate a procession promoting more intercaste marriages. Theatre writer-director Sapan Saran also staged a piece titled ‘We walk for the future’.Another segment had people masking their faces and wearing badges of ‘paid trolls’ — their plea was to stop social media wars; while a group of performers announced the names of people who were lynched in the past few years. But the visual that stood out and perhaps had the maximum impact was this young woman with a placard that read, “I lost my father in the Kargil War; I don’t want the government to fight another war to win the elections”.
