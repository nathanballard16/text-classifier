LUCKNOW: Amidst resentment in the IAS lobby over the proposed police commissioner system in the state, Governor Ram Naik once again pursued its implementation, shooting a letter to chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday.Naik had raked up the issue during the Police Week celebration, when, in the presence of the chief minister, he asked for implementation of police commissioner system in three major cities -- Lucknow, Kanpur and Ghaziabad. The state DGP then demanded the same.Naik’s advocacy for the police commissioner system had not been welcomed by the IAS lobby, which has decided to take up the matter at the Services Week, scheduled to take place by the end of this month and oppose it tooth and nail.A tug of war between the IAS and the IPS officers over the police commissioner system in the state had been going on for over a decade when it was first mooted by then governor T Rajeshwar, who himself was a retired police officer.Amidst opposition from the IAS lobby, then chief minister, Mulayam Singh Yadav had dropped the idea of the police commissioner system.A delegation of the IPS Association had also met the chief minister for the same.The letter written by the governor to the chief minister has been forwarded to principal secretary (home) for his comments and remarks.
