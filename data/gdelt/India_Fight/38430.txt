‘Green bombs’ from children to grow more trees in Krishnagiri

KRISHNAGIRI: As many as 500 government school children armed with seed-bombs hurled them at Immidinayakanapalli village near Shoolagiri of Krishnagiri.

Those bombs will not explode but will germinate new trees from the seeds in them.

“We got an opportunity to throw seed bombs today. Each will germinate a new tree after the rains because the bombs carry seeds in them,” B.Mahalakshmi, a class nine student of a government school told reporters.

This is a joint initiative of Luminous Power Technologies (LPT), Hosur industrial association, ARCOD NGO and Tree Box India.

They organised the event on Thursday. A total of one lakh seed balls will be thrown across the country by LPT with the support of other movements.

In Hosur, over 15,000 seed balls were thrown in Immidinayakanapalli and surrounding villages. Mr.Vipul Sabharwal, managing director of LPT said, “we understand the need of reducing the carbon footprint to become planet positive. Our business decision is to foray with solar products and offer residential solar power to be sustainable. Nearly one crore trees have been cut in the last five years for development and other needs. While infrastructural development is a sign of a healthy economy, it is also important to make up for green cover loss with newer ones for sustainable progress.”
