Enough evidence to prosecute PM Modi in Rafale deal: Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Congress on Wednesday said incontrovertible proof of corruption has emerged against Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the Rafale fighter jet deal, and that it now merits an FIR against the Prime Minister under various sections of the Prevention of Corruption Act.“There is now enough evidence to prosecute the PM in the #RafaleScam. The trail of corruption begins & ends with him. That crucial Rafale files incriminating him are now reported “stolen” by the government, is destruction of evidence & an obvious cover up,” Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Twitter.Party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala also referred to a media report that cited the observations of the Indian Negotiation Team (INT) to allege that Modi not only misled Parliament by claiming that the Rafale deal for 36 aircraft signed by his government was cheaper than the UPA II deal, but that he also “held direct” negotiations with Dassault through National Security Advisor Ajit Doval , to seal the 36 aircraft deal and to bypass the INT.Congress said proceedings of the INT established that final negotiations of the Rafale deal were held in France by Doval and that the final agreement was consequently signed on January 13, 2016.“Responsibility for negotiating the 36 Rafale Aircrafts purchase was that of the ‘Indian Negotiating Team’ (INT) constituted by Ministry of Defence on May 12, 2015. But PM Modi was indulging in ‘direct negotiation’ with the French, which weakened the credibility of the INT....Doval was not part of the INT and was not even authorised by Cabinet Committee on Security for the same. Simple question is, how is it the domain of NSA to negotiate and finalise a Fighter Aircrafts purchase deal? Obviously, the PMO and the NSA were doing so under direct instructions of PM Modi,” Surjewala said.Raising the Rafale controversy and linking it to national security at a time the ruling party is seeking to score a one-up on the opposition by whipping up the nationalism debate, Congress dared PM Modi to launch an investigation into the deal to “save the credibility of the PM’s office.”“Time has now come to register an FIR against PM Modi and every other individual so that a time-bound investigation takes place in this entire sage of Rafale Corruption reaching the highest echelons of power,” the Congress spokesperson said, adding that the government was dragging its feet on setting up the Lokpal to save itself from inquiry.CPI secretary D Raja said, “The government claim of stolen filed in Supreme Court is shameful. What was the chowkidar doing? Also, this is a classic case of the government trying to shoot the messenger instead of paying attention to the message contained in these files.”
