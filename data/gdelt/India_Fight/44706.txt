Ever since India's move on Article 370, Pakistan backed terror groups are desperately trying to infiltrate terrorists from across the border into the Valley.

On Sunday, Pakistan once again violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir with mortars being fired in Mendhar sector of Poonch district. According to reports, the firing started around 4.15 pm.

The Indian Army also gave a befitting reply to this unprovoked firing and shelling. Shahpur and Kerni sectors of Poonch were also on the target at 9.45 am.

On September 15, India raised concerns regarding more than 2,050 unprovoked ceasefire violations by Pakistani forces this year.
