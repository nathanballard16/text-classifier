‘Hands Off’, Pakistan: At ICJ Hearing, Indian Diplomats Offer Neighbour Only A ‘Namaste’ As Greeting

During the first day of hearing in the case of Indian naval officer Kulbhushan Jadhav, who is currently facing the death penalty in Pakistan, at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), Indian diplomats rejected the handshakes offered to them by Pakistani officials and instead returned their greetings with a ‘Namaste’, reports The Economic Times.

This comes in the aftermath of an attack by Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in South Kashmir. At least 41 CRPF jawans were martyred in the suicide bombing which is the deadliest attack on Indian security forces in Jammu & Kashmir’s history.

Prior to the commencement of the hearing, the Pakistani Attorney General, Anwar Mansoor, extended his hand to Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Joint Secretary Deepak Mittal, but the latter folded his hands in a Namaste in response.

The same process was repeated when Mansoor offered his hand to the Indian Ambassador to the Netherlands Venu Rajamony. Finally, it was former attorney general and noted lawyer Harish Salve, who is representing India at the world body, who shook hands with the Pakistani official.

Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson and the Director-General For South Asia and SAARC Mohammad Faisal also had to remain content with a namaste from Mittal.
