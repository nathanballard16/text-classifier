Pooja Bhatt explains the change in Sadak 2 shooting schedule

Pooja Bhatt who was also part of the 1991 release Sadak, says the sequel demands the film to be shot in Mumbai. Pooja along with father and filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt has spent some time in Romania look for locations for Sadak 2.

An online website portal reported the change in films location and claimed the father-daughter duo was unhappy with Romania and the possible location they decided to shot the film in Mumbai. Actress Pooja took to Twitter to clarify that was not the case.

She wrote, "Romania is a stunningly beautiful country. We were very happy with the locations but logistics and emotional IQ of the local crew are key factors in determining a location for a film. Eventually, no one is bigger than a film and the film demanded we shoot only in India."

Mahesh Bhatt will return as director for Sadak 2 after 20 years. The film will also have the two sisters, Alia, and Pooja on screen together for the first time, it also stars Sanjay Dutt and Aditya Roy Kapur.
