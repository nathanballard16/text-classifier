In order to assist and help the distressed people of the Lalita Park’s slum clusters which were gutted in the fire recently, the Delhi Chief Commission (DCW) has started an online donations drive to support the people especially the woman and child who has lost all the belongings in the fire.

The massive fire took place on Saturday at East Delhi’s Lalit Park, where around 40 shanties gutted in the fire. However, there is no causality reported but the people lost many of their belongings.

The DCW chairperson Swati Maliwal met the distressed people on Sunday. “She met the distressed women affected by the fire who narrated traumatic tales of loss.

There were no casualties in the horrific incident but women and girls have been left without even a change of clothes and have lost all of their belongings.

The Delhi Government has set up shelters and basic requirement of food

and water was being looked after. However, the women and girls need urgent supplies of basic household items and compensation to start their life afresh,” said a member of DCW.

The DCW chief has also wrote a letter to the District magistrate (DM) requesting urgent and full compensation to all aggrieved. Further, she is also seeking special compensation for the women whose daughters are about to be married.

“I appeal to Delhi citizens to donate liberally to the families by providing clothes and household items to those affected by the fire.

Delhi also needs to come forward and liberally donate to the women whose girls were about to be married and who lost everything in the fire.

If any one wishes to donate to these women, they can contact us at livingpositive@gmail.com and we shall connect you to them. We will try our best to rehabilitate them,” said Maliwal.
