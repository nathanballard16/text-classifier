As per the police, the incident occurred when the former MLA fired celebratory shots at the party, and one of the bullets hit the victim. Special Commissioner of Police, R P Upadhyay, reportedly said, “The MLA was arrested from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. We have recovered two rifles, one pistol and 800 live cartridges from his farmhouse. He was the one who fired celebratory shots. One of the bullets hit the woman, Archana Gupta, in the head.”

The incident took place at around midnight on Monday. Gupta was admitted at a private hospital in Vasant Kunj where her condition is said to “critical”, Indian Express reported.

Soon after the incident, Singh fled the venue and was on the run till the cops arrested him on Tuesday. An FIR was filed against Singh for an attempt to murder and destruction of evidence, based on the complaint registered by Vikas Gupta, victim’s husband.
