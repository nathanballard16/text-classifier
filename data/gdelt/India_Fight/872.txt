Hyderabad: Cousin held for killing boy, he was inspired by YouTube videos

Hyderabad: The mystery over the death of a nine-year-old boy at Shamshabad was cleared after six days with the arrest of the boy’s 16-year-old cousin. The juvenile is said to have killed the boy after taking him to an isolated area outside the village. Police said he got the idea by watching videos on crime and on measures to avoid being captured in CCTV cameras.

On December 30, Dinesh, a Class IV student at TS Model School in Palamakula, went missing after leaving the house along with his elder cousin. Dinesh’s body was found late at night by his parents M. Chinna Raju and Nirmala in some bushes in an isolated area outside the village. His parents complained to the police and named their nephew as the suspect.

Police found that Dinesh left the house along with his cousin to eat food. The police questioned the cousin who confessed to killing Dinesh by throttling him. The juvenile is a Class IX student and was living with his grandmother in Palamakula village.

Shamshabad inspector R. Venkatesh said, “The juvenile said he had killed Dinesh to take revenge against the boy’s father Chinna Raju who had scolded him. On the day of the incident, Chinna Raju had scolded the juvenile for being irregular to school and getting addicted to vices. Raju told the Class IX student that he would inform his father.” The inspector added that the juvenile was well versed with the Internet. He used to regularly watch crime videos on YouTube and gained knowledge on how CCTVs function and how police use it to obtain evidence.

“The juvenile would have taken Dinesh to the outskirts to avoid being captured in the CCTV cameras. He throttled his cousin, went home and told his family that Dinesh had left home long back. The 16-year-old was produced before the Juvenile Justice Board for further action,” the inspector said.
