“The Pulwama terror attack was an outcome of their desperation. But the country stands beside the jawan and security persons. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already given a free hand to jawans and Army to ensure sacrifice of the jawans does not go in vain,” he said, while praising the bravery of two Odia jawans who were killed in the Pulwama attack.

Singh said during the all-party meeting held on Saturday in Delhi, representatives of all the political parties unanimously condemned the cowardly act of terrorists and Pakistan as well.

He also said that the opposition parties also stressed that they are standing by our forces at this time.
