122 migrant labourers head back home after Mamata s intervention

The decision to bring back the workers was taken after five migrant workers were brutally killed by terrorists at Kulgam district in South Kashmir. Suvendu Adhikari, the state Transport minister, visited the houses of the deceased and gave the cheques to their family members. Local farmers said workers from Murshidabad are going to Kashmir for the past four decades to make quick money. The labourers work in the apple orchards or are engaged in agriculture. Alam said many workers from Murshidabad work as masons in different parts in the country including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, South India and Gujarat.
