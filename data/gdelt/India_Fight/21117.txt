Won’t be pressured by anyone on ban: Pakistan

NEW DELHI: Pakistan will not be “pressured” by anyone on the issue of banning Masood Azhar , an official said on Thursday, a day after China dismissed reports that the US, the UK and France have served an ultimatum to Beijing to lift its “technical hold” on designating the JeM chief as a global terrorist by the UN.Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal said that Pakistan has a clear stance on Azhar. India says Pakistan-based Azhar’s JeM terror group was behind the February 14 Pulwama attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.
