Yet another army major died while another officer of the same rank and two soldiers were injured in an encounter in south Kashmir on Monday. Data shows that the number of Indian security forces who laid down their lives during anti-terror operations in Kashmir has been rising in the last three years and reached the same levels as 2008. This is apart from the number of soldiers killed in suicide attacks and bombings, which by their nature are difficult to prevent.

Though the number of Indian forces are commensurate with the increase in the number of Pakistan sponsored terror attacks and street violence in Kashmir, it is still a cause of concern. All three forces—Jammu and Kashmir Police, Army and CRPF—have almost 30 years of experience in counter-terrorism in the Valley. But some of their most competent men have been killed in gun battles, raising questions about the preparedness of our forces.

It is imperative that Indian security forces are fully equipped to fight Pakistan-backed cross-border terror effectively while limiting damage to Indian civilians and soldiers. It is high time the Modi government reviews counter-insurgency capabilities and invests in capacity building, for the short term and perhaps even the long term.

Although J&K police, Army soldiers and paramilitary have shown indomitable spirit to fight with valour and commitment, for the sake of people of Kashmir and the rest of the country, India owes it to them that they are sufficiently equipped in the long proxy war with Pakistan.
