One Jawan From Assam Martyred, Another Injured In Pulwama Terror Attack That Killed Over 40 Soldiers

At least 40 jawans were martyred in a dastardly attack on Indian Army convoy of 70 vehicles that took place yesterday in Pulwama, Jammu & Kashmir. An explosive-laden SUV rammed into a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) bus at Awantipora town.

This is the deadliest attack in three decades of Kashmir’s insurgency. The responsibility of the attack has been claimed by Pakistan-backed terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad, escalating tensions with the neighbouring country.

Among the at least 40 soldiers killed, one is Maneshwar Basumatary of 98th Battalion of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) from Assam.

Basumatary hailed from Tamulpur’s Kalbari.

Another soldier from Bongaigaon, Pabitra Barman, was also in the convoy faced minor injuries. His family members have confirmed of his well-being.

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has condemned the incident and tweeted, “Strongly condemn the cowardly attack on #CRPF jawans in #Pulwama. Terror has no place in India and we must together fight this menace as a nation. My heart goes out to the martyrs who have sacrificed their lives today. Deepest condolences”.
