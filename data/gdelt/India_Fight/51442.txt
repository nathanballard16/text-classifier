After Bigil, will Atlee direct Vijay for the fourth time?

Vijay is on top of his game right now as he has scored back to back hits in the form of Theri, Mersal, Sarkar and Bigil. The actor is presently shooting for his upcoming film, Thalapathy 64 in Delhi. Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, the film is touted to be a gangster flick set in a college backdrop.

Even before Vijay could wrap up Thalapathy 64, rumours about his upcoming film, Thalapathy 65 are doing the rounds on social media. It is said that Vijay will team up with filmmaker Atlee for the fourth time for his 65th film. However, it hasn't been finalised yet.

A source close to the actor revealed that Vijay and Atlee did discuss the prospects of doing another film together during the shooting of Bigil. If everything goes as per plan, the successful combination might reunite once again. An official confirmation regarding his next film is yet to be made.

Meanwhile, there are speculations that Vijay might do one more film with Lokesh Kanagaraj, which might take off after his film with Atlee is wrapped up.

If Atlee is not occupied with his much-talked-about Bollywood debut with Shah Rukh Khan, there are high possibilities that he will direct Vijay once again. In the past, they have joined hands thrice for the films, Theri, Mersal and Bigil.
