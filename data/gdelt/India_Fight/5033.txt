M Nageshwar Rao issued a press statement, refuting any link with M/s Angela Mercantile Pvt Ltd.

On Kolkata police raiding these firms, Rao told media persons, "All that is happening, appears to be propaganda."

In a statement dated, 30 Oct 2018, Rao had also refuted any link with M/s Angela Mercantile Pvt Ltd which is being raided by Kolkata Police today, ANI has reported.

This comes in the wake of Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar being summoned by the CBI in Shillong for questioning over the Saradha scam investigation. Kumar had headed the SIT (Special Investigating Team) formed by the West Bengal government to look into the Saradha Scam.

Rao has called this raid “politically motivated”, although, it cannot be confirmed at this time if it has any links to the ongoing tussle between the Central Bureau of Investigation and the Kolkata Police, CNN News 18 has reported.
