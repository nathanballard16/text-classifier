Businessman cleared over offering employee £20k to murder first wife

The family home cordoned off in Rookery Lane, Penn, after Sarbjit Kaur was found dead

Wolverhampton businessman Gurpreet Singh has been cleared of attempting to arrange the £20,000 contract killing of a former spouse who later died.

A jury at Birmingham Crown Court, which has been deliberating for more than 30 hours, found the 44-year-old company director not guilty of soliciting the murder of Amandeep Kaur in 2013.

She died a year later during a trip to India, with authorities in the Punjab concluding she had suffered a brain haemorrhage.

The jury is continuing to deliberate over a separate charge of murder against Singh, in connection to his second wife, Sarbjit Kaur, who was found strangled at their home in Rookery Lane, Penn, Wolverhampton, on February 16 last year.

During the trial, the jury heard how father-of-two Singh allegedly strangled 38-year-old Sarbjit between 8.15am and 9am after dropping his children at school and before leaving for work.

Giving evidence during his trial, Singh said he had suffered “mentally, physically and financially” since being charged by police.
