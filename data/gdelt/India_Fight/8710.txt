Pulwama attack: How India is making Pakistan 'feel the heat' at every stage - All you need to know

Ever since after the deadliest Pulwama terror attack killing 40 CRPF personnel where a suicide bomber blew off an explosive-laden SUV near Indian paramilitary convoy of 78 buses carrying personnel to Kashmir, India has been pushing the international community and trying to create every possible international pressure on Pakistan to act against terror havens on its soil.

The Pulwama incident has been condemned by several countries including the US, UK, France, New Zealand and lately China also. It has been a collective view of all the countries who have condemned the heinous and cowardly attack that Islamabad must act on terror since Pakistan based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) had claimed the responsibility for the Pulwama attack.

Meanwhile, India said it will use "all instruments at its command" to respond to Pakistan over its role in Pulwama terror attack after Islamabad warned it would respond with "full force" if attacked.

"India will exercise all instruments at its command, whether it is diplomatic or otherwise," Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said in New Delhi. “India has all options. You need not exhaust all options on day one. This is not a one-week battle. It’s to be undertaken in various forms."

Referring to Islamabad's alleged support for Islamist militant groups, he added, “I think Pakistan is riding a tiger on this issue, and a tiger never spares its own rider."
