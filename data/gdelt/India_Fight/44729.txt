Two More Maoists Gunned Down In Encounter At AP-Odisha Border

Amaravati: Two Maoists were gunned down in an encounter with the elite Greyhounds of Andhra Pradesh Police in the Eastern Ghats forests of Visakhapatnam on Monday, a day after three ultras were killed in the region, officials said.

This is the second encounter within 24 hours given the fact that the Maoists are celebrating their Formation Day across the red corridor, these two encounters in a span of 24 hours or so are definitely going to be a dampener for the ultras and a fillip to the Union Home Minister's plans," the force said.

The security forces recovered three weapons - an AK rifle , a .303 rifle and a revolver, from Monday's encounter site, Additional Director General of Police (Greyhounds) Nalin Prabhat said.

Visakhapatnam SP Attada Bapuji said that top Maoist leaders Arunakka and Jagan had escaped during the encounter.

On Sunday, three Naxals -- two women and a man -- were killed in an encounter near Gummirevula in Visakhapatnam district on the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha border.

A statement from the Director General of Police D Gautam Sawang said in all five Maoists were killed in the exchange of fire in the last two days.

In a recent meeting with Naxalism-affected states, Home Minister Amit Shah said that incidents of Left Wing Extremism (LWE) have come down but the focus needs to be on eliminating the problem completely.The police have intensified combing operations in the Andhra Pradesh-Odisha Border areas in view of the "Maoist Week" that is being observed from September 21 to 28.
