Ballia (UP), January 31

A day after his controversial remarks against Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, BJP MLA Surendra Singh has accused BSP president Mayawati of “murdering” a woman’s dignity by joining hands with one-time arch rival SP.

“For power, Mayawati has done what no person who values his or her dignity would do...she has embraced those who had attacked her and by doing so she has murdered a woman’s dignity,” Singh told newspersons at his residence on Wednesday night.

He was referring to the infamous 1995 state guest house incident in Lucknow in which Mayawati was attacked by Samajwadi Party workers.

One might or might not achieve success, but by allying with those who had trampled upon her prestige, Mayawati had proved that she had no self-respect, said Singh, who represents the Bairia Assembly constituency of Uttar Pradesh.

He claimed that only position and self-interest mattered to Mayawati and not if the other person had used foul language against her or harmed her dignity.

The BJP MLA had on Tuesday compared Rahul and Priyanka to Ravana and Surpanakha respectively.

Singh’s remarks invited angry reactions from the local Congress workers and swift disapproval from Union minister Mahesh Sharma on Wednesday. PTI
