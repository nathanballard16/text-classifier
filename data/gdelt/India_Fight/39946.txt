The Delhi police arrested four people for killing a 21-year-old man in Delhi's Ranhaula area on Friday.

The accused, identified as Ambika Prasad, used to smuggle liquor in Ranhaula. Nekram, the victim, worked as a domestic help at his house.

Police said Ambika Prasad got his sister married to a man in Uttar Pradesh. His sister, however, used to visit Nekram occasionally even after she got married. They soon developed an illicit relationship. According to the reports, Nekram eloped with Ambika's married sister and they went to Rajasthan.

He left her in Rajasthan after getting her a room and came back to Delhi to avoid any suspicion.

Ambika and his brothers kept looking for their sister but could not find her until one day when they got the news that Nekram has kept her away.

On August 16, three of the brothers caught hold of Nekram, locked him up in their house and beat him. Nekram died later after his neck broke.

Police have registered a case of murder in this case and arrested the accused.
