Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy has once again bemoaned that he is ‘in pain’ as he ensures that the coalition government in Karnataka continues to function.

Speaking at an event in Bengaluru, Kumaraswamy said, "The pain that I have felt, I don't speak out. I may be the Chief Minister but I am experiencing pain every day. If I tell you that, people will ask, ‘who will solve the problems of the state?’ For that reason, I should tell officials that this government is secure and give confidence that this government will function. These responsibilities have fallen upon me.”

This is not the first time Kumaraswamy has spoken up about the internal struggles affecting the functioning of the coalition government. However, he refused to be drawn into a discussion over it.

Earlier in July 2018, Kumaraswamy had broken down while speaking about the 'pain' of heading a coalition government in Bengaluru. He had compared his predicament to Lord Shiva and claimed that he was swallowing the pain of the government.

His latest complaint comes at a time the future of the alliance government in Karnataka has been questioned. The coalition government has had to withstand efforts from the BJP to topple it. Kumaraswamy had also alleged that the BJP had offered Rs. 10 crore to a JD(S) MLA to jump ship and withdraw support to the coalition government.

In his one year as the head of the coalition government in Karnataka, Kumaraswamy has also repeatedly clashed with the media and has accused media personnel of misreporting and misquoting him. He has also vowed to discontinue speaking to television reporters.
