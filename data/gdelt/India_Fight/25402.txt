FIR against Haasan for "free India's first extremist was a

An FIR was registered against Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) President Kamal Haasan here Tuesday for his "free India's first extremist was a Hindu" statement, police said.

The case was registered under Sections 153A and 295A of the Indian Penal Code, which deal with 'outraging religious feelings' and 'promoting enmity between different groups', respectively, they said.

A release from the Karur district police also warned of stringent action against those inciting violence in the name of religion, caste, language and race.

Haasan had said on Sunday that "free India's first extremist was a Hindu", referring to Nathuram Godse who killed Mahatma Gandhi.

The remarks drew condemnation from BJP and the AIADMK, although Haasan found support in Congress and Dravidar Kazhagam.
