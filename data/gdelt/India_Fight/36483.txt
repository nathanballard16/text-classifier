Chile confirms diesel oil spill in pristine Patagonia: Chile's navy confirmed the spillage of about 10,500 gallons of diesel oil into the sea in a remote and pristine area of the South American country's Patagonia and said it is working to mitigate the effects. The navy said in a statement that it received a call from the mining company CAP reporting the spill at the terminal of Guarello Island. The area, known for its biodiversity, is one of the planet's most untouched. The navy said it has deployed ships to the area to control damage from the spill.
