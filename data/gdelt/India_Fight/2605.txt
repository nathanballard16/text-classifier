Attack On YS Jagan: Jolt To AP Govt In High Court

Vijayawada: The Andhra Pradesh government got another jolt on Monday in the case of murderous attack on AP Leader of the opposition and YSR Congress party president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy.

AP government had filed a petition in the High Court to stop the National Investigation Agency (NIA) continuing the probe into the murder attack case. The High Court on Monday struck down the plea by the state government, and the Court ordered the Union government to file a counter by 30 January.

The Court also ordered the NIA to furnish before the court all the details with respect to the investigation till now. On Saturday, The AP High Court rejected the House motion petition. This has come as a big jolt to the ruling TDP which was wanting to halt the NIA probe at any cost.

The court also asserted there was no urgency to inquire into the petition filed by the AP government. The YSRCP president's advocate had earlier stated that the ruling government had filed a petition with an intention to obstruct the NIA probe.

The lawyer representing the AP Leader of Opposition stated that after the murderous attack on YS Jagan, the AP chief minister had stated that that Vizag airport fell under the Central jurisdiction, but now after the NIA took over the investigation he's crying foul fearing his plot would be exposed.

She also asserted that the TDP government was going all out to ensure the real facts of the case did not come out. The AP High Court had asked the government to present their arguments on Monday.
