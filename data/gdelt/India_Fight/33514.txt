Woman, driver get life term for husband’s murder

Ludhiana: A local court has sentenced a woman and her family’s former driver to life imprisonment for her husband’s murder. The court of additional sessions judge Arun Kumar Aggarwal also imposed a fine of Rs20,000 each on the convicts. On 10 December 2016, Sidhwan Bet police had booked Ranjit Kaur of Khurshaidpura and Nanak Singh Kaka of Biharipur in Jagraon for the murder of her husband Sukhpal Singh.

As per prosecution, Sukhpal’s elder brother Mohinder Singh told police that the marriage of his youngest brother was solemnized about 16 years ago with Ranjit Kaur, but the relations between Sukhpal and his wife were not cordial, as Ranjit used to leave the house frequently with others without telling Sukhpal. Earlier in June 2016, Ranjit — after leaving her children at her parental house — eloped with Kaka, who was earlier working as Sukhpal’s driver.

However, a month later, both Sukhpal and Ranjit reached a compromise and she came back to her husband’s house, but allegedly did not mend her ways. Kaka had threatened to kill Sukhpal, but afraid of the family’s defamation, Sukhpal did not take any action against him. On December 9, 2016, around 9.30pm, Ranjit, Kaka and an unidentified person forced Sukhpal to lie on the cot and put some substance in his mouth. Kaka picked up a wooden log and gave a blow on Sukhpal’s head. Next day, Mohinder found his brother dead and informed police. Police booked the accused persons and arrested them before filing a chargesheet against them in court.
