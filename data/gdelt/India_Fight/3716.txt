Shraddha Kapoor's sweet gesture for a 13-year old ill fan

Shraddha Kapoor recently took off time from her hectic schedule to meet a 13-year old girl who has been diagnosed with third stage of tuberculosis. Recently, there was a social media post done by an organization who wrote about this ailing fan's wish to meet Shraddha.

As soon as Shraddha came across the post, she got in touch with the organization and took out some time from her schedule to meet the fan at the hospital. Posting a picture with the fan girl Shraddha wrote, "I’m so so happy that I was able to go & meet Summaya today. She’s such a precious little angel. Praying for her recovery. @ketto please let me know how I can help with her treatment & all the best with all the work you guys are doing"

While on her visit to hospital, Shraddha donned a burkha to avoid chaos and trouble to other patients at the hospital during the peek visiting hours. The actress is running on a hectic schedule as she is not only shooting for her upcoming films but also for brand shoots. Shraddha is constantly traveling between Mumbai and Hyderabad where she is shooting for the action film Saaho.

On the work front, after the success of Stree, Shraddha will be seen essaying varied characters in her upcoming films Saaho, Chhichhore, Saina and the next installment of ABCD which are set to be released in 2019.
