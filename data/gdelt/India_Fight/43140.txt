'How can a Sikh think of weakening Akal Takht'

SULTANPUR LODHI: Taking strong exception to Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal 's remarks that the Congress government in Punjab was playing politics to weaken Akal Takht , chief minister Amarinder Singh launched a counter offensive on Tuesday. He said how could a Sikh even think of challenging the authority of Akal Takht."Harsmirat is one of the most ill-informed women that I have ever heard. She is speaking completely without knowing the facts. Akal Takht was established by the sixth Guru and all Sikhs bow before it. Is she crazy to say that we have undermined its authority? Who can dare to challenge Akal Takht? Why she does not find the facts before she talks? I don't know how she works in Delhi? She has no knowledge of what she is talking," he said during an interaction with media after convening a meeting of Punjab cabinet in Sultanpur Lodhi town of Kapurthala.Amarinder also ridiculed Harsimrat over her comments that Punjab government did not support agri-based industry. "I find her totally illogical. There is no point in discussing her," he said.He also rejected the allegations that the state government was not cooperating with the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) for the celebrations to mark the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak Dev.
