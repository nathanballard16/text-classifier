Thalapathy 65: Will Magizh Thirumeni direct Vijay in his next?

Fresh off from the mammoth success of Bigil, Vijay is presently busy shooting for his upcoming film, which is tentatively titled, Thalapathy 64. Directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj, the film is tipped to be a gangster flick set in a college backdrop. Even before Thalapathy 64 could be wrapped up, news about his upcoming film started doing the rounds.

If rumours are anything to believe, director Magizh Thirumeni is said to have met Vijay recently and has narrated his script. Reportedly, Magizh is yet to hear from Vijay and is confident that this project might materialise soon.

However, certain sources reveal that Vijay is yet to decide on his 65th film and hence rumours regarding Magizh Thirumeni directing him in a film could be mere speculations. Soon, an official confirmation regarding the same will be shared by the makers.

Magizh Thirumeni has some brilliant films like Thadaiyara Thaaka, Meghamann and Thadam under his credit. Of the four films that he has directed, three of them were critically acclaimed. Hence, his combination with Vijay could do wonders, if everything goes as per plan.

Vijay is currently in Delhi shooting for Thalapathy 64 along with Malavika Mohanan. It is said that romantic portions featuring the two actors will be shot in this schedule which is expected to go on for 40 days.

Meanwhile, It is rumoured that Lokesh Kanagaraj, who is helming Thalapathy 64 might direct his 65th film as well.
