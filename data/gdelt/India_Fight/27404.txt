Third BJP leader murdered in West Bengal in 3 days; Party blames Mamata's TMC

The BJP worker who was murdered in 24 Paragana was only 25-year-old. The onus of the killing has been levied on TMC leaders, therefore BJP workers were seen staging a protest at 24 Paragana after the bone-chilling murder of their party worker. They also sought an arrest of those behind murder.

Before this, another party worker who had quit TMC to join Bharatiya Janta Party was shot dead in Nadia on May 24.
