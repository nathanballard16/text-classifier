Police crack murder committed by gay partner

A former research scholar from IIT-Delhi, who was found dead in a hotel room on Thursday, had been killed by his gay partner, police said.

The S. R. Nagar police, who are investigating the murder of Srikanth Reddy, a native of Guntur in Andhra Pradesh, said that his partner S. Naresh from Medak confessed to killing him. He later attempted to end his life by slitting the throat in the same room, said the police.

Irked over the sudden decision of Srikanth getting married to a woman, Naresh asked the latter to meet him one last time, before breaking their relationship. Accordingly, the duo checked in at Krrish Inn in Ameerpet on July 2 and stayed for two days, said the investigators.

“We suspect that it was a preplanned murder, as the accused had carried a knife which he used in the offence. He also had a rope,” said the police.

Srikanth, who was pursuing his post-doctoral in Dubai had come to India on June 14 and got engaged to a woman from Visakhapatnam on June 20. Their marriage was scheduled for next month. The police suspect that Srikanth and Naresh had a heated argument over the former’s marriage plan.

Naresh was undergoing treatment at a private hospital in the city.
