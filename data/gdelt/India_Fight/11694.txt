The conflict between India and neighbouring Pakistan has escalated to a level not seen since the 1970s; the rival nations, which both possess nuclear weapons capabilities, have already exchanged artillery fire and the nations' fighter jets have engaged each other in the skies above the contested Kashmir region.

In the aftermath of the JeM suicide attack which killed over 40 Indian soldiers in Pulwama in Kashmir, India conducted an air strike on alleged terror camps located within Pakistan.
