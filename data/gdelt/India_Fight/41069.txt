Pakistan President Arif Alvi Gets Notice From Twitter Over Post On Kashmir

The very fact that Twitter had to even send what I regard as an offensive notice to the President is ridiculous! If Twitter found there was no reason to suspend then there was no need to send notice to the President either! What were they trying to prove? https://t.co/Gpg3w92hPM — Shireen Mazari (@ShireenMazari1) August 27, 2019

Twitter has sent a notice to Pakistan President Arif Alvi over his tweet on the situation in Kashmir, according to a media report. Human Rights Minister Shireen Mazari posted the screen shot of a mail received by President Alvi from Twitter authorities and said the notice was "in bad taste and simply ridiculous." On Monday, President Alvi tweeted a video showing a protest rally over the Kashmir issue. On Sunday, Minister for Communication Murad Saeed said he has also received a notice from the micro-blogging site that one of his tweets has violated Indian laws. Director General (DG) Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor last week said the authorities had taken up with Twitter and Facebook the alleged suspension of Pakistani social media accounts posting in support of Kashmir. "Pakistan authorities have taken up the case with Twitter and Facebook against suspending Pakistani accounts for posting in support of Kashmir. Indian staff at their regional headquarters is the reason," he said in a tweet.Tensions between India and Pakistan spiked after India abrogated provisions of Article 370 of the Constitution to withdraw Jammu and Kashmir's special status and bifurcated it into two Union Territories, evoking strong reactions from Pakistan.
