Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalal to tie the knot sooner than expected? Read on

Varun Dhawan and Natasha Dalal were spotted together in a plush suburb of Mumbai. The speculation is rife that the duo will make an announcement with respect to their wedding. These two lovebirds have been spotted with each other many times in the past, and don't mind getting clicked by the paparazzi. Varun is seen sporting an orange number, while his lady love is seen wearing a blue top with black shorts. Every time this couple is spotted together, it only further fuels the rumors of their wedding happening sooner than expected and that both the families have started the wedding preparation in full swing.

When Varun's father and renowned director David Dhawan, was quizzed about his son's wedding, he said, he would have loved to see Varun getting married, but the marriage will not take place this year, as Varun has kept his date diary packed with shoots. Varun is shooting for Remo D’Souza film, and then he will start work on David Dhawan's next film. David also further added that Varun will himself announce the wedding and his family will start the preparations once he is ready.

It is rather interesting to see if Varun and Natasha go ahead with their wedding this year, or whether they decide to push it further and finish shooting for his father, David Dhawan's film. We wish to see this lovely couple get married as soon, as Varun's fans would love to see the duo together as a happily married couple. It is up to Varun-Natasha to set a date and make the announcement that everyone is eager to hear.
