Looks Like PM Modi Has Found His On-Screen NSA As Akshay Kumar Might Play Ajit Doval In His Next

Akshay Kumar has been rightly termed as the new age Bharat Kumar as he has been strictly choosing scripts that are either about relevant issues reflecting the society, or a biopic on someone who has done a lot for the country.

With Mission Mangal, Housefull 4, Good News, Sooryavanshi, Laxmmi Bomb, Bachchan Pandey and Ikka in his pipeline, Akshay seems to be every director's choice.

According to recent reports, Akshay has been roped in for one more project which is based on the life of Ajit Doval, India's National Security Advisor to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Akshay will be reuniting with director Neeraj Pandey for that.

The research has already begun but it will take time before the project actually gets in motion. “Neeraj will first make Chanakya with Ajay Devgn, which was announced a few months ago. Akshay also has to complete prior commitments. The team wants to lock the script before making an official announcement,” a source told a leading tabloid.

Neeraj Pandey has previously directed several Akshay Kumar-starrers like Special 26, Baby and Rustom.

Talking about Ajit, he started out as an IPS officer in the 1968 batch with the Kerala cadre. He has been a part of the anti-insurgency operations in Mizoram and Punjab in the late 1960s. He also helped in the release of passengers from IC-814 in Kandahar in 1999.

After joining PM Modi's cabinet, Ajit strategized the surgical strike against Pakistan after the deadly Uri attack in 2016 and also the Balakot airstrike in February this year after the Pulwama attack.

It will be interesting to see how Akshay essays the character of Ajit Doval.

Previously, Akshay was in the limelight when he interviewed PM Narendra Modi.
