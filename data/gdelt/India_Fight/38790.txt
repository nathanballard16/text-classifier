Delhi man absconding in murder case arrested from Agra

A 22-year-old man absconding in a murder case for more than a year was arrested from Agra, police said on Sunday.

The accused, Jeetesh, carrying a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head, was wanted in the murder case where he along with his associates had allegedly killed one Vijay Kumar in Nand Nagri area in March last year, they said.

In another case in October last year, Jeetesh, along with his associates Samir, Prashant and Ansul, had set a car of one Kartar Singh on fire to avenge the death of his father, police said.

In 2017, Jeetesh married a girl from another community, following which his wife's relatives killed his father last year. Thereafter, he along with his friends set the car of Singh, his wife's relative, on fire, they said.

Jeetesh was also declared a proclaimed offender by a city court, they added.

He fled to Agra after the two incidents and was nabbed from the city on Saturday following a tip-off, police said.

A pistol along with four live cartridges intended was recovered from his house in Delhi's Nand Nagri area, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) G Ram Gopal Naik said.

Interrogation revealed that his friend Deepak had an enmity with Kumar and wanted to take revenge from him. So, he along with Deepak and other friends, stabbed Kumar, the officer said.
