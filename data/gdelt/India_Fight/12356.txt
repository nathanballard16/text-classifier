Caste, Aadhaar details make Seva Mitra controversial

VIJAYAWADA: The Seva Mitra app, developed by IT Grids (India) Private Limited, requires a TDP membership number and a password.TDP selected party members as Seva Mitras at polling booth level. He said Telangana cops should have transferred the case to Andhra Pradesh police, similar to the Jayaram murder case. Taking feedback from party members was not a crime and Seva Mitra app was intended to do the same, he said.Chekuri said no government data was stolen and even if there was any, Telangana police did not have any jurisdiction to probe the complaint. He said information on Aadhaar , caste and other details were collected since the party provided insurance coverage to every member.He said the reason for profiling a list of beneficiaries is to check for any shortcoming in the delivery mechanism. They would check if members in their areas were residing at the given address and had they received government benefits.The app’s features such as profiling voters based on caste and party affiliations have led to controversy.TDP spokesperson KC Chekuri said the app has only 75 lakh party members.
