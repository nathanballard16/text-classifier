Pune: In another major bust on a high profile sex racket running in Pune’s Viman Nagar area, police arrested two people who forced two girls, including a foreigner, into prostitution. The accused have been identified as 26-year-old Vishal Mahadu Nrirmal and 32-year-old Krushna Prakash Nair.

Viman Nagar police had received a tip off about a prostitution racket being operated from a hotel in the area wherein two girls, one of them being foreigner, were forced to prostitution. After verification of the tip off, police set a trap and exposed the sex racket. The police sent a decoy customer to the hotel after getting information about the sex racket to nab the culprits.

The decoy customer contacted the pimps and struck a deal with them to supply the girls. As soon as the decoy gave the signal to the police team, they raided the hotel when the girls reached the designated hotel room and arrested the pimps.

The girls were sent to rescue home after their statements were recorded. One of the girl who was forced into flesh trade hails from Uzbekistan.

While Visham Nirmal and Krushna Nair have been arrested, three others have also been booked for the crime but are at large currently. Police seized Rs 5,000 cash, two mobile phones and one car from the accused. Offence has been registered against the accused under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Further investigations are on.
