Dredging works begin in Jet lake

Krishnagiri: The district administration has commenced dredging work in ‘Jet’ lake near Veppanahalli with the support of Katerra, a leading design and global construction company that has entered into collaboration with the state government to address the ongoing acute water crisis owing to delayed monsoon across the state.

District collector S Prabhakar said the Jet lake was one of the biggest lakes in Veppanahalli panchayat union and hoped the dredging would help remove sediments and debris from the lake and ensure a regular water depth.

Dredging would also improve the quality of water, besides paving way for a healthier aquatic eco-system, a source said.

The collector said they were planning to clean 1,300 waterbodies in and around the district. “This initiative would not have been possible without the help and support of corporates and communities in the district. The restoration programme has already been initiated in areas such as Hosur, Denkanikottai, Thalli and Soolagiri.”

Nejeeb Khan, India head (design and business strategy), Katerra group of companies, said they were happy to extend their support to the initiative taken up by the state government. “Actions like this are critical to helping villages in battling the ongoing water crisis.”

Divisional revenue officer Shanthi, block development officer Ramachandran and others participated in the inaugural function that was held on July 23.
