Katrina Kaif has already shot her first poster with Akshay Kumar for 'Sooryavanshi'

Katrina Kaif continues to be in big demand. Earlier, After Hrs had conjectured that the Bharat actress might clash with her best friend Salman Khan next Eid because she is the leading lady of Sooryavanshi. Well, the conjecture is now giving way to confirmation. Kat has already shot for its poster with the film’s leading man, Akshay Kumar.

Later this summer, the two Bollywood superstars will begin shooting the exciting, fast-paced cop drama that has a ‘contraband’ angle to it.
