A former aide of fugitive gangster Dawood Ibrahim, Shakeel Ahmed Sheikh alias 'Lambu' Shakeel, died at Jaslok Hospital in South-Mumbai on Sunday night.

Shakeel was suffering from a heart ailment and died late on Sunday night, said a hospital official.

"Shakeel used to oversee smuggling and hawala operations of the Dawood gang in the 1990s and was a trusted lieutenant of the latter as well another gang operative, Chhota Shakeel," said a crime branch officer.

"He took part in the gang's gold smuggling activities too," added the official.

Sheikh was booked under stringent TADA (Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, now repealed, for rioting and murder by Mata Ramabai Ambedkar Marg police station in 1991.

"Having fled the country, he organised hawala rackets before being held and deported from Dubai in 2003," the officer added.

After he returned to the city in 2003, Sheikh was arrested in an extortion case, said Sachin Kadam, senior police inspector, Anti-Extortion Cell, Mumbai Police.

"Shakeel Shaikh earned nickname Lambu, because of his height. He used to settle disputes for Dawood gang," said the officer.
