Rajinikanth and wife Latha's new photo from Darbar shoot will reaffirm your faith in love

Rajinikanth is hailed as the Superstar of Indian cinema. But he is also a loving husband and doting father to his two daughters. Very rarely we get to see Thalaivar's romantic side, and a photo of him with wife Latha from the shooting spot of Darbar surfaced online yesterday.

In the photo, Rajinikanth is seen dressed a cop, while Latha Rajinikanth looks elegant in a saree. She has her hands on Rajinikanth's shoulders and we can't get enough of their love. The couple has been together for nearly 38 years now and they still continue to set relationship goals for their daughters and fans.

Here's the photo:

Rajinikanth and his wife Latha at Darbar shooting spot

Rajinikanth first met Latha Rangachari on the sets of the Tamil film Thillu Mullu in the year 1980. Incidentally, Latha had come to interview Rajinikanth as part of her college work. During the interview, Rajinikanth and Latha discovered common interests and the former felt an inexplicable feeling which made him propose to her by the end of the interview.

However, Latha smiled at him and said that she needed to talk to her parents first. Later, Rajinikanth took the help of YG Mahendran and other seniors in the film industry to convince Latha's parents.

On February 26, 1981, Rajinikanth and Latha tied the knot at Tirupati temple in Andhra Pradesh. They welcomed two daughters, Aishwarya in 1982 and Soundarya in 1984.

On the work front, Rajinikanth is presently camping in Mumbai to shoot for AR Murugadoss's Darbar. The action flick, bankrolled by Lyca Productions, is slated to hit the theatres on Pongal 2020.
