Rajkot's Rashtriya Shala plans Bapu’s museum with priceless pictures

RAJKOT: Rajkot's Rashtriya Shala , which will be completing 100 years in 2021, is celebrating Mahatma Gandhi ’s 150th Birth anniversary celebration on Tuesday. Founded by Bapu, the Shala will celebrate both the occasions with a museum that will depict Bapu 's Satyagraha movement in Saurashtra, more specifically in Rajkot.Rajkot preserves a special memory of Bapu, who not only spent his childhood in the city but also did his education here. This was also the city where the Father of the Nation staged his Satyagraha movement and many eminent freedom fighters joined him in his battle against the British Raj.A museum depicting Bapu's entire life — from Mohan to Mahatma — was inaugurated last year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Located barely 2km away from the Rashtriya Shala, the museum, built by the state government in the school where bapu did his primary schooling, has turned out to be a major centre of attraction for both Indian as well as foreign tourists.However, very few people visit the Shala, the place where Gandhiji had started his fasts in 1939.Therefore, in order to attract more people to the Shala, the trust has come up with an idea of creating a museum at the prayer hall of Shala where Gandhiji used to pray during his stay at Rajkot, with some of the rare pictures they have in their treasure as well as with some of the old freedom fighters. Priceless photographs in the collection depict Bapu's journey from his struggle for freedom from the British Raj during his stay in Rajkot and Saurashtra, to how Mohandas metamorphosed into the Mahatma.The renovated prayer hall is now ready to be converted into the museum. It has six rooms which will be converted into the museum. One room will depict Gandhiji’s childhood and thereafter his freedom struggle in Saurashtra. Another room will be dedicated to freedom fighters of Gujarat like Dhebarbhai, Kanubhai Gandhi, Mahadev Desai and other people who were around the Mahatma during his lifetime. However, the proposed museum, which won’t be as luxurious as the Mahatma Museum, will be kept as simple as possible as it had been when Bapu was around with lanterns installed for lighting instead of modern fixes.
