Masood Azhar Should Be Brought To Justice Says Arjun Kapoor

Arjun Kapoor hails the gallant efforts of Indian Government for getting Masood Azhar name in terrorist list by UN.

The UN has designated the leader of a militant group behind a deadly bomb attack that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of war as a terrorist. The UN move comes after China dropped its objection to the listing. India hailed it as a diplomatic victory.

Masood Azhar is the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which carried out a suicide bombing in February killing 40 troops in Indian-administered Kashmir. He will be subject to an assets freeze and a travel ban.

Talking about Indian Diplomatic win on the sidelines of IMW Trailer launch actor Arjun Kapoor said, "UN has finally agreed that he a threat and it is about time that better sense prevails and we all can see how the government has been pro-active for the last few years trying to get him to be called a threat. And now that he is a threat, action is taken and we can bring him to justice for all the innocent lives lost"

The proposal had been brought forward by the US, Britain and France after the Kashmir attacks - the deadliest in the disputed region during a 30-year-long insurgency.

The attack worsened tensions between nuclear-armed Pakistan and India, with war temporarily appearing a real possibility.

China - a long-time ally of Pakistan - had previously blocked the sanctions committee from imposing sanctions on Masood Azhar in 2016 and 2017 but agreed to the proposal on Wednesday.

Meanwhile on the work front, Arjun Kapoor is currently busy with India's Most Wanted, post that he will be seen in Panipat and Sandeep Aur Pinky Faraar.
