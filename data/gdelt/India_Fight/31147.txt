Kolkata: Class 10 female student found dead in GD Birla School with her wrists slit

In a macabre incident, a Class 10 student of GD Birla School in Kolkata was found dead under mysterious circumstances on Friday. Kritika Pal, a Class 10 student who was academically gifted was found lying in a pool of blood with her wrist slit, inside a bathroom.

She was rushed to a hospital where she was declared brought dead. The police are investigating if it was a suicide or a murder. She was a class topper and a three-page suicide note has been unearthed.

The cops of Kolkata’s Crime Branch – which is known locally as the Detective Department – are yet to ascertain cause of death. Her face was covered with a plastic and she could’ve died due to suffocation or her slit wrists.

She was missing for 45 minutes before her body was found. Questions are already being raised how the teachers and school helpers missed her absence. Her friends said she was fine throughout the day and they couldn’t find her after the break. It was only in the last period of the day that they found out she was in one of the toilets.
