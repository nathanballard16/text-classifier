Mystery shrouds death of a mobile shop owner

Rajkot: A mobile shop owner was found dead under mysterious circumstances in the ground of Tapas Society on Nana Mava Road on Thursday night.

Police said the victim, identified as Tushar Patel (36), had consumed poison.

However, before consuming poison, Patel had sent a WhatsApp message to his wife Kavita, alleging that he was forced to consume poison by those with whom he had a financial dispute.

“However, our investigation with the help of forensic science laboratory experts revealed that there were no signs of forceful attempt to force the poison down Patel’s throat, nor his clothes had any residuals of poison left on them. It appears that Patel had ended his life on his own,” said V S Vanzara, inspector with Rajkot taluka police station.
