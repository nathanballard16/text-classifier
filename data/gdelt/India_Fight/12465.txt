India is terrorising Rohingya refugees in Kashmir

"The [Indian] military officer told us in our home: 'India is not your country, so you have to leave and go back to Myanmar,'" a Rohingya Muslim refugee in Kashmir told Fortify Rights, a non-profit human rights organisation based in south-east Asia.





Other Rohingya refugees describe threats and beatings at the hands of Indian security forces and even private Indian citizens, attacks that have increased in both frequency and ferocity in recent months and years.





When Myanmar launched its most recent crackdown on its 1.3 million Rohingya population in 2017, one that the United Nations has described as "textbook ethnic cleansing", Hindu nationalists and extremists capitalised on India's growing animus towards its 200 million Muslims by whipping up fear of a massive Rohingya refugee influx into the country.





When I spoke with Ashley Kinseth, founder and director of Stateless Dignity, a human rights advocacy group for stateless people worldwide, she told me how government officials in the Jammu region of Indian-administered Kashmir have even advocated for an "identify and kill" movement, one meant to single out Rohingya Muslims and then murder them as a form of what can only be described as a deranged form of hyper-nationalist vigilante justice.





"What really struck me is the effects that this Hindu nationalist movement is having on the Rohingya Muslims, and it mirrors this global trend towards not only Islamophobia but also nationalism and populism, which is really something that the current Indian prime minister and his political party have drawn on," said Kinseth.







The Indian government estimates there are up to 40,000 Rohingya refugees living in scattered settlements throughout India, largely in the states of Jammu and Kashmir, Telangana, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Rajasthan - an estimate that is most likely exaggerated by India's right wing ruling party, BJP, especially given that the

UNHCR

has documented and registered a total of only 18,000 Rohingya refugees in this country of more than a billion people.





Nevertheless, the persecution and fear these survivors of violent dispossession and dislocation experienced in the country of their birth is now being re-lived in the country they sought sanctuary.





In a single week in mid-January, India used the threat of violent force to push 31 Rohingya refugees out of Indian territory towards Bangladesh, where they were eventually denied entry, and trapped on the "zero line", or rather a "no-man's land" on the India-Bangladesh border, according to
