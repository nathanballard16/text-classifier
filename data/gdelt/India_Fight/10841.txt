Indian High Commission in Pak gives demarche to Foreign Ministry for safe return of Indian pilot

Indian High Commission in Pakistan, last evening, gave a demarche to Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the immediate and safe return of the Indian Air Force pilot captured after air combat on Wednesday.

According to sources, the Indian High Commission gave a demarche to not only the Pakistan Foreign Affair Ministry but also to Pakistan's acting High Commissioner in New Delhi for the release and return of the Wing Commander.

Following air combat between the Indian and Pakistani air force, the Indian pilot was captured on Wednesday after he was ejected safely from his MiG 21 Bison aircraft but landed across the Line of Control (LoC) in the neighbour country.

The wing commander, whose MiG 21 Bison aircraft was shot down by the Pakistan Air Force, is currently in Pakistan Army's custody.

Hours later, after his capture, the Pakistan Army released a video, where the pilot could be seen drinking tea.

He answered questions with composure and no display of fear.

The Ministry of External Affairs then summoned the acting high commissioner of Pakistan and demanded the immediate and safe return of the Wing Commander.

The pilot lives in Madambakkam in south Chennai and joined the IAF in 2004 after training at the Tambaram Air Force station.
