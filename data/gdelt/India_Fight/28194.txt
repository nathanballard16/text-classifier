Katrina Kaif reveals why she is worried about Janhvi Kapoor’s OTT gym shorts; Find out

When it comes to hitting the gym, nobody does it better than our B-town celebs because every day, they hit the gym in style and with a lot of panache. Just like their red carpet outfits, celebs surely have a separate wardrobe for their gym/Pilates outings and we say this, because whenever these B-town celebs are papped outside their gym, they make sure they never repeat an outfit. From Janhvi Kapoor, Malaika Arora, Sara Ali Khan, Mira Rajput to Kareena Kapoor Khan and others, these B-town divas dish out some serious gym fashion goals.

And talking about gym fashion, at the chat show with Neha Dhupia, Katrina Kaif was quizzed about, “Which celebrity goes OTT in his/her gym, and workout looks?” and to this, this Bharat actress took Dhadak actress Janhvi Kapoor’s name, that’s right! Kat said, “Not OTT, but I am concerned about the very, very short shorts that Jahnvi wears! She comes to my gym as well, so we, often are together in the gym. I just worry about her sometimes.” Well, we hope that 22-year-old Janvhi Kapoor is hearing this piece of advice from senior actor and perhaps, takes cue.

On the work front, Katrina Kaif is currently busy with the promotions of Ali Abbas Zafar’s Bharat opposite Salman Khan, and post Bharat, Katrina will begin shooting for Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi opposite Akshay Kumar. Talking about Janvhi Kapoor, after wowing the audiences with her debut film Dhadak opposite Ishaan Khatter, currently, Janhvi Kapoor is shooting for a film based on the life of Gunjan Saxena and for the same, the actress was spotted in Lucknow for the same.
