Fires Across Patna Dampen Diwali Spirit

Patna: Diwali was particularly infernal this year as the state capital reported more than a dozen cases of fire caused by stray fireworks resulting in loss of properties to the tune of several lakh rupees. Fortunately, no one was reportedly hurt in any incident.

On Wednesday evening, fire was reported from a Bhojpuri film studio located within Rajdhani Hotel on Exhibition Road that took two hours and five fire trucks to finally be able to douse the raging flame. During the entire period, Exhibition Road was shut down causing traffic gridlock in adjacent areas.

Another ferocious fire destroyed a shoe godown near Doctors' Colony in Kankarbagh. Shoes and chappals worth several thousand rupees were gutted in the blaze that was apparently caused by a 'deeya' (an oil lamp) left inside by the owner of the company. Two fire trucks from the Kankarbagh Fire Station fought the fire for about an hour before getting the situation under control.

In yet another incident, a furniture warehouse was completely destroyed when a firecracker ignited a massive fire on Diwali night on Digha Ashiana Road. The fact that the warehouse is located near the house of Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav made the firefighters react swiftly and even after getting control over the situation, two fire trucks remained on the site till next morning.

Fires were reported from a motor parts shop near the CDA building and from Frazer Road where an electrical transformer near the Central Mall caught fire threatening other shops in the area.
