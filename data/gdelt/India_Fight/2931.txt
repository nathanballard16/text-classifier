DU student killed, relatives injured in accident

Car overturned after hitting a divider in Gulabi Bagh; all victims are teenagers

A 19-year-old Delhi University student was killed and his three teenage relatives were injured when their car overturned after hitting a divider in north Delhi’s Gulabi Bagh in the early hours of Wednesday.

Shivam, a resident of Regar Pura near Karol Bagh in central Delhi, was a first-year BA student at DU’s School of Open Learning (SOL).

The car belonged to his father. The injured persons have been identified as Kashish alias Badal (18); Nitin (18) and Arnesh Shankar (19).

The victims, who were returning from a family wedding, were on the way to eat parathas in Haryana’s Murthal when the incident happened.

The medical examination report is awaited to determine whether they were drunk at the time of the accident, said a police officer.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (North) Nupur Prasad said the accident took place around 3 a.m. near a gurdwara in Gulabi Bagh.

An eyewitness told the police that the vehicle was speeding. It allegedly hit the concrete road divider and flipped twice before coming to a halt after skidding for few metres. Passers-by rushed to help the victims and informed the police about the incident.

“All four teenagers were rushed to a hospital, where Shivam was declared brought dead. He had suffered serious head injuries,” said the police, adding that Regar Pura resident Arnesh was discharged after treatment.

Kashish and Nitin belong to Chandigarh. They had come to Delhi to attend a family wedding, said the police.
