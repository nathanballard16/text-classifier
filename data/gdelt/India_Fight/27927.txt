Madhavaram is a neighbourhood in North Chennai best known for its milk colony. In the early 1990s Aavin, the state-owned cooperative, decided to set up base here and since then, it has become its central dairy. The suburb has transformed itself from being a relatively unknown neighbourhood to now having many a multi-storied structure and becoming a part of the city’s efficient transport system.
