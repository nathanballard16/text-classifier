Man injured in leg, ward boy ties bandage on jeans at Madhya Pradesh hospital

BARWANI: Call it an act of sheer negligence that defied even common sense. A ward body at government hospital in Sendhwa tied bandage on a villager, who was injured in leg, right over jeans he was wearing.The incident occurred on Thursday, when a resident of Deewaniya village, Shobharam, was brought to 100-bed civil hospital after he was injured in an accident involving a two-wheeler. “He was checked by Dr Vijendra Kalen, who asked his staff to carry out dressing of his wounds,” Sendhwa block medical officer, Dr JP Pandi told TOI.He said that due to absence of a dresser, a ward boy tied bandage on knee and calf of the injured person but over jeans he was wearing ( and not directly on the wounds). “ As soon as the incident came to notice, Shobharma's jeans were cut and his knees were dressed properly,” Dr Pandit said.About the ward boy’s action, Dr Pandit said that as only one dresser was posted in this 100-bed hospital against the sanctioned posts of four, they cannot engage a dresser for 24 hours. “Because of this shortage, the ward boy used to carry out dressings under supervision of a nurse. In this case, the doctor after issuing instruction for dressing, got busy preparing Shobharam's MLC,” he said.Dr Pandit said that there were only seven doctors in the hospital against sanctioned strength of 20 physicians and even number of ward boys and nurses was not as per sanctioned strength.After the incident came into light on Friday, Sendhwa Sub-Divisional Officer (Revenue) BS Kalesh visited the hospital and inquired about the incident.Dr Pandit said that the ward boy had been removed from the duty.
