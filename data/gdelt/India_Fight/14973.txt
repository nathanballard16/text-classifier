It’s been a while since the rumours of trouble brewing between Erica Fernandes and Hina Khan started doing rounds and since people have started believing it too, the latter has opened up about it. Hina, who is known for calling a spade a spade, addressed these rumours and called them ‘stupid’. While speaking exclusively to Bombay Times, the actress said, “I have been inundated with calls regarding my alleged issues with Erica, but I chose to not respond, as I find these rumours stupid. It’s only been a few months since I have started shooting for this show, and every relationship grows organically. I can’t impose myself on someone nor can the other person do it."

Speaking more about it, she added, “Erica is a very sweet girl. In fact, everyone in the team is nice. Sometimes, you connect with people instantly, or you take time. There are also times when two people, who are good individually, fail to gel with each other. Shaadiyaan toot jaati hain.”

Hina also said that in Erica and her case, they have known each other for just two-three months. “The other actors share a great rapport with each other, because they have been shooting together since six months. They have a lot of memories; I can understand that. Erica and I talk a lot, but I would not say that we are friends. May be, with time we would become friends, but I don’t see that happening because I am taking a break from the show in the next month-and-a-half.”, stated the actress.

While Hina has opened up on the rumours, Erica is still tight-lipped about the same. Both the actresses are playing important roles in the show Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2. Erica plays the protagonist Prerna and Hina plays the antagonist and the iconic character of Indian TV Komolika.
