NEW DELHI, Jan. 11 (Xinhua) -- A special court in India convicted self-styled "Godman" Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh, who was already in jail over rape charges in the murder case of a journalist more than 16 years ago.

A journalist named Ramchandra Chhatrapati was murdered after he had published an anonymous letter about the sexual exploitation of women by Singh at his headquarters "Dera Sacha Sauda" in Sirsa district of northern state Haryana.

Besides the "Godman," three others were too pronounced guilty in the journalist's murder case. The quantum of punishment will be announced on Jan. 17, said media reports.

Violence erupted in Panchkula and Sirsa districts of Haryana in August 2017 after Singh was convicted in the rape cases. Over 40 people were killed and scores of others injured in the violence.

The self-styled "Godman" was infamous for leading a mysterious life, wearing colourful clothes, riding high-end motorbikes, and owning huge properties both in India and abroad. He enjoyed tremendous political influence in Haryana state across all major political parties and senior politicians.

He was found guilty of forcibly keeping women at his headquarters in Sirsa for deriving sexual favors.
