Pulwama Attack, Stand With Govt To End Terror, Says Congress Ghulam Nabi Azad After All Party-Meet Ends

The government briefed the political parties on the terror attack that killed at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force jawans in South Kashmir on Thursday when a convoy of security forces was targeted by terrorists.

Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad addressed the media after the all-party meeting and said, “We told the home minister that he should tell the PM on our behalf that he himself should meet all national and regional party presidents."

"The PM should call a meeting of these heads and discuss the issues with them. All parties supported this suggestion. We have made it clear that whatever Rahul Gandhi said in the Press conference yesterday we repeated it at the meeting. The whole country is in mourning and is sad, is angry.", he added.

The all-party meeting passed a resolution condemning the Pulwama terrorist attack today in New Delhi.

The meeting convened by Home Minister Rajnath Singh, who was in Kashmir on Friday to take stock of the situation was attended by Ghulam Nabi Azad, Anand Sharma and Jyotiraditya Scindia of the Congress, Sudip Bandyopadhyay and Derek O'Brien of the TMC, Sanjay Raut of the Shiv Sena, Jithendra Reddy of the TRS, Naresh Gujral of the Akali Dal, Upendra Kushwaha of the RLSP and Jai Prakash Narayan Yadav, D Raja of the CPI, Farooq Abdullah of the National Conference, Ram Vilas Paswan of the LJP among others.

The decision to hold an all-party meet was announced by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley after he emerged from a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) on Friday morning. Jaitley announced that the all-party meet would be called soon after Rajnath Singh’s return from Kashmir.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has warned Pakistan to expect a strong response to the suicide attack as the government said it had "incontrovertible evidence" of the country's involvement, a statement quickly rejected by Islamabad.
