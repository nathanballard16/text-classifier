A man has been arrested in connection with a quadruple homicide in West Chester, Ohio, police said Tuesday.Gurpreet Singh, who is identified as the man who initially called 911 to report the slayings and the husband of one of the victims, has been arrested.Authorities said Singh, 37, was placed under arrest in Connecticut and faces four aggravated murder charges. He called 911 on April 28 to report the killings of the four family members.Prosecutors say they will seek the death penalty.Singh is the husband of Shalinderjit Kaur, who was found shot three times in the head. Kaur's parents -- Hakiakat Singh Pannag and Parmjit Kaur -- were also killed, along with her aunt, Amarjit Kaur. Authorities said the victims were shot a total of 18 times inside an apartment at the Lakefront at West Chester. All but one of the shots were to their heads. A preliminary autopsy released in late May shows how gruesome the slayings were.Hakiakat Singh Pannag was found lying on his left side in his bed. He had been shot eight times in the head. His wife, Parmjit Kaur, had been shot five times. Four gunshot wounds were to the head and one was to an arm. She was found on the living room floor.Shalinderjit Kaur suffered three gunshot wounds to the head. Her body was found in the dining room.Amarjit Kaur, was shot twice in the head. Her body was found near her sister's, in the living room.The autopsy reports for all four state that rigor mortis had set in, and that the victims were likely dead for a while before being found by a family member.The four victims were well known in the Cincinnati area's Sikh community, investigators said. Relatives of the victims are now asking the Indian government to get involved with the homicide investigation."We want only justice. We are demanding the Indian government that they should talk to (the) American government," said Jasdeep Singh, Amarjit Kaur's son. "It's been two months, and it's really a shock. We are in shock for (the) last two months."Singh led a march for justice Sunday in Punjab, India. Hundreds of people, including many from the Sikh community, attended.In a written statement, West Chester Township spokeswoman Barb Wilson said, "West Chester police investigators continue to follow countless leads and gather evidence aided by multiple agencies, the community and those who knew the victims. It is critical to the investigation that details and evidence be carefully guarded in order to preserve the integrity of the case, the identification of a potential suspect and future prosecution."Police Chief Joel Herzog wants everyone to know that the victims and their families, here and in India, are very much on the minds of officers as the investigation continues. This case will continue to be our top priority until those who committed this crime are held accountable."
