They allegedly charged hefty fees for the procedures.Shama Parveen Sheikh, 28, and Rohit Yadav, 26 reportedly also posed as doctors despite having no medical degree, police said.Sheikh and Yadav were arrested on Wednesday evening and have been booked under sections 420 (fraud) and 315 (act done with intent to prevent child being born alive or to cause it to die after birth) of the Indian Penal Code, besides various provisions of the Maharashtra Medical Practitioners Act and theThe scam came to light after a lawyer, who found out about the clinic through her colleague, conducted a sting operation and helped the cops nab the two red-handed.On June 30, an employee told Chitra Salunkhe of the illegal procedures being undertaken at Charu Hospital in Govandi.“In order to verify these claims, I called up the hospital claiming that I needed the test performed on a pregnant relative. Sheikh quoted the rate of the test, plus the abortion in case it was a girl child as Rs 1,20,000, which was subsequently brought down to Rs 1lakh after a little bit of bargaining,” Salunkhe stated in her complaint to the police.The first appointment took place on July 7when an advance of Rs 50,000 was paid to the accused. “One of my assistants went there with a pregnant woman who agreed to help us. They shot the proceedings and the entire conversation on my phone. The two can be seen taking the money and explaining the procedures,” she stated.Since the woman was 24 weeks pregnant –4 weeks past the legal limit for termination of pregnancy – she was ‘advised’ to forego sex determination in order to ‘save time’, Salunkhe said in her complaint. The next appointment was scheduled for July 10.Armed with evidence – her call records, and the video – Salunkhe approached the police.“Based on this information, we teamed up with the complainant and got the dummy patient to request the doctors to go ahead with the abortion despite the legal window ending,” said Senior Police Inspector Deepak Pagare of Shivaji Nagar police.On the day of the appointment, a police team and Salunkhe’s employee waited downstairs at the hospital as the dummy patient and a man who pretended to be her husband went upstairs.The police raided the premises and apprehended the accused red-handed as they were prepping the woman for abortion.“In our investigation, we found that the two identified themselves as doctors despite not having any medical degree,” said Pagare.
