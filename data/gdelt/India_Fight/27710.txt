Senior official checks work at dump yard

Coimbatore: Corporation deputy commissioner Prasanna Ramasamy on Tuesday inspected the construction of a five-lakh-litre sump at the Vellalore dump yard.

Water from the sump would be used to conduct firefighting operations if another fire breaks out at the yard, corporation officials said.

To prevent fire accidents at the dump yard, the corporation has been spraying water over the accumulated waste, a senior official said. “We are also planning to construct an overhead tank (OHT) at the dump yard to enhance spraying of water across the 650 acres. Also, works are going on to compartmentalize the accumulated waste,” he said.

Non-compartmentalization of wastes was cited as the main reason for the delay in extinguishing the fire that broke out in the yard a couple of months ago. The corporation had to seek the assistance of the Indian Air Force, which used a chopper to control the fire after firefighters and corporation works failed to do so even after 70 hours of struggle.

The corporation is also planning to set up a green belt around the yard.

The civic body is planning to install several CCTV cameras across the dump yard, which would be useful to tighten the monitoring system, said another official. “We plan to install over 50 CCTV cameras,” he said. “Once the micro-composting centres are operational, the amount of waste reaching the yard would be reduced considerably,” he added.
