81-YO Arrested For Growing Marijuana In Maharashtra, Says He Was Unaware It Was Illegal

An 81-year-old man has been arrested for allegedly cultivating cannabis on a huge tract of land in Palghar district, Maharashtra on Monday. Is that even legal? NO!

The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation said that the accused, Indradev Bajgovind, had been using cannabis (marijuana), for personal consumption, as per the report in Times Of India.

The police acted on a tip-off and raided the farm in Nevale village, Boisar. The police found nearly 200 plants in the field and seized 905 gm marijuana. "The owner of the land had commissioned the construction of an ashram there and had given the task of running it to Bajgovind. The construction is underway and the accused began growing marijuana," said an officer.

What is more interesting is that he said that he was unaware that marijuana is illegal in India. The 81-year-old has been booked under sections 20(a),8(a)(b)(k) of the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act and remanded in police custody. The investigation is still on and the police said that they will question the land owner.
