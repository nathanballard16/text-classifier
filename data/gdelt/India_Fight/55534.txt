John Exelby, 78: BBC news editor with a passion for jazz and India

At the time of the Iranian embassy siege in 1980, when six armed men campaigning for Arab sovereignty in southern Iran stormed the building, two members of John Exelby’s BBC news team were inside applying for visas. One was Chris Cramer, who would go on to become managing director of CNN, and the other was Simeon “Sim” Harris, a sound recordist. After two days Cramer was released because of (an exaggerated) sickness and Harris escaped across the parapet of a first-floor balcony in front of the world’s cameras as the SAS abseiled in. As their news editor, Exelby had been required to be at a building next door in case he was needed to negotiate their release.

Exelby had joined the BBC newsroom in 1971
