Gujarat HC quashes death sentence, orders retrial in double murder case

In this case, Manju was defended at her trial in Gandhidham by an advocate provided by the Legal Service Authority. The HC said the legal aid being provided “is just for name’s sake”. The legal aid is nothing but a farce. The HC termed this a “farce” and called for senior and experienced lawyers to be engaged. It is very unfortunate to note that in the case at hand, there was practically no cross-examination.
