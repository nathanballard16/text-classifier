India Today TV's special investigation team penetrated Pakistan's web of lies over and about the Balakot airstrike and proved there were indeed military casualties and not just destruction of terror infrastructure and militants.

The expose found appreciation from various quarters, including national security experts.

On Tuesday, a Union minister also joined the list.

Piyush Goyal, Union Minister for Railway and Coal, praised the probe and said that was one piece information the government was not privy to.

"The way your Balakot Tapes exposed things was praiseworthy. Everyone saw how India is a new nation and we can give a fitting reply to terror," Goyal said, at Aaj Tak's 'Suraksha Sabha' to a rapturous audience.

In the Balakot Tapes expose, India Today's undercover reporters caught residents of Balakot and police officials in PoK admitting on tape that the Indian strikes caused damage to life and property.

In Balakot, near the Jaish terror camp that the IAF bombed, mosque worker Mohammad Naeem told India Today TV's investigative reporters that several Pakistani soldiers were killed in the Indian air strikes late last month.

"I am speaking from the Nor mosque in Sehri," Naeem said as he confirmed his identity to the India Today TV team over the phone.

"How many people would have died in the Indian strikes?" the reporter probed.
