Amit Shah attacks Congress, blames Nehru for current problem in Jammu and Kashmir

New Delhi, June 28 (IBNS): In his scathing attack on the Congress, Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Friday blamed former Indian PM Jawaharlal Nehru for the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

He even said that the centre did not need to take lessons on democracy from the Congress party.

"Who is responsible for the partition of the nation? Whose fault is it that today one-third of Jammu and Kashmir is not with India? Who called for ceasefire back then? It was Jawaharlal Nehru who did it and gave that portion(PoK) to Pakistan," Shah said in the Parliament.

He went on attacking the Congress and said the party had used the Article 356 as a political tool.

Under the Article, central Rule can be imposed on a state.

In his first major move as the Union Home Minister of the nation, Shah tabled the Jammu and Kashmir Reservation (Amendment) Bill 2019 in the Lok Sabha on Friday.

The Presidential rule was imposed in the state days after the BJP had withdrawn its support from the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) resulting in the fall of the government.

The Election Commission in March stated there would be no simultaneous Lok Sabha and Assembly elections in the state.

However, the panchayat elections were held in the state. Speaking about the local body polls, Shah said: "Local body elections were not held in the state for a long time but our government held the elections."

Stating the law the order in Jammu and Kashmir has improved, Amit Shah on Friday said the Assembly elections in the northern state will be held in the next six months, media reports said.
