Major fire at cable company godown in Ludhiana

LUDHIANA: A major fire broke out at a godown of a private cable company in Gill village here on Friday midnight. The blaze was intense and difficult to douse due to flammable material like plastic remote controls, set top boxes, wires, etc stored inside the godown.The officials said they received information about a fire at 12am and fire tenders were pressed into action. When fire personnel reached the spot, the blaze had already engulfed the godown except the area where call center was operational. The godown was located in an open field making it easier to move the fire tenders. During night they brought water from main fire station, Gill Road fire station and Sherpur Chowk tube well. However, in the morning they took direct supply from a tube well in the fields .Station fire officer SN Sharma said it was a major fire and they were still at the spot trying to control it. He said the godown was constructed in a makeshift manner and due to heat, the sheds fell down. "We are now removing those sheds so that the fire can be completely controlled. Exact cause behind the fire is yet to be known," he added.
