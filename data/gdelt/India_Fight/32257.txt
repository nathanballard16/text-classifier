Congress neta shot in Haryana, cops link it to ‘criminal record’

Haryana Congress functionary Vikas Chaudhary was shot dead on Thursday morning by unknown assailants, barely 300 metres from his home on Thursday morning.The 41-year-old Chaudhary, who was a party spokesperson and a close aide of state chief Ashok Tanwar , was parking his Fortuner outside a gym in Sector 9 when a couple of gun-wielding men, who seem to have been trailing him in a car, pumped about 12-15 bullets at the vehicle, killing him on the spot. The crime was captured on the CCTV camera which was installed outside the gym.ACP Jaiveer Singh Rathi said 12 spent cartridges were recovered from the crime scene. He added that the attack appeared to be planned. A murder case has been registered and police are scanning the CCTV footage to identify the accused.The phone records of several people are also being looked at. No one has been arrested so far. Additional DGP (law and order) Navdeep Singh Virk said the killing appears to be connected with Chaudhary’s own criminal background.“Chaudhary had a criminal background and 13 FIRs of extortion, kidnapping, attempt to murder were registered against him since 2007 in Haryana and Uttar Pradesh . His murder appears to be connected to his own criminal background,” he tweeted. Virk said seven police teams have been deployed and they are confident of solving the case soon.
