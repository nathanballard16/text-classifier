MP: Cops unearth 'disproportionate assets' of civic employee

The Lokayukta police on Tuesday raided the home of a class four employee of Indore Municipal Corporation (IMC) and unearthed assets disproportionate to his known sources of income.

Acting on a tip-off, the police raided the home of Riazul Haq Ansari (35), who is employed as 'beldar' (doing odd jobs and distributing bills) with the IMC, an official said.

The police seized Rs 50,000 in cash, gold and silver jewellery, apart from a few movable and immovable properties, Lokayukta's deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Praveen Singh Baghel said.

The police also recovered documents for two flats in an apartment complex, a penthouse, a plot of land, a building and a shop, the senior official said, adding that some of these properties have been purchased in the name of his relatives.

An SUV and two motorcycles were also found at his residence, Baghel said.

Ansari has been working at the IMC since 2003 and in 16 years of service, his total income from the salary is around Rs 25 lakh and the value of assets recovered from him is more than his known sources of income, the DSP said.

A detailed valuation of his assets is being carried out and the case is being probed under the anti-corruption laws, he added.
