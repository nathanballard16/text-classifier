Kashmiri businessmen in Goa beach village hold shutdown to protest Pulwama attack

Panaji, Feb 19 : Nearly 250 Kashmiri businessmen, selling handicrafts, gemstones, carpets and other exotic articles in South Goa's Canacona, known for its beautiful beaches, shut down their stores on Tuesday to protest the Pulwama attack which killed 40 CRPF jawans.

Speaking to reporters, spokesperson for the Kashmiri business community, Muzaffar Ahmed condemned the attack in Pulwama and also praised the local community in Canacona, located 70 km south of Panaji, for assuring their safety.

"The loss of the country is bigger than a loss to us as businessmen. We are together with the country and with the kin of the soldiers who died in the attack," said Ahmed, 37, who has been running his handicraft store in Goa for the last 10 years.

He also said that his relatives in Kashmir had called him to exercise caution, in view of the spate of attacks on Kashmiris in other parts of India, but added that locals had assured them of safety.

"People from Canacona have supported us and said that no one will be allowed to attack us... If there is something to learn, learn it from the people of Canacona and Goa, learn from them the importance of unity," Ahmed said.

The Canacona sub district is home to popular beaches like Palolem, Agonda, Patnem, etc, which are regularly frequented by foreign and domestic tourists.
