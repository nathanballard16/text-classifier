Monitoring Desk

MUMBAI: Shah Rukh Khan’s latest release Zero may not have impressed one and all but the film sure offered some powerful performances from its lead stars. Truly unmoved by film’s failure, King Khan is now all set to begin shooting for the Rakesh Sharma biopic – Salute. The biopic based on the life of astronaut Rakesh Sharma earlier had to go on floors in May this year. However, makers of have now decided to start rolling February onwards.

Produced by Siddharth Roy Kapur, film’s first schedule is expected to begin in Mumbai’s Film City. We hear that the construction work for film’s huge set has already started there. If a report in a daily is to be believed, SRK decided to prepone film’s shoot schedule to shift his focus from Zero debacle. The decision taken by the actor and producer aims to wrap up the film’s main schedule before summers. Considering the crucial scenes will be filmed outdoors in bulky costumes, it will be better for them to shoot it before.

We hear that Shah Rukh Khan will soon start prepping up for his role in the film. Film’s next schedule is planned to be wrapped up at an undisclosed location by June this year. Starring SRK in the lead, Salute will be helmed by Mahesh Mathai.
