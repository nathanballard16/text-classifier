Mumbai: Two people, including a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawan, were killed after a SUV of former Union minister Hansraj Ahir’s security convoy was hit by a truck in Wardha district Thursday. According to the police, the truck driver lost control of the vehicle while trying to save a stray monkey near Jamb junction on the Chandrapur-Wardha highway.

“Two people died in the mishap; one of them was a CRPF jawan, while five other CRPF jawans sustained injuries,” said a police official.

Mr Ahir was headed towards Nagpur along with his security convoy in four vehicles when the accident took place at Jamb village on the Chandrapur-Wardha highway. The truck driver took a sharp turn to save a monkey crossing the road, only to hit the SUV of Mr Ahir’s security convoy.

Mr Ahir escaped unhurt as he was not inside the SUV that was hit by the truck. CRPF jawan Phalji Patel and the SUV driver Vinod Zade suffered serious injuries in the accident. “They were rushed to a hospital where they died while undergoing treatment,” Ahir's personal assistant Ravi Chawre said.

The five other injured CRPF jawans were admitted to the Orange City Hospital in Nagpur, Mr Chawre added.
