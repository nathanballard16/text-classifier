Delhi BJP will continue to fight for justice in this case and for punishment to the persons who murdered him [victim],” Mr. Tiwari said.

Compensation

“The family members should be adequately compensated. The members of society should not remain mute spectators in such incidents. Everybody has a right to protect his family and the victim was also performing his duty by resisting the criminals but he was murdered. This cruel murder is not a matter of politics rather an opportunity to unite to ensure justice to the members of victim family,” he said further.

Attacks CM
