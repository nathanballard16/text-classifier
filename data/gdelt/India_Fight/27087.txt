New Delhi, May 24 : The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Friday successfully flight tested a 500 kg class Inertial Guided Bomb from the IAF's frontline Su-30 MKI fighter at the Pokhran test range in Rajasthan.

According to a Defence Ministry statement, the guided bomb achieved the desired range and hit the target with high precision.

All the mission objectives have been met and the weapon system is capable of carrying different warheads, the statement added.
