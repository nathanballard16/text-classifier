Bukhari murder: Cops mull over Interpol red corner against ‘wanted conspirator’

SRINAGAR: J&K police are mulling over approaching the CBI for issuance of an Interpol red corner notice against Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) operative Sheikh Sajjad Gul for allegedly hatching the conspiracy to kill Kashmiri journalist Shujaat Bukhari last year. CBI is the nodal agency for the Interpol in India and a request for a worldwide alert has to be routed through it.Bukhari, 50, was killed by a three-member LeT team on June 14 last year outside his office at Press Colony here.Gul, a resident of HMT Colony on the outskirts of Srinagar , had escaped to Pakistan in 2017 after fraudulently getting Indian passports for himself and his family. Now he is settled in Rawalpindi , according to IGP Kashmir SP Pani.From Pakistan, Gul had started an online campaign against the journalist and was believed to have instructed the three Lashkar terrorists — Naveed Jhatt, Muzaffar Ahmad and Azad Malik — to carry out Bukhari’s killing, police had said last year.While the three terrorists were killed in various encounters, Gul was declared “wanted conspirator” in the murder of Bukhari.“Our investigation has established that there was a campaign against Bukhari on certain social media platforms like ‘Kashmirfight.wordpress.com’, Facebook account ‘Kadwa such Kashmir’ and Twitter handle ahmadkhalid@313. With the cooperation of service providers, tangible evidence has been collected to establish that individuals behind it belong to the Lashkar-e-Taiba and all the content on social media has been posted from Pakistan,” IGP Pani had said on June 28 last year.Gul was earlier arrested by the Delhi Police in 2003 and had served sentences also. Later, he resumed his education and completed his MBA from Jaipur before returning to Srinagar. He was arrested in 2016 in another case and was subsequently released on bail.Last year, J&K Police had sent a request to the US under the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) for the preservation of data of Bukhari’s Facebook and Twitter accounts. Both the US and India have been signatories to MLAT since 2005. The treaty enables the two countries to pursue their common objective of law enforcement.
