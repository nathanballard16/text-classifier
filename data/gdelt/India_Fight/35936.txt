Aishwarya Rai Bachchan Joins Madame Tussauds Family In Sydney

"The Lights, Camera, Bollywood experience opened in April and is one of the most energetic and loved experiences by our guests. It truly depicts the vibrant life backstage on a Bollywood movie production set and we love seeing the fun that our visitors have when they learn how to master a Bollywood dance routine or star in an iconic film scene, including DDLJ! With the new addition of Aishwarya Rai featuring alongside Shah Rukh Khan, we're confident there will be a lot more selfies snapped in the Bollywood zone," said Connolly.

Bollywood diva and former Miss World Aishwarya Rai will now have the "Lights, Camera, Bollywood" experience at Madame Tussauds in Sydney as she joined the family on Wednesday. "We're excited to announce that Aishwarya Rai has joined the Madame Tussauds family and will be here for a limited time only.
