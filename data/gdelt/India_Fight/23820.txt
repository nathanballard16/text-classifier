Two killed as cyclone lashes eastern India

PURI (India) • At least two people were killed yesterday as eastern India was slammed by the strongest cyclone in five years, with strong winds bringing down trees and power lines and causing "extensive" damage in the tourist town of Puri in the state of Odisha.

Moves by the authorities to evacuate around a million people in the projected path of the cyclone appear to have minimised the human toll of Cyclone Fani. Cyclone tracker Tropical Storm Risk put Fani as a powerful Category Four storm on a scale of one to five.

The cyclone spent days building up power in the northern reaches of the Bay of Bengal before it struck the coast of the state of Odisha at around 8am yesterday, the state-run India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.

"The eye of the cyclone has moved over the land," said Dr K.J. Ramesh, director-general of the IMD.

The storm was expected to weaken as it progressed towards West Bengal, a state adjoining Odisha. Odisha and West Bengal, which are expected to bear the brunt of the storm, were forecast to get heavy showers yesterday and today, according to the weather office.

"I can confirm two deaths for now. One old man in one of the shelters died because of (a) heart attack. Another person went out in the storm despite our warnings and died because a tree fell on him," Odisha state special relief commissioner Bishnupada Sethi said.

Howling winds gusting at up to 200kmh whipsawed trees, uprooting scores, and driving rain impacted visibility, while streets were deserted in the state capital Bhubaneswar and Puri.

One witness in Puri reported seeing a small car being pushed along a road by the winds before being turned over.

"It just went dark and then suddenly we could barely see 5m in front of us," the man told Agence France-Presse from a hotel where he had taken shelter.
