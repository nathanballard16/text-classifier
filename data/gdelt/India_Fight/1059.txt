New Delhi: Police in the national capital have registered a case of attempt to murder against unknown persons who attacked a man in Shahadara on Sunday evening. Going by reports, the man was attacked after he objected to the miscreants misbehaving with his sister.

An official familiar with the case told Indian Express that the incident took place on Sunday evening when the man had gone to New Seemapuri to visit a friend. His sister arrived at the spot to call him home for some urgent work which is when a group of four boys passed lewd comments at her. Angered, the man objected to their behaviour. However, they responded by stabbing him.

Even as the victim's sister raised an alarm, the miscreants managed to flee the spot. A passerby rushed the man to a nearby hospital where he is currently being treated for stab wounds incurred during the attack, police said adding that an FIR in this regard has been filed at the Seemapuri police station. Based on a complaint by the man, police have launched a search to track and nab the four boys who attacked the victim.

A similar incident had come to light from Muzaffarpur in Uttar Pradesh in June of last year when a man was shot dead by a group of miscreants after he allegedly objected to them eve-teasing his daughter. The 65-year-old man succumbed to his injuries soon after he was rushed to a nearby hospital. Police had registered a case against the two youngsters who shot the man.
