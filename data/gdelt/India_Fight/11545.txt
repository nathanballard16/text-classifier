After facing massive backlash, Pakistan government deletes propaganda video on Wg Cdr Abhinandan

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman

New Delhi: Shortly after releasing a propaganda video featuring IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman with multiple cuts, Pakistan took down the video from its official Twitter handle. The video was criticized for being in bad taste and was later removed from Pakistan government’s official Twitter handle after officials realized that it was in violation of the Geneva Convention.

In the video, Abhinandan talks about his entry into the Pakistani airspace in search of a target after which he is shot down. He also speaks at length about his overall experience while being in Pakistani custody.

The pilot was made to speak about the circumstances in which he was captured and the treatment he received. There are multiple cuts in the video suggesting that it was tampered with to suit Pakistan’s nefarious agenda.

Meanwhile, the IAF said that this video was done when the officer was in captivity and under duress and added that further clarifications will be made after speaking with the officer.

Wing Commander Abhinandan was handed over to Indian authorities today and crossed the Wagah Border over into India. Yesterday, Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced his release as a gesture of peace while briefing the joint session of the parliament.

Pakistan, in the first official statement after Abhinandan’s release, said that while in captivity, the captured pilot was treated with dignity and in line with international law.

"Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan announced his return as a goodwill gesture aimed at de-escalating rising tensions with India," it concluded.
