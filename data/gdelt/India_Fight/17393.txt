The How It Happened author also publicized the news on her social media expressing her gratitude saying: “So Firefly has won the Peek a Book Children Festival’s prize. The jurors are 13, 14 and 15 years old and that just makes my day. Very thrilled that children and pre-adults are liking Sharmeen and Jugnu and the stories of the Jinn.”

She went on sharing the comments that the judges had made regarding her work: “‘This book was really fascinating because it involved so many myths and so much magic in it . Was a really satisfying read.’ Fatema Tambawalla.”

I loved the premise and the narrative. The story was scary, full of suspense and very well told. I loved the characters, especially the girl and Jugnu. It was a book that showed adults as flawed and capable of cruelty and bad choices, something not seen often in children’s books,” she went on share the comment of another judge aged 15 named Ashwini Karthik.

The third and last judge, aged 13 expressed her delight after reading the book as well, saying: “Clearly the winner! Even though I got a bit creeped out reading it in bed at night I couldn't put it down. Samina Bandukwala, 13 years.”
