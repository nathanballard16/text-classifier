Thursday saw Delhi and adjoining areas of Noida, Gurugram, Ghaziabad and Faridabad recording an intense spell of widespread rain and thundershowers, paving way for extremely pleasant weather conditions. Friday too remained on the similar note, with mercury settling well below the normal.

Normally also, weather in Delhi during September had remained quite comfortable, contrary to the warm and humid weather in usual. October has also followed the similar pattern. This can be attributed to the extended Monsoon rains over the region. The withdrawal process of Southwest Monsoon has not yet started, which usually begin by the second or third week of September. Due to this, weather conditions have been conducive for the rain activities. However, we now expect the weather situation to now change.

According to weathermen, rain in Delhi-NCR would now reduce significantly. But isolated rainfall on account of local development due to availability of moisture in the atmosphere cannot be ruled out.

The cyclonic circulation over Haryana, which had been responsible for drenching the city day before yesterday is now becoming less marked. Thus, chances of rains during the next 24 hours are quite less. Marginal increase in day temperatures would also be seen.

By October 7, weather would clear up completely over Delhi and adjoining areas. Sky would become clear, with bright sunshine returning over the national capital. With this, day temperatures that have been so far under check are expected to rise further, leading to very warm ad humid afternoons. However, night temperatures would see slight decrease.
