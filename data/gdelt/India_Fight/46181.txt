Indian premier Narendra Modi’s government says the scrapping of Jammu and Kashmir state’s special status was necessary to integrate it fully into the rest of India and spur development.

Critics say the decision to revoke autonomy will fuel further alienation and armed resistance.

Kashmir is divided between India and Pakistan, who both claim the territory in full. More than 40,000 people have been killed in an insurgency in the Indian part of Kashmir since 1989.
