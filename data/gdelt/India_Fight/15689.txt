As per recent reports, Sanjay Dutt not only had to work hard for this role, he even had to carry off a body armour weighing a whopping 35 KG.

Yes, as per DNA, “While shooting in Jaipur, Sanju would exercise in the gym before wearing the armour so that he could perform effectively. Earlier last year, when he went for the make-up and costume trials, the armour was specially designed to suit his personality.” Sanjay also has been beefing up his body to shoot for this epic by Ashutosh Gowariker.
