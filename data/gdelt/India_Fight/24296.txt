Deepika Padukone, not Jacqueline Fernandez to be part of Salman Khan's ‘Kick’ sequel?

The reports of makers of Salman Khan starrer ‘Kick’ coming up with the second instalment of the film has been doing the rounds for quite some time now. However, if the latest reports are anything to go by then Deepika Padukone might replace Jacqueline Fernandez in ‘Kick 2’. According to a report in Bollywood Hungama, Deepika was the original choice for ‘Kick’. However, things didn’t work out then and Jacqueline was brought in. Now, the makers are considering approaching the ‘Padmaavat’ actress yet again for the second instalment. The report also elaborated about Deepika’s possible role in the film. It reportedly stated that as she cannot just play a typical Salman Khan’s heroine in the film, her role has to be powerful as the male lead. And hence Sajid Nadiadwala is working on it, injecting heft into the female lead. Meanwhile, while Salman is all set with his upcoming film, ‘Bharat’, Deepika is busy shooting for Meghna Gulzar’s ‘Chhapaak’.
