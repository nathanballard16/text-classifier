Constable found dead in hotel room

A police constable was found dead in a hotel room at Medipally here on Monday afternoon.

The victim C. Srinivasulu (45), attached to City Security Wing of Hyderabad Commissionerate, committed suicide by consuming pesticide due to severe financial problems, Medipally Inspector B. Anji Reddy said.

“We suspect he resorted to the extreme step after he received bank notices for not repaying a loan amount,” the officer said. The incident came to light around 4 p.m. when the housekeeping staff of the hotel opened the room with a duplicate key, as there was no response from Srinivasulu even after repeated knocks. He was lying unconscious, frothing at the mouth.
