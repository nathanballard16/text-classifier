West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee called off her 'Save Constitution' dharna after the Supreme Court order in connection of CBI raid against Kolkata's top cop Rajeev Kumar. The apex court directed CBI not to take any coercive action including arrest against Kumar. The court also ordered Kumar to co-operate with the central agency and to appear before it in Shillong. Mamata termed the SC's directive as a "moral victory" for her. She accused CBI of harrasing state officials on the behest of central government. The unprecented drama unfolded in Kolkata when some CBI officials, who had reached Rajeev Kumar's residence to question him in a probe into the ponzi scheme scam, were bundled into police jeeps and taken to a nearby police station. Although, they were let go after a brief detention. Mamata Banerjee also reached at Kumar's residence in his support. She began a sit-in protest at Metro Channel in Kolkata with her cabinet ministers and supporters. She was also joined by Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and RJD leader Tejaswi Yadav. CBI approached the SC against Kolkata's police action and accused the state government of disrupting the agency's functioning. (BCCL)
