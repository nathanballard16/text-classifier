Mumbai attack ‘leader’ is arrested in Pakistan

Islamabad Pakistan has arrested a radical cleric who is wanted by the United States over the attacks in Mumbai in 2008 in which 166 people were killed. Hafiz Saeed, 69, founded the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, which was banned in 2002 and blamed for the attacks on hotels, a Jewish centre and a railway station in Mumbai. He was detained in Punjab province days before Imran Khan, the prime minister of Pakistan, was due to make his first official visit to Washington. The US had offered a $10 million reward for Saeed’s arrest. President Trump tweeted: “Great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him!” (AP)
