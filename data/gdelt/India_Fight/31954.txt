Jharkhand gets central award for clean and decorated toilets

RANCHI: Jharkhand secured the first position in the first Swachh Sundar Shauchalaya Awards announced by the Union Jal Shakti ministry. Five districts of the state also featured in the top 10 list, with Giridih bagging the top spot among the districts nationally.The awards were announced on Monday.Talking to TOI on Tuesday, Aradhana Patnaik, secretary, department of drinking water and sanitation, said: "Apart from the first rank in the state and district categories, Jharkhand also got many more awards. We had hit upon the idea of toilet beautification through paintings a year ago, after seeing the common people in tribal strongholds decorating toilets with wall paintings, Sohrai murals and so on. This idea gave us an edge over the others."This was the first time that such an award was constituted by the Union ministry. The entries for the same were invited between January 1 and 31, and over 1.34 crore entries were received.While East Singhbhum secured the fourth position in the special mention category, the other three districts to feature in the top ten list are Seraikela-Kharsawan at the sixth spot, Koderma at the seventh spot and Lohardaga at the ninth position."Under the initiative, we covered around 70% of the toilets built under SBM Gramin through wall paintings. Since we already started the beautification process before the award was constituted, Jharkhand was a step ahead of others," Patnaik added.Chief minister Raghubar Das congratulated the districts and the state for bagging a total of seven awards in various categories. "This achievement is dedicated to the people and those working in the drinking water and sanitation department," Das said.
