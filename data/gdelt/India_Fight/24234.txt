Tensions ripple across the Middle East region

The U.S. deployed an aircraft carrier and Air Force bombers to the Persian Gulf in response to what officials described as new threats by Iran against American troops in Iraq.

The move was intended “to send a clear and unmistakable message to the Iranian regime that any attack on United States interests or on those of our allies will be met with unrelenting force,” said the national security adviser, John Bolton.

The news came as Iran’s state media reported that Iran would be informing the other signatories of its nuclear deal that it would reduce compliance with the 2015 accord over sanctions imposed a year ago, when President Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the deal.

Gaza: Israel and Palestinian militants agreed to a new, fragile cease-fire. At least 22 Palestinians, including children and militants, and four Israeli civilians died in the fighting over the weekend.
