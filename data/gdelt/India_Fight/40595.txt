Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor open up on his cancer battle; actress says he became like my child

Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor have been each other's support system for many decades now. But veteran actor Rishi Kapoor's ill health brought the family even closer as they jet set to New York for his treatment when he was diagnosed with cancer last year. Since then, scores of Bollywood celebrities and people from the film industry have visited Rishi and Neetu. A testament to this is Neetu's Instagram profile which showcases the positive attitude of the Kapoor's to fight cancer back.

In a latest interview with Times Now, which is yet to be aired, Rishi and Neetu opened up about their initial struggle and how they fought it through. When Neetu was quizzed about how her husband's cancer treatment has so far been, Rishi said, "She has been a rock of Gibraltar, really really supported me without her I wouldn't be getting anywhere."

Adding to this, Neetu said, "It's like I told you he became like my child and I wanted to do everything in my power that he should not be in pain, he should get whatever he wants." Not just Neetu, but Rishi's immediate family has also stood by him like a rock. Ranbir Kapoor often visits New York as and when he can and so does their daughter Riddhima who lives in Delhi.

Now, Rishi is looking forward to returning home and he hopes he to make it in time for Ganesh Chaturthi, which takes place on September 2 this year. Speaking with Mid-Day, the actor had said, "Celebrating Ganpati is a family tradition. So, I am hoping to be part of it."
