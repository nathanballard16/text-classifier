Drop in youths joining militancy

As per the data with the security agencies, this year till March 25 only three local youths have picked up arms and joined the rank of the militant groups.

New Delhi: There has been significant drop in local youth joining militant organisations in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) in 2019 after seeing a surge in 2018 and 2017.

This even as army has launched an operation against the Jaish-e-Mohammad leadership in Kas-hmir Valley after the Pulwama attack on the CRPF on February 14.

As per the data with the security agencies, this year till March 25 only three local youths have picked up arms and joined the rank of the militant groups.

This is sharp drop from 208 locals joining the militant groups in 2018, which was the highest number of local recruitment in Jammu and Kashmir in recent years. The increase in young Kashmiri boys picking up guns had worried the security establishment.

Adil Ahmad Dar of the Jaish-e-Mohammad who had carried out the suicide attack on CRPF convoy killing 40 soldiers was also a local boy.

In 2017 the number of local recruitment was 128 which then was the highest number after 2010.

If the trend of fewer locals joining militancy continued throughout the year in summers too, it will be a sign of slow return of calm in the trouble torn Valley and peace to its people.

However, the drop in local recruitment in militancy has coincided with strong action by security agencies against militants.

In 2019, security agencies have killed over 60 militants in Jammu and Kashmir out of which 21 are only from Jaish-e-Moham-mad. Out of these 21 Jaish militants, 17 have been killed after Pulwa-ma attack on the CRPF convoy on February 14. In last 3 years, the army eliminated over 600 terrorists operating in the State.
