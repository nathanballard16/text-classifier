JAIPUR: A vehicle seized by the traffic police was stolen from Vishwakarma Industrial Area (VKI) police station on Friday. The truck was parked outside the station due to lack of parking space. Police are yet to find the stolen truck.

According to police, the truck with goods was seized by the traffic police on Friday and parked at the designated space where the seized vehicles are kept. However, the truck was stolen on the same night.

Vishwakarma SHO Mangli Lal Bishnoi told TOI, “Traffic police had seized the vehicle under Section 185 of Motor Vehicles Act (MVA), 2019 for drunk driving. Since we do not have sufficient space in the police station complex, the seized vehicles are parked on Sikar Road. It was stolen from there.” Cops although are yet to find the stolen vehicle but they claim that the owner might be involved in it and Bishnoi added, “The keys were inside the police station but the accused managed to take away the vehicle by using a duplicate key. There is a high possibility that the owner was behind this theft. We will catch him soon.”

Police claimed that they have registered a complaint and are investigating the case. They will also look at CCTV footage to find any leads in the matter. “Since we have owner’s details and registration number, we are confident of recovering the vehicle,” added the official.

A similar incident was reported few months back when a tractor, filled with stones, seized by the Kanota police in June was allegedly stolen on the same night from the police station premises. At that time also lack of space for parking had been cited as the reason for the missing vehicle.
