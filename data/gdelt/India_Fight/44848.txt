Eight dead, 100 hurt in 5.8 magnitude Pakistan quake

Reuters: An earthquake of magnitude 5.8 shook northern Pakistan on Tuesday (September 24), killing eight people and injuring 100, government and police officials said. Several buildings collapsed, while, roads were cracked large enough to swallow cars in Mirpur, a town on Pakistan’s side of the disputed territory of Kashmir near India.

District commissioner Mohammad Tayyab said eight people were killed, including three children. District police chief Irfan Saleem said more than 100 more suffered injuries. The quake struck 14 miles (23 km) north of Jhelum, Pakistan, at a relatively shallow depth of 10 km, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) reported.
