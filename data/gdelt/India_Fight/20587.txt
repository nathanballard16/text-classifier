The violations have resulted in the deaths of ten people, including four security personnel, along with 45 people being injured since India dropped bombs on a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot on February 26. India said this was a response to 40 army personnel being killed by Pakistan in the Pulwama attack on February 14. Over the last couple of months, Pakistan’s army also used mortars and artillery guns more than 100 times during these violations.

Civilian areas have also been targeted, as two girls were injured in the Poonch area on Friday.



But Paramjit Singh, the general officer of the White Knight Corps in the Indian Army, said Pakistan has suffered up to six times more casualties than India in its retaliatory action.



He said: “Almost 513 ceasefire violations happened in the past one-and-a-half month and over 100 times during these violations, the Pakistan Army used heavy weapons like mortars and artillery guns and targeted civilian areas.



“However, as per our sources, the Pakistan Army suffered five to six times more casualties than the casualties on our side.”
