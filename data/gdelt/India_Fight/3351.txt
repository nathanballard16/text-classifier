There were discrepancies in the details he gave them about his location and movements at the time of the boy's abduction. As soon as the girl's brother came out of his house, the duo abducted him and took him to village outskirts, where after gagging him, they killed him. The false leads were later contradicted by the analysis of his mobile phone location.During the sustained grilling, Sarvesh finally broke down and confessed to the boy's abduction followed by his killing.
