Hyderabad: After being repeatedly harassed by her husband, a woman decided to take a drastic step. The woman allegedly killed her 13-month-old daughter and then attempted to end her life. The incident took place at the woman's residence in Jeedimetla. The deceased's husband suspected that she was cheating on him.

The woman allegedly slit her daughter's throat and then did the same to herself. The woman and her husband hail from the Prakasam district of Andhra Pradesh. The couple used to live in a rented accommodation in Shapurnagar. The husband is employed at a fabrication company while the woman is a homemaker. The couple had come to Jeedimetla around two years ago.

The husband alleged that his wife went inside the bathroom and latched the main door of their house from the outside. After noticing this, the husband informed his neighbours. When the neighbours rushed in, they saw that the woman and her daughter were lying injured inside the house.

The two were immediately taken to the Mallareddy Hospital. While the baby was declared brought dead in the hospital, the woman was admitted for treatment. The woman was then taken for surgery.

While talking to the Deccan Chronicle, Jeedimeetla inspector P Ramana Reddy stated that the man used to harass the woman because he suspected her of infidelity. After the harassment continued, the woman allegedly started spending more time with his family. The woman had returned to the city only five days prior to the incident.

In her statement, the woman allegedly stated that she wanted to end her life because of the constant harassment. The police booked the woman on charges on murder and booked the husband for domestic violence. The woman is now recovering from the surgery.
