Tempo driver’s murderer nabbed

Vadodara: Within hours of his murdering a tempo driver, the crime branch arrested main accused Kalu Bharwad late on Wednesday night from Harni area. The two other other accused involved in the crime are still absconding. The cops said that Bharwad has admitted to committing the crime in a fit of rage.

According to the police, the victim, Megha Bharwad, was having an affair with Kalu’s wife for the last few months. After Bharwad came to know about it a month ago, he warned the tempo driver to stay away from his wife. On Wednesday morning, Bharwad caught the duo red-handed. He then called victim Megha to an open plot behind Sagar Studios on Ajwa Road in the afternoon, where he and another person attacked Megha. They first tied him to a cot and then thrashed him with sticks. Megha suffered severe injuries on his head and other parts of the body. Interestingly, one of the accused also called up ambulance and even informed the victim’s relative who had called up on his mobile phone.

The victim was rushed to a private hospital and then admitted to SSG Hospital. “Doctors at SSG declared him brought dead. A complaint of murder was registered at Bapod police station following which we began search for the accused trio. During investigations we learnt about the enmity between the two over the victim’s extra-marital affair,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, DCP (crime).

After getting information that the murderer was in Harni and preparing to leave the city, cops rushed to the spot and arrested Kalu, who works as a security guard in a park on the outskirts of the city. “During interrogation he said he acted in a fit of rage and didn’t want to kill Megha,” Jadeja added.
