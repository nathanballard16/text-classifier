Deepika Padukone obliges fans with photos at Delhi airport

For the last couple of weeks now, Deepika Padukone and Vikrant Massey are shooting for Meghna Gulzar’s Chhapaak in Delhi. Ever since the film went on floors, photos and videos of the actors from various locations across the capital have been flooding the social media space. These peeks have certainly amplified curiosity of movigoers making their wait for the film even harder.

On Thursday afternoon, Deepika was spotted in the capital yet again. However, this time around, she was not in her character. She was at the airport looking stunning in a basic black tee teamed up with high-rise blue denims and black boots. DP, who has a huge fan base in Delhi, made it a point to oblige her fans with photos. As per reports, the actress has wrapped up the first schedule of Chhapaak and was leaving for Mumbai.

Below, see her pictures:

Quite recently, a video of Deepika and Vikrant, wherein the duo can be seen getting off an autorickshaw, went viral online. The actress can be seen wearing a green kurta and red salwar. Watch it here:

In another video, the two actors can be seen shooting in a busy market in North-East Delhi. Here, take a look:

Vikrant, who plays Deepika’s love interest in the film, considers working with the actress a “huge responsibility.” Talking about collaborating with her, he said, “Working with an actress of her caliber is not just an opportunity but also a huge responsibility. I’m both nervous and excited.”

Chhapaak is based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Aggarwal. After a two-month schedule in Delhi and Mumbai, the film is expected to wrap by the end of next month. It is slated to hit the screens on January 10 next year. At the box-office, it will clash with the Ajay Devgn-starrer Tanhaji: The Unsung Warrior.
