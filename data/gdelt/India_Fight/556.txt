One person was killed and several were injured as the protest turned violent in Kerala. Sabarimala Karma Samithi and Antarrashtriya Hindu Parishad called a dawn-to-dusk 'Hartal' to protest the entry of two women of menstruating age into the sanctum sanctorum of the Sabarimala temple. Agitators hurled crude bombs and stones and clashed with police and political rivals that left scores of people injured including three BJP workers in a knife attack. According to reports, over 20 offices of the ruling CPI(M) and its other Left allies were attacked by fringe elements. In Thrissur, three BJP activists were stabbed during a scuffle with workers of the Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI), the political wing of Popular Front of India, police said. The incident occurred when saffron party workers attempted to force a restaurant to put down the shutters. A 55-year-old man, who was seriously injured when CPI (M) workers hurled stones at protesters from atop their party office at Pandalam in Pathanamthitta district, died late Wednesday night. Police have beefed up the security in the state and arrested more than 750 people to maintain law and order. (PTI)
