Students of the Jamia Millia Islamia (JMI) University clashed with Delhi police personnel who lathi-charged students outside Jamia Millia Islamia and also used tear gas in a bid to scatter the agitating students who were marching to Parliament to oppose the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019.

The protesters had called for a march to Parliament House from the university campus to express their opposition to the passage of Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 in the parliament. The march was called by the Left-leaning All India Students Association (AISA). AISA had also staged a protest against the law at Jantar Mantar before it was passed in the Rajya Sabha.

Hundreds of students had gathered outside Jamia Millia Islamia to march to Parliament before they were stopped by police. The students accused the police of using force against them by using canes and tear gas.

The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) had closed entry and exit at Patel Chowk and Janpath metro stations due to students' protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. However, DMRC took to twitter to inform that all the train services have been resumed.

"As advised by Delhi Police, entry & exit at Patel Chowk and Janpath have been closed. Trains will not be halting at these stations," DMRC said on twitter.
