Pakistan receives body of its national stoned to death in Indian jail

By monitoring report

LAHORE/NEW DELHI: The body of a Pakistani national, Shakirullah, who was stoned to death by other inmates in Rajasthan’s Jaipur Central Jail mid last month, has been handed over to Pakistan at the Wagah Border on Saturday.

The murder of the Pakistani national had come after India levelled baseless allegations against Pakistan of being involved in the Pulwama attack in occupied Kashmir. Shakirullah had been in the Indian jail since 2001. Pakistan has lodged protest with India after the inspector general of police (IG) for Rajasthan and in-charge of prisons Kapil Garg confirmed the news of Shakirullah's murder on Feb 20.

"The Indian administration failed to protect Shakirullah," said Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi.

Shakirullah's family will take his body to their native area Daska, Sialkot for burial.

The Pakistani prisoner had been eight years into a life-term when he was attacked at the Jaipur central jail. He was stoned to death following a quarrel, Garg told AFP.

The deceased’s family maintained that the late Shakirullah was not mentally fit and crossed Indian territory by mistake during

his visit to Shakargarh to visit a festival.

The Foreign Office has objected over India’s no response to Pakistan’s request for ‘post-mortem-judicial’ inquiry.

“Failure to protect basic human right to life of Pakistani in its prison raises questions India must answer,” said FO spokesperson Dr Mohammad Faisal.
