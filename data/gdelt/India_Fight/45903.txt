Narendra Modi-Xi Jinping informal summit: No objection to erecting banners, Madras high court says

CHENNAI: In a reprieve to the Tamil Nadu government and the external affairs ministry, the Madras high court on Thursday said it has no objection to erecting digital banners to welcome Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, who would be visiting Mamallapuram for the second edition of the informal summit between India and China.A division bench of Justice M Sathyanarayanan and Justice N Seshasayee made it clear that it is obligatory in the state to follow all the existing rules regarding erection of such banners.The court also said that no political parties would be allowed to erect any such banners.The issue pertains to a joint affidavit filed by the state and ministry of external affairs submitting that Indian head of the government and head of state of a foreign country would be visiting Chennai and would be having bilateral talks at Mamallapuram on October 11 and 12.“Whenever any head of state visits our country as part of bilateral relation and as a goodwill gesture, it is customary on the part of the ministry of external affairs to welcome the visiting dignitary by putting up welcome banners,” they said.In the affidavit, the state submitted that as the visit is in Tamil Nadu, it is courteous on the part of the state government to welcome the head of state.When the plea was taken up for hearing, the bench wondered as to the need for the state to move the court seeking permission when it is the prerogative of the executive to according such permissions.To this, advocate general Vijay Narayan submitted that the state wanted to ensure that nothing was done against the existing rules or the court orders.Opening the same, senior counsel P Wilson for DMK submitted that the court would set a bad precedence if the present plea was accepted. “When there is rule of law, they must abide by it. What is the need to approach the court? There must be some hidden agenda,” he added.Wilson also wanted the court to ensure that no political party is allowed to put up any such banners.Recording the same, the court passed a detailed order and noted that it had no objection for the state to put up such banners.The state moved the high court in the backdrop of the death of 23-year-old techie R Subashree who was killed by a banner illegally erected by a former counsellor of AIADMK despite a blanket ban on placing such banners.
