Here's the motion poster:

Earlier, it was reported that Vikram 58 was titled, Amar. But, the makers surprised the audience with the new title. According to director Ajay Gnanamuthu, the film's title Cobra and Vikram's character has a connection. Elaborating more about the film's title, Ajay, in an interview to Times of India, said, "The protagonist’s character and cobra has a link. If I reveal anything more now, it will give away too many details. Also, since the film is made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi, I wanted a title that works in all languages. Hence, we zeroed in on Cobra.

Currently, the team is shooting in Chennai and the schedule will be wrapped up in a couple of days. The team might travel to Russia and Europe to shoot the rest of the film. If everything goes as per plan, the Cobra team will begin the next schedule in mid-January.

The first-look poster of Cobra will release by the end of January and the film will hit the theatres in summer 2020. Composer AR Rahman, who is scoring the tunes has given three songs as of now.
