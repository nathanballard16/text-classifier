India Should Not 'Test Our Resolve': Pakistan Army to India on Nuclear Threat

The Pakistan Army's spokesperson said that India has been lying about the number of deaths in the Balakot strike on 26 February and the downing of an F-16 jet of the Pakistan Air Force during the first ever air clashes on 27 February.

"Two months have passed since and India has told countless lies on the matter. We have not responded to the lies, not because we can't, but because we don't want to retaliate", the Ghafoor said.

"We have not retaliated because we want peace…we asked you (India) to ask America about our F-16s' strength. In this day and age, hiding the downing of a plane is impossible. In this time, even if a motorcycle crashes the world finds out", the spokesperson added.

The tensions between the two nuclear armed neighbours rose to an unprecedented level following a terrorist attack by the Jaish-e-Muhammed terrorist organisation on an Indian security personnel convoy on 14 February, killing 40 Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir. India launched air strikes on 26 February in Pakistan's Balakot area, targeting terror camps to avenge the attack.
