His mother Ujjwala Tiwari was also admitted to the same hospital when she received a call from their home about her son being "unwell and bleeding from the nose".

She was later quoted as saying that Rohit was "depressed for a long time". " "There are a few people responsible for the same. I will reveal the names of the people who caused him depression," she said.

ND Tiwari had died at the age of 93 on 18 October 2018, his birthday. Rohit, 40, had joined the BJP ahead of the 2017 Uttarakhand Assembly polls.

He first came into the limelight for fighting a long-drawn paternity battle with his father who had refused to accept him as his biological son. The Congress veteran had later went on to accept him as his son.
