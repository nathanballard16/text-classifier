New Delhi: Chandu Chavan, the jawan who crossed into Pakistan in 2016 mistakenly, has written to President Ram Nath Kovind, seeking permission for euthanasia.

In his letter, the soldier who had erroneously crossed the border said that he cannot take the torture of his officers and therefore want to end his life.

Narrating his ordeal in the letter, Chavan alleged that he was being subjected to torture and harassment ever since he came back from Pakistan.

“I was humiliated, looked at with suspicion and even punished on false charges by my senior officers....I am deeply depressed because of these problems. I request you to kindly give permission of mercy killing/euthanasia as early as possible as I don’t want to tolerate this torture anymore,” he said in his letter.

The jawan had in October quit the Army saying due to, what he termed, “incessant harassment" in the force. Chavan, posted as a jawan in the armoured Corps Centre in Ahmednagar, had sent his resignation letter to his unit commander. The Army, however, strongly rejected his charge, saying he was declared “absent without leave” with effect from October 3.

"Since I came back from Pakistan, I have been continuously harassed in the Army and am being looked at with suspicion, that is why I decided to quit," Chavan had said.

Refuting the charges, the Army, in a statement, said that the unit has also not received any request for premature discharge. It further said that Chavan was absconding from his unit following the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against him after he was found in an inebriated state in the unit lines

Chavan, who had crossed to Pakistan inadvertently right after the 2016 surgical strikes, was captured by Pakistan Rangers and was beaten, tortured and almost killed for four months, before being handed over to India.
