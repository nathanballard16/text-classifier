Chennai civic body officials seize 2.15 tonnes of plastic products

CHENNAI: In a crackdown on banned plastic in the city, officials of Chennai Municipal Corporation seized 2.15 tonnes of plastic goods worth Rs 15 lakh being transported to Parry’s from Puducherry The raid was carried by officials of Royapuram zone sans police protection and based on a tip-off, in which officials seized 143 boxes, each containing 10,000 units of banned plastic products like cups and plates and fined the transporter Rs 25,000.“We received prior information about banned goods being transported to the city from Puducherry and raided the transport office this morning as the goods were being unloaded. This is the first time in the state that the transporter has been booked for offence,” said an official who was part of the team that raided SK Transports office on Muthunaicken Street in Mannady.A team of officials including the assistant health officer, sanitary officer, sanitary inspector, and workers carried out the raid, and a fine of Rs25,000 was levied from the owner of SK Transports for the first-time offence of transporting banned plastic items.While Tamil Nadu has the ban put in place since January this year, Puducherry government, which was about to ban single-use plastic from March 2019, deferred it and plastic products are still being manufactured, sold and used. There are over 300 plastic product manufacturing units in Puducherry, which is less than 150km from Chennai.Besides, banned plastic carry bags and pouches were seized from small vendors in George Town area.Traders said a proper ban should be implemented across the country. “As there is a ban in Tamil Nadu, all such products are being transported from neighbouring regions like Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Puducherry. Manufactures and suppliers are changing their modus-operandi to deliver plastic goods by creating fake bills in the name of traders in neighbouring states, where plastic is not banned, to outsmart officials raiding the transport vehicles. Besides, the sale of paper and cloth alternatives is not picking up as there is still demand for plastic,” said G Sankaran of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry Plastic Association.
