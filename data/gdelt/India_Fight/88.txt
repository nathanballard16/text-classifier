What does Modi mean when he says Congress-mukt? He explains

When he uses the expression "Congress-mukt", Prime Minister Narendra Modi says, he means he wants to rid India of a culture and a way of thinking.

Even people in the Congress say the Congress is a culture -- or a thought -- the prime minister told ANI editor Smita Prakash on Tuesday.

The Congress too, Modi said, needs to be "mukt" -- or free -- of this Congress culture.

A quick look at India's political map shows that the Congress isn't going anywhere.

In fact, after strong performances in three state elections in the Hindi belt, Team Rahul Gandhi is back with a bang. Where there was only saffron, saffron and saffron on the map, there's now a hearty splash of Congress blue.

What does Prime Minister Narendra Modi have to say about the reverses suffered by the BJP in the recent round of assembly elections?

The prime minister acknowledged the mandate in favour of the Congress in Chhattisgarh, but pointed to hung assemblies in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan -- as well as the fact that the BJP battled strong anti-incumbency in MP and Chhattisgarh.

Modi covered a wide range of topics in his interview with ANI, including the 2016 surgical strikes, the Ram temple issue, the resignation of Urjit Patel, and much more. Click here to go to our live blog.
