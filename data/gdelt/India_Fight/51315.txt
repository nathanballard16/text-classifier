Daman health authorities raid 3 ‘quack-run’ clinics

Surat: The health authorities of union territory of Daman raided three clinics in Moti and Nani Daman that were run by quack doctors and also seized medicines and other materials on Tuesday.

Official sources said that the surprise check was a joint operation by the health department officials along with Daman police under the Clinical Establishment Act, 2010. The checking was conducted following complaints received by the department against the quacks who had set up shops to loot people in Daman.

Officials stated that the doctors were found practising without renewing their licences under the rules of the central health department. However, medicines, intravenous fluids and other materials were seized from their clinics and investigations were on to verify the accused persons’ papers.

Director of Daman health department, Dr VK Das said, “The surprise check was conducted following rampant complaints against these quack doctors operating in Daman. We have collected all the details about practising doctors in Daman before raiding the clinics.”

Dr Das further said that they are now examining the papers of these doctors. “If we find evidences against them to prove they were impersonating as doctors without qualification, we will arrest them,” he added.

He, however, refused to reveal the names, saying that the matter is under investigation which prevents disclosing of credentials.
