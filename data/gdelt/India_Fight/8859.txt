JKLF Chairman Yasin Malik, over 100 others detained in occupied Kashmir

SRINAGAR: Indian authorities on Saturday arrested Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Chairman Yasin Malik and over 100 others in overnight raids in Srinagar.



According to Kashmir Media Service, the Indian occupying forces took Malik into custody after raiding his Maisuma residence in Srinagar and lodged him at Kothibagh police station.

The overnight arrests included those of many senior members of Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). Those arrested include JI Ameer, Dr Abdul Hamid Fayaz, Advocate Zahid Ali, Ghulam Qadir Lone, Abdur Rauf, Mudassir Ahmed, Abdul Salam, Bakhtawar Ahmed, Muhammad Hayat, Bilal Ahmed and Ghulam Muhammad Dar.

A senior police official in Srinagar told Reuters that the arrests are part of a crackdown ahead of Indian elections set to be held by May. “The arrival of more troops and the arrests of leaders and activists of separatist groups is part of an election exercise undertaken to ensure free and fair elections,” said the senior police official.

“Anti-election campaigns will not be allowed and separatists will be detained to ensure free, fair and transparent elections in the state,” the police official said.



India Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party is set to seek re-election in nationwide polls that are due to be held by May.

The situation in occupied Kashmir has worsened in the aftermath of the February 14, Pulwama attack which killed at least 40 Indian soldiers.
