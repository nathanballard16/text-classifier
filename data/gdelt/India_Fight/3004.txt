Vishakhapatnam: In a shocking turn of events coming to light from Andhra Pradesh, a woman has been arrested for allegedly strangling her minor daughter to death. Identified as B Usha, aged 32, the accused initially claimed the insanity defense after eyewitness accounts placed her at the scene of the crime at the time of the girl's murder.

The incident took place on January 22 at the residence of Vishakhapatnam residence of B Usha where she lives with her husband Appa Rao, her son and two daughters. On Tuesday, Usha's seven-year-old daughter Bandi Ramya was found dead at the family home. Officials with the Rambili police station were alerted and rushed to the spot.

A preliminary investigation led police to suspect Usha's version of the story. It was her five-year-old son, the only eyewitness to the crime, who told investigators what had actually transpired that day. Our father was not at home and I saw mother strangling Ramya to death on Monday morning, said the boy.

Based on his statement, police officials registered a case of murder against Usha and took her into police custody. V Chakradhara Rao, sub-inspector with the Rambilli police station told Times of India that the accused hated her daughters and loved her son since she thought the girls were 'mischevious and naughty'. He also said that the mother has been arrested under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) which corresponds to charges of murder. She will be produced before a court and will not be granted any medical attention at a mental asylum since she is not suffering from any mental illness, added the officer.
