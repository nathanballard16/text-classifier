Srinagar: Security has been stepped up around the Indian Air Force bases in Srinagar and Awantipora area after Intel agencies warned of the possibility of a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir.

Last month, reports had stated that the JeM is planning to attack the security forces again in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district. Intel agencies had warned that the attack might be carried out in the Lethipora region of the district.

There have been multiple reports of possible terror attacks in the valley following the Balakot air strikes carried out by the Indian Air Force targetting Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training camps in Pakistan.

The fresh warning echos the last one in terms of the possible modus operandi to be used by the terrorist to target the security personnel in the valley. As per the report, the terrorist will not use vehicle - as done during the February 14 Pulwama attack - but will target security establishments, camps, and buildings using Improvised Explosive Device (IED).

On February 14, JeM operative Adil Ahmed Dar had rammed his IED-laden vehicle into a moving CRPF convoy resulting in the death of at least 40 personnel. In response, India on February 26 carried out air strikes across the Line of Control (LoC) targeting the terror outfits training camps in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).

The next day, Pakistan made an unsuccessful attempt to intrude the Indian airspace and lost one F-16 during the dogfight. One of India's MiG 21 Bison piloted by Wing Commander Abhinandan had also crash-landed in PoK. Abhinandan was handed over within three days to the Indian authorities via Wagah border.
