The Chennai police arrested a 23-year-old man for murdering a minor, who had allegedly exposed the man’s plan to murder someone.

According to reports, Prabhu Deva (24) and Suryah (16) were friends and they both lived in Kuruvanmedu village. The boy was working as an earthmover cleaner under Jayachandran. A few days ago, Prabhu Deva and his friends had attacked a truck driver and based on the driver’s complaint, the police had registered an FIR against them. However, Prabhu Deva was made to believe that the police had registered a case only after Jayachandran insisted.

Therefore Prabhu Deva decided to kill Jayachandran and took Ajith Kumar as his accomplice. They then told Suryah about the plan and told him to quit his job. However, Suryah did not quit and instead tipped Jayachandran off about the impending plan.

Angered over this, the duo planned to eliminate Suryah. On August 15, the boy did not go to work and went to attend a temple festival. However, as Suryah did not return home that night, his relatives and neighbours started enquiring about his whereabouts. Suryah’s friends, who had accompanied him to the festival, allegedly told the search group that he had left the temple early in the night. His relatives continued their search and found Suryah dead, with stab marks on his body, on the banks of the Palar river. Suryah’s relatives took the body home and intimated the police. Police arrived at the house and sent the body for autopsy and registered an FIR in the case.

Police arrested Prabhu Deva on Saturday in connection with the crime and questioned him. Based on his statement, the police nabbed Ajith Kumar on Monday and remanded both the men to judicial custody.
