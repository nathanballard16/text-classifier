Seven persons including three policemen were arrested on Friday for trespassing and allegedly digging up a private land in search of treasure at Velpupally village in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri district. The accused, who include a former deputy sarpanch now associated with the ruling TRS party, were caught while digging up a private land belonging to a doctor using earth mover on Wednesday.

It is rumoured that the village had treasures hidden during the Nizam-era. According to the New Indian Express, Dyanaboina Achaiah, the former deputy sarpanch of the village, had hatched the plan to dig up the land for the treasure hunt. He disclosed the plan to A Srinivas Reddy, who was working as the head constable of Choutuppal Police Station. Srinivas then contacted his former colleagues A Ramakrishna, a home guard at Bhongir fire station; V Prabhaker, a constable at Motakondur Police Station; and others.

As per the plan, the 10-member gang including two priests began digging up the land on September 13, and continued digging up the land every night for almost a week.

However, their plan was foiled after a shepherd noticed their suspicious activity at night, which he shared with other villagers. Soon, the land owner Yadagiri Muralidhar Rao, got to know about this and filed a complaint with the Turkapally police. Muralidhar Rao complained that his compound wall and wires were damaged.

Following the complaint, police arrived at the spot, however, three persons fled from the scene.

The accused officials have been suspended. The accused were charged under 447 (criminal trespass) and 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), along with other sections under Treasure Trove Act, The Times of India reported.
