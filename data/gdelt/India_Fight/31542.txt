Indian security forces have launched a fresh search operation to trace and eliminate terrorists reportedly hiding in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir.

According to sources, security forces started the operation early on Monday at a village located in Pulwama.

Sources told India Today TV that the search operation has been conducted after specific inputs about the presence of terrorists in the Pulwama village.

A joint team of security forces comprising 55 Rashtriya Rifles, CRPF and SOG launched a search operation in the area.

Local sources said all entry and exit points have been sealed and door-to-door search operations are being conducted.

On Sunday, security forces had gunned down four terrorists from the Ansar Gazwatul Hind group (AGH) in Daramdor village of Shopian in south Kashmir.

A fierce gun battle broke out between the terrorists and team of security forces after a team cordoned off the apple orchards in the village, where the terrorists were hiding.

An officer said that the slain terrorists were identified as Showkat Ahmad, Azad Ahmad, Suhail Yousuf and Hassan Mir.

A statement released later by authorities said Showkat had a long history of terror-related crimes since 2015. He was initially part of terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen and switched to the AGH just one month back.
