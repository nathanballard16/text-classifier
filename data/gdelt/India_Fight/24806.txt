Style, Toward Clarity and Grace

As “Politics and the English Language” suggests, Orwell never saw himself as just a novelist or just a reporter: he was always thinking and writing as both. In “Politics and the English Language,” Orwell argues that the style in which people communicate determines the degree to which their governments can successfully pass off lies as truths. As a reporter, Orwell demonstrated a distinct skill for teasing out the truth within political messaging, as seen inand. As a novelist, Orwell convincingly created dystopic political worlds by replicating the linguistic techniques of propagandistic communication, as he did inand. As an essayist, notably for “Politics and the English Language” and “The Prevention of Literature,” he explored the intersection of political and literary cultures. In “Politics and the English Language,” Orwell considers how, in light of World War II, wordy, vague prose contributes to a political culture of manipulation and violence. Edith Wharton argued a similar point after World War I in the 1923. Similarly, with its attention on concision in prose, “Politics and the English Language” sits within a lineage of writing guides aimed towards improving clarity. These guides includeby Martin Cutts (1996),by Fern Rook (1983), andby Joseph M. Williams (1995).
