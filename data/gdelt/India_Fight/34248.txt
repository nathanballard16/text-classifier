Lightning kills 35 cows at shelter, 315 others shifted

Allahabad: As many as 35 cows were killed when lightning struck a cattle shelter in Phulpur tehsil of the district early on Thursday.

Senior officials from state capital Lucknow rushed to Gauvansh Aashray Sthal in Kandi village under Bahadurpur block on Friday and made arrangements to shift the remaining 315 animals to a safer location.

According to sources, the 350 cows were resting in the open when lightning struck the water-filled area. While 22 died on the spot, the rest were fatally injured.

After villagers reported the matter to the administration, senior district officials including district magistrate Bhanu Chandra Goswami and the BDO of Bahadurpur reached the shelter in Kandi.

“Of the 13 grievously injured cows, seven died around noon and the rest by evening. Five other injured cows are recuperating,” said CS Sharma, chief veterinary officer of the district.

Autopsy has confirmed lightning as the cause of death of 35 cows. “The dead animals have been cremated and the rest of the cows shifted to a nearby shelter,” Sharma added.

Members of Vishwa Hindu Parishad, who visited Kandi village after the mishap, later met the district magistrate to discuss how safe other state-run cow shelters were.
