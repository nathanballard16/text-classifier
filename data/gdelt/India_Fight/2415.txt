Watch: Salman Khan is filming some high octane car scenes for Bharat and we are totally loving it

In just a week’s time, all the Salman Khan fans will be treated to the trailer of one of the most anticipated films of the year- Bharat and while we are patiently counting days, today, the producer of the film, Atul Agnihotri, shared a video from the sets of the film on Twitter wherein we can see some car-chasing sequence taking place on the sets. Alongside the video, his caption read, ‘6 days to go #BharatTeaser @bharat_thefilm @beingsalmankhan #katrinakaif @aliabbaszafar @whosunilgrover @DishPatani.’

Well, if you have Salman Khan and Ali Abbas Zafar together, you better expect some high­-octane car-chasing sequences, and staying true to their tradition, just like Tiger Zinda Hai, Bharat will also offer some high-voltage action and drama. For the first schedule of the film, the cast and crew of Ali Abbas Zafar’s film had jetted off to Malta to kick start the film, and post Malta, they headed to Abu Dhabi, Punjab and Delhi. While all the Salman Khan fans were expecting that the trailer of the film will be released on the actor’s birthday, i.e. December 27, 2018, however, the director of the film had taken to Twitter to announce that not on his birthday but on another special occasion is when the trailer of Bharat will release.

Ali Abbas Zafar wrote, “All the @BeingSalmanKhan fans , don’t loose your hearts, it was our conscious decision not to release anything about @Bharat_TheFilm on Bhai’s birthday, we are still shooting the film , Naye saal mein nayi film ki baat karegein , Naam Bharat hai ..date bhi special Hogi.” And now, according to reports, the trailer of Bharat will release on Republic Day, i.e. January 26, 2019. This 2019 Eid outing also stars Tabu, Sunil Grover, Disha Patani, Jackie Shroff and Nora Fatehi among others.
