The Accidental Prime Minister: Delhi High Court rejects PIL seeking ban on trailer

The Delhi High Court has rejected a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) seeking a ban on the trailer of The Accidental Prime Minister. The film is based on the book of the same name written by Sanjaya Baru, the media advisor of former prime minister Dr Manmohan Singh, and chronicles the tenure of Singh in office.

Anupam Kher and Akshaye Khanna play Dr Manmohan Singh and Sanjaya Baru, respectively, in The Accidental Prime Minister. The film is slated to open in theatres this Friday (January 11).

Pooja Mahajan, a Delhi-based fashion designer, had filed a PIL claiming that the film will tarnish the image of the prime ministerial post, nationally and internationally.

However, the Delhi High Court quashed Mahajan's PIL and said that only those directly affected by the film had the right to approach the court. The court also ruled that this was not a matter of public interest, and therefore, the PIL would have to be dismissed.

Earlier, Mahajan had filed a plea through her counsel Arun Maitri, claiming that the trailer violated Section 416 of the Indian Penal Code as impersonation of a living character or living persons is not permissible in law.

Advocate Maitri said in court that the makers of The Accidental Prime Minister had not taken the permission of Dr Manmohan Singh, Congress president Rahul Gandhi and his mother Sonia Gandhi to portray them in the film.

On Monday, a single-judge bench had struck down Mahajan's plea saying that it should be refiled as a public suit.
