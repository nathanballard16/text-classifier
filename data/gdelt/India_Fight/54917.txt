HP's anti-fraud programme seizes goods worth Rs 80 crore in 1 year

New Delhi: HP Inc.'s Anti-Counterfeiting and Fraud (ACF) programme has seized counterfeit products worth Rs 80 crore in India in the past one year with Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) leading the chart with products worth Rs 33.5 crore.



The PC major's ACF programme helps combat production, distribution and sale of counterfeit ink and toner printing supplies, the company said on Monday.





Bengaluru came a close second with seized products worth Rs 22 crore followed by Mumbai and Chennai with seized products worth Rs 6.5 crore and Rs 3.5 crore, respectively.



"Law enforcement authorities conducted raids at over 170 premises resulting in 144 arrests across India. Among the products seized during the raids were finished and unfinished cartridges, packaging materials and various sets of labels. These seized cartridges and labels were used to manufacture counterfeit HP print supplies," the company said in a statement.



The company regularly conducts audits and cooperates with law enforcement agencies to conduct raids to reduce counterfeits in the supply chain to protect customers and businesses, the company added.



Apart from enforcement and raids, large and medium-sized HP customers can request a customer delivery inspection (CDI), a unique protection service, if they suspect the presence of counterfeit products in their delivery.



Through the ACF programme, the company aims to protect businesses from the problems that can result from counterfeit supplies.
