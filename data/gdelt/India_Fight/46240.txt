New Delhi, October 5

Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has given an in-principle approval to enhancement of monetary assistance to next of kin of all categories of battle casualty from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 8 lakh.

The amount will be granted under the Army Battle Casualties Welfare Fund (ABCWF). Earlier, there was a provision of financial assistance of Rs 2 lakh to the battle casualties in case of death, 60 per cent and above disability or invalidation due to disability, and Rs 1 lakh to those suffering disability less than 60 per cent.

This payout is in addition to the existing liberalised family pension, financial assistance from the Army Group Insurance, Army Welfare Fund and ex gratia amount.

The ABCWF has been set up under the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare (ESW), Ministry of Defence, after a large number of people offered to provide monetary assistance to the families of battle casualties following an incident in February 2016 at Siachen, wherein 10 soldiers were buried in an avalanche. The ABCWF was instituted in July 2017 and implemented retrospectively with effect from April 2016.

The fund was created under the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890. A bank account, bearing No. 90552010165915, was opened in the South Block branch of Syndicate Bank, New Delhi, for public to deposit money.

This fund is in addition to the various existing schemes for the welfare of the next of kin and children of battle casualties in form of additional ex gratia. — TNS
