Boxful of apples with pro-Pakistan slogans

Hum Kya Chahte? Azadi

JAMMU: Apples with pro-Pakistan graffiti and the names of slain terrorists Burhan Wani and Zakir Musa scribbled on them in black ink have been found inside a box of fruit procured by a vendor in Kathua district, J&K police said on Wednesday.The lot was seized after the unidentified vendor, who owns a stall near Mookherji Chowk in Kathua town, reported what he had found to the nearest police station. "What we know so far is that the apples came from Jammu. We are trying to confirm the point of origin and whose handiwork it was," an officer said.The slogans scribbled on the apples include "(What do we want? Freedom)". Some fruit sellers in Kathua threatened to boycott apples grown in Kashmir if police failed to trace the culprits.
