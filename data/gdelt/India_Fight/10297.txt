‘Air Force displayed bravery like Lord Hanuman’ says Sumitra Mahajan

Indore: Lok Sabha Speaker Sumitra Mahajan on Tuesday equated the Air Force to the tale of Lord Hanuman returning safely after setting Lanka ablaze for the strike on a terror camp in Balakot.

While praising the Indian Air Force, Mahajan also congratulated Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the air strike, saying the action sent a strong message to Pakistan that it should not look at India with evil eyes.

The IAF carried out multiple aerial strikes at terror launch pads at various places in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, destroying control rooms of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other infrastructure.

She stated that “Pawan Putra Hanuman returned after torching Lanka. Our Air Force displayed bravery like Lord Hanuman. Now the entire country is confident of terrorism being eliminated.”

She further added that “Our air warriors returned unscathed after taking action against the terrorists’ hideouts but the neighbouring country is still clueless about what happened.”

The air strikes by the IAF on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest terror camp in Pakistan on Tuesday was in retaliation to the February 14 attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, which had left 40 Indian CRPF troopers dead.
