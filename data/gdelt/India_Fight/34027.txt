Salman Khan Hosts Birthday Bash For Ex Sangeeta Bijlani & Girlfriend Iulia Vantur Seems To Be Just Fine!

Salman & Sangeeta Bijlani might have dated back in 90s but it’s something that’s known to every cinegoer because after all, it’s the ‘Salman Khan’ and every small incident related to him, grabs the eyeballs! Recently, the Dabangg actor had hosted a birthday bash for his ex, which was attended by other Industry members like Mohnish Bahl, Prabhudeva, Sajid Nadiadwala and girlfriend Iulia Vantur.

The pictures from the bash are storming the internet. While Sangeeta can be seen all smiles as she poses with the balloons, another picture witnesses the entire squad posing together. Salman can be seen donning a white t-shirt, next to the birthday girl, who’s in a blue attire. What grabbed eyeballs is the actor’s present girlfriend posing at the side and she seems to be just as happy. That’s indeed the kind of equation every person would want in their life – but not every one can be as our Bharat actor.

Yesterday, a video of Salman matching footsteps on Urvasi with his Dabangg director Prabhudeva from the event was doing the rounds.

Actor Kichcha Sudeep of “Eega” and filmmaker Sajid Nadiadwala are also seen shaking legs with the “Dabangg” star in the video shared on Twitter on Tuesday.
