Trio opens fire at man who chased them for entering his farmland

Dharmapuri: A three-member gang has opened fire at a 31-year-old man, who was guarding his maize farm at night, after he attempted to catch them for entering the field.

Police identified the victim as Sekar, of Kadukkapatti near Palacode. He has been admitted to the government hospital in a critical condition.

According to a police officer, Sekar was employed with a private bank. “He was at the farm on Thursday night to guard the maize crop. Around midnight, he saw three men entering his farm. As soon as he raised an alarm, the trio sped away on their bike.”

But Sekar started to chase them on his motorcycle. When the gang reached Papparapatti, they stopped the vehicle and one of the men pulled out a country made gun to scare Sekar away. “Since Sekar shouted for help, the man opened fire, but missed the target. As Sekar attempted to flee, the gang shot at him once more, this time on target,” the officer said.

Other motorists on the stretch later rescued Sekar and took him to the hospital. Doctors said Sekar was out of danger but has to be under critical care. Police have registered a case and launched a manhunt for the trio.
