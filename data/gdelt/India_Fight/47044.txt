Meanwhile, the security personnel were also alerted and they took control of the aircraft. When they tried to apprehend him, he was found in an intoxicated and drugged state. He further did not respond to the security personnel and stayed inside the toilet. He was then brought out of the toilet and handed over to RGI airport police for further action.

He was then sent to Osmania hospital for tests. But at the hospital, he did not cooperate with the staff and tried to escape from the hospital by removing his clothes. He even threatened police and hospital staff by behaving madly.
