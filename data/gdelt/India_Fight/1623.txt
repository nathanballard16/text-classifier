A pall of gloom descended on the area after the came. Friends and relatives as well as local people thronged the family's house.

"He was passionate about army. After getting BSc degree from Fergusson, he never thought about any other career option and started preparing for army exam," said Harish Kasarkhod, a childhood friend.

Having graduated from a premier college, Nair could have got a comfortable job elsewhere but his passion was the armed forces, Kasarkhod said.

A family member said Nair had spoken to his mother Friday morning.
