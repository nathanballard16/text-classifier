BJP's latest on Rajiv Gandhi: Instruction to kill came from his office in 1984 riots

The BJP continues to target former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in the campaign for the ongoing Lok Sabha election. In the latest attack on Rajiv Gandhi, the BJP alleged that the "instructions to kill" came from the then Prime Minister's Office in 1984 riots.

"It's on record of Nanavati Commission that probed the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the biggest genocide of India in which the government killed its own citizens, that instructions to kill came directly from the then PM Rajiv Gandhi's office," the BJP posted on Twitter today, adding, "The country awaits justice for this karma."

This is in reference to Congress president Rahul Gandhi's Sunday jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who had accused the former prime minister of corruption last week.

Responding to PM Modi, Rahul Gandhi wrote on Twitter: "Modi Ji, The battle is over. Your Karma awaits you. Projecting your inner beliefs about yourself onto my father won't protect you. All my love and a huge hug. Rahul"

PM Modi had called Rajiv Gandhi the "bhrashtachari number one" (corrupt number one) at an election rally. "Your father was termed Mr Clean by his courtiers, but his life ended as bhrashtachari no 1," Modi had said in Uttar Pradesh.

PM Modi has continued to attack the Congress with barbs on Rajiv Gandhi. On Wednesday, he told an election rally in New Delhi that Rajiv Gandhi used naval warship INS Viraat as his "personal taxi" when he went for a holiday with his family and relatives from sasural in 1987.
