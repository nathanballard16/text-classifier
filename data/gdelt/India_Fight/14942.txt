“Weak Modi is scared of Xi”, says Rahul Gandhi

NEW DELHI: Calling China's decision to back Pakistan on Jaish-e-Mohammed a failure of the BJP government, Congress president Rahul Gandhi Thursday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was weak and scared of the Chinese President.Rahul tweeted, "Weak Modi is scared of Xi (Jinping). Not a word comes out of his mouth when China acts against India. NoMo's China diplomacy: Swing with Xi in Gujarat, Hug Xi in Delhi, Bow to Xi in China."With the terror outfit JeM responsible for Pulwama attacks, Congress accused the BJP regime of giving another reprieve to Masood Azhar. It questioned Modi's repeated bonhomie with the Chinese President given that the government had failed to bring China to its side on the UNSC proposal to tag the JeM chief a global terrorist."A terrorist responsible for such bloody murders is let off the hook again by the BJP," the AICC said.Calling it a "sad day" for India's fight against terrorism, Congress spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, "China blocking Masood Azhar's designation as global terrorist reaffirms Chinese position of being an inseparable ally of terrorism's breeding ground -- Pakistan. Sadly, Modiji's foreign policy has been a series of diplomatic disasters."China's decision on JeM was yet another opening for Congress to slam the BJP over the issue of terrorism post-Pulwama, having spent last few days targeting national security adviser Ajit Doval for "having released the JeM chief" after the IC-814 hijacking.
