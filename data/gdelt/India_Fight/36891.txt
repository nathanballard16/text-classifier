Triple Talaq Bill: Decisive turn in BJP's battle against 'appeasement' politics

NEW DELHI: Parliament's nod to the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill, 2019, criminalising instant talaq , marks a decisive turn in BJP's political battle against what it dubbed "appeasement" politics, which will amplify its domination and help reassure its base.BJP has consistently opposed triple talaq and other controversial features of Muslim personal law , including polygamy, on the ground that they were in conflict with the law of the land and as part of its larger pitch for Uniform Civil Code . Although the campaign against the politics of vote bank fetched it good returns at the hustings, it was unable to deliver on its manifesto promises because of lack of numbers and the support that Muslim resistance would receive from other political parties, including its allies.That changed on Tuesday evening with a victory that will boost the spirits of the cadre, and reassure those who looked uncomfortable with the new thrust on winning the "vishwas" of all and induction of outsiders of diverse stripes in the aftermath of Modi's landslide win in the Lok Sabha polls.BJP may have lately framed the issue of punishment for those persisting with instant oral talaq as one of gender justice, but the cadre continue to see it through the prism of their fight against what saffron circles call the "Muslim veto". To them, the success on the floor of Rajya Sabha represents a "foot-in-the-door" moment; a prelude to the enactment of Uniform Civil Code and abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of the Constitution which guarantee "special status" to J&K.The manner of victory was equally important. The margin of 99 to 84 would suggest a closer conflict. However, it was an easy win, with "opponents" like AIADMK, JD(U), BSP and TRS choosing not to follow through their aggressive attack by voting against it.
