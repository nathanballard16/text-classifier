Water-sharing, transit to top Hasina’s Delhi agenda

NEW DELHI: Connectivity will be the dominant theme of the forthcoming visit by Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina , who arrives here on Thursday on a three-day trip, her first after elections in Bangladesh and India.Hasina will will address the business summit at the World Economic Forum here on Thursday, as well as meet business leaders to attract investment into Bangladesh. On Saturday, Hasina will sit down for a day of bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government. Hasina and Modi will inaugurate three video projects — for India to buy LPG from Bangladesh, a new hostel at the Ramkrishna Mission in Dhaka and an institute for skill development in Khulna.Water sharing and transit by inland waterways are likely to dominate the discussions. But there is unlikely to be any move on the Teesta. Instead the Indian government will be pushing through with an idea that Mamata Banerjee had floated a few years ago — that India would be willing to share water from a number of other rivers with Bangladesh. The Indian side is looking at 7-10 trans-boundary rivers crossing into Bangladesh. Bangladesh is the largest recipient of assistance from India’s Exim Bank and this might be increased further.Hasina will call on the president and also meet opposition leader Sonia Gandhi during her visit. Foreign minister S Jaishankar and other ministers will call on her.
