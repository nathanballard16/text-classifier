New Delhi:

Air Chief Marshal Rakesh Kumar Singh Bhadauria on Tuesday said there was a major shift in the way terror attacks were being handled by the government. “Present security environment in the neighbourhood is a serious cause of concern. The Pulwama attack is a stark reminder of the persistent threat to defence installations,” news agency ANI quoted Air Chief Marshal as saying. The Indian Air Force is celebrating its 87th anniversary today.

“Strategic relevance of this (Balakot airstrike) is the resolve of political leadership to punish perpetrators of terrorism. There is a major shift in govt’s way of handling terrorist attacks,” Bhadauria said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a tweet this morning extended his greeting to the force: "Today, on Air Force Day, a proud nation expresses gratitude to our air warriors and their families. The Indian Air Force continues to serve India with utmost dedication and excellence."

Bhadauria took charge last month as the 26th chief of the Indian Air Force. He has more than 4250 hours of experience on 26 types of fighters and transport aircraft with the unique distinction of being an Experimental Test Pilot, a Cat 'A' Qualified Flying Instructor and a Pilot Attack Instructor, says his profile on the Indian Air Force website. Air Marshal Bhadauria was also the Air Attache, at EoI Moscow, Assistant Chief of the Air Staff (Projects), Commandant of the National Defence Academy, Senior Air Staff Officer at HQ CAC, Deputy Chief of the Air Staff at Air HQ and Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief of Southern Air Command.
