Four TMC offices have been vandalised in the area since Sunday and two BJP workers arrested in this connection, sources said. The area remains tense.

A worker of the BJP’s minority cell was allegedly killed in a clash allegedly between cadres of the saffron party and Trinamool Congress (TMC) in Arambagh area of Hooghly district on Sunday. Four persons have been arrested so far, police said.

Blaming TMC workers for the murder, the BJP has called for a 12-hour bandh in Arambagh on Wednesday, even as the ruling party denied the charge, calling the death a “fallout of personal enmity”.
