Mumbai: Man kills live-in partner in Vakola, arrested

The Vakola police on Tuesday arrested a 30-year-old man who allegedly murdered his live-in girlfriend. According to police, the accused has been identified as Ramsey Kurioe, who is also said to be of a north-east origin and was staying with his girlfriend Marina at his flat in Santacruz East.

The police initially registered an Accidental Death Report (ADR) in the matter which was later turned into an FIR as it was established that the deceased was brutally assaulted to death which his boyfriend tried to portray as an accident to escape arrest.

A police officer said, "It was revealed that the duo were not in good terms since a long time and used to fight over trivial issues which intensified since last week. The deceased was brought at Cooper hospital in Vile Parle in a collapsed state where she was declared dead on admission."
