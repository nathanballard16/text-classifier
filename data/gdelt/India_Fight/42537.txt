A year after the draconian section 377 was decriminalised by the Supreme Court, the community believes that the masks are gone but there is still a long battle ahead. According to activists the first step is already taken and future legislation are in process. "The masks have vanished and we have found prominence in mainstream culture. We have grown to embrace ourselves in our complete being. However, we ought to remember that reading down of section 377, is the first step. We need to ride on it, and win more legislation, more equality, marriage rights, adoption rights and many more," said Harish Iyer, an equal rights activist and the founder of The Jimmy Foundation. Iyer had moved the Supreme Court with an Impleadment Application on the section 377 case.
