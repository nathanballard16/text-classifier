SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen killed a ruling Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) leader inside his house in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said Sunday.

Locals said 70-year-old Ghulam Muhammad Mir was affiliated with BJP and was its vice-president for Anantnag district.

Mir was fired upon by gunmen at village Nowgam-Verinag in Anantnag district, about 86 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Last night gunmen barged inside house of Mir in Verinag and fired upon him indiscriminately," a police official posted in Anantnag told Xinhua. "He was in critical condition and was immediately removed to a primary health center in the vicinity... However, he succumbed on the way."

The police suspected that militants were involved in the killings.

The militants in the region usually target families and individuals for their possible links with police and defense agencies. Even people having associations with pro-India political parties and police are targeted at times.
