Congress, Mayawati, Akhilesh can't digest a man from backward caste became PM: Amit Shah

New Delhi: Top leaders and political parties continued with their high-octane electioneering across the country and held rallies and roadshows on Thursday. Among other developments, PM Narendra Modi took time from his hectic campaigning schedule and spoke exclusively in an interview with Zee News editor-in-chief Sudhir Chaudhary. PM Modi discussed a wide range of issues besides expressing confidence that the NDA will get more than 272 seats in the Lok Sabha and will form the government at the Centre.

The Prime Minister also spoke about how the Opposition parties have indulged in electoral mudslinging this time and are constantly targeting him and calling him names. Taking a dig at West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, PM Modi said that the latter has refused to accept him as Prime Minister, thus insulting the Constitution

In the sixth phase of the election, voting will be in Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal and also on all Lok Sabha constituencies in Haryana and Delhi.
