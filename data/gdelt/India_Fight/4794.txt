NEW DELHI, Feb. 7 (Xinhua) -- As many as 2 million government employees in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh are observing a seven-day strike against the state government, demanding restoration of the old pension scheme.

The strike began on Wednesday and will continue till Feb. 12. More than 150 government employees unions are participating in the statewide strike. Almost all government offices in the state wear a deserted look, or remain locked, as the striking employees and the union leaders gather outside to strategise and protest, said local media reports.

The Uttar Pradesh state government had recently introduced a new pension scheme under which the government employees are expected to contribute more towards the scheme. The agitated employees are opposed to this new pension scheme.

The share of the government too in the pension scheme has been raised from 10 percent to 14 percent.

The government held several rounds of talks with the striking employees' unions, but when the talks failed the government invoked the Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) banning all protests but the strike has begin, the media reports added.

According to a union leader of the striking employees, the health and power sectors would not be involved. "This is being done on compassionate grounds so that people are not affected, but at a later stage we will include health and power services," he added.
