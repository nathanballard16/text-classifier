4 Found Guilty For 2008 Jaipur Serial Blasts That Killed 80, 1 Acquitted

The blasts in Jaipur in 2008 had killed 80 and left over 170 injured

Four people have been found guilty of involvement in multiple bomb explosions that killed 80 in Jaipur in 2008. One person has been acquitted. The blasts in Jaipur over 10 years ago had also left over 170 injured. Sentencing is on December 20.

The four convicts are Mohammad Saif, Sarwar Aazmi, Salman and Saifur Rehman. The fifth one, Shahbaaz Hussain, has been acquitted.

Three more accused are in Tihar Jail in Delhi. The entire conspiracy was believed to have been planned by one Mohammad Atin from Uttar Pradesh's Azamgarh, who was subsequently killed in the Batla House encounter in Delhi.

The four convicted today, all residents of Uttar Pradesh, had carried out the blasts on Atin's instructions. They bought explosives - ammonium nitrate which was then mixed with shrapnel - and left on cycles which were parked at nine locations in the city.

All the bombs went off between 7.20 and 7.45 pm.

The court also upheld the prosecution's version that two more of the accused in this case were killed in the Batla House encounter in Delhi.

The string of synchronised blasts that took place in Jaipur in May 2008 was among the deadliest attacks carried out by the Indian Mujahideen. Of the 10 improvised explosive devices (IEDs) that were planted, nine went off.

The accused, Shahbaaz Hussain, who has been acquitted today, had been charged with sending an email claiming responsibility for the blast and for it to have been the handiwork of the Indian Mujhahideen, but there was no evidence to prove that he had sent the email from a cyber cafe in Sahibabad. Shahbaaz Hussain is an M Tech in Computers and ran a cyber cafe in Lucknow.
