COIMBATORE: Four days after recovering the skeletal remains of R Sakthivel, 42 a software engineer , from his home on Kallukuzhi Street at Kurichi near Sundarapuram, the city police on Thursday detained his 47-year-old neighbour in connection with the case.Police identified him as M Anandakumar, a widower. “Sakthivel was in a relationship with a woman, who is a relative of Anandakumar. The woman had rejected Anandakumar’s advances earlier. This made him take revenge on Sakthivel, who was staying alone. On October 3, Anandakumar attacked Sakthivel using a wooden log and also stabbed him with a pair of scissors. He tied his hands and legs and set him on fire after pouring some fuel on him,” a police officer said.Anandakumar also took away three cellphones including an iPhone , a 64-inch LED television, a motorcycle, a laptop, a gold ring and a gold chain from Sakthivel’s house. “He had fixed the television in his home and was watching movies along with his children,” the officer told TOI.Police collected the IMEI (international Mobile Equipment Identity) numbers of the stolen phones and found that Anandakumar had used one of the phones on October 6 before selling it to someone.Anandakumar has confessed to the murder, the officer said. “We plan to remand him in judicial custody on Friday morning. We also suspect the involvement of three more people in the incident.”Sakthivel’s nephew Dinesh had found the skeletal remains on December 22.
