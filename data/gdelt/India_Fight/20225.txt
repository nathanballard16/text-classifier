Pankaj Tripathi joins Irrfan and Kareena Kapoor Khan's Angrezi Medium for a cameo

Actor Pankaj Tripathi is now everywhere, and he rightly deserves so. One of the finest actors that Indian Cinema has given to us, after Stree and Luka Chuppa, he is all set to collaborate with producer Dinesh Vijan once again. He has joined Irrfan and Rahdika Madan starrer Angrezi Medium, the sequel to the 2017 movie, Hindi Meidum. Irrfan will make his return to Bollywood post his break with the film as the actor was being treated for neuroendocrine tumour.

While talking to Mid Day, Tripathi revealed how his decision to join the film is out of respect and love for Irrfan and his friendship with Dinoo (Dinesh Vijan). He will be seen essaying the role of a wheeler-dealer, Tony, and helps Irrfan along with his daughter in the film to get to the UK. When asked how Pankaj Tripathi has now become a must in all of Dinesh's film, the producer quipped how it has become almost impossible to conceptualise any film without him and that he is his lucky mascot.
