The Indian Army on Saturday shot down a Pakistani military drone in Sri Ganganagar sector of the Indo-Pak border in Rajasthan, ANI reported.

To this end, the Indian Army said one Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) intruded in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar sector around 7.30 pm on Saturday.

"The drone was engaged and brought down," the Army added.

The downing of the drone came in the midst of heightened tension between India and Pakistan after the Indian Air Force (IAF) struck a terrorist training camp in Balakot and subsequent retaliation by Islamabad.

It was the third unsuccessful attempt by Pakistan to send a spy drone inside India since the February 26 airstrike.

On March 4, a fighter jet of the IAF shot down a Pakistani drone in Bikaner sector of the Indo-Pak border using an air-to-air missile. The Pakistani drone was shot down by a Sukhoi-30 aircraft.

Another Pakistani drone was shot down by India on February 27 along Indo-Pak border in Kutch in Gujarat.
