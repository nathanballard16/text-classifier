Ruckus during oath taking of Pragya Singh Thakur as she invokes her spiritual guru

The Lok Sabha today saw ruckus as Pragya Singh Thakur took oath as the newly elected member of the house. While taking oath of duty Pragya Singh Thakur took name of her guru.

Taking oath in Sanskrit, she said, "I...Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur Poorn Chetnand Avdheshanand Giri", which the Opposition members objected to saying she modified the wordings of oath. They said the name of her guru, Swami Avdheshanand Giri was not mentioned in the record that she submitted in the election affidavit and taking that name is not allowed under the rules.

Pro-tem Speaker Virendra Kumar said he will get the record verified and take cognizance accordingly.

In the middle of ruckus, the Lok Sabha officials asked Pragya Singh Thakur to include her father’s name in her oath. Pro-tem Speaker Kumar was seen checking files. He also called for the certificate of victory issued by the Election Commission to Pragya Singh Thakur. He was all the while requesting the Opposition members to maintain order in the house so that the oath taking process could be completed.

Finally after two interruptions, Pragya Singh Thakur completed her oath of duty in the third attempt. In the Lok Sabha election, Pragya Singh Thakur was elected to the lower house from Bhopal parliamentary constituency defeating Congress veteran and two-time Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Digvijaya Singh. She is an accused in Malegaon blast case of Maharashtra in which six people were killed more than 10 years ago.
