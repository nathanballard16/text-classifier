CJI: Former Supreme Court judge to probe 'conspiracy' in CJI case

New Delhi: Former Supreme Court judge AK Patnaik, who is tasked with probing an alleged conspiracy to frame Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi in a sexual harassment case, will start his inquiry only after an in-house inquiry against Gogoi is completed.“I will start only after the in-house committee completes its probe as there is no time limit fixed by the Supreme Court to submit the report of my inquiry into the affidavits sent to me by the court,” Justice Patnaik told ET on Friday.A Supreme Court bench had on Thursday asked Justice Patnaik to examine allegations of a “larger conspiracy” by vested interests behind the sexual harassment charge levelled against Gogoi by a sacked court staff, and told the chiefs of CBI, IB and Delhi Police to assist him in the probe.The apex court had also constituted a three-judge internal panel of Justices SA Bobde, Indira Banerjee and Indu Malhotra to probe the allegations of sexual harassment.“My inquiry essentially is into the affidavit filed by advocate Utsav Bains shall start only after the other probe is completed,” Justice Patnaik said. A Chandigarh-based lawyer, Bains had in an affidavit alleged that the harassment charge was part of a larger conspiracy hatched by a large corporate house in connivance with a sacked court staff to implicate the CJI and fix benches and verdicts in the top court.
