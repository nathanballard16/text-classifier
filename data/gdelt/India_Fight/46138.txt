Rs 96 lakh for kin of ASI killed in road mishap

New Delhi, October 4Motor Accident Claims Tribunal (MACT) has awarded over Rs 96 lakh to wife and five children of a 46-year old Assistant Sub Inspector in Delhi Police who was killed in a road accident last year. MACT Presiding Officer SS Malhotra awarded the compensation of Rs 96.16 lakh to family of Mamchand Tomar, who was deputed as an ASI in Delhi Police at the time of accident. On April 6, 2018, travelling from Delhi to Ghaziabad in his car, Tomar suffered serious injuries after being hit by a dumper at a high speed. The court held that there was no evidence to show that Tomar was at fault in any manner. "This issue is therefore decided in favour of the petitioners (Tomar's family) and against respondents by holding that the victim died in a vehicular accident due to rash and negligent driving of the dumper," the court said.
