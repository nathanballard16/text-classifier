On, Nayantara Sahgal addresses meet atIn an atmosphere vitiated with communal hatred, when civil liberties are under attack, writers have been raising their voice and are committed to putting up a fight against the ongoing assault on human freedom and security,said at the ‘India Unites Convention on’, an event organised at Sophia College on Mahatma Gandhi’s 71st death anniversary. “As writers we are committed to a surgical strike against war. All forms of art can be a powerful tool of political activism,” she said on Wednesday, addressing a 300-strong audience at the function organised by Delhi-based socio-cultural organisation Anhad, in association with independent rights groups.Sahgal, who was at the forefront of the ‘award wapsi’ movement, was not allowed to inaugurate thein Yavatmal following threats from MNS workers. At the Sophia event, she said the ideology that led to Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination “was spreading religious hatred in the country, destroying equal citizenship and rights of Indians – their right to think, speak, write, dance, dress, love and marry – by taking control of the universities and all aspects of knowledge and culture by making nonsense of history, science and art.” On Wednesday, Mirror had also reported her scathing attack on Bollywood for the industry’s silence over suppression of free speech.In order to combat this “frontal attack on our Constitution”, Sahgal said the solution was “to unite in civil disobedience in our respective fields and reject the lies we are told”. Given the influence teachers have on children, she underscored their role in this endeavour.On a personal note, the 91-year-old niece of Jawaharlal Nehru reminisced about her first encounter with Gandhi in Allahabad when she was four. Her mother had asked her to present a bouquet to him, but she refused saying he was ugly. Gandhi had laughed, saying that he hoped she would always be this truthful.In the same breath, paying a tribute to slain journalist Gauri Lankesh, she said writers will continue to support those who speak the truth to power. “We had drifted far from Gandhi’s dream of inclusiveness and become a nation where a few Indians had colossal wealth while the rest were short on basic needs,” she said.Retired Supreme Court Justice Jasti Chelameswar, retired IPS officer Dr Meeran Chadha Borwankar, Marathi writer Pradnya Daya Pawar, Admiral L Ramdas, student leader Kawalpreet Kaur, lyricistand editor of Little Magazine Antara Dev Sen were other guest speakers for the evening.
