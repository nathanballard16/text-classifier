Pune: The Pune Police booked two men for murdering a 21-year-old man. The two accused hail from Rajasthan and are furniture traders. Ram Swarup, the deceased was a native of Nagaur district of Rajasthan. The accused were identified as Pappu Ram and Jagdish.

An investigation revealed that the deceased used to work at Pappu Ram's shop in Kharadi's Chaudhary Vasti area. The arrests came in response to the complaint filed by the deceased's father.

The deceased's father alleged that his son had been hired to work in the furniture business but was forced to do daily chores like cleaning and cooking for the accused. When Swarup refused to do the daily chores on May 5, the accused allegedly locked him up in a room.

The police stated that the deceased's body bore several injury marks, which indicated that he had been beaten. On May 6, the accused sent the deceased back to Rajasthan. Swarup was admitted to a hospital in Jaipur but was later shifted to Jodhpur, where he succumbed to his injuries.



The police told Hindustan Times that Swarup died at 7 am on June 4. A case was registered at a police station in Rajasthan and was later transferred to Pune. Investigation of the case was undertaken by assistant commissioner of police, Yerwada division, Shivaji Pawar.

A similar incident came to light from the national capital in January after a domestic help was found dead at a doctor's residence in Safdarjung Enclave. The police claimed that the deceased had committed suicide but the family of the deceased alleged that she had been murdered after being sexually abused.
