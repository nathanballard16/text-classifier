5 killed, 2 injured as police officer shoots his colleagues in India

At least six Indian police officers were killed, two were injured during a shootout, which was arranged by their colleague in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, Hindustantimes reported.

According to these data, the incident occurred early in the morning. The motives of the attacker are unknown. Most of the victims died on the spot, two more died on arrival at the hospital. Nothing threatens the life of the injured at the moment, their condition is assessed as stable.

Two of the six dead were reportedly senior police officers. The offender committed suicide after the attack.

The central belt of the states of India, including Chhattisgarh, has been fighting the Maoists, militants of left-wing political convictions, striving to overthrow the political elite of the South Asian country for many decades.

The Maoists claimed responsibility for most of the attacks in the region, including attacks on senior officials and police officers in these states in recent years. The fight against the Maoists is complicated by the fact that a significant part of central India is covered by dense jungle, in which it is difficult to track the location and activity of the militants.
