I feel the fire in your hearts: PM Modi's outrage on Pulwama terror attack

As the nation mourns the loss of 40 CRPF jawans killed at the Pulwama terror attack in Kashmir, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday said he shared nation's outrage.

Addressing a public gathering in Barauni in Bihar, PM Modi said, "Jo aag aapke dil mein hai, wahi aag mere dil mein bhi hai (the fire that is burning in your hearts, the same fire burns in my heart)".

He also paid tribute to CRPF jawans Sanjay Kumar and Ratan Kumar Thakur, Bihar natives who were martyred in the Pulwama terror attack, the deadliest strike on the armed forces in Jammu and Kashmir.

"I pay my tributes to martyr constable Sanjay Kumar Sinha from Patna and Bhagalpur's Ratan Kumar Thakur who sacrificed their lives for the country. I express my sympathies with their families," PM Modi said.

Expressing sympathy to the families of the martyred jawans, Modi said he understands that the people of the country are feeling enraged after the incident.

40 CRPF jawans were martyred in the ghastly February 14 terror attack in Pulwama when a Jaish-e-Mohammed suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden SUV into a CRPF convoy.

In the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack, India on Friday revoked the MFN status to Pakistan. India also took strong economic action against the neighbouring country, by raising the customs duty to 200 per cent on all goods imported including fresh fruits, cement, petroleum products and mineral ore on Saturday.
