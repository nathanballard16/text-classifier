Marathi films have been experimenting a lot lately - from concepts to technology. One to join the list of such films is upcoming much-awaited movie Pondicherry. Set in the scenic French colonial city Pondicherry, the film derives its name from the location. It will be shot completely on a smartphone. The excitement around the film is increasing and now that the director supposedly revealed a look of the movie's leading lady Sai Tamhankar, the curiosity is only intensifying.

Sai is seen clad in a simple cotton saree with gajra in her hair, standing against a rustic painting. Director Sachin Kundalkar shared this picture on his Instagram with no caption. Since then, fans have been speculating if this is indeed the first look from the film. There has been no official statement from neither Sachin nor Sai about the same.

The film is being shot completely in Pondicherry. The director recently shared the challenges the team was facing while shooting with a smartphone. The film will see stalwarts like Mahesh Manjrekar and Neena Kulkarni play pivotal roles alongside leads Amruta Khanvilkar, Vaibhav Tatvawadi and Sai Tamhankar.

Pondicherry is written by Sachin Kundalkar and Tejas Modak. The posters and first look of the film were launched a few days ago. Since then, the film has been garnering a lot of interest. Currently, the whole team is in Pondicherry busy shooting for the film. There is no official announcement on the release date of the film but it is expected to hit theatres soon.
