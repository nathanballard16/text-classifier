Sub abandoned off Spain had 3 tons of cocaine: Authorities in Spain said a homemade submarine abandoned off the country's northwestern coast had three metric tons of cocaine on board. Police and the Finance Ministry said it is the first time that drug smugglers have tried to use a submarine in Europe. An international operation involving police from Spain, Portugal, the United States, Britain and Brazil tracked the fiberglass vessel across the Atlantic. Authorities said that the submarine was due to pass the cocaine to another vessel but that the three people on board abandoned the sub amid rough seas off Spain. Two Ecuadoran nationals were arrested. A third person is at large.
