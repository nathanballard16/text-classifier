Indonesia is 'world’s most chilled out country'

The South-East Asian nation of Indonesia is the world's most chilled out country, according to a study by lastminute.com.

The European travel retailer crunched numbers to come up with a list of the world’s 15 most laid-back lands.

Indonesia is made up of over 16,000 islands, meaning you're never far from the ocean in th southeast Asian nation.

Considering factors across four categories: breaks, environment, culture and human rights, researchers looked at everything from weather and light pollution to number of public holidays, accessibility of Zen spaces and country’s natural resources.

Indonesia scored best in the environment and culture categories, but dropped points in terms of human rights. With almost 200 green spaces and over 16,000 islands, travellers are never far from an ocean-dipped sunset.

The Twelve Apostles in Victoria, Australia which was ranked the second-most chilled out country in the world.

Second-placed Australia scored well for environment thank to its abundance of nature and for human rights but dropped points in the culture category. Next up, Iceland scored reasonably well across all four categories. The island nation gives workers 36 days off every year and is one of the best spots on the planet for stargazing.

Iceland is the third most chilled out country in the world and one of the world's best places for stargazing.

The Philippines was ranked as the best place on the planet to explore Mother Nature as well as being listed seventh in the chilled-out rankings. Sri Lanka, listed by Lonely Planet as the top country to visit in 2019, was voted the best place to enjoy a day off and ranked in fifth place, just below New Zealand which is the fourth most chilled-out country in the world.

Taal Lake in Luzon, The Philippines. The country ranked as the seventh most laid-back nation.

Also making the cut was Cyprus in sixth place which scored well across culture and breaks, and Greece and Spain which were recommended for their practices of Mesimeri and Siesta — or taking some quiet time after lunch. They ranked eight and fifteenth, respectively.

Spain and Greece were commended in the list of the world's most chilled-out countries for the practice of taking some afternoon quiet time on a daily basis.

India's fascination with mediation pushed the country into ninth place while Mauritius, Costa Rica, Portugal, Bulgaria and Croatia rounded out the top 15.
