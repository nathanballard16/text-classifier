NGT directs DPCC, Delhi civic bodies to submit report on unregulated slaughter of pigs

The National Green Tribunal has directed the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) and the city's municipal corporations to submit a report on a plea alleging pollution caused by unregulated slaughter of pigs.

A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel on Thursday sought a factual and action taken report from DPCC, and New Delhi, South Delhi, East Delhi and North Delhi municipal corporations within a month.

The DPCC will be the nodal agency for coordination and compliance, the NGT said.

The tribunal's order came on a plea filed by city resident Pramod Bahadur and a religious outfit, Ojasvi Party, against pollution caused on account of unregulated slaughter of pigs.

According to the applicants, 2,000-5,000 pigs are slaughtered in a day without specific and dedicated place and in the process 25,000 litres of toxic blood is released into the Yamuna river.

The applicants referred to Section 7 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, and Rule 3 of the rules framed thereunder, prohibiting discharge of pollution beyond the prescribed norms.

They said unchecked slaughtering has potential of causing diseases and sought direction to set up a slaughter house.

The tribunal said the only issue which it would consider is whether there is a need to check unscientific discharge of blood and carcasses of slaughtered animals in violation of environmental norms.

The matter is posted for next hearing on October 18.
