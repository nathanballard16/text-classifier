"All kinds of intervention will be conducted to ensure the security of Malayali media workers who went to report news in Mangaluru. State police chief is connected to the Karnataka police to ensure that the reporters are relased from custody. I strongly condemn those who have been portraying media reporters as violent and their news collection devices as weapons. It is a fascist attitude to curb media freedom. Public dissent should only rise higher against this attitude," Pinarayi's post read.
