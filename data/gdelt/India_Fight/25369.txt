Property I own is open book, compare it to 'mahamilavati' people: Modi

Sasaram (Bihar) [India], May 14 (ANI): Narendra Modi launched an attack against the opposition by urging people to compare the property owned by him to those owned by "Mahamilavati" people. The Prime Minister added that despite being in politics for a long time, his property details are an "open book".

"People should compare what these 'Mahamilavati' people, who are shedding tears for poor, have done for the poor and for their own family. What are they doing today? Before voting, people should remember how much property do they own. These people exploited poor people's money to indulge in corruption, they have looted the poor," Modi said while addressing a rally here.

"I have been the longest Chief Minister of Gujarat. By people's blessing, I became the Prime Minister and worked for five years in Delhi. Even after being in politics for so many years, the amount of property I own is like an open book. You can compare both of them," he added.

In a veiled attack at the RJD, Modi said they want to take the state back into the era of "lanterns", the symbol of Lalu Yadav's party.

"Fifty years back, Ram Manohar Lohia had raised his voice in front of Jawahar Lal Nehru and said that India has got independence, so many years have gone, but still women in the country are unhappy with two things - water and toilets. Ram Manohar Lohia had raised his voice in front of Nehru, but nobody heard him. Ram Manohar Lohiaji I pay respect to you today... I have tried to fulfil Ram Manohar Lohia's dream by getting almost 10 crore toilets built across India," Modi said.

Eight out of the total 40 seats in Bihar are scheduled to vote on May 19, the last phase of national polls. (ANI)
