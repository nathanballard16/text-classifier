It was not known what sparked the fire, but fire officials said that the entire manufacturing facility was engulfed within moments. Even a neighbouring facility owned by same family also caught fire.Even as the firemen were making attempts to douse the fire, tin sheds of the factory started collapsing. There were at least 37 persons working at the two units when the fire was ignited. However, no injuries or casualties were reported due to fire or collapse of infrastructure.“The company did not have any fire-fighting equipment nor there was a fire station in the industrial estate. After our bowsers ran out of water, we had to send them to a nearby tyre manufacturing factory for refilling,” said deputy chief fire officer Parth Brahmbhatt. He added that the fire department staff were clueless about the units as the owner refused to come to the spot and no other responsible person was present there.The fire was brought under control only by 7 pm. However, the salvaging continued even after that. The fire department has instructed the Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd to snap the electricity connection of the two units which were engulfed as well as two other neighbouring units which is also owned by same family.
