The former minister also said he has filed a complaint against the BJP supporters for attacking him.Linda said, "Tripathi complained that the BJP supporters chased him and prevented him from going inside the booths. We will lodge a case based on his complaint." He added that BJP has lodged a separate complaint in connection with the incident.Accusing the district administration of "acting as BJP agents", Tripathi said he was wrongfully detained for two hours and deprived of the opportunity to be with his supporters on polling day.

I was reminded of the old days when the mafia looted the Adivasi community and attempts were made to wipe out their heritage."In another incident, police intervened and prevented violence at Dema and Tendoowee localities of Hussainabad assembly constituency, where supporters of NCP candidate Kamlesh K Singh and Ajsu Party nominee Kushwaha Shivpujan Meha clashed outside polling booths.Chhaterpur SDPO Shambhu Kumar Singh said, "We have detained one person and will take in a few more for questioning.
