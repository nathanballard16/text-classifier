A heavily armed US carrier strike group has moved into position near Iran as tensions mount

The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group has moved into position near Iran as tensions between Washington and Tehran rise.

The strike group's arrival in the northern Arabian Sea follows that of a task force of B-52 heavy, long-range bombers, which recently completed their first deterrence patrol in the region.

These assets have been deployed to US Central Command to deter Iran, which the US believes may have been plotting attacks on US interests.

A US aircraft carrier and its strike group are on station to check Iran, which the US has accused of plotting attacks on US interests in the region.

The USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier and the cruiser and destroyers escorting it are operating in the northern Arabian Sea, Fox News reported, citing defense officials. The carrier is sailing with an air wing consisting of dozens of F/A-18 Hornet fighters, while the escorts are carrying hundreds of land-attack cruise missiles.

These military assets were deployed last week to the US Central Command area of responsibility along with a bomber task force, a missile-defense battery, and other capabilities in response to what CENTCOM characterized as "clear indications that Iranian and Iranian proxy forces were making preparations to possibly attack US forces in the region."

CENTCOM announced earlier this week that US forces in the region were on "high alert."
