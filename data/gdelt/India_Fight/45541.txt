Ten central trade unions backed by the Left and the Congress have announced nationwide general strike on January 8 against economic policies of the Narendra Modi government.

The decision was taken at an all India open convention at Parliament Street in the national capital on Monday. The convention was represented by union leaders from INTUC, AITUC, HMS, CITU, AIUTUC, TUCC, SEWA, AICCTU, UTUC and LPF.

Ten major central trade unions have called for a protest on January 8 against the alleged anti-labour economic policies of the Modi government.

Meanwhile, the RSS affiliated Bhartiya Mazdoor Sangh (BMS) is not supporting the bandh call.

While speaking to India Today TV, CITU General Secretary Tapan Sen said, "In the garb of FDI, this government is allowing loot of the public sector. So far, the Modi government has listed 10 companies for sale, but couldn’t succeed in selling even one.’

Tapan Sen further said that the opposition parties are responsible for the anti-labour policies as they give silent approval to the Modi government labour policies in Parliament.

Addressing the National Open Mass convention of Workers, the leaders alleged that the aggressive onslaught of the Modi-2 government on the rights and livelihoods of people in general and working class in particular, pushing relentless privatisation and bringing 100 per cent FDI in the CPSEs, is responsible for the current economic mess.
