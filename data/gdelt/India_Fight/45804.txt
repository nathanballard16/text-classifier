BENGALURU: The rocky terrain and hillocks between Bengaluru and Tumakuru are home to many pangolins which often venture out near human habitats where they come to feed on termites and end up becoming victims of poachers.On Tuesday, a team of foresters from Bengaluru Rural district busted an illegal wildlife trade racket and seized pangolin scales and claws, weighing about 1kg, at Narasipura village, bordering Nelamangala.The team led by Bengaluru Rural deputy conservator of forest GA Gangadhar arrested four persons for indulging in the act. “These miscreants also had Indian pond terrapin shell (7kg) and Indian soft shelled turtle shells (1kg) with them. Our team members posed as customers after we got clues about four persons carrying suspicious items stuffed in gunny bags with them. They revealed that they were transporting items to customers in Bengaluru,” he added.The arrested have been identified as Boya Siddaiah from Hindupur, Manjunath from Gowribidanur and Ravikumar and Sanjivappa from Bukkapatna
