Lovers Killed For Inter-caste Relationship In Tamil Nadu

Chennai:Close on the heels of an 'honour killing' of the most dishonourable kind in Palamaneru in Chittoor, in which a girl was forcibly whisked away and murdered, news of another heinous killing surfaced. A pair of young lovers were brutally stabbed by the boy's brother in Tamil Nadu. The reason in both the gruesome murders was the same—inter-caste relationship in the case of the TN couple and marriage in the Chittoor murder. Kanaka Raj (22)of Mettupalayam in Coimbatore fell in love with Darsanipriya (17) from the same place. The girl hailed from a Dalit family and the boy's parents, who belonged to an upper caste, warned him not to meet her.

Kanaka Raj had earlier eloped with Darsanipriya with the intention of getting married to her, but his family members tracked him down, had a meeting with the family members of the girl and settled the issue. The lovers were warned against meeting each other.

However, Kanaka Raj continued to meet Darsanipriya regularly, despite warnings from his brother, Vinod. On Tuesday, Vinod attacked Kanaka Raj and Darsanipriya with a knife, stabbing them indiscriminately. While Kanaka Raj succumbed to his injuries on the spot, Darsanipriya died while undergoing treatment on Saturday. Police have registered a case and are probing the matter.
