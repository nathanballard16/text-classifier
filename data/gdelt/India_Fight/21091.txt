Priyanka Chopra pens an emotional note for two lawyers – here’s why

“I am what I am, so take me as I am,” said the Chief Justice of India as the Supreme Court struck down the Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code in a unanimous vote last year. And Priyanka Chopra Jonas found this line apt to start her note addressing to the two lawyers, Arundhati Katju and Menaka Guruswamy. Yes, the two amazing ladies not only fought for the LGBTQ community but also got the Section 377 abolished forever. There were rainbow colour flags flying everywhere in the country and because of their historic win Arundhati and Menaka have now made it to the list of TIME’s 100 Most-Influential People. Priyanka, who has been a part of this coveted list in the past, congratulated them on their achievement.

With utmost grace and dignity, Priyanka penned down their profile which said, “Armed with a well-planned strategy that went beyond their well-researched legal arguments, Arundhati and Menaka became beacons of hope for the Indian LGBTQ+ community. Their perseverance and commitment led an entire community to a historic win by humanizing their struggles and giving them the freedom to love.”

“In their committed fight for justice, they have shown us that we as a society must continue to make progress, even after laws are changed, and that we must make an effort to understand, accept and love. It is who we are as people,” concluded the Isn’t It Romantic actress.

Well, wasn’t this a sweet gesture on her part? No wonder, PeeCee is the queen of so many hearts. Stay tuned to CineBlitz for more such updates from the world of Bollywood.
