Punjabi actress Tanvi Nagi, who shot to fame with Mankirat Aulakh’s song Kuwari, has all the reasons to be cloud nine. The diva has tied the knot with her beau Mohit Banwait today. The couple, who exchanged the rings in October this year, took the nuptial vows in Chandigarh’s Mohali City. It was a gala event which was attended by Tanvi and Mohit’s family and close friends. The first picture of the D-day was shared by groom Mohit on Instagram.

In the picture, the couple sitting on the stage post the Jaimala ceremony. The bride and the groom were dressed in colour coordinated outfits. Groom Mohit wore a maroon coloured sherwani which he had paired with a golden turban, pyjama, and stole. On the other hand, Tanvi looked like a dream in her bridal look. She wore a maroon coloured lehenga with heavy golden embroidery which she paired with a golden dupatta. The bride completed her look with tradition bridal jewellery including maang tika, necklace, nose ring and red chooda. The couple was all smiles as they started a new journey together.

Interestingly, Tanvi has been sharing glimpses of her wedding celebration on social media. In fact, she recently shared a video from her mehendi night wherein she was seen dancing her heart out. Dressed in a royal green ethnic ensemble, Tanvi looked elegant as a quintessential bride to be.

Talking about the work front, Tanvi made her big screen debut with Mohit’s production Once Upon A Time In Amritsar in 2016. While the couple was rumoured to be dating each other ever since, they made it official post their engagement ceremony. The actress will also be seen in Mohit’s next production Ni Main Sass Kutni opposite Mehtab Virk. The movie is slated to release in summer 2020.
