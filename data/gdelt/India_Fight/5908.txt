Congress govt in MP walking in the footsteps of previous BJP govt: Mayawati

LUCKNOW: In a fresh attack on Congress, BSP chief Mayawati on Thursday said that the government in Madhya Pradesh was following in the footsteps of the previous BJP government.A day after Congress’ Priyanka Gandhi announced her party’s alliance with Mahan Dal in UP for the upcoming Lok Sabha, Mayawati drew a parallel between the Madhya Pradesh Congress government’s use of the National Security Act against some Muslims accused of cow slaughter and the UP BJP government’s invocation of sedition against 14 students from the Aligarh Muslim University , including the union president. She said that both were examples of state terror.Interestingly, BSP with its two MLAs had extended support to the Congress government in MP to take it past the halfway mark of 115 seats. She had clarified even then that her support, despite her ideological differences with Congress, was to ensure that BJP is kept out of power. However, she has refused to allow Congress to join the BSP-SP alliance in UP, saying that while Congress will reap the benefits of the alliance, BSP will have nothing to gain from them.Strongly criticising the action of both governments, the former UP chief minister said that any government should stay away from such cruel and unnecessary actions that have the potential of ruining student life.“Where the BJP government has made a mockery of a serious issue like sedition in order to prevent free speech, MP’s Congress government is walking on the footsteps of the previous BJP government and has slapped a case under NSA against several Muslims on charges of cow slaughter,” Mayawati said.She added that governments of both parties were not just casteist, but that they are also working on communal lines. “People should now wonder what difference is there between the ideology and style of working of governments of both Congress and BJP,” she said.The BSP chief further said that BJP was allowing harassment of dalits, caste differences, neglect of backwards and violence against Muslims to flourish in the country and was also playing around with the future of poor among upper castes. “While the people of this country are desperately looking for options, the new Congress governments are doing exactly what BJP has been doing, which is working against dalits, backwards, religious minorities etc. Why are they doing this?” she asked.
