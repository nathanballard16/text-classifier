The NCP Wednesday alleged that the government's 'negligence' was responsible for the breach of Tiware dam in Ratnagiri district, in which six persons were killed

Mumbai: The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) on Wednesday alleged that the government's "negligence" was responsible for the breach of Tiware dam in Ratnagiri district, in which six persons were killed.

Calling for action against the guilty, Maharashtra NCP chief Jayant Patil sought to know after how many deaths will the government wake up.

"The mishap occurred due to the negligence of the administration. How many lives will it take for the government to wake up?" Patil asked.

His party colleague Dhananjay Munde supported Patil over his "negligence" remark and asked the government to provide immediate relief.

"The incident again raises the issue of a structural audit. Wake up those in power!" Munde tweeted.

Munde, who is the Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, had been raising the issue of carrying out structural audits of roads, bridges and buildings in the wake of wall collapse incidents, claiming lives, especially in Mumbai.

At least six people were killed and 19 went missing after the dam breached following incessant rains leading to flood-like situation in downstream villages. The dam had developed a breach late Tuesday night after heavy rains.
