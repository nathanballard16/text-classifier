American DJ and electronic music producer Marshmello, who was in India to play his set on Sunday, observed a 2-minute silence for the CRPF jawans who lost their lives in the Pulwama terror attack.

Before beginning his performance at the Supersonic music festival 2019 in Pune, the DJ said, "Two-minutes silence for the Indian soldiers who lost their lives in a terrorist attack," with the tricolour projected in the backdrop.

The ghastly terror attack, that took place on Thursday, was perpetrated by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed. A suicide bomber, who has been identified as Adil Ahmed Dar, rammed his Scorpio car carrying 350 kilograms of RDX, into a CRPF convoy of 78 buses. It is the worst terror attack on Indian forces in Jammu & Kashmir.

The FRIENDS hitmaker, on Friday, had taken to Twitter to offer his condolences to the families of the victims. A fan told news agency IANS after the final show of the music festival, "So many artistes performed at the festival, but it was only Marshmello, who remembered the jawans. I respect him even more now."

My prayers go out to those affected by the Pulwama attack. — marshmello (@marshmellomusic) February 15, 2019

The music festival also had others artistes including Jaden Smith, Rudimental, Prateek Kuhad among others performing. Luka Chuppi actor Kartik Aaryan also joined the Happier hitmaker on stage and danced with him to the tune of Coca Cola song from his forthcoming flick. The musician recently released the music video for his new single BIBA featuring Shirley Setia, Pritam which had a cameo appearance by Shah Rukh Khan.
