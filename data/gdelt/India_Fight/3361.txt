Republic Day 2019: Indian Navy tableau shows Kerala rescue operations

The relief and rescue operations done by the armed forces during the Kerala floods last year were proudly displayed as the main theme of the Indian Navy Tableau that rolled down the Rajpath during the 70th Republic Day Parade. The tableau was replete with the services pressed into the rescue operations last year.

Titled 'Operation Madad' (help), the Navy's efforts in Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operation was displayed to thousands of spectators present at the Rajpath. The audience witnessed a rescue from a rooftop wherein a Dhruv helicopter was pressed into service.

The tableau also featured the Navy's might through state-of-the-art armed assets like MiG-29K multi-role fighter, Rukmani Satellite, Boeing P81 Maritime Patrol aircraft, Kolkata class Ship and Kalvari class submarine.

The massive floods in Kerala last year that ravaged the state, claimed hundreds of lives, and rendered thousands homeless. In its 14-day-long rescue operation, aptly titled 'Madad', in the flood-hit southern state, the Indian Navy rescued a total of 16,005 people. The operation was launched on August 9 with an objective to assist the state administration that was working to provide relief in affected areas.

The Defence forces conducted several heroic acts such as air-lifting a pregnant woman and winching up a two-year old, which won them widespread appreciation.

In keeping with the sea warrior's theme for the year 2019 — "Indian Navy-Mission Deployed and Combat Ready", the tableau also illustrated its multi-dimensional combat readiness.
