Public Execution Of Rape Accused In Yemen Viral As Dubai

A disturbing video of a man being publicly executed for raping a minor in Yemen is doing the rounds on social media with claims that the incident happened in Dubai, where the judiciary punished the rapist with death moments after committing the crime.

The video is viral in the wake of the rape and murder of a 26-year-old veterinarian of Hyderabad, that has sparked outrage in the country, bringing questions of women's safety to the forefront. In a gruesome incident, a Hyderabad based veterinary doctor was gang-raped by four men, murdered and later her body was burnt on November 28.



The 1 minute 42 second video shows the accused being shot at from a point blank range by policemen. Amidst protests, his corpse is tied and hung from atop a crane. The video has been captioned as, "5 year old was raped in Dubai...Within 15 minutes of this rape incident, the judiciary ordered the police to shoot the rapist in public view..."

BOOM has not included the video in the story, given its violent nature.









The video is viral on Facebook and Twitter since 2018 with a similar narrative.
