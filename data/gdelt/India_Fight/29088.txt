Two held for stealing dumper

The Panvel City police have arrested two men who made away with a dumper that was seized by the police from an illegal sand mafia at the site of Navi Mumbai international airport on June 1.

The dumper, which was facing mechanical issues, was parked outside the compound of the Panvel City police station after repairs. It was to be taken to the tehsildar’s office for filing of a report the next day, but was stolen that night.

On June 5, the police received information that the dumper had been stolen by its owner, Kundan Mhatre, and they registered a case of theft against him.

On Friday night, the police traced Mr. Mhatre to Belapur and arrested him and his accomplice, Subhan Inamdar.

“The accused were the owners of the dumper and not the people carrying out the mining. They wanted their vehicle back so they took it away using duplicate keys. They were under the impression that they can take the vehicle because they own it. But since it had been seized by us for illegal mining, they were booked for theft,” sub-inspector Sunil Tarmale, Panvel City police station, said.
