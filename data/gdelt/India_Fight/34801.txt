Bigg Boss is one of the popular reality shows and many regional versions of the series are also one of the most liked series. And now, the Telugu version is grabbing all the limelight. As per latest report of Times of India, a public interest petition was filed in the Telangana high court on Tuesday and promotion of obscenity, vulgarity, encouraging abusive behavioral patterns, misguiding young people and immoral activities were the charges levied. The PIL was filed urging the court to ensure that all the episodes are censored properly. The petitioner, K Jagadishwar Reddy has already sought a stay on the show.

"A select group of people will be confined in a house and all their activities, conversations and their emotions are captured live by various cameras fitted in various parts of the house. All the participants were lured into it with the promise of money and fame in a short span of time and all of them will be treated as objects of amusement for the viewers, the petitioner said. The show broadcasts all that is happening inside this house. All the inmates are locked inside the house for 100 days," he said.
