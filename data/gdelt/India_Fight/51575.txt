A murder convict serving life term in Nabha jail has taken the wedding vows inside the jail premises on Friday. This is the second time that wedding bells rang inside the Nabha Central Jail.

Mohammed Wasim, the member of the Gagiga Khan gang, involved in the 2016 Yasir murder case, married a girl from his native town inside the jail.

A total of eight people attended the wedding including the family members of both the bride and groom, according to a Times of India report.

The ceremony took place at 9 am on Friday as per the Muslim traditions.

Wasim, who is serving a life sentence, was convicted for murder in 2010. He had earlier applied for a parole to get married which was turned down.

Later, his counsel asked for permission from the court to allow Wasim to get married inside the jail premises if he cannot be released. The court then agreed that Wasim may take his wedding vows inside the jail in presence of full security.

Besides murder, several cases are registered against Wasim. The police had earlier given a negative report on Wasim's parole.

Earlier, gangster Mandeep Singh, who is also serving life imprisonment in Nabha jail, got married inside the jail premises with the permission of the High Court.
