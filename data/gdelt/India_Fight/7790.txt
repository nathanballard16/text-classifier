PM Khan denies Pakistani role in attack

Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said his country had no role in a suicide bomb attack in Kashmir that killed more than 40 Indian soldiers but warned of retaliation if India attacked Pakistan, amid rising tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.

India has accused Pakistan of having a "direct hand" in the terror attack on Feb 14, for which Pakistan-based group Jaish-e-Mohammad has claimed responsibility.

Mr Khan's statement, which also referred to upcoming elections in India, came a day after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the time for dialogue with Pakistan had passed. He urged dialogue but also warned of reprisals.

"It is your election year and we understand that during elections, you will get a boost to teach Pakistan a lesson. If you... launch any attack... Pakistan will retaliate," Mr Khan said in a televised message to the nation and to India.

He said he had kept silent till now as he did not want to detract focus from a visit by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who ended a visit to Pakistan and arrived yesterday in India.

"We know it is easy to start a war. It is in the hands of humans to start a war; however, to end war isn't in our hands," said Mr Khan.

In response to Mr Khan, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) called Pakistan the "nerve centre of terrorism".
