As a goodwill gesture, BSF hands over Pak national to Pakistan Rangers

Jammu (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], Mar 9 (ANI): As a goodwill gesture, the Border Security Force (BSF) on Saturday handed over a Pakistani national to the Pakistan Rangers at about 3:40 pm.

The Pakistani national was apprehended on Friday by the BSF while he crossed the international border (IB) in Ramgarh area of Samba district in Jammu and Kashmir.

“The BSF released the Pakistani national healthy and sound. Pakistan Rangers were also appreciating the humane approach of the Border Security Force,” said the BSF PRO in a statement.

The move comes as a positive development as tension between India and Pakistan heightened following February 14 terror attack on the convoy of Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in Pulwama in south Kashmir in which 40 security personnel were killed and five others were injured.

In retaliation to Pulwama terror attack, Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out air strikes at a JeM training camp in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26, eliminating a “large number” of terrorists, according to India’s Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.

Next day, Pakistani jets violated Indian air space and dropped bombs in Rajouri sector in Jammu and Kashmir. India also foiled an attempt by the Pakistan Air Force to carry out strikes in the state by shooting down its F-16 fighter plane. (ANI)
