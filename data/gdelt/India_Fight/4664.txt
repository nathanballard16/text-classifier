Chhagan Bhujbal Extends Moral Support to Kushwaha

Patna: Chhagan Bhujbal, the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader from Maharashtra, met with Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha at his residence in Patna on Tuesday and expressed his sympathy for his injuries that he received during a police lathi-charge on his rally in the state capital last Saturday.

In Patna, the All India Phule Samata Parishad chief, a former Shiv Sena leader who later joined Sharad Pawar’s NCP, lashed out at the Nitish government in Bihar saying Bihar under Nitish had turned into a dictatorship where voice of the opposition was being crushed by use of force or by issuing threats of arrest in made-up cases.

“Opposition is being brutalized by the use of force and anyone who does not agree with the government, they face the task of being raided and sent to jail in fake CBI probes. The All India Phule Samata Parishad will launch a nationwide stir to oppose these tactics by the NDA,” he said.

Bhujbal, who spent two years in jail in connection with money-laundering, embezzlement, and corruption cases only to be released on bail last year, said that there was no need to resort to lathi charge in Patna last Saturday when the RLSP rally was entirely peaceful.

“It seems like the government was trying to murder Kushwaha because of his popularity in Bihar,” he said.

Kushwaha, whose right arm was in a sling due to injuries received during the police lathi charge last Saturday, thanked the Maharashtra leader for his support and pledged to continue to fight against the NDA government to which he was a part of until just a few weeks ago.
