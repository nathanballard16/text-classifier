Madhya Pradesh Food Department raids kitchen serving Shatabdi train

The Madhya Pradesh Food Department officials on Sunday conducted raids at the base kitchen of the Delhi-Bhopal Shatabdi Express, after reports of unhealthy food being served to passengers, and collected samples of the meals being prepared using rotten food items.

During the raids, the food department officials seized several rotten items, including 25 kg rotten onion, that were being used to prepare meals for the passengers in the train's base kitchen. It was also observed that the food was being prepared in unhygienic conditions like without staff wearing gloves and caps, which is mandatory.

The officials took several samples of rotten onions, paneer, pulses and spices, stocked in the kitchen, which were later sent to a government laboratory for examination. The rotten onion was immediately destroyed by the Food Department officials.

Food Inspector Ravi Kumar Agrahari said, ''We have come to inspect the base kitchen of the train on the instructions of the Gwalior District Collector following several complaints of unhealthy food being served to passengers on board the train. We inspected the Vridavan Food Products, which supplies meals to several premium trains."
