J-K: Terrorist hide out busted in Shopian

Shopian (Jammu and Kashmir) [India], Mar 6 (ANI): A terrorist hideout was busted on Wednesday in Kungnoo village here in a joint operation by the Jammu and Kashmir Police and 44 Rashtriya Rifles.

A substantial amount of incriminating material has been recovered from the hideout, according to the police in Shopian.

A case has been registered and further investigation is underway.

This comes as tensions between India and Pakistan have heightened following the February 14 deadly terror attack in Pulwama, and cross-border firing that ensued subsequently on various posts along the Line of Control (LoC).

Last week, two terrorists belonging to Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), including one from Pakistan, were killed in an encounter.

The encounter had come a day after India carried out air strikes at a JeM camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. (ANI)
