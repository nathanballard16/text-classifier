Farmers opposing wind farm attack labourers, dozen hurt

RAJKOT: At least 12 labourers were injured when they were attacked by the farmers of Katpar village of Mahuva taluka in Bhavnagar district , who were agitating against the setting up of a wind farm in their area on Friday. The farmers also vandalized an earth mover, trucks carrying the blades of the windmill , a road roller and eight to 10 SUVs.The farmers numbering 125 to 150 were protesting against the wind farm project, stating that it would endanger the lives of birds and animals.“The electric wires attached beneath the windmill can electrocute animals that come in contact with them. That apart, the revolving blades of the windmill can cut the birds into pieces which fly through them,” said one of the agitating farmers.Among the animals found in forest around Katpar village include lions, leopards, deer and blue bulls. Birds including many endangered species like flamingos, painted storks, pelicans and ducks are also found there. The villagers have been opposing the wind farm since past few months.On Friday, while the company’s officials were installing a windmill with the help of the labourers, the farmers arrived at the spot and started stone pelting.“The company’s officials had sought police protection in advance and were provided with four policemen. However, when the farmers’ protest snowballed into a major agitation and they started stone pelting, the cops posted there sought reinforcement, and we arrived at the spot. However, before we reached the spot, the farmers had already thrashed a dozen-odd labourers and vandalized the vehicles,” said M K Gohel, inspector of Mahuva police station.“We have registered rioting case against the agitating farmers on the complaint of Bharat Sankhat, a police constable posted there at the request of the company’s officials,” Gohel said.The police said they had booked the farmers for rioting, vandalism, physical assault and preventing police from performing their duty. “We would start arresting the accused farmers soon,” added Gohel.
