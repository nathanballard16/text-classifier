The nurse was allegedly left holding the baby’s torso while its decapitated head was left inside the mum’s body in the reported horrific incident on January 6.

He and a colleage then allegedly tried to cover-up the tragedy by depositing the lower part of the baby in the mortuary, according to shocking reports from India.

The nurses, at a government health centre in Ramgarh, then asked the woman’s family to take her to a hospital.

Gynecologist Ravindra Sankhla said he was told the baby was delivered and just the placenta remained in the womb.

He then realised something was horribly wrong while attempting to remove the placenta, Hindustan Times reported.

Doctors reportedly then found the head of the dead baby inside the woman’s womb during surgery and informed her relatives.

The mum, Dikhsha Kanwar, is now reportedly fighting for her life.

Her husband has lodged a complaint and alleged the two nurses were drunk.

The boss of the Ramgarh community health centre claimed he wasn’t around at the time of the incident.

He said the nurses conducted the delivery without informing him.

Jalam Singh, sub-inspector and investigating officer of the case, said no arrests had been made.

“When questioned, the hospital staffers handed over the lower part of the foetus to us,” he said.
