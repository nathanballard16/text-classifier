Keerthy joins Nagarjuna’s movie?

Makers of Nagarjuna’s upcoming film Manmadhudu 2 seem quite determined to make it larger than life.

With Rakul Preet in the lead role and Nag’s daughter-in-law Samantha making a cameo appearance in the movie, the project had already a fair amount of glamour attached to its name. And now, Keerthy Suresh’s induction into the film’s cast, albeit in a cameo role, comes as the cherry on top. “Rahul and Keerthy happen to know each other personally, so he took the chance and asked her to make a small appearance in the film. She agreed!” a source says.

The film is being shot in Portugal. Some actors may return sometime this week to finish the rest of its shoot in India, added the source. With three of the best heroines appearing alongside Nagarjuna, its makers have certainly raised the bar expectations high.
