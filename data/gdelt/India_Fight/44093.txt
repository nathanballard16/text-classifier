Congress accuses govt of forcing LIC to make ‘imprudent investments’ to hide growing NPAs

NEW DELHI: Congress continued to attack the Modi government for its “brazen mismanagement” of the Indian economy with former party chief Rahul Gandhi taking a swipe at PM Modi’s “Howdy Modi” event in the US when the condition of the economy seemed “not too good”.Rahul’s economy jibe came even as Congress quoted reports of RBI and SBI to claim that the Life Insurance Corporation had been compelled to make “imprudent investments” in risky public sector banks so that the government can “hide” its growing corpus of bad debts.“‘Howdy’ economy doin’, Mr Modi? Ain’t too good it seems,” he said on Twitter, using the hashtag “HowdyEconomy,” Rahul said on Twitter.Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken referred to RBI’s Handbook of Statistics on the Indian Economy to allege that the government had forced LIC to make rash investments like a fund infusion of Rs 21,000 crore to IDBI in 2018-19, all of which was wiped out. Maken also said it was a matter of concern that the Union cabinet had approved fresh funding of Rs 9300 crore to IDBI from LIC’s corpus.“LIC’s risky investments have gone up to a historical high of Rs 10.7 lakh crore in the last five years alone. A case in point is that even when the overall benchmark sensex grew at 73% in the last five years, the BSE (S&P) PSU index where LIC invested only grew at 20%,” Maken said.The former Union minister also referred to an SBI research wing report that shows that household financial liabilities in India have more than doubled in the last five years, buttressing the opposition party’s arguments that the economic slump is taking an unprecedented toll on incomes.Quoting the SBI report, Maken said household liabilities grew from 3.30 lakh crore in 2012-13 to 7.41 lakh crore in 2017-18, an increase of 4.11 lakh crore in just five years. He also said savings had seen a 6% decline, a clear indicator that the economic situations is spiralling out of control.
