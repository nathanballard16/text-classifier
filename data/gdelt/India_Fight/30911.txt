Karan Johar, who co-judges the reality show “India’s Got Talent” along with actresses Kirron Kher and Malaika Arora, often shares behind the scene videos on social media called “Toodle”.

In one such video late on Monday, Karan was seen pulling Kirron’s leg, for wearing a traditional headgear, which was gifted to her by a contestant from Arunachal Pradesh.

Karan, too, was given one. But he had not put it on. In the video, Kirron asks why he did not, to which, the filmamaker, goofing around, said: “Because you have guts, I don’t.”

Several users on social media pointed out that Karan was being “disrespectful” towards the “Japi” — a traditional hat from Assam — which is a “symbol of respect for all the people of Assam.

Following the incident, Karan apologised with a tweet.
