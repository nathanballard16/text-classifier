The Indian release ofhas been pushed forward from April 10 to May 22, 2020, which coincides with the Eid weekend. Traditionally, the holiday slot has been dominated byfilms, this year being locked for hisdirectorialReportedly, this is the first time in a decade that a festive weekend in India has been blocked by a Hollywood film. Back in 2009, James Cameron’s visual spectacle Avatar released on Christmas alongside 3 Idiots.Trade pundits believe that the bold move will not last till the end. “The makers have booked the coveted weekend because no Hindi film has claimed the slot yet. They are sure to back out once a Hindi film is announced,” said Raj Bansal, a distributor and theatre owner in the Northern belt.He also believes that Eid is more viable for Hindi films, and that Hollywood studios should target the Christmas weekend instead. “On Eid, the business experiences a boost primarily in the tier-two and tier-three cities, as the audience there are emotional about seeing their stars on the holiday. They would relate more to a Salman Khan than a Dwayne Johnson or aon the occasion because he is synonymous with Eid,” Bansal argues.That said, the possibilities of clashes between Indian and international films in the future can’t be ruled out. “The business of Hollywood films is growing every year, which has given them the confidence to take on Hindi films in India. The process will however take some time,” he concluded.In 2015, the Daniel Craig-starrer Spectre was to release during Diwali, but was moved by a week after Salman’s P rem Ratan Dhan Payo was announced for the same date.
