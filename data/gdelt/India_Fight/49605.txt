Babu Sarkar, nephew of Najem Sarkar, another of the labourers, said: “We have heard that the militants don’t spare those who shield their targets. It took a lot for the people of Katarsu to help our people….We will be ever grateful.” Nazir Ahmad, the owner of the orchard where Bakkar and Babu worked this season, said migrant labourers like them came from Murshidabad by hundreds. “They are usually put up in tents outside the village. But after the attack last night, we decided to take the survivors to our houses.”

A pall of gloom descended on Katarsu where the labourers from Murshidabad have won praise for their hard work and integrity. “Labourers like Babu or Bakkar are so humble, so hard-working, so honest… we never hesitated to employ them. It is impossible to get such workers easily,” said an apple farmer from Kulgam. The attack has affected other orchards. Nursalem Sheikh, another labourer from Murshidabad who used to work in Chogalpora, 15km from Katarsu, was sent home by the orchard owner. “I did not risk it. I bought him a bus ticket for Jammu. Nursalem is like my own brother and I have known him for 20 years. I speak to his family. I will visit his home when I go to Calcutta next for my business,” said the owner of the orchard where Nursalem worked. In Bahalnagar, Samirul Islam of Bangla Sanskriti Mancha, which works to ensure all Bengal labourers return safely from Kashmir, said: “Even in this hour, the help these people from Bengal got in Kashmiris is exemplary.”
