NHRC to probe Hyderabad encounter

HYDERABAD: The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) will conduct a spot inquiry at the site of the “encounter” near Tondupally toll plaza in Telangana where four men suspected of raping and murdering a young veterinarian were killed by the police.Taking suo motu cognisance of the “encounter killing”, the NHRC said on Friday that it would send a team led by a senior police officer to Telangana to probe the matter. “The team will file a report soon,” NHRC said.The NHRC also issued a notice to the Telangana police seeking an explanation on the encounter. “The commission is of the opinion that this matter needs to be probed carefully,” it said and asked its director-general (investigation) to immediately send the team to conduct an on-the-spot investigation. Sources said the team, headed by an SSP rank officer, was expected to arrive at the encounter site soon.“The death of four persons in the alleged encounter with police when they were in their custody is a matter of concern,” the NHRC said in a statement. The commission has already taken cognisance of the increasing cases of rape and sexual assault on women across the country and has sought a detailed report from state governments and police heads as well as from the Union ministry of women and child development.The commission said the deceased were arrested by the police during investigation and a judgment by a competent court was yet to be pronounced. “If the arrested persons were actually guilty, they were to be punished as per law pursuant to the directions of the competent court,” it said.It said the right to life and equality before law were basic human rights recognised and granted by the Constitution.Meanwhile, People’s Watch and CPRI filed separate complaints with the NHRC to order a probe into what they called “extra-judicial killings” by the police.
