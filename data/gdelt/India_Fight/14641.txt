New Delhi: Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has revealed that the Indian military knows the identity of the Pakistani pilot whose US-made F-16 was shot down by Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s MiG-21 “Bison” on February 27. However, the defence minister refused to give further details.

Slamming Pakistan for living in a state of denial, Sitharaman said that Pakistan has a tendency of not admitting their fallen in case of conflict with India and said Islamabad will not admit having lost the F-16 or its pilot just like they didn’t acknowledge the “sacrifices” of its soldiers during the Kargil conflict.

The pilot of the downed F-16 aircraft was beaten up by local villagers in Pakistan and succumbed to his injuries in a hospital.

On Wing Commander Abhinandan, who faced mental harassment while being in Pakistan’s custody, the Minister of Defence said that his josh is high as he is extremely cool-headed. She also said that Abhinandan performed his duty and is trained to handle such extreme situations. “He bore no malice against Pakistan,” ToI quoted Sitharaman as saying.

Meanwhile, a US-based activist from Gilgit claimed today that bodies of dead terrorists were shifted to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa from Balakot after IAF’s air strikes. He also shared a video where a Pakistani Army officer can be seen talking to the families of the dead terrorists saying that he will support families of the terrorists who were “martyred” in the IAF operation.

India launched an air strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camps in Pakistan in response to the death of 40 CRPF jawans who were killed in Pulwama suicide bombing in South Kashmir.
