Hindu Mahasabha Leader Kamlesh Tiwari Who Made Controversial Remark On Prophet Mohammed, Shot Dead

Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwari was murdered in Lucknow on Friday (18 October) by unknown assailants.

As reported by Financial Express, the assailants had entered his office in the Uttar Pradesh capital on pretext of giving him a gift. After entering they repeatedly shot him before fleeing. He was rushed to a hospital but succumbed to his injuries.

The modus operendi of the murder is not yet clear as some media reports claim that he was stabbed multiple times which led to his death. Reports have also claimed that his throat was slit.

The incident happened in Lucknow’s Khurshidbagh.

Tiwari had made headlines for making a controversial remark against Prophet Mohammed in 2015 following which he was booked under the National Security Act (NSA).

Tiwari's controversial comment led to a major backlash from the Muslim community which has demanded that he be awarded the death penalty. It had also led to the Kalichak riots in West Bengal’s Malda when a protesting mob turned violent.

In the aftermath of Tiwari’s statement, an Imam from Bijnor had promised to pay Rs 51 lakh to anyone who beheaded the Hindu Mahasabha leader.
