Lok Sabha elections 2019: As voting for round 5 ends, 118 seats remain

The fifth phase of Lok Sabha elections witnessed a 63.24% turnout as 51 constituencies went to polls across seven states on Monday, according to the Election Commission (EC) of India’s Voter Turnout mobile app. Barring seven parliamentary constituencies in West Bengal and Anantnag and Ladakh in Jammu and Kashmir, this phase of election was entirely in Hindi speaking states.

The turnout for corresponding constituencies in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was 61.75%, according data provided by the EC.

Two explosions at polling stations in Pulwama in Kashmir and clashes in West Bengal were reported during Monday’s voting.

This phase is important for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as a 2019 phase-wise classification of PCs by 2014 results shows that the party and its other National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners had the highest seat share in the PCs which voted on Monday.

The fate of several key leaders including Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Union home minister Rajnath Singh, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Union minister Smriti Irani will be decided in this phase.

Over 875 million electors voted on Monday to decide the fate of 674 candidates. The EC had set up 96,088 polling booths which included the maximum of 28,072 in Uttar Pradesh.

With this phase, election is over in 424 seats and polling in the remaining 118 seats will be held on May 12 and 19. The result for all phases is scheduled on May 23.
