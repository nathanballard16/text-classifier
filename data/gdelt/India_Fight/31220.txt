MUMBAI, June 22 (Xinhua) -- One person died and another suffered minor burns after a major fire broke out Friday evening at an under-construction warship at Mazgaon Dockyard in Indian commercial center Mumbai's eastern sea-front, said a release by the dockyard.

The contract worker on the vessel succumbed possibly to asphyxia and burn injuries, said the release.

The warship caught fire at 5:44 p.m. local time and the fire has been brought under control.

An inquiry has been constituted to ascertain the cause of the fire, the release said.

The construction of the warship, a stealth guided missile destroyer, started at Mazgaon Dock in July 2018.
