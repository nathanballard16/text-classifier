Sunil Grover makes his priority clear ahead of the Lok Sabha Elections; Check it out

Indians across the world celebrated the festival of Holi with all zeal and fervour yesterday. Bollywood and TV celebs were also not behind when it came to the epic Holi celebrations and their social media accounts were the proof of the same. Popular comedian Sunil is reeling under the sadness as the festival got over and his latest tweet is a testament to the fact. He went on and tweeted how he will vote for a particular party in the coming general elections who will promise not one but 3-day Holi.

"Holi khatam! Yar holi 1 saal main 3 din honi chahiye! . Jo bhi party yeh promise karegi, mera vote usi ko !," he tweeted.

Recently, the actor-comedian was in the news as reports of him burying the hatchet with Kapil was doing rounds on the internet. A few days back, the duo was seen at Sohail Khan's bash. As per reports, during the party, they did exchange pleasantries but sat in different corners and remained cordial.

Rumours were rife that Salman did try to mend things between the two and even asked Sunil to join Kapil on The Kapil Sharma Show. When we asked Sunil about the same, he said that he is busy with his own show, Kanpur Waale Khurranas and also shooting with Bharat and that's why he didn't have the time at all to think about it.
