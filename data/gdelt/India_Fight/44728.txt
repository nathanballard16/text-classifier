New Delhi: The Delhi Excise Department on Monday made a surprise inspection of department stores in Karol Bagh, Janakpuri, Azadpur, Jahangirpuri, Dwarka, Kailash Colony and Govindpuri Extension and sealed two shops.

Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said the raids were on in many areas. The raids were being conducted on his direction.

"Two shops have been sealed over violation of rules. The Excise Department officials are raiding various department stores in Delhi," the government said.

According to a statement, when the Deputy Chief Minister visited a department store at Arya Samaj Road, Karolbagh, with the Excise Department officials at 7.30 p.m, he noticed of all the items being sold, almost 90 per cent were beer and wine. "It was being sold openly, whereas only 15 per cent beer and wine can be sold at a department store as per the rules."

The Deputy Chief Minister directed the officials to seal the shop immediately.

"They were running wine and beer shops in the name of department stores. Delhi has 125 department stores with licence to keep 15 per cent of wine/beer. The highest limit of refrigeration allowed in such stores is of 300 litres," Sisodia said.

He said the action was taken after complaints were received that liquor shops were being run in the name of department stores.
