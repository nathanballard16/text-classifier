'Was Rajiv Gandhi's assassination accident?' VK Singh hits back at Digvijaya Singh for Pulwama terror attack remarks

Digvijaya Singh courted controversy after he termed the Pulwama attack an “accident” and said that “doubts” are being expressed in some foreign media reports over the February 26 IAF strike.

Two days after seeking evidence to prove terrorist casualties in Indian airstrikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) training camp in Pakistan's Balakot, senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh on Tuesday termed the Pulwama terror attack as an "accident."

In a series of tweets in Hindi, the former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister said foreign media was raising questions over airstrikes in Pakistan following "Pulwama accident" and this was putting a question mark on the credibility of the Indian government.

This came amid various opposition leaders asking the government to put in public evidence to back claims of terrorist casualties in anti-terror strike.
