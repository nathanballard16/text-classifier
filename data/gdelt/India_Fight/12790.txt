`Pak refuses to open gate at Poonch’

POONCH, Mar 4: Although the Samjhauta Express train services between Lahore and Delhi were restored yet cross LoC bus service in Poonch remained suspended as Pakistan refused to open the Rah-e-Milan Gate at Chakkan Da Bagh on Monday.

“The cross LoC bus carrying passengers left Chakkan Da Bagh in Poonch for Rawlakote today, but after Pakistan army did not open the gate on the Zero point, the bus had to return to Chakkan Da Bagh,” an official said.

The weekly service was earlier suspended following escalating tensions between the two nations after the Pulwama terror attack on 14 February in which 44 CRPF personnel lost their lives. But it was subsequently resumed. The tension between the two nations, however, escalated following the Indian Air Force's attacks on Jaish-e-Mohammed's training camp at Balakot in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province on February 26.

A day later, on February 27, Pakistani fighter jets had violated Indian air space in Nowshera sector of Rajouri district. Following which, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman had shot down a Pakistani F-16 before he was downed and captured by Pakistan army personnel. Abhinandan was later handed over to Indian authorities on March 1 at the Wagah-Attari border.

Earlier in the day, India and Pakistan exchanged heavy fire and shelling in Akhnoor area of Jammu. Later in the evening, cross-border shelling resumed in Poonch district also after a lull for two days.
