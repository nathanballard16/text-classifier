Indian Air Force Aircraft Force Pakistani F-16s To Retreat After Being Detected Flying Close To Border Near Punjab

As a direct consequence, Indian Air Force (IAF) scrambled its Sukhoi Su-30MKI and Mirage 2000 jets which resulted in the Pakistani jets retreating into their territory.

As per an India Today report, it is still unclear whether the Pakistani jets were trying to intrude into Indian territory, but their objective could have been to detect Indian troop movement near the border as they were accompanied by a drone.

This development comes a month after the IAF conducted air strikes in Pakistan’s Balakot thereby reportedly eliminating around 200 to 300 terrorists. This led to a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani jets a day later which resulted in a Pakistani F-16 being shot down and India losing a MiG-21 Bison.
