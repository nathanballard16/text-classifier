Even transferring the first Rs 2000 a tough task: Experts on govt's farmers' income plan

"Irrespective of whether the amount of Rs 6,000 per family a year would be adequate or not or the same is a judicious decision, implementation would be a major issue and may face lot of legal hurdles after a recent Supreme Court judgement on ownership," Supreme Court senior advocate N K Poddar said here at an interactive session organised by the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce.

Kolkata: The Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi, the farmers' income support initiative announced by the Centre in the interim budget, may face major roadblocks including legal ones during its implementation phase, experts said Saturday. To woo distressed farmers ahead of the general elections, the Centre has announced direct income support of Rs 6,000 per year to those holding cultivable land up to two hectare. The Centre had said it would benefit 12 crore farmers and cost the exchequer Rs 75,000 crore annually.
