Masood Azhar secretly released from Pak jail

: The Intelligence Bureau has alerted the government about the deployment of additional Pakistani troopers along the India-Pakistan border near Rajasthan and said Islamabad is planning a big action and has released a wanted terrorist for terror operations, according to two officials aware of the developments.

Amid rising tensions between the two countries, the IB input said Pakistan has secretly released Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Masood Azhar to plan terrorist operations while other terror organisations were also working openly. There were uncorroborated reports after the February 14 car bomb attack in Jammu and Kashmirs Pulwama that Pakistani agencies had taken Azhar into protective custody.

JeM took responsibility for the attack in which 40 paramilitary troopers were killed and prompted India to carry airstrikes on the groups camp in Pakistans Balakot on February 26.

One of the officials cited above said Pakistans spy agency, Inter-Services Intelligence, had no inkling that the Indian government would revoke Article 370 on August 5. It is being considered the ISIs biggest intelligence failure in history and now they are under pressure to act, the official said on condition of anonymity.
