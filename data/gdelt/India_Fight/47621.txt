Ashok Tanwar extends support to JJP

New Delhi Oct 16 : Former Haryana Congress chief Ashok Tanwar on Wednesday extended his support to Jananayak Janta Party (JJP) in the upcoming Assembly polls.

The JJP was floated by Dushyant Chautala, the estranged grandson of Former Chief Minister of Haryana O.P. Chautala.

Ashok Tanwar and Dushyant Chautala addressed a joint press conference, where the former alleged that he has been ignored in the Congress.

Tanwar added he will support the JJP on the seats where the party has winning candidate, and the two young leaders pledged to provide an alternative to the people of the state.

Dushyant Chautala has welcomed Ashok Tanwar's decision.

With Tanwar resigning from the Congress -- a move that seems to dent the party further in the state -- the grand old has been pushing for Dalit-Jat combination pitching Kumari Selja as President with former Chief Minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda at helm of affairs.

The former Haryana Congress president even alleged that tickets were sold in the party.

In run-up to the polls, while JJP helmed by Dushyant Chautala is trying to influence the Jat voters, who were traditional voters of INLD, Congress is battling on two fronts -- one with BJP and other its turncoats.
