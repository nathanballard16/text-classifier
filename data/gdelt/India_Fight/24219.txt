Actor Prakash Raj Confident Of Coalition Govt At Centre

New Delhi: Versatile actor Prakash Raj said that the next government would be formed by a consortium of parties in the true spirit of federalism as propounded by the makers of the Constitution. He said there was no way Congress and BJP can secure a majority and form a government at the Centre.

Speaking to press persons on the sidelines of campaigning for Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi, he pointed out that people had already seen the ill effects of giving complete majority to a single party in the last years under the BJP rule. He showered praises on the work of Aam Aadmi Party in Delhi on education, health and welfare fronts, and asked other regional parties to emulate the AAP’s model of development.

He expressed hope that the efforts made by Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekar Rao to unite the regional parties and form a federal front would come to fruition soon. He questioned how the BJP could stoop so low in politics that it had to field the terror accused Pragya Thakur as its MP candidate.

On the issue of his candidature from Bangalore Central parliamentary constituency, he exuded confidence that he would emerge victorious. The actor plunged into electoral politics as an independent candidate after his friend and senior journalist Gauri Lankesh was killed by right wing groups in Karnataka.
