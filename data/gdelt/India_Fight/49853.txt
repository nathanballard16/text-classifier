Delhi Police trail thief to bust entire gang

A month after four burglars allegedly broke into a head constable’s house in Saket, police arrested the gang after a brief shootout in Mayur Vihar Friday. The accused have been involved in more than 94 cases of burglary in South Delhi and other areas.

The complainant, head constable Rajesh Kumar, said the men broke into his house when he and his family were away.

DCP (South) Atul Kumar Thakur said the accused, Wasim, was identified after a sketch was made with the help of neighbours. An officer said, “We found that they were involved in several burglaries. They would use their WagonR and target government quarters and DDA flats.”

“We wanted to arrest the entire gang so we tracked their car and planted a GPS device. On Friday, we found they were going to commit another burglary and arrested them,” said Thakur.
