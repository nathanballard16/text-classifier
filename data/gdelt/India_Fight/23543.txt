The crew of Rajinikanth and Nayanthara's Darbar attacked by college students with stones? Find out here

Rajinikanth's Darbar in trouble after being attacked on set?

The shoot of Rajinikanth’s Darbar isn’t going as smooth as the producers would have expected it to go. Rajinikanth and Nayanthara were shooting for the film in Mumbai at a college and according to reports, the crew was attacked by a bunch of students. Apparently, a couple of college students were taking photos and videos of the actors who were busy shooting which didn’t go down too well with the crew. Nobody was allowed near the shoot location and angered by the crew members, students started pelting stones at the shoot location. No official confirmation or announcement on the incident has been given by the producers.

A report in India Today said that director AR Murugadoss is not planning to change the location of the shoot after the unwanted friction between the college students and the crew. Rajinikanth started shooting for the film with the Mumbai schedule and arrived here last month for the same. The crew began shooting for the movie with a puja. Nayanthara, who is the female lead in this cop drama, also joined Thalaivar at the shoot later on. Yogi Babu, Kathir and Vivek also play pivotal roles in the movie and it’s definitely going to be one massy entertainer.

Darbar is scheduled to release during Pongal 2020 and will have Thalaivar playing the role of a cop after more than two decades. Fans are pretty excited for the film since they loved Rajinikanth and Nayanthara’s onscreen chemistry in Chandramukhi. The last time Thalaiavar was in Mumbai was when he was shooting for Kaala Karikalan, which got mixed response from critics but fans loved it. Anirudh Ravichander will be composing music for the film. He had also made music for Rajinikanth’s last film, Petta, which received a great response from fans. Stay tuned with us for more updates.
