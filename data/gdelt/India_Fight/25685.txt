Asus takes a dig on OnePlus 7 with a new teaser of Zenfone 6

Asus India took a dig on OnePlus latest smartphone, the OnePlus 7, with a new teaser. The company posted a new teaser about its upcoming Zenfone 6 smartphone while taking a pot shot on OnePlus 7’s battery capacity. The brand is all set to launch the smartphone today.

Asus India posted a tweet on its official handle that reads, “5000 > 1+7+3700, so why choose ordinary when you can #DefyOrdinary? #ZenFone6.” Asus is basically targeting the 3700mAh battery present in the OnePlus 7 while claiming that the upcoming smartphone will be equipped with a much bigger battery backup. The company has confirmed that the Zenfone 6 will feature a 5000mAh battery.

However, if recent leaks are believed to be true then Asus might introduce a flip camera, which could more or less similar to the one present in the Samsung Galaxy A80.

Recollecting some key rumoured specifications, the Zenfone 6 will feature a 6.3-inch full HD+ display with 2340×1080 pixel resolution. It will be powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 processor coupled with 4GB/8GB/12GB RAM and 128GB/256GB/512GB ROM storage.
