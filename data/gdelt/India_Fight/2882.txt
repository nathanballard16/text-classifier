NDMC 2009 bylaws: Supreme Court quashes North Delhi civic body's 2009 bylaws, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

NEW DELHI: In a major relief to property owners in areas under New Delhi Municipal Council NDMC ), the Supreme Court on Tuesday struck down the municipal body’s 2009 bylaws, under which it was empowered to charge property tax even on vacant land.The bylaws introduced the system of Unit Area Method (UAM). As per this method, Unique Area Value (UAV) per sq ft/meter of a property is fixed with reference to its characteristics such as location, occupancy, age and structure. This UAV is then multiplied by the area of the vacant land or covered space to arrive at its annual value on which the property tax is to be paid.A bench of Justices A K Sikri and Ashok Bhushan said UAM is a better method in comparison with the earlier one based on annual rent, but held that such methodology is not provided in NDMC Act and quashed it. It upheld Delhi high court order which had struck down the bylaws.“We agree with HC that the impugned bylaws that provide UAM based on value of the property ... are foreign to the methodology provided in Section 63 of the NDMC Act. Such bylaws are, thus, ultra vires the provisions of NDMC Act,” it said.Noting that over 95% of the property owners were agreeable to pay the tax as per the 2009 bylaws, and even paid the taxes on that basis during the pendency of the case in the last nine years, the court said their assessment would not be reopened to refund the money and the benefit would be given only to those who had challenged NDMC decision in HC.“In these circumstances, to upset the apple cart completely may not be appropriate. In such a situation, in exercise of powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, we direct that those assessees who have paid the tax as per bylaws 2009, their assessments shall not be reopened. Another reason for taking this course of action is that these assessees are satisfied with the assessments under bylaws, 2009. However, it will not apply to the those who were the writ petitioners in HC,” it said.
