India won’t tolerate provocation from Pakistan: Rajnath Singh

PUNE: Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said the surgical strike across the Line of Control in 2016 and the Balakot air strike in 2019 show that India won't tolerate any provocation.India has never had any territorial ambitions, the minister said while addressing cadets after reviewing the passing out parade of the 137th course at the National Defence Academy (NDA) in Khadakwasla near Pune.Pakistan has realised that it will never win a conventional war against India and has since resorted to a proxy war It will get nothing but defeat, Singh said. “Pakistan was defeated in 1948,1965, 1971 and 1999. This shows it will never win any conventional or limited war with India,” he said.India has always accorded importance to cordial and friendly relations with foreign countries, the minister added.The government was committed to the sovereignty of the nation and security of its people. “But if someone runs terror camps and attempts to attack our country, we will give them a stern reply,” he added.Singh said terrorism has become a global phenomenon. “We have witnessed 9/11 and 26/11. The Indian Army and security forces have fought against such attacks time and again,” he said.On the new challenges for the security agencies, the minister said, “ Cyberwar and tactics are being used to spread an ideology full of hatred. But our forces are equipped and trained to counter these challenges.”Emphasizing the contributions of the armed forces, Singh said, “The world has seen and experienced the professionalism of the Indian forces during humanitarian crises or in the event of a threat to global harmony.”Singh also reminded the cadets that it was their duty to safeguard the Constitution, the common thread that connected the military’s leadership to civilian leadership.The government has been focusing on defence development and diplomacy which has helped isolate Pakistan, he added.
