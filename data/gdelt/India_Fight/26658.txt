GUWAHATI: Suspected National Socialist Council of Nagaland (Isak-Muivah) militants shot and killed an Arunachal Pradesh legislator and 10 others after waylaying his convoy of four vehicles in the frontier state's Tirap district on Tuesday morning. The dead legislator, Tirong Aboh, belonged to the National People's Party (NPP) and was a candidate for Khonsa West in the just-concluded assembly poll.Earlier, he had won the seat as a candidate of the People's Party of Arunachal, which he later left to join NPP."Aboh's convoy was waylaid between Deomali and Bogapani and they shot him, his teenage son, Longgem, two bodyguards and seven others," an Arunachal Police officer said. The spot of the attack is 15km from the Assam-Arunachal border. "Aboh was going to Khonsa from Dibrugarh," he added. "The militants struck around 11.30am. They fired from close range. All those killed were found dead in their seats. Some of them had their seatbelts fastened." The attackers also set one vehicle on fire before leaving the site. Two of the dead were yet to be identified."One of the injured bodyguards and a supporter were taken to Assam Medical College in Dibrugarh. One woman supporter and another bodyguard escaped unhurt," he said. Security agency sources said, "Aboh was known as a no-nonsense politician and often received threats from the NSCN (I-M) for his opposition to their presence in Arunachal."
