An online petition has been filed urging UNICEF to remove Priyanka Chopra as a goodwill ambassador following her tweet lauding the Indian armed forces.

Priyanka posted a tweet saying "Jai Hind #IndianArmedForces" on the same day Indian fighter jets intruded Pakistan's airspace.

According to TMZ, the petition states, "War between two nuclear powers can only lead to destruction & death. As goodwill ambassador of UNICEF, Priyanka Chopra was supposed to stay neutral & peaceful but her tweet in favour of Indian arm forces after they invaded Pakistan airspace shows otherwise. She doesn’t deserve this title anymore."



Several had also commented on her tweet asking for her removal as UNICEF goodwill ambassador.

Priyanka has worked with UNICEF since 2006 and was appointed as the national and global UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador for Child Rights in 2010 and 2016, respectively.



Several Bollywood actors lauded the Indian Air Force and advocated war as tensions between India and Pakistan escalated in the aftermath of the Pulwama attack.
