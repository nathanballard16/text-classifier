The six dead included three civilians, one police officer and both shooters, authorities said.The four-hour gun battle at the Jewish JC Kosher Supermarket erupted after the pair shot the police officer at a nearby cemetery, which they fled in a white van.“They exited the van and they proceeded to attack this location in a targeted manner,” Jersey city public safety director James Shea told a morning news conference. “With the amount of ammunition they had, we have to assume they would have continued attacking human beings if we hadn’t been there.”The NYT reported that a suspect involved in the shooting had posted anti-Semitic and anti-police messages online. Jersey city mayor Steven Fulop ordered police to be on high alert to protect Jewish neighbourhoods following the attack.
