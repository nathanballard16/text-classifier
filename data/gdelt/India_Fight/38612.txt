Stunning pictures of ‘Gandhi Baat’ fame Anveshi Jain

Mumbai: Gandi Baat fame Anveshi Jain never feared taking risks in her career. It’s because of the tough choices she made that Jain is today considered one of the most experimental artists in the industry.

Anveshi Jain is nowadays busy shooting for the new Volkswagen show. It was her love for racing cars that made her take this project.

Talking about working in a film that would center around bikes, cars, and racing, Anveshi stated, “What matters the most to me is a good script. I won’t mind working in a film which has bikes, cars or racing for that matter, but the script needs to be fabulous. Having said that, I would be more than happy to work in Dhoom or Singham franchise’s next. Also, I am willing to work with Rohit Shetty as he makes the kind of movies I love.”

Besides the show, Anveshi Jain is gearing up for the release of her Gujarati debut. Moreover, shoot for her Bollywood debut movie will start by the end of 2019.
