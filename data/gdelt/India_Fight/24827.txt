Lok Sabha Election 2019: Advantage BJP in Delhi as AAP, Congress battle for spoils

The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress are playing a blame game over the issue. The West Delhi constituency primarily is a Jaat belt area with some parts occupied by the migrant population. The national capital is all set for a triangular fight between Congress, BJP and AAP in all seven Lok Sabha constituencies, going to polls in the sixth phase on May 12. The seat which has witnessed the dominance of Congress since its inception, will this time see a clash between two veterans from BJP and Congress. However, as per Congress president Rahul Gandhi, the party was interested in forming an alliance only in Delhi while the AAP party leaders wanted it in Punjab and Haryana too.
