Boy, 12, among six killed in fresh Kashmir clashes

SRINAGAR, INDIA (AFP) - A 12-year-old boy was among six people killed in three separate gun battles between rebels and security forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the police and army said on Friday (March 22).

Clashes have continued to rage in the restive mountainous region since the death of 40 Indian troops in a suicide bombing last month provoked tit-for-tat air strikes between India and Pakistan.

The boy was killed after militants became trapped in his home in the northern town of Hajin and engaged in a two-day gun battle ending on Friday, police told AFP. His father managed to escape.

The firefight left two suspected rebels dead. Another died in clashes in Gadapur village in the south of the restive Kashmir valley, army spokesman Colonel Rajesh Kalia said.

Two more militants were "eliminated" late on Thursday in the frontier district of Baramulla. One soldier and two policemen were also injured.

Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in 1947. Both claim it in full and have fought two wars over the territory.

The Feb 14 suicide blast was claimed by a militant group based in Pakistan, and New Delhi has long accused Islamabad of backing a 30-year insurgency that has left tens of thousands of people dead, mostly civilians.
