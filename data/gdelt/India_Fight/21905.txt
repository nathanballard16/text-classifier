Mumbai stands by its martyr

Mumbaikars from across age groups gathered at the 26/11 memorial outside the Police Gymkhana on Tuesday to condemn the recent derogatory remark about Hemant Karkare by Malegaon blasts accused Pragya Singh Thakur.

Ms. Thakur, who is the BJP’s candidate from Bhopal, had said last week that Karkare, who was the chief of the Maharashtra Anti Terrorism Squad at the time of his demise, died due to his karma, and because she had placed a curse on him. Her statement attracted widespread criticism from police personnel and civilians.

Former Bombay High Court judge Abhay Thipsay, who was part of the protest, said, “We have assembled peacefully and spontaneously for our martyr. This shocking statement shows the level of Ms. Thakur’s IQ. Despite all this, if she wins the elections, it will be nothing short of shameful.”

Around 100 protesters lit candles as a mark of respect to Karkare, who was shot down by Ajmal Kasab and Abu Ismail on the night of November 26, 2008.

“Ms. Thakur said the police subjected her to third degree torture, which is absolutely false. We demand that the BJP and the Election Commission of India cancel her nomination. By making her a candidate, the BJP has shown where it is taking our country,” said lawyer Abha Singh, whose husband YP Singh is a retired IPS officer.

Aditi Jain, one of the protesters, said, “Karkare was our hero who lived and died for us. It is shameful that someone accused of terror charges says this about him.”

Another protester, Sanjeev Batra, said, “Ms. Thakur is trying to spread communal hatred in the country and today we are here to tell her we won’t let her do this. If Karkare sacrificed his life for us, this is the least we can do for him.” The protest was organised through word of mouth and through messages circulated via Facebook and WhatsApp.
