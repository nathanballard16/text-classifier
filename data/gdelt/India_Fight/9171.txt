Shabir Shah ‘fit and fine’ in Tihar jail: MHA

Authorities have denied any untoward incident or mishap involving the separatist leader: Home Ministry

Tihar prison authorities in Delhi have informed the Ministry of Home Affairs that Kashmiri separatist leader Shabir Shah is “fit and fine.”

“Tihar prison authorities have denied occurrence of any untoward incident or mishap involving Shabir Shah,” a statement by the Ministry said.

Mr. Shah was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in July 2017 in a decade-old terror financing case. He has been logged in Tihar prison since.

“Refuting fake news circulating in a section of media, DIG Tihar Prison, Shailendra Parihar, said Shah is absolutely fit and fine. He said all other inmates from J&K and Pakistan are also fine. The prison authorities appealed to all to be cautious against fake news,” the statement said.

After the Centre moved additional 10,000 armed forces to the Kashmir Valley, there were rumours that Mr. Shah was beaten in the prison.

Post-Pulwama terror attack where 40 CRPF personnel were killed by a car-borne suicide bomber, the Jammu and Kashmir administration had withdrawn the security cover of other separatist leaders and arrested hundreds of Jamat-e-Islami members.
