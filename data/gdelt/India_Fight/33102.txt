1 more held in car dealer murder case

Coimbatore: The Podanur police on Tuesday arrested one more accused in connection with the murder of R Paranthaman, 37, a car dealer, on April 18.

P Bharathi, 24, was arrested near his home in Sathyamangalam and remanded.

A police officer said, “Bharathi has a case against him in Sathyamangalam. He was working as an acting driver and had connections with anti-social elements.” Police also seized a car from him.

Eight people were already arrested in the case.

Paranthaman, a resident of Meena Estate in Sowripalayam, on the day of the Lok Sabha election (April18) cast his vote and was returning to his office on Chettipalayam-Eachanari Road.

A six-member gang, which had followed him, barged into the office and had hacked Paranthaman to death. They had also stolen Rs2lakh and a gold bracelet.

Inquiries had revealed that Ravi, 30, a native of Vyasarpadi from Chennai, who was running a car dealership at Goldwins in Chinniyampalayam in the district, had hacked Paranthaman to death due to business rivalry. He was arrested on April 21. The other seven accused were arrested over the past two months. Police are on the lookout for two more accused in the case.
