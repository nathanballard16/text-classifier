Woman shot in face after she stops dancing at wedding

LUCKNOW, Dec 6 (Agencies): A woman was shot in the face after she stopped dancing at a wedding in Uttar Pradesh's Chitrakoot. The horrifying incident was caught on camera.

The incident occurred on December 1 during a performance at the wedding of village head Sudhir Singh Patel's daughter.

The video shows the young woman, who was part of a dancing group, on the stage with a co-performer.

A man in an inebriated condition is heard saying, "Goli chal jayegi (shots will be fired)," as soon as the woman stops dancing.

"Sudhir bhaiya, aap goli chala hi do (Brother, you should fire the bullet)," another man is heard saying. Suddenly, the woman is shot, taking everybody by surprise. The bullet hits her face. One of the village head's family members had reportedly shot at the woman.

The woman has been admitted to a hospital in Kanpur.

The groom's maternal uncles, Mithilesh and Akhilesh, who were on the stage, were also injured in the firing, according to the police.

The groom's paternal uncle Ram Pratap filed a first information report against an unknown man.

"We are trying to arrest the accused. We are making all the efforts to bring the culprit to justice," senior police officer Ankit Mittal said.

It may be recalled that in a similar incident in 2016, a 25-year-old dancer was killed in celebratory firing during a wedding in Bathinda in Punjab.

Kulwinder Kaur, who was pregnant, was shot in the stomach while performing on stage. She had died on the spot.
