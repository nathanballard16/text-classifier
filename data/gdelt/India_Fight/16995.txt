Farooq Abdullah files nomination papers, vowed to fight “communal forces”

SRINAGAR: Seeking a fourth term to Lok Sabha from the prestigious Srinagar, National Conference (NC) president Farooq Abdullah Monday filed nomination papers

Accompanied by his son and NC vice-president Omar Abdullah to the office of the returning officer, the 83-year-old NC president filed his nomination papers.

Speaking to media-persons, Abdullah vowed to fight “communal forces” in the country.

“I am still young and have to do a lot of work. We have to save our country from communal forces. Our fight is against communal forces,” said the former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister.

“Except for destruction, they (the BJP-led government) have nothing to offer. I don’t think they can offer anything if they return to power. Their agenda is destruction,” Abdullah told.

He also targeted the former Anantnag MP and Peoples Democratic Party president Mehbooba Mufti for not raising the state’s concerns in Parliament and said, “We saw such candidates who failed to highlight issues concerning our state in the top most House of people, on the contrary they spoke of New Delhi in Kashmir.”

Srinagar is going to polls in the second phase of the general election on April 18.
