The Luv Ranjan rom com will be the fourth for both together and will bring them together after almost four years. According to reports in Time Of India, a source close to the development said, “The film is a romantic comedy and both the actors have not only given the nod but also allotted dates from February onwards. While Deepika is also handling dual roles as an actress and a producer with films like Chhapaak and ’83 coming up, Ranbir has been shooting for Shamshera and Brahmastra, and has already allotted his dates. Ranbir and Deepika’s reunion in a TV commercial for a paint brand has reinforced the belief in their chemistry, and thus they will be doing their fourth film together after Bachna Ae Haseeno, Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani and Tamasha.”

The film reportedly also stars Ajay Devgn. Everyone is waiting for things to get official and the announcements to come out soon.

Meanwhile, Deepika and Ranbir were last seen together in Imtiaz Ali directorial Tamasha in 2015 and were loved and praised for their unique chemistry.
