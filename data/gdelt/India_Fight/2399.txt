Pakistan's ISI-backed terror module busted, 3 arrested

Two suspects were arrested from Delhi, while one was arrested in Kerala.

A Pakistan-Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) terror module was busted with the arrest of three people from Delhi and Kerala.

The special cell of the Delhi Police has arrested three suspects, including an Afghan national, for planning to kill senior Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) leaders in Karnataka's Mangaluru, with a motive of causing riots in the country. They also had several dignitaries from Delhi on their list.

The three suspects have been identified as Sonu alias Tahsim, Riayujdeen and Wali Mohammed Afghan.

Wanted mobster Dawood Ibrahim's D-Company was allegedly behind the conspiracy to kill the political leaders.

One of the arrested suspects purportedly worked for a close aide of Dawood Ibrahim - Ghulam Rasool Patty. Dawood Ibrahim is suspected to have been hiding in Pakistan.

The arrested operative is suspected of being the mastermind behind this plot. The suspect had fled after the Gujarat riots. The same person was also been accused of being involved in BJP leader Haren Pandya's assassination.

Four months ago, an Indian agency intercepted his phone calls, which revealed his plans for targeting RSS leaders at several places, including South India. Following this, two suspects were arrested from Delhi, while one was arrested in Kerala.

These terror operatives were reportedly in constant touch with their Pakistan-based handlers and had also acquired weapons for implementing their plan.

On the basis of input and technical analysis, the police transpired that a deep-rooted conspiracy was hatched by ISI and its operatives in India to infuse terror in the minds of people for creating instability in the country. Police have now launched an in depth investigation in the matter.
