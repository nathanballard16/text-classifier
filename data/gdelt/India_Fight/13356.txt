Indian Air Force's Satellite Pics Prove Raid Into Pakistan Successful - Report

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has provided the government with radar imagery and high-resolution satellite images of the reported air raid on a terror training camp inside Pakistan following a prior report that had cast doubt on the Indian military's claims.

The Press Trust of India, the country's biggest news agency, quoted security sources as saying that the government received all the "evidence" of the 26 February bombing raid on the facilities of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) near the town of Balakot in northeast Pakistan.

This evidence reportedly showed that Indian S-2000 laser-guided bombs had pierced the targeted buildings, exploding inside and causing "significant damage".
