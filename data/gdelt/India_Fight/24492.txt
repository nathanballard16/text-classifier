HC upholds life sentence for murder

Says accused was of sound mind when he committed the crime

MADURAI

Taking cognisance of the fact that a worker convicted of the murder of his employer was of sound mind at the time of occurrence, the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court upheld the life sentence awarded to him by a lower court.

The court was hearing the appeal preferred by A. Davidson against the life sentence awarded to him by Nagercoil Sessions Court. The appellant worked under the deceased, Thangappan, as a daily wage worker. In 2013, Davidson trespassed into Thagappan’s house and stabbed him to death after he was not assured of regular employment.

He had also threatened to attack Thangappan’s wife, if she interfered. Hearing the cries for help from the employer’s wife, the neighbours rushed to the scene and nabbed Davidson. After a complaint was lodged with Thuckalay police, a case was registered for murder and trespass under the Indian Penal Code.

During the course of hearing, it was argued that Davidson was suffering from Bipolar Affective Disorder and therefore he was entitled for the benefit of exception under Section 84 (Act of a person of unsound mind) of the Indian Penal Code.

A Division Bench of Justices P. N. Prakash and B. Pugalendhi took cognisance of the fact that it was only subsequent to the occurrence of the offence that Davidson was suffering from the disorder. When the accused was questioned about the incriminating materials, he is said to have narrated the incident. Also, at the time of occurrence, Davidson had not made any plea for exception on the basis of the disorder.

The court said that this revealed that he was of sound mind at the time of occurrence of the incident. Therefore, the benefit of exception under Section 84 of the IPC could not be extended to the appellant, it said, and dismissed the criminal appeal.
