Mother Teresa’s Former Assistant Mark Bloomfield Killed In Bar Fight

Mother Teresa's former assistant died in the hospital from injuries he sustained during a bar fight in the United Kingdom. 54-year-old Mark Bloomfield was injured during a fight at the Full Moon Public House in Swansea last week.

Authorities have not released many details about the fight but did say they have charged a 61-year-old male with causing grievous bodily harm. Authorities also detained a 21-year-old man and a 50-year-old woman in connection with the assault. They were later released, but officials say they are still under investigation.

Bloomfield's family issued a statement through the South Wales Police Department remembering his legacy of helping people during his time in India working with Mother Teresa.

"Mark Bloomfield built a legacy that will continue to live on in the countless lives that he encountered. As special assistant to Mother Teresa in Calcutta, he was an essential contributor to her mission and to those she cared for.

In India, he organized free cataract surgery camps and founded schools that gave rare access to education for girls. In Africa, he helped preserve wild game by introducing ultralight aircraft to combat the onslaught of poachers.

He will be remembered for all of this and more by his mother and three siblings."
