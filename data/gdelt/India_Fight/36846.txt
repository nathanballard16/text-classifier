Given info on IndiGo's dealings with Bhatia group companies to authorities: Rakesh Gangwal

NEW DELHI: The bitter battle between IndiGo promoters -- Rahul Bhatia and Rakesh Gangwal -- is not over as yet. Gangwal on Tuesday said he has given information regarding the airline's related party transactions (RPT) with Bhatia family-controlled InterGlobe Enterprises (IGE) Group companies to "relevant authorities". Gangwal had earlier this month complained to market regulator SEBI about these RPTs, among other control issues."I have provided this information to the relevant authorities. I wish people had the conviction to be quoted and not hide behind the veil of so called unnamed 'sources' to spread a false narrative," Gangwal said in a statement.This, he said, came as a fallout of unnamed people connected to IGE earlier claiming that there was "not a shred of evidence to substantiate allegations on RPTs between the airline and IGE because there are no whistleblowers as claimed by Gangwal and that "regulators had been seeking similar information for the past 10 days and none has been forthcoming." Gangwal issued the statement on Tuesday to "address this canard."While comments from IGE were sought after Gangwal's latest missive on Tueaday and are awaited, the group had earlier this month said on the issue of RPTs that the same were disclosed at the time of IPO in 2015 and “materiality of the transactions for (IndiGo) is not significant as… it is only 0.53% of (IndiGo’s) consolidated turnover for FY 2018-19.”The IGE comments had come after Gangwal in early July complained to SEBI, saying: “I hadn’t contemplated that over the years, Bhatia would start building an ecosystem of other companies that would enter into dozens of related party transactions with IndiGo. We are not against RPTs as long as proper checks and balances exist and such RPTs are in the best interest of the company. Beyond just questionable RPTs, various fundamental governance norms and laws are not being adhered to…”A statement by IGE on July 10 had said RPTs exist in four areas — real estate leased to IGAL; simulator training facilities; general sales agents (GSAs for limited foreign markets only) and crew accommodation at Accor Hotels.The total value of RPTs in these four areas with IndiGo was Rs 150.1 crore in FY 2018-19, representing 0.53% of IndiGo’s consolidated revenue. And about Rs 119 crore in FY 2017-18, representing 0.5% of IndiGo’s consolidated turnover, the group had said.
