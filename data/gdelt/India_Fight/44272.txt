Six Booked for Cow Slaughter After Hindu Outfit Threatens Mass Suicide in UP

New Delhi: After three cows were found slaughtered in Agra, six men have been booked under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act 1955, according to a TOI report on Wednesday.

Three cows were found slaughtered early on Wednesday morning near a graveyard in the Kothi meena bazar area of Shahganj police station.

The issue was brought to light by members of the Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha who met deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma urging him to direct the police to book the accused. The Hindu outfit threatened that if their demand is not met, they will ‘commit suicide’ outside the police station.

“We will commit suicide outside the police station if the accused are not arrested in 24 hours. We met the deputy CM and informed him about the situation,” Sanjay Jat, national chairperson of the Akhil Bhartiya Hindu Mahasabha told the English daily.

The Agra police has said that it will arrest the accused soon. The accused have been identified as Pucchi, Sharif, Moin, Afzal, Rizwan and one unknown.

In February this year, the Agra police had arrested seven men for slaughtering goats and lambs. The meat was to be prepared for a wedding function.

Under the Uttar Pradesh Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act 1955, there is a ban on slaughter of cow, bull and bullock. Violation can invite a maximum prison sentence of seven years and a fine of ten thousand rupees.
