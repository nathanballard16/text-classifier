Three More Arrested in Churi-shop Owner Murder Case

Patna: Two days after criminals gunned down a churi-shop owner in Kadam Kuan in Patna, police nabbed two more accused in the case bringing the total number of arrests in the case to three.

Authorities arrested Rahul and Bhawani from their homes in Mithapur under Jakkanpur police station on late Sunday night in the killing of shop-owner Deepak Kumar Sahni who was first beaten up and stabbed multiple times outside his shop by four men on Saturday night before being shot to death.

Talking to reporters in Patna on Monday, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manu Maharaj said that a team of police led by Town DSP Suresh Kumar, Kadam Kuan police station in-charge Nishikant Nish, and Special Cell constable Vinay Prakash had carried out raids that resulted in the arrest of Rahul and Bhawani, both of whom are also said to have churi (bangle) shops in the same Churi Market.

A third person, also named Deepak, was arrested shortly after the crime was committed on Saturday evening. He remains in the police custody.

According to Bhawani, the murdered victim had beaten him up a few days ago while his henchmen made a video of his thrashing. Deepak then uploaded the video on YouTube and those who saw it, started to make fun of Bhawani.

He then hatched the plan to teach Deepak a lesson which ended with his killing, the SSP told the reporters.
