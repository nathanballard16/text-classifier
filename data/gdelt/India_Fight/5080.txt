Chandrababu Naidu, Mamata plan ‘dharnas’ in Delhi next week

NEW DELHI: As the last session of the 16th Lok Sabha draws to a close next Wednesday, opposition parties have planned a string of protests against the Narendra Modi government in the capital as they prepare for the big electoral battle ahead.The protests will begin on Monday when Andhra Pradesh chief minister and TDP chief N Chandrababu Naidu flies into Delhi for a day-long dharna (sit-in) at the Andhra Bhavan premises along with his party colleagues to seek ‘special status’ for the state. Leaders of several opposition parties which are part of the platform to combat the ruling BJP are likely to call on the TDP chief, making it a rallying point.Naidu’s show will be followed by a “dharna” by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee on February 13 and 14 as the Trinamool Congress chief plans to shift the arena after her protest in Kolkata earlier this week over CBI’s move against the city police commissioner. This will part of her battle against the Centre on the issue of “attack on federalism”.When Mamata staged a sudden dharna in support of the Kolkata police commissioner whom CBI wanted to question in connection with chit fund scams, most of the opposition leaders stood by her with some even visiting the venue. The issue seemed to have provided a new glue to the 22-odd parties to rally against the Modi government.
