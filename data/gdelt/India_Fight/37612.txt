Sonbhadra violence: Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath removes District Magistrate, Superintendent of Police

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday removed the District Magistrate and Superintendent of Police of Sonbhadra with immediate effect.

This follows the violent incident last month when villagers allegedly clashed with the henchmen of the Gram Pradhan in which at least 10 people had been killed. State government dismissed DM Ankit Agarwal and SP Salman Taj Patil, and ordered departmental action against the two. In addition, the action was also initiated against eight gazetted and seven non-gazetted officers while a Special Investigation Team was formed.

S Rajalingam will be the new District Magistrate and Prabhakar Chaudhary will be the new Superintendent of Police of Sonbhadra district.

The CM said, "Whoever is responsible in the incident of Sonbhadra, if alive, the government will take strict action on them as well."

He also mentioned that two committees were formed to investigate the entire matter. One of them under Chairman of Chief Secretary Revenue, Renuka Kumar to investigate matter related to revenue. The second committee was constituted under Additional Director General of Police, Varanasi Zone to investigate matters.

CM said that the committee report revealed that on October 10, 1952, the then Member of Legislative Council (MLC) Maheshwar Prasad Narayan Singh and Durga Prasad Rai, with their 12 relatives, formed the Model Agro Cooperative Committee who wrongly got 1305 bigha land of Gram Panchayat in 1955. Later, in 1979 the land was wrongly named after the living members of the society and the members started selling this land in 2017 this caused the dispute.

The government announced a compensation of Rs 18.5 lakh to the families of the deceased and Rs 2.5 lakh to the injured.
