This Bird Has A Better Life Than You, It Flew To London In Business Class & That Too For Free

There is a good reason for you to feel jealous of this bird because it enjoyed a privileged trip and that too for free! A Singapore Airlines flight going to London’s Heathrow Airport saw a unique passenger in the business class.

The bird got sat there for a good 12 hours before someone noticed it!





A video was posted and since then it is going viral. In the video, you can see the bird sitting on the top of a passenger’s seat. A steward tries to catch it but fails. The poor bird, however, gets caught with the help of passengers onboard.

After getting captured, the bird was handed over to the animal quarantine authorities once the aircraft landed in London.
