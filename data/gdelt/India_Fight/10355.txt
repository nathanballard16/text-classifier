Israeli Missiles Used in Indian Air Force's Pakistan Strike - Reports

The missiles were used as Islamabad accused New Delhi of violating its airspace on Tuesday, when Indian warplanes bombed a Jaish-e-Mohammad camp. The organisation earlier claimed responsibility for the deadly attack against an Indian military convoy in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in February.

India's Ministry of External Affairs called the Tuesday air raid as a “non-military” and pre-emptive move, adding that the Indian Air Force had ensured there were no civilian casualties in the strike.

The Pakistani National Security Council, in turn, reportedly rejected New Delhi’s claims that the airstrike targeted terrorists and was allegedly conducted due to Islamabad’s “inability to take action to destroy terrorist infrastructure”.
