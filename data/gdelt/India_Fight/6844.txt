People of Jaipur are enraged over the Pulwama terror attack and are coming together to express their grief and respect for the martyred soldiers and their kin.

In city’s Govind Dev ji temple, a special prayer meeting in remembrance of the martyred soldiers was organized on Saturday. The residents who participated in this prayer meeting were visible upset and after offering their tributes to the martyrs, voiced their protest against the terrorists who bombed the CRPF convoy.

Five of the forty CRPF soldiers who were martyred in the brutal attack belong to Rajasthan.

On this occasion Mahant of Govind Dev ji temple, Anjan kumar Goswami, announced to donate Rs5 lakh to the chief minister’s relief fund and also announced to give away Rs1,11,000 to the kin of the family members of the martyred jawan Rohitash Lamba, who hails from Jaipur district.

The prayer meeting was attended not only by the people from various NGOs and organizations, but the devotees as who arrive daily to the temple were also present. “It was a tearful moment for everybody at the temple on Saturday and we all turned emotional and some of the devotees were even crying,” Manish Gaur, who is a regular at the temple said.

Organiser of this prayer meeting, Suresh Mishra, said the time has come to give a befitting reply to the enemies for this terror attack. Students union of the University of Rajasthan has decided to cancel its annual fair “Ghoomar” this year due to this tragedy. Not only this, the students have also decided to donate Rs10 lakh to the families of the martyred CRPF men.
