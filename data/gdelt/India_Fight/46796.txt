Lucknow, October 9

Tension prevails in Uttar Pradesh’s Basti district after violence erupted during immersion of idols and a student leader was shot dead.

The shooting in broad daylight took place in the city despite heavy police presence after Tuesday evening’s violent clashes between two communities in which vehicles were damaged and shops were burnt, forcing the police to rush additional force from neighbouring districts.

Trouble started when a rumour spread that pieces of meat had been strewn on Ramjanki road, the route through which Durga idols were to go for immersion. Anti-social elements went on a rampage, hurling stones and setting shops ablaze. Additional police force had to be rushed to Basti and the city turned into a virtual fortress.

Despite the heavy deployment, student union leader Kabir Tiwari was shot by two bike-borne assailants on Malviya Marg around 11 am on Wednesday. People present at the spot managed to nab the two accused and handed them over to the police.

The critically injured Kabir succumbed to his injuries on way to King George Medical University in Lucknow. The anger spilled on the streets when the body was brought back to Basti. His supporters attacked the Kotwali police station damaging government property. The shops immediately down shutters and the town wore a deserted look as the police took charge of the situation.
