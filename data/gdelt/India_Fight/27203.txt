New Delhi: More than 40% of elected representatives in the newly-elected 17th Lok Sabha face criminal charges, including serious ones such as rape, extortion and murder, as per independent analysis by a not-for-profit organisation.

As per the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR), at least 233 of the 543 members of the Lok Sabha, who were named as winners on Thursday (May 23), face criminal proceedings. Out of the 303 MPs of Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), 116 face criminal charges, including one for terrorism.

On the other hand, 29 of the 52 MPs of the Rahul Gandhi-led Congress party face case, according to ADR. In fact, Congress MP from Idukki in Kerala, Dean Kuriakose, faces 204 criminal cases.

ADR's election chief Anil Verma was quoted as saying by news agency PTI that the trend of an increasing number of MPs with a criminal background was "disturbing" and that it was "bad for the democracy."

ADR said that it studied the records of 539 winners. It said that the number of elected MPs facing criminal cases in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls was the highest since it started gathering data in this regard in 2004.

The not-for-profit organisation also discovered that the number of legislators facing grace criminal cases had more than doubled in the last 10 years, including 11 murder cases, 30 manslaughter charges and three accused of rape.

The 2019 Lok Sabha elections saw a rise in the number of candidates with criminal cases contesting the general elections, compared to candidates with similar backgrounds in the last election in 2014. In 2019, almost 19% of the candidates who fought the elections face charges including rape, murder, and kidnapping, as per the New Delhi-based Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR).

Out of the nearly 15,000 candidates (19%) have criminal cases registered against them, as per the self-sworn affidavits of 7928 candidates analysed by the not-for-profit organisation that advocates. In 2014 elections, that number was at 17% and 15% in the 2009 polls.

This year, almost 1070 candidates (13%) with serious criminal charges, such as rape, murder, attempt to murder, kidnapping and crimes against women, contested the general elections.

As per the report, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) led the race with 40% of its candidates in the 2019 polls facing criminal charges, including crimes against women and murder. However, its main rival Congress party fared no better, with 39% of its candidates having criminal cases registered against them.

Among the regional parties, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) had the most number of candidates (58%) who had declared criminal cases against them in their affidavits. This was followed by the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) which 50% of candidates with declared criminal cases. The Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) had 22% of its candidates with criminal cases filed against them.

As per the law, a candidate convicted in a case convicted of any offense and sentenced to an imprisonment of two years of more is barred from contesting elections. However, those facing charges are allowed to fight the polls in view of fairness and also because the Indian judicial system can sometimes take months, even years, to resolve a case.

The counting of votes for the 2019 Lok Sabha elections took place on May 23, in which the BJP posted a landslide victory with 303 seats while the Congress won 52 seats. The BJP-led NDA, with 353 seats, on Saturday, claimed stake to form the next government.
