Patna, August 17

Controversial Bihar independent MLA and strongman Anant Singh has been booked under Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) after the seizure of an AK-47 rifle and grenade from his ancestral house, the police said on Saturday.

Confirming this, Patna (Rural) Superintendent of Police Kantesh Kumar Mishra said it could not be ruled out that the sophisticated weapon may have been used in “some big incidents”. The case is being probed and police would act as per the evidence that comes up during the investigation, he said to questions whether the MLA will be arrested.

“He (Anand Singh) has been booked under UAPA for the recovery of a sophisticated weapon AK-47 and grenade during a raid in his ancestral house on Friday,” Mishra said.

Parliament has recently passed an amendment to UAPA to give powers to the Centre to designate an individual as a terrorist and seize his properties.

Barh sub-divisional police officer Lipi Singh said ‘’We are moving ahead as per law and senior’s instructions. We are completing paper work and will submit before the court all the evidences along with an FIR to pray for issuance of warrant against him (MLA).’’

Singh, nicknamed ‘Chhote Sarkaar’, has a long criminal record. The MLA had reacted angrily to the raid at his ancestral house and alleged that a conspiracy has been hatched against him at the behest of JD(U) MP Lalan Singh. — PTI
