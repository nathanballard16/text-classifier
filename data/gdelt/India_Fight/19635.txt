Salman Khan issued notice by ASI for damaging antique figurine while shooting for Dabangg 3 in Madhya Pradesh

Bollywood actor Salman Khan has landed himself in trouble again. The actor, who has been currently shooting in the state of Madhya Pradesh for his upcoming movie, Dabangg 3, has been issued a notice by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The ASI has ordered Salman and his team to remove two set pieces of the film which were being constructed at the historic Jal Mahal in Mandu, Madhya Pradesh. The notice also consists of the clause that the film's shooting might get cancelled if the filmmakers do not pay heed to the above directive.

According to reports, the production house was being informed previously also regarding the same but no action was being taken on their side. As per the notice, the film crew have violated the norms of the Ancient Monument and Archeological Sites and Remains Act 1959 by constructing the set there. Moreover, the Dabangg team has also been accused of damaging an antique figurine at one of the forts located nearby the banks of the river Narmada in the town of Maheshwar. According to the eyewitnesses, the figurine got damaged while the set of the film was being removed from the fort.

Vijaylaxmi Sadho, the Culture Minister of Madhya Pradesh reacted to the reports by saying that whatever happened was wrong. The minister also said that she would visit the fort herself to understand the situation. She also added that action against the people will be taken if they are accused of doing something wrong during the shooting of the film.
