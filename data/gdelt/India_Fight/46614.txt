Mohan Bhagwat's Dusshera speech is disquieting for how it looks inward

In a speech that paints a state of siege, from family to nation, Bhagwat’s description of lynchings stands out for its stark denial of a brutal reality.

The BJP won a second term with a larger mandate, its government is putting in motion its core ideological projects, Article 370 has been abrogated — and yet. A summary of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat’s Dussehra speech this year would have to begin with the “parantu (but)” he inserts into his address after acknowledging, and owning, the Modi-BJP’s triumph. “Parantu is sukhad vatavaran mein alsa kar hum apni sajagta va apni tatparta ko bhula dein… aisa samay nahin hai”, this is not the time to be lulled into complacence, he says. The rest of the speech is mostly a bristling statement of the dangers and spectres that ostensibly afflict and confront Hindutva and the “Hindu Rashtra”, as the RSS and its chief have always defined, and continue to define, the nation. “Hamaare saamne kuch sankat hain jinka upaay hamein karna hai”, we are faced with dangers we must resolve. These, in Bhagwat’s telling, are visible but also hidden, more internal than external — “kuch sankat saamne dikhayee dete hain, kuch kuch baad mein saamne aate hain”. They are born of India’s diversities, which, he says, are manipulated to widen cleavages and fault lines. They come from attempts to defame Hindus, as in the case of lynchings, which, he says, are communal problems that are not one-sided, “dono taraf se aarop-pratyarop chalte hain” (there are allegations and counter-allegations).
