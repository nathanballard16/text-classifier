India witnessed one Jallianwala Bagh massacre, Kashmiris witnessed many: JRL

Srinagar

Proclaiming democracy on one hand and using police to stop peaceful gatherings and tribute assemblies, on the other hand, are two contradictory things. United India During its struggle for freedom from British occupation witnessed only one Jalianwala Bagh massacre but Kashmiris have witnessed dozens of such massacres carried out by government forces from 1990 till today, JRL in a statement issued to media said.

The spokesman in a statement said that January 21, 1990, is a historical day when Kashmiris resisted bullets but refused to budge before “tyranny and falsehood”. This was stated by the Joint Resistance Leadership comprising of Syed Ali Shah Geelani, Mirwaiz Muhammad Umar Farooq and incarcerated Muhammad Yasin Malik while recalling the sacrifices of martyrs who laid down their lives on January 21, 1990.

Despite heavy police restrictions, curfew in the whole area, arrest spree by the state, JRL leaders and activists managed to gather at Basant Bagh and held a memorial meeting near the site of the massacre at Basanat Bagh Gaw-Kadal, the spokesman mentioned.

It is worth to mention that to foil today’s peaceful program, Police kept JRL leaders Syed Ali Shah Geelani under house arrest while as police today morning also raided the residence of Muhammad Yasin Malik and arrested him immediately. He has been lodged at police station Kothi-bagh. Police have also arrested Hurriyat leaders Bilal Ahmad Sideeqi, Hilal Ahmad Waar and many others.

Dozens of political activists and youth were either arrested by police in nocturnal raids or raided by police from these areas.
