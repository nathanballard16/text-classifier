Varun Badola, Shweta Tiwari shoot in Delhi

TV actors Varun Badola Shweta Tiwari and Anjali Tatrari were recently in Delhi shooting across various locations in Model Town, Chandni Chowk , Subhash Nagar and Jawahar Gate for ' Mere Dad Ki Dulhan '. The streets around these areas were blocked as the residents gathered in large numbers to catch a glimpse of the actors. Shweta, who thoroughly enjoyed her stay in the city, said she had a great deal of delicious food along with great company. “We shot in real locations so it was a lot of fun. I gorged on a lot of Purani Dilli specials, rode an e-rickshaw and even interacted with a few fans. Varun and Anjali are fun to hang out with and all of us are foodies so there was neither a dearth of good food nor chatter,” she says.Varun Badola and Anjali Tatrari chill after a hectic schedule in Model TownBeing a Delhiite, Varun took advantage of the schedule and visited his home. “I make it a point to stay at home whenever I am in town for shoot,” he tells us, adding, “The good thing about Delhi is that you are spoilt for choice when it comes to food. From a thela wala to a five-star restaurant, you can eat as per your budget not worrying about the taste or quality. Food here is simply amazing.”For Anjali it was a one-of-a-kind experience. “This city is very beautiful... Varun sir and I shot in a bungalow in Model Town and I just fell in love with the beautiful terrace garden where we enjoyed a hot cup of tea. I also had scenes with Shweta ma’am, which were shot near the Red Fort . Later, we had paranthas from Paranthe Wali Gali. I also tried street food like chhole kulche, momos and aloo chaat followed by some mouth-watering kebabs. I couldn’t shop this time, but I would love to come back and shop at Sarojini Nagar and Janpath ,” she says.
