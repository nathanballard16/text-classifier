Eight years after two-time Municipal Councillor from, was shot dead in broad day light, six men accused of murdering him have been acquitted by a sessions court inOne sharp shooter, bike rider and four conspirators were acquitted of all charges, after the defence claimed that their identities were not convincingly established by the prosecution. Because of this, the complete chain of circumstances could not be established.However, a detailed order copy was not made available. The accused are Santosh Yadav, Balchandra Bhoir, Sumeet Yerunkar, Umesh Falle, alleged shooter Mahendra Kevat and motorcycle rider Dattatray Gaikwad.According to the complainant Kedar Mule, who has a construction firm in which Waringe’s wife was a partner, the politician was killed at the construction site.He told the court that on the day of the incident, he and Waringe were supervising construction. When he was at the back of the site, he heard a sound that resembled firecrackers and passersby raising a hue and cry. “I then rushed to the place from where I heard the sound. I saw that one unknown person was firing at Waringe,” he said.Mule then said that he picked up the brick lying near him and threw it towards the person who was firing. The assailant then got on to the bike that was waiting for him and fled the scene. Mule also identified the shooter in court. Mule claimed that he then took Waringe to the hospital and was turned away from three places before he was finally declared dead at AIMS.However, defence lawyer Ramprasad Gupta says that when the accused were brought to court after their arrest, their faces were not covered so the fact that they were shown to the witnesses could not be ruled out. And therefore the accused have to be given the benefit of the doubt.
