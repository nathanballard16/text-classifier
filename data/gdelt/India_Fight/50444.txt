One-sided action in lawyers-police clash in Delhi against police-persons will demoralise police-force

Dear Editor,

It refers to one-sided action by suspending two police-persons and transferring two senior police-officers following violent clash between lawyers and Delhi Police on 02.11.2019 at Tis Hazari court-premises in Delhi without any action against any lawyer including the one who initiated the ugly clash by wrongly parking his car in front of police lock-up in the court-premises. Impartiality demanded that licence of the lawyers involved in the clash would have also been suspended till completion of enquiry.

It is usual that no action is usually taken against any lawyer in incidents of clash between lawyers and police, while some police-persons are targeted with immediate suspension and transfer like was in an incident in the year 1988 when Kiran Bedi was Deputy Commissioner of Delhi Police (North).

One-sided action police-persons following clash of 02.11.2019 made police being totally helpless in defending citizens, media-persons and themselves in violent scenes created in and outside court-premises of Saket and Karkardooma in Delhi on 04.11.2019. Such beating of police-persons will tend to encourage hard-cored criminals including those in prison to be violent against police-persons.

It should be ensured that licences of guilty-found lawyers may be permanently cancelled after enquiry is over to prevent lawyers taking law in their hands in future.
