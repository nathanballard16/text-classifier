No major terror attack except Uri in last 4.5 years due to pre-emptive action: Rijiju

It doesn’t mean attempts were not made but pre-emptive strikes, pre-emptive action and arrest by various forces helped,said Kiren Rijiju.

Gurugram: Union Minister of State (MoS) for Home Affairs Kiren Rijiju on Wednesday asserted that there has been no major terror attack in the country in the last four-and-half-years due to the action of intelligence agencies, who thwarted such attempts.

Delivering a speech at the inauguration of the 19th International seminar on Synergized response to the emerging IED and terrorist threats organised by NSG, Rijiju said, “The response to these kinds of threats are enormous because, in the last four-and-half-years other than the Uri incident, the bomb blast and attack in some of the border areas like Pathankot, we could really secure our country in a way we have envisioned for the country.”

“There were no attacks in any big or small city in India. It doesn’t mean attempts were not made but pre-emptive strikes, pre-emptive action and arrest by various forces helped,” he added.

The attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri town took place on September 29, 2016, when terrorists stormed in an Army Camp and brutally massacred.
