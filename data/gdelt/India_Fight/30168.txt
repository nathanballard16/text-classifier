Police bring five Easter bombing suspects back from Saudi Arabia

Two more suspects arrested from Kandy in TID and Army joint operation





Five Sri Lankans suspected of having links to the Easter Sunday bombings that killed more than 250 people were brought home in Police custody on Friday after being deported from Saudi Arabia, Police said.



Police declined to provide details of the arrests beyond saying the five were picked up in a Middle Eastern country and were sent back in the custody of Sri Lankan Police from the Saudi city of Jeddah, Reuters reported. “These are the five remaining leaders of the 21 April terrorist group,” Police Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekera told reporters.



The coordinated Islamist militant suicide bomb attacks on hotels and churches sent shockwaves through the Indian Ocean island state that had enjoyed relative peace since the Civil War ended a decade ago.

Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attacks that authorities said were carried out by two little-known domestic groups – the National Thawheedh Jamaath (NTJ) and Jamathei Millathu Ibrahim.

Police declined to give information about the nature of the five suspects’ roles in the attacks but said one of them, identified as Mohamed Milhan, was a senior member of the NTJ.



“He could have been the next leader,” Gunasekera said.



Meanwhile, two more suspects who maintained close ties with Zaharan Hashim were arrested in Kandy on Friday in a joint operation led by the Terrorism Investigation Department (TID) and Army, authorities said.



Authorities have arrested more than 2,000 people in connection with the attacks. While courts have released most of them on bail, 634 remain in detention.



Authorities say the threat of more attacks has been contained and the security services have dismantled most of the network linked to the bombings.
