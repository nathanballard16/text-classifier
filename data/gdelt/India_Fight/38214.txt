A 38-year-old man has been arrested under the UP Prevention of Cow Slaughter Act for ferrying more than two tonnes of prohibited meat, said a police officer on Wednesday.

Talah Akhtar, a resident of Sitapur, and his aide Chandbabu were on way to Lucknow on Tuesday to sell the meat of 15 animals, allegedly slaughtered in his district.

Hasanganj Station House Officer (SHO) Dhirendra Pratap Kushwaha said they got a tip-off that a vehicle carrying the prohibited meat would pass through the area. "We started checking all vehicles and nabbed the accused. We have sent samples of meat to a lab for confirmation and destroyed the rest," he said.

The police suspected that two more vehicles were ferrying the prohibited meat. But they dodged the police as someone alerted them about the police presence on the route.

According to the police, Akhtar claimed that he was doing the business for the past many years but was never caught.

The police have increased vigil and are carrying out searches for the prohibited meat carrying vehicles and its suppliers.

Meanwhile, Sunni cleric Maulana Khalid Rashid Firangi Mahali has appealed Muslims to avoid the slaughter of prohibited animals during the festival.
