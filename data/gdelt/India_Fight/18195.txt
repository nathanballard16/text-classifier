Two Bangladeshi citizens were killed allegedly by Indian Border Security Force (BSF) on Masudpur frontier in Shibganj upazila in Chapainawabganj early today.

Deceased were identified as Milon Ali, 17, son of Belaluddin of Moralpara village and Senarul, 24 from Thutapara village in Shibganj upazila, reports our Chapainawabganj correspondent.

Of them, Milon sat for Secondary School Certificate examination this year.

Milon’s brother-in-law Abdur Rahim and villagers claimed that Milon along with some other people were returning from India through Masudpur frontier when the BSF opened fire on them, leaving him seriously injured.

His associates decided to take him to his house at Moralpara village, but he succumbed on the way around 5:00am, Abdur Rahim said.

Confirming the incident, Lt Col Sajjad Sarwar, commanding officer of 53 BGB Battalion, said it is still not clear whether he was killed by BSF. "We are investigating the matter," he said.

BGB few days back arrested few persons along with phensidyl and yaba, who had link with Milon, the CO added.

On the other hand, BSF started firing when Senarul was going towards India through the Masudpur frontier, injuring him severely, Senarul's brother Enamul Huq said.

He succumbed to his injuries when he was being taken to a hospital around 5:00am, he added.

Police recovered the bullet-hit body of Senarul around 12:15pm at his brother-in-law's house at Chanshikari village of the upazila, Md Selim Reza, officer-in-charge (investigation) of Shibganj Police Station, said.
