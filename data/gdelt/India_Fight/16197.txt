Warner Bros head steps down after reported affair with an actress

The chairperson and CEO of Warner Bros, Kevin Tsujihara, has stepped down following accusations that he helped secure roles for an actress with whom he was allegedly having an affair.

John Stankey, chief executive of parent company Warner Media, said that it was “in the best interest” of the firm that Tsujihara steps down.

“Kevin acknowledges that his mistakes are inconsistent with the company’s leadership expectations,” said Stankey.

However, the firm is conducting an investigation into the allegations, following a Hollywood Reporter story that detailed text messages between Tsujihara and Charlotte Kirk dating back to 2013.

The messages have revealed a ‘favour for a favour’ sexual relationship between the aspiring actress and the studio head, in which he made promises that he would introduce her to influential executives and she would be considered for roles in movies and television.

Tsujihara has told Fox News that their relationship ended many years ago. “The release of the story by the Hollywood Reporter had nothing to do with me. In fact, I tried to prevent it,” he said. Tsujihara’s lawyers have denied that he intervened in casting decisions for the films.
