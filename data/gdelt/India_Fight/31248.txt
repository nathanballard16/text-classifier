A major fire broke out in Indian Navy's under-construction stealth guided-missile destroyer, “INS Visakhapatnam,” stationed at Mumbai’s Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders on Friday, killing a 23-year old contract worker.

"Under-construction warship Visakhapatnam caught fire at 5.44 PM. The blaze erupted on the second deck of the ship," said PS Rahangdale, chief of the fire brigade, reported news agency PTI.

The fire started in an air conditioning bay, according to an official. It took time for fire-fighters to reach the spot, according to an official.

According to a statement issued by the Mumbai-based firm, the damage caused by the fire was not widespread and was brought under control, the statement said. The victim died due to asphyxiation and burn injuries.

“Eight fire engines and seven water tankers were rushed to the dockyard after the fire broke out,” the official said.

The lead ship of this class was launched on 20 April 2015 and is expected to be commissioned in the Indian Navy in 2021. Once commissioned, they will be the largest destroyers in the Indian Navy's arsenal.

The Visakhapatnam-class comprises of four ships - Visakhapatnam, Mormugao, Imphal and Porbandar all of which are being built by Mazagon Dock Limited.
