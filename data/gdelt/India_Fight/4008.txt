Mittal, who grew up in Calcutta, is counted among the richest Indians because of his stake in ArcelorMittal. Despite having operations in several countries, Mittal is yet to set up a stronghold in India. The Rs 42,000-crore offer made by ArcelorMittal — which has the backing of the committee of creditors — has provided only a pittance to operational creditors like RIL.

Legal observers say cases filed by operational creditors could prove to be a major stumbling block that ArcelorMittal will need to negotiate before it wins approval from the NCLT. The plan, which promises to pay off dues of most of the secured financial creditors, was cleared by the CoC where the SBI had a majority vote. The Ruias, who had made a late offer that was eventually rejected by the NCLT last Tuesday, had proposed to pay off all operational creditors in full and in three instalments. Meanwhile, a section of the operational creditors had approached the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal on Wednesday in an effort to stymie the NCLT hearing on the ArcelorMittal petition tomorrow. But the tribunal refused to hear the matter.
