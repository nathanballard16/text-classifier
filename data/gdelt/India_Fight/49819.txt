Merkel to sit through national anthem; netizens unhappy

New Delhi, Nov 1 : As India accepted a request by the German government to allow its Chancellor Angela Merkel to remain seated while the national anthems of both the countries are played as she is suffering from a medical condition, netizens on Friday took to Twitter to disagree with the governments stand.

"I used to feel great respect for #AngelaMerkel, not anymore. She does not stand for justice, but for financial and political profits", a user tweeted.

"Why India Tweaked Protocol to Allow German Chancellor Angela Merkel to Sit Through National Anthem? is it new India," noted another.

"Owing to German Chancellor Angela Merkel's medical condition, India has accepted a request by the German government to allow her to remain seated while the national anthems of both countries are played. Now please don't call her Anti-National", wrote another user.

India and Germany inked over 20 agreements, including in the field of Artificial Intelligence, green urban mobility and agriculture, and resolved to jointly combat terrorism, as visiting German Chancellor Angela Merkel held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi here as part of the 5th Inter Governmental Consultations.

While strengthening Cooperation in the Field of Artificial Intelligence and Digital Transformation formed a major part of the joint statement, there was also a large section on combating terrorism.

PM Modi, in his address, said that India and Germany have resolved to intensify bilateral and multilateral cooperation to deal with the threats of terrorism and extremism.
