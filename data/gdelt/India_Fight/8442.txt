We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab,” Nitin Gadkari said in a tweet.Under the leadership of Hon'ble PM Sri @narendramodi ji, Our Govt. has decided to stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan. We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab.The rivers that flow into Pakistan from India are Ravi, Beas and Sutlej, three tributaries of the Indus, an official said.Under the World Bank-brokered Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, the waters flowing in the three Indus tributaries have been allotted to India while the waters of the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus to Pakistan.Of the total 168 million acre-feet, India’s share of water from the three allotted rivers is 33 million acre-feet. India uses nearly 93-94 per cent of its share under the Indus Waters Treaty and rest of the water remains un-utilised and flows into Pakistan. It is this water that India has decided to stop.India earlier announced withdrawal of Most Favoured Nation status to Pakistan in trade and hiked duty on imports from that country to 200 per cent in the wake of the Pulwama incident
