Auto Shankar's Chandrika: Meet Swayamsiddha Das

Model-turned-actress Swayam has made a name for herself in the digital space with, a Zee5 web-series conceptualised and directed by Ranga and produced by Trident Arts Digital and Manoj Paramahamsa's Baby Shoe Productions.

The Tamil series Auto Shankar resurrects one of Chennai's most notorious criminals: Gowri Shankar, an auto driver from the Thiruvanmiyur neighbourhood who ran illicit arrack and prostitution rackets and was hanged for murdering six people in the 1980s.

Sarath Appani (Angamaly Diaries, Chekka Chivantha Vaanam, Odiyan) plays Shankar and shoulders the entire series bravely. The other characters have very limited story arcs. Of the lot, it is Chandrika (Swayam) who leaves an impression. As a sex worker who becomes Shankar's favourite, Chandrika is believably seductive. Her uninhibited performance is one of the highlights of the series and one wishes that the director had given her more to do, writes Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute . Swayam steals the show with her complex character with grey shades. Her quiet disposition while battling inner turmoils and dilemma come to the fore when it concerns Shankar.

Fans and critics alike have been raving about Swayam's performance ever since the series aired on April 23.

The young actress has turned a lot of heads with her performance and has definitely carved a niche for herself.
