VADODARA: Three cattle owners were arrested on Wednesday with regard to a clash between farmers and cattle owners at Waghodiya on Tuesday evening.

The clash was triggered by cattle owners letting their bovines graze in a soya bean farm at Rampura village. As the owner of the farm Ratilal Parmar rushed to stop the cattle from damaging his standing crops, the three cattle owners Raghu Bharwad, Suresh Bharwad and Vaju Bharwad started beating him up. As Ratilal shouted for help, his son Rasik came there but he too was thrashed.

Meanwhile, other people from Ratilal’s village including his cousin Suresh and another son Dinesh came to their help. Ratilal told police that the accused snatched a wooden stick from Dinesh and beat him up. As more people from Ratilal’s side arrived there, the three accused went away with their cattle. Ratilal, Rasik and Dinesh were taken to Jarod Referral Hospital for treatment and were later discharged.

Ratilal later gave a complaint of assault and criminal intimidation against the three cattle owners based on which they were arrested. He also alleged that he faced a loss of Rs 40,000 as the cattle destroyed his crops.
