Arjun Kapoor juggles his dates

The actor will essay the role of Prabhat Kapoor, who heads the four-member team carrying out the operation.

Arjun Kapoor, who is back in action, seems to have got really busy with his upcoming films, as his dates are jam-packed. The Ishaqzaade actor is so caught up at work that he is currently juggling between two of his films India’s Most Wanted and Panipat.

As the promotions of his upcoming release India’s Most Wanted is going on, the shooting for his period drama Panipat is also happening simultaneously.

A source close to the actor reveals that Arjun is shooting for Panipat in ND Studios, which is in the outskirts of Mumbai. Paanipat has an ensemble cast and he has given his dates for that film. At the same time, he is also trying his best to take out time for the promotions of India’s Most Wanted. He doesn’t want to lose out on the promotions either as this film is very close to his heart.

Directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, India’s Most Wanted tells the story of an undercover operation to capture a deadly terrorist referred to as ‘India's Osama (bin Laden)’ without the use of any weapons.

The actor will essay the role of Prabhat Kapoor, who heads the four-member team carrying out the operation.

As far as Panipat is concerned, it’s a period drama mounted on a huge scale and is being directed by Ashutosh Gowariker.
