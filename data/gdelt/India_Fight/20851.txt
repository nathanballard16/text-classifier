Kolkata: Trinamool Congress MP Derek O'Brien on Wednesday mocked the Bharatiya Janata Party and its leaders over the projections they have been making for themselves in West Bengal with regard to the Lok Sabha Elections 2019.

Derek said the BJP people do not even know how many seats are there in West Bengal while claiming that they will win 30 out of 42 seats in the state. The people of the state are with the Trinamool Congress, he added.

“BJP people are also saying they will win 50 out of 42 seats as they don't even know how many seats are there. Let them dream, people of Bengal are with Mamata Banerjee and TMC. On May 23, we'll see where these people hide,” the TMC leader said.

Derek’s remarks came as the two parties continue to slug it out in West Bengal for the Lok Sabha Elections 2019.

On one hand is Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee and on the other is PM Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, who have been involved in an intense war of words.

The BJP has even moved the Election Commission complaining against the TMC for roping in Bangladeshi actors for campaigning for the Bengal party. While the Centre has cancelled the visa of Ferdous Ahmed, one of the Bangladeshi actors involved in the campaigning row, the Bangladeshi government has told them to return to the country.

The actors have been clearly told that they should shoot for films in India only after General Elections are over.
