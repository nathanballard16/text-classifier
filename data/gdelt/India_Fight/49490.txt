NEW DELHI

Unidentified terrorists reportedly shot dead as many as five labourers working in India-controlled Kashmir on Tuesday night.

All the dead belonged to India's eastern state of West Bengal, said media reports.

Dead bodies of all those killed were recovered by security forces in the area which was cordoned off and search operation launched to nab the assailants.

One other labourer was injured in the terror attack, which is being described as the biggest one after Indian Government abrogated the Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, on Aug. 5, that guaranteed a special status to India-occupied Kashmir.

Further details of the terror attack are awaited.

Barely 24 hours ago a truck driver was killed by unidentified terrorists. The driver was attacked late on Monday evening south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.
