Power Of Strings: This Iraqi Teacher Transformed His Assault Rifle Into A Musical Instrument

For centuries, music had a special place in the life of Iraqi people. It was a magnet for artistes as well as commoners across the region but recent years saw Mosul suffer a devastating musical purge.

In what is both an inspiration as well as rekindling of nostalgia, Baghdad resident Majed Abdennour recently made grabbed eyeballs for clutching a repurposed musical instrument.

The Iraqi teacher in his fifties had an assault rifle at home to "protect" himself and his family during the fearsome years of sectarian violence in the Iraqi capital. Memorably, from 2006 to 2008 militants and extremist Islamists ruled Baghdad, while Sunnis and Shiites hid behind closed doors in their respective communities.

"All of a sudden, it was as if all the ties that had connected us didn't matter anymore, Iraq became a huge battleground, war was everywhere," said Abdennour.

According to the Iraq Body Count database, more than 100,000 civilians were killed in the country between the 2003 US-led invasion and the withdrawal of American troops in 2011.

"I ask myself: why war? Why the violence? I'll transform all that into music," Abdennour, who lost a number of cousins and friends in attacks, was quoted as saying by AFP.

His assault rifle was from a series of automatic rifles that are based on the original design of Mikhail Kalashnikov and he took it and its ammunition case to a metalworker, asking him to convert that into a musical instrument.

The metalworker quizzed about what he wanted to do with the weapon.

"I told him: don't ask questions, do it!"

Abdennour was sure that the metalworker must have thought that he was mad but he sings with all his heart and strums the strings of his unusual instrument with an ammunition case as a sound box.
