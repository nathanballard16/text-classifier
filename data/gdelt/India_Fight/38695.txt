Sporadic violence in Srinagar streets leaves more than 12 injured, but protestors 'clueless' about Article 370

SRINAGAR: Seventeen-year-old Zeeshan Bilal Bhat, a resident of Srinagar’s Noorbagh, is among 11 youngsters admitted to Srinagar’s SMHS hospital with pellet injuries sustained in clashes with security forces after Friday’s prayers in his locality, over the revocation of J&K’s special status by the Centre.A class 12 student, Zeeshan doesn’t know anything about Article 370 and its provisions, yet joined a group of stone-pelters in his area on Friday. His father Bilal Bhat runs a poultry farm while his mother is terminally ill, said one of Zeeshan’s attendants, adding that the teen is the couple’s only son and has three sisters.Wahid Gani Wani (24), also from Noorbagh, is under treatment at the facility with pellet injuries on his face and right eye. Considering the amount of damage caused to his retina, doctors aren’t too optimistic about his recovery.Waqar Rafiq (22) of Buchpora area on the outskirts of Srinagar also sustained pellet injuries in both his eyes and face. “This also seems to be a serious case of eye injury. He has a long battle ahead of him,” said an SMHS doctor. Farhat Fayaz (15), also from Buchpora, is perhaps the only patient in this lot with a head injury caused by a stone.SMHS doctors said most of the patients are stable and haven’t suffered any major debilitating injury. “Most of them would recover in a couple of weeks but those with eye injuries will take some time to fully heal,” said a doctor at the hospital.Some others — also injured in sporadic violence that broke out in the streets of Kashmir when stone-pelters clashed with security personnel deployed to maintain law and order during Friday prayers — are admitted with minor injuries in the Sher-e-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences.
