The main suspect in 25-year-old Delhi doctor’s murder, who was found dead with multiple stab wounds and her throat slit, was arrested from Uttarakhand’s Roorkee on Friday, two days after the incident.

The suspect, Chandra Prakash Verma, also a doctor and victim’s flatmate, had been on the run since the murder and was arrested from near Gang Nahar in Roorkee by a team of Delhi Police crime branch.

Police say Verma was planning to kill himself by jumping into the river. He had been staying in different hotels but changing them frequently. Before reaching Roorkee, Verma went to Uttar Pradesh also.

DCP Central Mandeep Singh Randhawa confirmed the arrest but refused to elaborate, saying Verma was arrested by the crime branch and they are yet to take his custody.

The woman and the 29-year-old man lived in separate rooms in a third-floor flat in Ranjit Nagar. A third flatmate was not in the apartment at the time of the murder. All three worked as interns at a government hospital in Karol Bagh.

Police suspect that the victim, Garima Mishra from Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur, may have had an altercation with Verma after which he killed her using either a kitchen knife or a surgical blade.
