Indian Missile Mistakenly Hit its Own Chopper in Conflict with Pakistan - Report

The investigation's focus is to determine "if multiple layers of safeguards meant to protect assets from friendly fire failed and how systems need to be improved to prevent any such incident in future", it reported.

The Indian authorities maintain that the IAF strike was carried out against suspected terror infrastructure operated by JeM, the Pakistan-based terrorist organisation that claimed responsibility for the Pulwama attack.

A day after the Indian side launched the air strike in Balakot (in Pakistan), the two nuclear armed nations engaged in an air clash, a first in five decades. According to reports, at least 25 fighter jets from the Pakistan Air Force tried to breach the border for a strike on military targets. A slow moving target like the Mi-17 V5 helicopter could be mistaken for a low flying armed UAV homing into an air base, said the media report citing sources.

The IAF has stated it wouldn't hesitate from initiating Court Martial proceedings against personnel found guilty in the inquiry.
