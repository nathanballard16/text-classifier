BJP, TRS, YSRC conspiring against Telugu Desam, says N Lokesh

Vijayawada: Telugu Desam leaders including minister N. Lokesh have alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, TS Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao and YSRC chief Y.S. Jagan Mohan Reddy had conspired to suppress the Telugu Desam by “carrying out attacks” on IT companies in Hyderabad that were providing services to the party. He alleged that the three leaders were trying to steal the data of the Telugu Desam to weaken their party in the elections.

Mr Lokesh took to Twitter to voice his protest against police raids in Hyderabad on an IT firm, IT Grids, that was providing support to the Telugu Desam.

He said that the “three Modis” — his reference to Mr Modi, Mr Rao and Mr Reddy — were unable to face AP Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu directly. They had tried to stop work on the capital Amaravati and AP’s development but had failed. “They have now begun raids on IT firms that are offering services to TD,” he said.

He alleged that Telangana police had tried to steal the data of TD membership and seva mitras during the raids and had kidnapped employees to weaken the TD’s online services.

Mr Lokesh said Mr Modi and Mr Rao were trying to make Mr Reddy the Chief Minister but the people would give them a befitting reaction.
