Two terrorists, belonging to Pak-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, were gunned down by security forces in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Baramulla district on Friday. This comes amid severed ties between India and Pakistan, in the wake of Pulwama terror attack that claimed lives of 40 CRPF bravehearts on February 14.

According to police, there were specific inputs about the presence of militants in Warpora area of Sopore, following which they launched a cordon and search operation. The gunfight began as soon as militants opened fire at the search party.

Two militants have been killed, a police official said, adding the operation was going on. The identity of the militants was yet to be ascertained.

According to DIG South Kashmir Atul Kumar Goel, terrorists belonged to Jaish-e-Mohammed. There was no collateral damage & no injuries to security personnel, he said. The public is requested not to venture into the operational area until it is sanitised, he added.

It was on February 14 when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district, killing at least 40 personnel and leaving many critically wounded. The carnage triggered anger in the country, with India taking major decisions against Pakistan to build diplomatic and international pressure on the neighbouring country.
