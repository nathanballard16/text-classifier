Intelligence agency sources on Tuesday claimed that Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed's (JeM) Chief Masood Azhar and Taliban's Haqqani Network had a meeting one month ahead of the Pulwama attack.

Intelligence agencies claimed that the meeting was to plan a suicide attack in India. Sources claimed that ISI mediated the meeting between JeM chief and Taliban Haqqani Network in Bahawalpur.

Sources further claimed that terrorists from JeM and Taliban Haqqani network were being trained at the Balakot's terror camps that were destroyed in the Indian airstrike.

On February 14, lesser-known Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar blew his explosive-laden vehicle next to a bus in a CRPF convoy in Pulwama , killing at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) paramilitary troopers.

On February 26, the India Air Force carried out air strikes in Balakot, destroying the biggest Jaish terror camp.

While the Indian Air Force did not give a count of the number of terrorists killed, reports indicated that at least 250 terrorists were killed in the strike.
