I-T department seizes Rs 5 crore cash in raids against former Karnataka Deputy CM G Parameshwara, others

Bangalore: The Income Tax Department has seized about Rs 5 crore cash during raids against former Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara and others, officials said Friday. They said the raids that began Thursday are ongoing on premises at about 25 locations.

In coordinated raids, more than 300 Income Tax sleuths swooped down on premises linked to two prominent Congress leaders in Karnataka – G Parameshwara and former MP RL Jalappa’s son J Rajendra. The raids are in connection with a multi-crore tax evasion case linked to the NEET exams, officials said.

Besides raiding the office, residence and institutions belonging to G Parameshwara, the I-T officials also searched the residence of his brother G Shivaprasad and personal assistant Ramesh, sources in the department said.

While Parameshwara’s family runs the Siddhartha Group of Institutions, which was established by his father HM Gangadharaiah 58 years ago, Rajendra runs the RL Jalappa Institute of Technology at Doddaballapura and Kolar.
