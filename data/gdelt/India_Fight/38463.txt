Bombay HC strikes down plea against online drug sales

MUMBAI: The Bombay High Court has struck down a public interest litigation (PIL) challenging online sale of medicines. The PIL was filed against the Union government and e-pharmacies. The HC noted that guidelines to regulate such entities would be announced soon and, hence, they would “comply with substantive laws”.The petition had said certain categories of drugs (schedules H and X) cannot be sold without a prescription, that is, only through physical stores. In other words, the case challenged e-pharmacies where these critical medicines can be ordered online even without prescription in certain towns and cities. (Schedule H drugs include key antibiotics, and schedule X drugs are related to opioid and psychotropic substances — both categories cannot be sold without the prescription of a registered medical practitioner).This comes after a similar petition against e-pharmacies was withdrawn in the Calcutta high court in March, while the Patna high court in July questioned the government on delay in finalising guidelines for e-pharma companies.The deadline for amendments to the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, which would regulate e-pharmacies, was July 31. With the government yet to notify the guidelines, e-pharma companies continue to face an uncertain regulatory climate, and mounting court cases.In its reply, the government said the final notification on e-pharmacies is likely to be issued within four months. Retail trade channels under All-India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists have been opposing e-pharmacies because of discounting as a standard practice by online players. On an average, most epharmacies offer a 15-20% discount on each order, while there is no such fixed practice among chemists and stockists, or they may offer up to 10% off on orders of a certain amount.Madras High Court had last year stayed the ban on online sale of medicines, while another case in Delhi high court sought contempt action against the government for allegedly not taking any action against defaulting e-pharmacies.
