The upcoming Lok Sabha elections in the state of Uttarakhand will be held in a single phase on April 11, 2019, and like many states in the country, the mountain state will see a fierce battle between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Congress. Back in 2009, Congress reigned supreme in all five Lok Sabha constituencies in the state but in 2014, the BJP wiped out the grand old party from all the Uttarakhand seats. Given how the BJP is firmly placed in Uttarakhand, Congress would need to put a Herculean effort to usurp the BJP from the mountain state.

Ever since the announcement of elections scheduled by the Election Commission of India (ECI) on March 10, the Model Code of Conduct is in effect in the state. Out of just over 1 crore population, nearly 78 lakh voters will cast their vote in the upcoming general elections in Uttarakhand. The political parties have till March 25 to file candidate nominations while the date for scrutiny of the nominations is March 26.

Incumbents in the state

Almora: This parliamentary seat is reserved for Scheduled Caste (SC) candidates and Ajay Tamta of the BJP is the current MP from Almora. In 2014, he defeated then sitting MP Pradeep Tamta of the Congress, by a margin of nearly one lakh votes.

Garhwal: BJP's Bhuwan Chandra Khanduri occupies this seat. He stormed to a resounding victory in the 2014 general elections where he received a massive 4.05 lakh votes compared to Congress leader Harak Singh Rawat's 2,21,164 votes.

Haridwar: Former Uttarakhand Chief Minister Harish Rawat was the sitting MP in Haridwar from 2009 till 2014. But his decision to not to contest the elections from the same seat in 2014 cost the Congress dearly as his wife Renuka Rawat was handed a bitter defeat by BJP's Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, who is the incumbent from Haridwar.

Nainital–Udhamsingh Nagar: This parliamentary seat was constituted in 2009 and it was won by the Congress in its maiden elections. However, in 2014, the BJP crushed the grand old party with a huge margin. Incumbent Bhagat Singh Koshyari defeated Congress' KC Singh Baba by a margin of nearly 3 lakh votes.

Tehri Garhwal: It was the same story in this constituency as well where the Congress was the ruling party from 2009 to 2014 and then the BJP won it with a big margin. BJP leader Mala Rajya Laxmi Shah is the current MP from Tehri Garhwal.

Candidates in the fray

The ruling BJP feels confident in its parliamentary incumbents and the speculation is rife that the party will field all of its sitting MPs in the upcoming elections. However, no official announcement has been made yet.

Congress Uttarakhand chief Pritam Singh earlier said that the party will announce the list of its contesting candidates soon. He also added that the Congress is looking repeat its historic success of 2009 in the state.

What happened in 2017 Assembly elections

After losing the 2012 Assembly elections by a narrow margin, the BJP emerged as a dominant force in 2017 sweeping 57 seats out of 70 in Uttarakhand. On the other hand, the Congress suffered a humiliating loss where it could only manage 11 seats. The state saw a voter turnout of 65 per cent where the BJP received 2,312,912 votes while the Congress had to do with 1,665,664 votes. BJP's Trivendra Singh Rawat was named the new Chief Minister of Uttarakhand on March 11, 2017.
