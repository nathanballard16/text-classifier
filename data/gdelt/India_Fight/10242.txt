Pakistan captures Indian pilot after shooting down aircraft, escalating hostilities

British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that he was “very concerned” about the rising tensions and that he had spoken with his Indian and Pakistani counterparts about it. “Neither side wants to see this escalate further, but this is going to take really critical restraint in the days ahead,” he said. Russia’s Foreign Ministry “expressed hope for the de-escalation of the situation.”
