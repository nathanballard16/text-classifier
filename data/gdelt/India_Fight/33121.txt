Mukhtar Ansari case: Mystery deaths of witnesses

VARANASI: Ramadhar Rai, the lawyer and close relative of slain BJP MLA Krishnanand Rai said that the mysterious deaths of some eyewitnesses and two others migrating from Ghazipur without recording their evidence in court enabled the acquittal of prime accused Mukhtar Ansari in the murder case.When TOI contacted Ramadhar, who was at his Ghazipur residence, he said that he was one of the lawyers in the Krishnanand Rai murder case when it was being heard in the district and sessions court. "There were two prime witnesses - Sanjiv Rai and Munna Rai of Jamania - in this case. They did not record their evidence in court and left the district to settle in some other city.""Shashikant Rai, who was in Krishnanand's vehicle when it was attacked on November 29, 2005, had also suffered bullet injuries but survived. Apart from Shashikant, a local farmer Manoj Gond, who was working in his field near the crime spot, was also eyewitness. Both died under mysterious circumstances," he said.
