Siege by troops triggers clashes in Pulwama village

In occupied Kashmir, clashes broke out between Indian troops and protesters in Pulwama district against a cordon and search operation launched by the troops today (Tuesday). The operation is launched by the troops in Bongam area of Karimabad village.

After the cordon, a group of youth assembled near the site and staged anti-India protests.

The forces used force and fired teargas shells on the protestors triggering clashes.

Indian troops also launched a cordon and search operation in Kokernag area of Islamabad district.

However, operation is called off in view of stiff resistance offered by the youth.

Meanwhile, the Joint Resistance Leadership has strongly condemned the extension of judicial custody of illegally detained Chairman Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front Muhammad Yasin Malik by a National Investigation Agency court upto July 7.

The JRL in a statement in Srinagar said that the illegal detention of Muhammad Yasin Malik is being deliberately prolonged under political vendetta in violation of basic principles of democracy and humanity.

The JRL also denounced the continued detention of other resistance leaders by NIA and Enforcement Directorate.
