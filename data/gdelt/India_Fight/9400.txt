Kashmiris are not enemies: Sitaram Yechury

Thiruvananthapuram: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury said those declaring Kashmir as an integral part of the country on one hand and attacking Kashmiris on the other, are only helping the enemies of the country.

He said the brothers and sisters of Kashmir are not enemies of the country. Democracy, secularism and equality cannot be safeguarded till power re-mains in the hands of people who oppose Kashmiris.

Yechury was speaking at the valedictory of Student Parliament here.

The CPM general secretary said A.B. Vajpayee had stated that Kashmir was integral part of the country which cannot be separated. However, the rulers of today who claim to pursue the same thought, say Kashmir is India’s part but Kashmiris are not. Yechury said after Pulwama terror attack all opposition parties stood with the Prime Minister. All were united to defend the country’s unity and integrity. However, BJP national president reacted instantly that only Modi government and not the Congress government reacted strongly against Pakistan.

The CPM leader said democracy cannot be sustained without secularism and equality. Those experiencing terror and fear in north India, feel fresh air of democracy when they come to Kerala.

Former KPCC president V.M. Sudheeran said the real threat to democracy was politics of murder. The ideology which advocates use of weapon cannot become an instrument of democracy.
