HYDERABAD: The bodies of a couple, who allegedly committed suicide after their detention and humiliation by the police, were found from Rohri Canal in Matiari district on Saturday evening. Bhit Shah Police Station SHO Karam Khan Umrani said that badly decomposed bodies of Moinuddin alias Arsalan Rajput and his wife, Zainab Shaikh, who had jumped in the canal in Nawabshah, were found from Bilal Shah channel.



He said that the family of the deceased couple claimed that they both committed suicide by jumping in the canal. He informed that he handed over the bodies to Punhal Chandio Police Station in Nawabshah from where the family, which did not allow postmortem, collected the bodies.



"They took their lives because of the cruelty of the police," bewailed Irshad Rajput, Moinuddin's father, while talking to the local media. He claimed that his son operated a restaurant and guest house in Nawabshah, which the police raided on the complaint of an influential woman.



"The police took my son and daughter-in-law to the police station where my son was beaten and both of them were humiliated until we went there and proved that they were a married couple," said Rajput, suggesting that the police treated the couple as if they were not wedded. He said that the family will register a case against the policemen who detained the couple as well as the influential woman who got them arrested over a personal dispute.



He claimed that the police also took cash and mobile phones from the guest house. The couple's car and slippers were found from a bank of Rohri Canal in Nawabshah two days before the bodies were found.
