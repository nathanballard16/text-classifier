One person was injured when a driver rammed a crowd with his car in the Model Town area of northwest Delhi on Sunday night, before speeding away.

The video of the incident, which surfaced on Monday, shows the terrifying moment when a black sedan drove into a group of people at a busy road in Gupta Colony before going a little ahead and reversing back into the same crowd, and hitting more people.
