Jammu, August 6

The Army has foiled a major infiltration bid in the Macchal sector of Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday, a second within a week’s time.

As many as five to six terrorists had sneaked into the Indian side at 2:30 am on Tuesday before the patrolling team spotted and engaged them. In the ensuing encounter, the Army personnel succeeded in foiling their infiltration attempt while one soldier sustained injuries and was subsequently evacuated, reports said.

On Saturday, another infiltration bid was foiled by the Army where Pakistani BAT personnel with some terrorists had tried to enter India in the Keran sector.

Meanwhile, Pakistani troops on Tuesday violated the ceasefire agreement on the Line of Control (LOC) in the Sunderbani sector of Rajouri by using small arms.

“The Pakistan troops used small arms shelling along with mortars in the Sundarbani sector, which the Army retaliated. Shelling started at 12:45 pm and continued for two hours.” a defence spokesperson said.

Meanwhile, in the backdrop of the prevailing situation in Jammu and Kashmir after the Central Government revoked the special status of J&K, the General Officer Commanding in Chief, Northern Command, Lt Gen Ranbir Singh chaired a meeting of the Core Group of Intelligence and Security agencies at Srinagar to review the operational readiness to meet any contingency that could adversely impact the security situation in J&K. He stated that the necessary security arrangements had been put in place for ensuring peace and security.
