3 shops raided, but I-T dept denies action

Ludhiana: Three garment shops in Bhadaur House, and two houses of shop owners in Pakhowal Road were allegedly raided by income tax sleuths on Thursday morning. However, the investigation wing of the I-T department located in Kitchlu Nagar has denied their office involvement in the raid, which allegedly saw the participation of a huge police force and I-T officials. According to the sources, rumours of a major I-T action in the coming days had been doing the rounds for the past 2-3 days in the city.

Apparently, Thursday’s action caused panic at the AC Market and the stores situated nearby Bhadaur House. As news of the raids spread among shopkeepers, hundreds of them downed shutters of their shops and started gathering outside the three premises where the income tax teams were present. There were also unverified reports about some I-T officials being locked in the shops.

Meanwhile, it has been learnt from sources in the Income Tax department that the action was taken on those businessmen who were connected with the group of real estate agents and dealers who were raided in the first week of December 2018. During that raid, almost 40 premises linked with the associates of three prominent businessmen were raided by the investigation wing, and the action had continued for several days.
