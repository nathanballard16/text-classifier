Victims’ kin to oppose Dera chief parole in HC

CHANDIGARH: The family of slain Sirsa journalist Ram Chander Chhatarpati and victims of castration in the Dera headquarters are clear that they will oppose any parole for Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Chhatrapati’s son Anshul, the complainant as well as main witness of his father’s murder, is scathing about the BJP government’s decision to consider the Dera chief’s parole plea.“Law and order is the main point which should be taken into consideration while deciding on the appeal moved by the Dera head. His only motive is to come out jail. And the government should take into account the law and order situation it faced on August 25, 2017. Who will bring him back to jail?”Forty-two people were killed in police action in Panchkula and Sirsa on August 25, 2017 after the CBI court convicted the Dera chief in two cases of rape. Despite heavy security arrangements, his conviction triggered violence, forcing police and paramilitary personnel to open fire on rioting mobs.The Haryana government in January had even refused to allow the Dera chief to be present for sentencing in the Ram Chander Chhatarpati murder case. He was, instead, presented through video conferencing and sentenced to life term.Anshul apprehended that as the SIT had failed to arrest key Dera functionaries involved in Panchkula violence, there was no surety of law and order situation after the Dera chief’s release. “He is the biggest threat for our family. We shall certainly oppose the parole and will move the Punjab & Haryana HC,” Anshul said.“We have already requested the CBI to oppose his parole in the court. At the same time, we shall also move court in case the government takes decision to give him parole. And most surprisingly, how can the government ignore the remarks of Punjab and Haryana high court that his release could once again lead to law and order issue in Haryana,” the complainant said.
