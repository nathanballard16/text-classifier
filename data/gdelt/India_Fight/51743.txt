The film, not titled yet, is being directed by debutant Kaashvie Nair and produced by Bhushan Kumar, Nikkhil Advani and John Abraham.

Talking about the project, Rakul had said: “The film is in the rom-com space, and it is the story of characters who belong to India and Pakistan, so it’s a cross-border. I think definitely this will be of huge interest to the viewers.
