Condemning the “dastardly” attack by Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed, Punjab cabinet minister Navjot Singh Sidhu on Friday asked whether an entire nation can be blamed for a handful of people.

“Nations cannot be held responsible for the dastardly acts of terrorists. The terrorists do not have deen, mazhab (sect and religion).There are good, the bad and the ugly. Every institution has them. Every nation has them. The ugly need to be punished.” Sidhu said.

" He followed that up by saying, "For a handful of people, can you blame the entire nation and can you blame an individual?"

“This is about a terrorist attack, which was a dastardly and cowardly act. Those who perpetrate such act should be punished. But, these people cannot hold nations to ransom. If some terrorist organisation has done it, then wage a war against them,” Sidhu added. He also called for a “dialogue to find a permanent solution to end the bloodshed.”
