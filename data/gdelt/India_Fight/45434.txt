Allahabad: Floods hit flower market, prices shoot up as Navratra begins

ALLAHABAD: Besides affecting the everyday life of citizens in Sangam city , the devastating floods and heavy rains have made a dent in the flower production on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna. As a result, flowers are being sold at higher prices with the beginning of Navratra on Sunday.Flower sellers at Rambagh, Naini, Phaphamau, Rajapur, Kydganj, Sulemsarai and adjoining mandis claimed that prices of flowers have doubled up since major chunks of crops of rose, genda (marigold), lotus and other flowers have damaged in floods and rains.Babloo, a flower exporter at Rambagh mandi said, “With the beginning of Navratra, the demand of flowers is rising. We have brought flowers from Kolkata as crops of rose and genda that grew between Allahabad (Naini, Jaipura, Jigna) and Varanasi belt on the banks of Ganga and Yamuna were destroyed in floods.” He added, “Only 10-15 per cent of flower crops that grew on relatively elevated areas, is safe, but not enough to cope with the rising demand”.Presently, a garland of marigold is being sold between Rs 40 and 50, which was earlier available at Rs 20 or 30. Similarly, prices of rose petals have also doubled. A small rose garland is being sold between Rs 20 and 30 instead of Rs 10 and 15. A lotus flower is being sold at Rs 10 instead of Rs 5.Anuj, another flower dealer at Rajapur, said, “This festive season, prices of all varieties of flowers are skyrocketing because of which customers are buying more loose flowers than garlands.”“I too have suffered heavy loss as the entire yield of my marigold crops was washed away in floods in Phaphamau on the banks of Ganga,” he added.“Unlike every year when all flower sellers used to hit the jackpot during festive season, we have suffered hefty losses owing to the floods and rain this year,” said Kartik, a seller at Rajapur.Meanwhile, the devotees visiting the flower shops were not asking for sackful of flowers due to shooting prices.Madhu, a devotee at Kydganj, said, “This season, prices of rose and genda garlands are much higher compared to last year and I have bought only few garlands”.
