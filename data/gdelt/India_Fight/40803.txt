'Situation in J&K is not normal': Rahul Gandhi after being sent back from Srinagar airport

4/5

Before leaving Delhi, the leaders had insisted that they were only going to assess the ground realities and not for creating any disturbance.

"Our motive is not to go and create a disturbance. We are not going as government's opposition, we are going in government's support so that we too can give suggestions as about things that can be done," he said while talking to ANI, hours before leaving for Jammu Kashmir.

"If the situation is normal, why they are objecting to our visit? And if they are objecting, they should accept that the situation is not normal. We don't need security," RJD leader Manoj Jha said.

Ghulam Nabi Azad also slammed the government asking why political leaders are under house arrest if the situation is normal.

"If the situation is normal, why political leaders are under house arrest? If the situation is normal, why I, a former Chief Minister of the state, is not being allowed to go to my home?" he questioned while talking to reporters.

Terming it a contradiction of government's stand, he further added, "It has been around 20 days. On one hand, the government says everything is normal and on the other hand, it doesn't allow anyone to go there. I have never seen such a contradiction."

"The political parties which are going under the leadership of Rahul Gandhi are responsible political outfits and all of us are responsible leaders. We are not going to break the law. The issue of J-K, Ladakh is worrisome," he said while expressing concern about no statement being issued by the Home Ministry on the situation.
