Party turns tragic: 23-yr-old dies in fight with friend

Ludhiana: Birthday celebrations of a friend’s son turned tragic for a 23-year-old youth, who died in a fight with his another friend at a restaurant in Mundiya area late on Wednesday night. All the friends were drunk when the incident took place.

The Mundiya police on Thursday arrested Sundar Kumar, 20, of Ram Nagar for the death of Mithun Kumar (also of Ram Nagar) under Section 304 (punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC.

A group of six friends — Surinder Kumar, Mithun Kumar, Sundar Kumar, Manoj, Pappu and Parshotam — had gone to the restaurant in GK Estate following a party at the residence of Surinder at Ram Nagar. Surinder had thrown the party to celebrate his son Nitin’s first birthday.

Assistant sub-inspector Harbhajan Singh, in-charge, Mundiya police post, said all friends were in an inebriated condition when Mithun and Sundar got in an argument. They started abusing each other. Soon, Sundar started to thrash Mithun.

The ASI said restaurant owner Balbir Singh intervened and asked both Mithun and Sundar to go out. After coming out of the restaurant, Sundar pushed Mithun as a result of which he fell down and his head hit hard on floor. As Mithun sustained head injury, Sundar got scared and fled the spot, police said.

The restaurant workers raised the alarm after which Mithun was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him brought dead.

The ASI said all friends lived in Ram Nagar area and were fish sellers. Since all were drunk, nobody knew what exactly happened between Mithun and Sundar and what triggered the fight between them.

ASI Harbhajan said the police arrested Sundar on Thursday morning.
