PATIALA: Fighting for a cause, general secretary of the Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers’ Association, Dr D S Bhullar, who has a rare blood group and has not only donated blood for 58 times, but has also been fighting against the stray dog menace and sterilization of dogs.Having ‘A-negative’ blood group, Dr D S Bhullar has been donating blood since 1982.But from the last 4 years, he claims to have lowered the number. He started the campaign to get donors of rare blood groups available on a phone call.“A few years ago, I formed negative blood group association in Punjab and campaigned to get them available on a phone call. This also saves their blood from getting wasted by not being utilized. Blood once donated for storage has validity. I had also sent a proposal to the Red Cross Society and urged them to get the names of such rare blood group donors registered,” said Dr Bhullar.Besides, Dr Bhullar also launched a massive campaign for helping ambulances get way on roads.“In 2015, I had launched a campaign “Give Way to Ambulance” and motivated people about this social cause. Till now, I have got over 10,000 people pledged for the same,” said Dr Bhullar.The Patiala-based doctor, who is a medical superintendent at Government Dental College and Hospital, had also fought against dog-bite menace for four years in public interest. He collected cases of dog bites and fought cases against the corporation, but all had fallen in vain.
