A major fire broke out on the sets of Varun Dhawan and Sara Ali Khan starrer 'Coolie No. 1' at Filmistan Studio in Goregaon, Mumbai in the wee hours of September 11. The mishap reportedly occurred around 1 AM with approximately 15 workers on the set at the time of fire, who immediately called cops and the fire station. The fire was put out timely and there are no reports of any casualty. However, the cause of the fire is yet to be known. When Filmmaker Anurag Kashyap turned 47 recently, fans got a sneak peek of his super cute social media banter with girlfriend Shubhra Shetty. Sharing an adorable picture of herself with Anurag on her Instagram story she wrote, ’You have lived 17,166 days. Keep going.’ Re-sharing her story Anurag wrote, ’Thank you. And since you lived only 9,547 days, so don’t even compete.’ Last year in an interview, Anurag revealed that after a long time, he is in relationship again.
