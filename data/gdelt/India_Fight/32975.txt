Delhi HC moved for monitored probe into temple attack

New Delhi, July 3 : A plea was filed in the Delhi High Court on Wednesday seeking a court monitored investigation into the attack on a Hindu temple during communal strife in old Delhi.

The petition filed by advocate Alakh Alok Srivastava sought the court's direction to set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) duly monitored by the court to investigate the "conspiracy" behind the attack on an old Durga temple at Lal Kuan in Hauz Qazi area.

The advocate also sought departmental action against police officials who failed to avert the sacrilege.

"The brazen attack on a Hindu temple by a mob of about 200 persons categorically shows that the attackers were not having any fear of the police and the law enforcement agencies and thus suitable departmental action is required against the concerned police officials," the plea read.

Srivastava also alleged that there seemed to be "a deep rooted conspiracy" behind the incident and added that proper guidelines must be framed to prevent any such attack in the future for the sake of communal harmony.

Trouble erupted late on Sunday in Hauz Qazi over parking of vehicles and quickly assumed communal overtones, forcing authorities to deploy a large contingent of police and paramilitary forces.

Union Minister Harsh Vardhan, who represents the area in the Lok Sabha, had also condemned the attack on the temple.
