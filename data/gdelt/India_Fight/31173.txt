One dead in fire at under-construction Navy warship at Mumbai's Mazgaon dockyard

New Delhi:

A major fire broke out at an under-construction warship of the Navy at Mazgaon Dockyard in Mumbai on Friday evening in which one person was killed, an official said. "Under-construction warship 'Visakhapatnam' caught fire at 5.44 pm. The blaze erupted on the second deck of the ship," chief of the city fire brigade PS Rahangdale had said earlier.

"Fire is confined to second and third deck of the warship. Fire-fighting operation is underway along with Dockyard fire-fighters. Smoke has spread in the warship," Rahangdale said.

A defence official said one person, who was trapped inside, was dead. "Bajendra Kumar (23) was brought dead to the hospital," the Chief Medical officer of state-run JJ hospital said.

"The cause of the fire will be ascertained after a proper inquiry, but the first priority is to douse the fire with a minimum loss," another fire brigade official said.

Mazgaon Dockyard is the only facility in India having capability to build sub-marines. Visakhapatnam, the largest warship of its class, was unveiled for construction in Mazgaon Docks in April 2015. It is the first of the four stealth guided missile destroyers to be built under Project 15-B Class.
