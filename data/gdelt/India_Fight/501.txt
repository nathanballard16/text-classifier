The main accused in the Bulandshahr violence, Bajrang Dal district convener Yogesh Raj, was finally arrested today, a month after a mob lynched Syana Station House Officer (SHO) Subodh Kumar Singh on December 3. A civilian, Sumit, too was killed.

Raj, believed to be the mastermind behind the Bulandshahr violence, had been on the run. He had released a video on the social media, claiming he was innocent. The police had raided his residence and hideouts and issued a notice that his property would be impounded.

Bulandshahr SP Prabhakar Chaudhary said acting on intelligence inputs, Raj was arrested from the Khurja T-point on National Highway 91. After a medical examination, he was presented before a local court for judicial remand.

Sources said the police arrested Raj late Wednesday night as pressure from local BJP leaders mounted. Earlier this week, the Syana police had arrested Prashant Nat, who allegedly severed the deceased inspector’s fingers before he was shot. The axe used in the crime has been recovered.

The widow of the slain police officer, Rajni Singh, said the arrest would help check “goonda raj”. Till date, 33 persons have been arrested for the mob violence that followed after a cow carcass was found in the fields of Raj Kumar, a former gram pradhan of Mahav village, one of the accused in the FIR.

Yogesh Raj had registered the first case, naming seven persons, five of them members of the masjid committee, who were found innocent. Satish and Vineet, also accused of violence, and Azhar, accused of alleged cow slaughter, had surrendered in a court in Bulandshahr on Wednesday.
