Pulwama attack: UN High Commissioner strongly condemns terror attack, calls on authorities to bring those responsible to justice

In New Delhi, India's Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Tuesday directed officials to ensure protection of innocent Kashmiris living in different parts of the country. "We acknowledge actions taken by the Indian authorities to tackle these incidents and we hope that the Government will continue to take steps to protect people from all forms of harm that may be directed at them on account of their ethnicity or identity," Colville said.

Strongly condemning the suicide bomb attack against Indian security forces in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Michelle Bachelet has called on authorities to bring those responsible to justice. The top United Nations human rights official is also saddened by the further loss of life from subsequent gun battles in the same area on Monday. Rupert Colville, the spokesperson for the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) was quoted as saying that, "The High Commissioner strongly condemns the suicide bomb attack against Indian security forces in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February and calls on authorities to bring those responsible to justice." The UN Human Rights chief expressed hope that escalating tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours "will not add further to the insecurity in the region". In the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, Colville said the High Commissioner is also "concerned" by reports from India that "some elements" are using the attack as "justification for threats and potential acts of violence" targeting Kashmiri people living in different parts of India.
