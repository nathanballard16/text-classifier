In the first incident of post-poll violence in Uttar Pradesh, Amethi MP-elect Smriti Irani’s confidant Surendra Singh, 50, a former head of Baraulia village, was shot dead by unidentified persons late Saturday night.

Irani, who rushed to Amethi this morning, was one of the pall-bearers at the cremation. She had publicly praised Surendra Singh on several occasions during campaigning for his support.

OP Singh, the state DGP, said seven persons had been detained. “Our teams are investigating all angles, including personal enmity and political rivalry. I am confident we will crack the case within 12 hours,” he said.

A former village pradhan, Surendra Singh had campaigned extensively for Irani and organised “Vijay Yatra (victory procession)” after her historic win against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi with a margin of 55,120 votes. He was attacked while at home.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the DGP to take quick action. Lucknow IG Praveen Kumar has been sent to Amethi to monitor the investigation.

Abhay Singh, the son of the deceased, said: “I think some pro-Congress anti-social elements did not like us celebrating BJP’s win.”

Baraulia was in the news after Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra accused Irani of distributing shoes to residents to insult Rahul Gandhi.
