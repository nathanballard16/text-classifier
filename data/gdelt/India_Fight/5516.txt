HYDERABAD -- The civil society representatives took out a rally here on Sunday demanding arrest of the Union Council Chairman Raheem Shah who allegedly shot dead Irshad Ranjhani in Karachi on February 6.

The participants started the march from Model School and ended it outside Hyderabad Press Club. Human Rights Commission of Pakistan's coordinator for Sindh Imdad Chandio said Ranjhani's murder in broad day light and in front of so many people was a blatant violation of the human rights.

He said the manner in which Ranjhani was killed and subsequent circulation of video of the killing over the social media had dented the perception about security as well.

Punhal Sariyo, a peasant's rights activist, said the alleged killer Shah was booked in several criminal cases but the provincial government delayed his arrest even after Ranjhani's murder. 'Both Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz are helping the killer,' he alleged. Prof Mustaq Meerani said a judicial inquiry should be conducted over the incident and the murderer should be brought to book. He maintained that slain Ranjhani was being depicted as an outlaw to influence the case in Shah's favour.

Women Action Forum's Amar Sindhu, Strengthening Participatory Organization's Mustafa Baloch, advocate Amjad Palijo and others also spoke.
