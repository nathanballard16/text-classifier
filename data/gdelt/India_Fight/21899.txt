MP: Gang which carried out fake I-T raids to extort money held

A gang of five people which carried out bogus Income Tax raids on businessmen on the lines of Hindi heist film "Special 26" to extort money have been busted, police said Tuesday.

Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) Amrendra Singh identified them as Devendra Dabar (29), Sunil Mandloi (24), Ravi Solanki (24), Durgesh Gehlot (23) and Satish Gawad (30) and said several documents were recovered from them.

"Gang leader Dabar would pose as chief investigation officer of intelligence and criminal Investigation section of Income Tax department. He also carried a fake identity card," Singh said.

The official said there are leads that the gang had carried out a fake income tax raid in Burhanpur town some time back and extorted the money.

The gang had gathered information about the movable and immovable assets of around 35 prominent businessmen of Dhar, Khandwa, Dewas, Khargone, Jhabua, Alirajpur and Indore, he said, adding that the gang was preparing to carry out an 'income tax raid' when they were nabbed.

The additional SP said that the gang was running a fake I-T department office in Silicon City of Indore and had duped 80 unemployed youth of Rs 40 lakh after promising them jobs.

Fake seals of the Income Tax department, police uniforms along with name plates with "Government of India" inscribed on them have been seized, he said.
