It was initially intimidating as cameras were following me everywhere, but now I am getting used to it. Initially, I was apprehensive about being a part of this show. I pondered over the offer and felt that this would be a good opportunity to share my journey with other women. I am someone who began from nowhere and I think I have been able to achieve what I wanted to. Also, I wanted to show that nothing comes easy. One has to work hard to lead a certain lifestyle.”Makeup artist Guneet Virdi will also be a part of this show. She sas that her life hasn’t changed much since she started shooting for the show as she was used to cameras. “I have been shooting for ad campaigns and songs, so being on the camera was not a big deal. I am enjoying shooting while I am leading my regular life. I am also looking forward to knowing about the lives of other women who are being featured in the show,” she says.Other women who are a part of the show are entrepreneur Reena Mittal, beauty salon owner Sona Sharma, Deepshikha Lungani, former model, Seema Gumber, event planner, Rashmi Sachdeva, former model, Pooja Dua, social activist, Pragati Nagpal, fashion designer, and Shaloo Jindal, homemaker.
