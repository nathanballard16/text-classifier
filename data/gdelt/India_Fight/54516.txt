police blocking service roads

IJM, Malaysia has built very functional service roads in front of the main gate of Rain Tree Park aka Malaysian Township, to facilitate easy merger into and splitting from the main road.With the provision of the road over bridge connecting JNTU to Rain Tree Park, the speed of vehicles on this road increased exponentially, which resulted in a fatal accident in front of the gate few months ago.In these circumstances, instead of improving safety, the traffic police blocked the service road making it dangerous for RTP residents to enter or split away from the main road.I appeal to the concerned minister and traffic police authorities, to remove these blockades immediately and take appropriate action on the irresponsible authorities who created this mess, thoughtlessly.
