BJP Govt Sends J&K’s Own ‘KPS Gill’ To Home State – With A Purpose

With no political background, the other four Advisors to the Governor are either retired IPS or retired IAS officers.

Khursheed Ahmad Ganai, a permanent resident of Kashmir, is a 1982 batch IAS officer of the J&K cadre, who is in his second stint as Advisor to the Governor. Former CM Mehbooba Mufti’s then PDP-BJP government had appointed him as J&K’s Chief Information Commissioner. However, NN Vohra got him back as Advisor, after the Governor’s Rule was imposed following the BJP’s withdrawal of support to Mufti in June 2018.

Kewal Krishen Sharma, a permanent resident of Jammu, is a 1983 batch IAS officer of AGMUT cadre. He was inducted as an Advisor by Governor Satya Pal Malik in November 2018, weeks before his Advisor BB Vyas was appointed as a member of the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC).

K Skandan is a 1982 batch IAS officer of the Tamil Nadu cadre. Before his retirement, he served as Joint Secretary (J&K) in the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for two years. Later, as an Additional Secretary in the MHA, Skandan remained associated with J&K for about three years.
