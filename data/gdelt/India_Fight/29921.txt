UPPSC officers threaten boycott if police raid headquarters

LUCKNOW: The officers’ union of Uttar Pradesh Public Service Commission has threatened to boycott examinations conducted by the commission and results related work if police carry out raids at UPPSC headquarters in Allahabad to probe Licentiate Grade Assistant Teachers’ Examinations-2018 paper leak case.Varanasi police have approached a local court seeking warrant to search UPPSC premises.On May 30, UP STF and Varanasi police had arrested UPPSC examination controller Anju Katiyar in the case. Varanasi police had sought the cooperation of UPPSC officials in the probe but in vain. Following this, investigating officer Anil Rai filed a plea in the court of special judge (anti-corruption) Lal Chandra in Varanasi on June 11 seeking warrant to search UPPSC premises. The matter would come up for hearing after the return of the judge from leave.“The application was filed in the court after UPPSC top officials did not cooperate with us in the paper leak case. We had sought documents and other information regarding examination controller Anju Katiyar from UPPSC chairman Aniruddh Yadav but he is yet to act,” ASP (crime) Varanasi Gyanendra Nath Prasad told TOI.UPPSC Employees/Officers’ Association president Dinesh Kumar said UPPSC is a constitutional body and police cannot enter into its premises to carry out searches.“We will also explore the legal option if any such attempt is made by police or the special task force,” he said. “We are supporting Anju Katiyar and if the police carry out searches then we will have no option but to indefinitely boycott examinations and that would hamper the results of thousands of UPPSC candidates,” Kumar added.The association has claimed that UP STF and police raid at UPPSC office on May 30 — a first in the commission’s history — and the subsequent arrest of Anju Katiyar were done in a haste.
