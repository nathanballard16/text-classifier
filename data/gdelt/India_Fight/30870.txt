Brother-in-law, aide, held in murder case

Ludhiana: Two months after a 30-year-old mason was murdered, Sahnewal police have arrested his brother-in-law and his accomplice from Chhatarpur of Madhya Pradesh. The police team is on the way back to Ludhiana and is likely to reach the city on Thursday.

The arrested accused have been identified as Ankit and his friend Bhupinder Singh. The deceased Raj Kumar, 30, had an inter-caste marriage against the wishes of his wife’s family eight years ago and later shifted to Ludhiana. The couple also has two children.

Rakhi, sister of the deceased said their family belongs to a lower cast, while her sister-in-law Deepa hailed from an upper cast family. Therefore, Deepa’s family was against the marriage. From the past few months, Deepa had started talking to her family members on phone, and came under the impression that her family was no longer against her marriage.

On April 2, Ankit with his friend Bhupinder Singh went to Raj’s house. Next day, the duo took Raj towards Canal Bridge on the pretext of an evening walk. After reaching Canal Bridge, Bhupinder held Raj Kumar, while Ankit allegedly stabbed him in his neck with a sharp-edged weapon.

Sahnewal police station SHO Iqbal Singh said a case under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC has been registered against Ankit and Bhupinder.
