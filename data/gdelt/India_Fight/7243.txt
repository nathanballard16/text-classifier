ISLAMABAD: Finance Minister Asad Umar on Monday urged India to listen to the people of Kashmir and warned the country that Kashmiris would not lose their determination to break free from its subjugation.

“India needs to listen to the people of Kashmir. It must realize that the more they try and repress the people of Kashmir through violence the more determined Kashmiris become to break free from the subjugation by India,” he tweeted.

“No amount of scapegoating Pakistan will change that reality,” the minister added.

Some 44 Indian paramilitary personnel were killed last week when an explosives-packed van rammed a convoy transporting 2,500 security forces in Pulwama, in the deadliest attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir in 30 years.

The attack worsened the already sour relations between India and Pakistan, as New Delhi piled the blame on Islamabad for the attack -- which was strongly refuted by the Pakistani leadership.
