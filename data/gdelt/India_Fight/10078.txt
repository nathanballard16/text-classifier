PM Modi: Country in safe hands, declares PM Modi after IAF air strike in Pakisan

NEW DELHI: India is in safe hands, Prime Minister Narendra Modi assured the nation in a rousing speech hours after the air strike on terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad ’s biggest training camp in Pakistan and vowed not to let the country be destroyed, halted or humbled.“Today, from the land of Churu, I want to assure the people of the country that the country is in safe hands,” Modi said at a public rally in Rajasthan on Tuesday afternoon, speaking against a backdrop of pictures of the Central Reserve Police Force personnel killed 12 days earlier in a terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama for which Pakistan-based JeM was quick to take responsibility.Referring to the pledge he had made during the election campaign in 2014, he reiterated, “Saugandh mujhe iss mitti ki, Main desh nahin mitne doonga, Main desh nahin rukne doonga, Main desh nahin jhukne doonga (I swear by this land I won’t let my country be destroyed, halted or humbled).”Without making a direct reference to the operation carried out by the Indian Air Force in the wee hours of Tuesday, he began by asking people to raise slogans of ‘Bharat Mata Ki Jai’ and said, “Today your mood seems a lot different. I can understand this josh (enthusiasm). Today is a moment when we should salute our brave soldiers.”Modi also underlined in his address that nothing was above the nation. “Nothing is above the nation. Those who serve the nation, everyone who is engaged in nation building, Pradhan Sevak (prime servant, as he often refers to himself) once again greets them,” he said.The PM headed for the rally in Churu, not far from the international border with Pakistan, after chairing a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Security in Delhi following the air strike which he is believed to have monitored through the night.In his address, he also acknowledged the contribution of Churu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu in the armed forces, saying soldiers from these areas are guarding the nation’s borders.Later in the day, speaking at an event at the ISKCON temple in Delhi, Modi alluded to the air strike saying, “God gives us strength to send a message to those demons and bad souls who are a threat to mankind and motherland.” BJP chief Amit Shah was more direct, saying at Ghazipur in Uttar Pradesh that the air strike would have provided solace to the families of the CRPF jawans martyred in the Pulwama attack in Jammu and Kashmir. “First we did surgical strikes after Uri (terrorist attack in 2016) and now with this air strike we have given a message to the world that India under Modi can go to any extent to safeguard itself,” he said.According to people aware of the matter, the PM had directed national security adviser Ajit Doval and the armed forces to launch a “decisive action” against JeM’s terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan. They said the Indian security establishment had information on JeM’s biggest training camp located in Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province which the National Investigation Agency had identified as a major training ground of Jaish during its probe of the Pathankot terrorist attack of 2016.The government opted for an air strike owing to the location of the target deep inside Pakistan and an assurance from the Air Force that Indian jets would return without suffering any casualty, said one person.The PM was keen on striking at the “root of the terror factory” and stopping further attacks on Indian soil, the person said.
