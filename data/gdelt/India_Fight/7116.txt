Pak-incubated terror unites Delhi, Tehran

New Delhi, February 17

Pakistan came under pressure over its incubation of terrorism after Iran made a common cause with India and the US pulled out from talks with the Taliban that it was to host.

Iran joined India in berating Pakistan for sheltering terrorists after its security forces were hit by the deadliest attack in recent times. India and Iran say they have incontrovertible evidence about Pakistan’s complicity and have vowed that it will pay a heavy price for harbouring and funding these groups.

“Iran and India suffered from two heinous terrorist attacks in the past few days resulting in big casualties. Today in my meeting with Sushma Swaraj the Indian FM, when she had a stopover in Tehran, we agreed on close cooperation to combat terrorism in the region. Enough is enough!,” tweeted the Iranian deputy foreign minister Syed Abas Araghchi.

Even as three of Pakistan’s neighbours — India, Iran and Afghanistan — now accuse it of being complicit with cross-border terrorists, its plan to be useful in the American scheme suffered a setback after Washington decided not to go ahead with the talks with the Taliban scheduled in Islamabad for Monday.

Both Iran and India have reasons to be worried about the bombing in Iran since it took place in an area where India has planned major investment in a port, a transport artery and industrial projects. The Iranian minister’s comments about solidarity with India set off a social media war. He was reminded that less than a year back, Khamenei had bracketed Kashmir with six places where Muslims were oppressed and hoped “their people will push their enemies back with the help of resistance in the near future.” — TNS
