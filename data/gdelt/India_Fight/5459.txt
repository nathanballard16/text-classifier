Traffic in knots as Prime Minister takes the road

Noida: Three main points in the city got blocked for traffic on Monday after a sudden change in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s arrival plan at the Expo Mart. The traffic police blocked the Noida-Delhi border at Chilla, DND Flyway and New Ashok Nagar.Earlier, the PM was supposed to fly to the venue, but had to take the road due to poor visibility. His convoy started from Race Course Road at 10.23am to reach Greater Noida.The traffic police received a message about the change in Modi’s plan only after 9 am but they soon flung into action and diverted the traffic.Traffic from the three major routes had to be completely blocked between 9.45am and 10.15am, with commuters caught unawares by the delayed traffic diversion necessitated by the VVIP movement.The traffic police on Monday evening issued an advisory, asking commuters to use alternative routes between 4-7pm on Tuesday, owing to the movement of dignitaries.
