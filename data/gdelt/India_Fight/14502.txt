India, Pakistan should initiate talks: German Foreign Minister

Islamabad [Pakistan], Mar 12 (ANI): German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas on Tuesday voiced concern over escalating tension between India and Pakistan and urged New Delhi and Islamabad to initiate talks to de-escalate the situation.

Addressing a press conference here, Maas said, "I am concerned about the tense relations between India and Pakistan. I urge Islamabad and New Delhi to solve disputes through dialogues."

Mass reached Islamabad on Tuesday for his two-day visit.

Tensions between India and Pakistan heightened following the February 14 terror attack in Pulwama which claimed the lives of 40 CRPF personnel. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Muhammed claimed responsibility for the attack.

Less than two weeks after the attack, India carried out air strikes at a JeM training camp in Balakot in Pakistan, eliminating a "large number" of terrorists, according to India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.

The very next day, Pakistani jets violated Indian air space and dropped bombs in the Rajouri sector in Jammu and Kashmir. India said it foiled an attempt by the Pakistan Air Force to carry out strikes in the state by shooting down an F-16 fighter plane. (ANI)
