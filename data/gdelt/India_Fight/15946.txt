Big Isle police arrest suspect in Puna fatal shooting after islandwide manhunt

Hawaii island police Tuesday arrested a 35-year-old Puna man who was the subject of an all-points bulletin after the shooting death of a 38-year-old man early Monday.

The Hawaii County Police Department said Ryan Frederick Davis was taken into custody this morning after being located by detectives from the Area I Criminal Investigation Section and Special Enforcement Unit at about 11:30 a.m. on Plumeria Street in Fern Acres.

Davis was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder in the shooting of Joshua John Santos of Puna.

Patrol officers responded to a report early Monday of a man with a gunshot wound lying in the driveway of a Plumeria Street residence in Puna. When they arrived at the Fern Acres subdivision, they found Santos unresponsive.

The medical examiner determined gunshot wounds to the chest were the cause of death, according to the police department.

Davis is being held in the police cellblock while detectives continue to investigate, police said.

Earlier today, police issued an islandwide all-points bulletin, warning the public not to approach Davis as he is considered armed and dangerous.
