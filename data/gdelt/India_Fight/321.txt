ISLAMABAD, Jan. 3 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani Army said late Wednesday that it has shot down an Indian drone in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir area, marking the second drone brought down in two days.

The army spokesman Asif Ghafoor said on Twitter that Pakistan army troops shot down another Indian spy quadcopter in Satwal sector near the Line of Control (LoC), which divides both countries in Kashmir.

The Pakistan army said Tuesday that it had shot down an Indian spy quadcopter in Bagh sector.

The incidents came at a time when relations between the two neighbors are tense over cross-border firing.

The army said Monday that Indian forces killed a woman and injured nine civilians along the LoC during a cross LoC firing.

Pakistan and India had declared ceasefire along the LoC in 2003, but both accuse each other of ceasefire violations.
