Zakir Naik’s efforts to cross over into the Maldives thwarted, says former Maldives PM

Former Maldives Prime Minister Mohamed Nasheed who is on a visit to the National Capital, on Friday said that the controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik’s efforts to cross over into the Maldives were thwarted.

“He (Naik) was trying to come to the Maldives but we did not allow him to come,” said Nasheed, who currently is serving as the Speaker of Maldivian Parliament.

When questioned about Maldives and Malaysia having any discussions regarding Naik’s extradition, Nasheed said, “He was not allowed to come to the Maldives recently so there would have been discussions (between Malaysia and Maldives).”

Leading a Parliamentary delegation, the former Maldivian Prime Minister is in the National Capital for the 6th Joint Commission meeting with India. Several Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and agreements have been signed between the two sides.
