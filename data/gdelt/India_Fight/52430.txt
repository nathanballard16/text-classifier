A war of words has broken out between the BJP and the Trinamul Congress over paramilitary forces in three Assembly segments where bypolls will be held on Monday. Byelections will be held in Karimpur (Nadia district), Kharagpur Sadar (West Midnapore) and Kaliaganj (North Dinajpur).

The three constituencies are witnessing triangular contest involving Trinamul, BJP and the Left-Congress combine. But the main fight is between the ruling parties in the state and at the Centre. This is the first time the two parties are in an electoral battle after the Lok Sabha polls in which the BJP bagged 18 of 42 seats in Bengal. On the eve of the voting, the Election Commission of India came under attack from Trinamul and the BJP over deployment of central forces. In Karimpur, 90 per cent of the 261 polling stations will be manned by central armed police forces (CAPF) as opposed to 70 per cent and 43 per cent in Kharagpur Sadar and Kaliaganj, respectively (see chart). “Such large difference in the CAPF deployment is a clear indication of how the poll panel is functioning. It appears that the commission has been trying to satisfy a particular political party,” a Trinamul leader in Karimpur said. According to Trinamul’s internal calculations, Karimpur that fell vacant following Trinamul MLA Mahua Moitra’s win from Krishnagar Lok Sabh seat is a safe bet. But the party feels the contest is tough in Kharagpur Sadar and Kaliaganj, which were won by the BJP and the Congress in the 2016 Assembly polls.
