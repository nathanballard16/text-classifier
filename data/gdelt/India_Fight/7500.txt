Six Army men killed this year

Hyderabad: With a Major and three jawans killed in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists in Kashmir on Monday, the number of Army personnel killed on duty stands at six in the first six weeks of this year.

A head constable of the CRPF was also killed in the cross-firing. The injured included DIG (South Kashmir) Amit Kumar, who received a gunshot wound in the abdomen, and an brigade commander, who was hurt in the leg. While last week’s Pulwama attack was among the biggest ever, terrorists had carried out a suicide attack on an Army camp at Sunjuwan in Jammu, on February 10 last year, in which six personnel were killed and six injured.

On February 12, last year, terrorists tried to enter a CRPF camp in Karan Nagar in Srinagar, but were repulsed by the alert sentry. Terrorists took refuge in a nearby under- construction building. During searches, an exchange of fire resulted in the death of a CRPF jawan.
