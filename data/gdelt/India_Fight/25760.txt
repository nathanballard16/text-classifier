Pro-talk ULFA leader, actress detained for Guwahati grenade blast

A leader from the pro-talks faction of the United Liberation Front of Assam (ULFA) and an actress have been detained by police in connection with Wednesday’s grenade blast in Guwahati in which 11 people were injured.

According to reports, the police raided a house in the Panjabari area of the city on Thursday and recovered some explosives, a pistol and 25 rounds of live ammunition. The police are yet to confirm the find.

“Our investigations are continuing and we have made satisfactory progress. But we won’t be able to divulge details at the moment,” said Assam Police DGP, Kuladhar Saikia.

The actress has been identified as Jahnabi Saikia and the pro-talk ULFA leader is Pranamay Rajguru. The actress had taken the house on rent around 10 days ago.

A grenade lobbed near a security check point outside a shopping mall had resulted in 11 persons, including two Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) personnel getting injured.

The banned United Liberation Front of Assam-Independent (ULFA-I), the anti-talks faction of the outfit, claimed responsibility for the blast.

“The revolution will be successful. Till there is a political solution to our demand, such incidents will keep occurring. I am not involved in the blast,” Rajguru told journalists, after he was detained for questioning by the police.

It is suspected that continued operations in recent weeks by security forces in Myanmar and India on outfits which have camps in the neighbouring country, may have led ULFA-I to carry out Wednesday’s blast.
