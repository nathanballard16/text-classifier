WhatsApp will roll out payments service in India this year: Will Cathcart

Payments through WhatsApp were introduced to a test group of a million users in February last year. The service is based on the Unified Payments Interface standard, which has been developed by the National Payments Corporation of India. “The idea is to make it easy for someone to send money to someone else through WhatsApp - the same way they send a message. We believe that if we get this right, it will accelerate financial inclusion and bring value for people in India’s fast-growing digital economy, We can’t wait to provide the service to more users all across India later this year,” said Cathcart.
