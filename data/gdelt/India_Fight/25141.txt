Chennai: Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan has stirred a fresh row by saying that independent India's first terrorist was a 'Hindu'. Addressing a rally during a by-poll campaign, the Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder said that Nathuram Godse was the first terrorist of independent India.

"I am not saying this because this is a Muslim dominated area. I am telling this because it is in front of the Gandhi statue. Independent India's first terrorist was a Hindu. His name was Nathuram Godse," Haasan said at the rally on Sunday.

"It starts from there. I'm Gandhi's great-grandson. I'm here to seek justice for that murder... I'll thump my heart and say that I'm a good Indian and any Good Indian will want the country to be peaceful and equal to all. He will always want the tricolours of the national flag to remain the same always," Haasan said while campaigning for his candidate in Aravakurichi for the upcoming by-polls. The Aravakurichi constituency in Tamil Nadu goes to polls on May 19.

Even earlier, Haasan had invited ire when he had referred to Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) as Azad Kashmir and batted for a plebiscite in Kashmir. He had reportedly made the comments in response to a question on Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 terrorists. Later, however, he had claimed that his statements were taken out of context.
