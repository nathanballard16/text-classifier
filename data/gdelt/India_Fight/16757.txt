Two killed as GSRTC bus crashes into rickshaw

An ST bus rammed into the auto-rickshaw leaving it completely mangled

Vadodara: Two tent labourers were killed in a road accident at Jhalod taluka in Dahod on Sunday afternoon. Deceased Sukram Sangada (42) and his cousin Ajay Sangada (18) had gone to Jhalod town in their autorickshaw to build a ‘shamiana’ for a wedding.

While returning, an ST bus coming from Santrampur side rammed into the auto-rickshaw, leaving the 3-wheeler completely mangled and upturned.

Ajay, who was driving the auto-rickshaw, died on the spot from the grievous injuries he received from the collision. Sukram succumbed on the way to the hospital. The ST bus driver fled the scene leaving the bus.

Sukram’s brother Manji Sangada registered a complaint of rash driving and death due to negligence against the ST bus driver at the Jhalod police station.tnn
