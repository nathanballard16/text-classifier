Delhi doctor who took a stand against hospital dies, relatives cry ‘murder’

NEW DELHI: Family members of Dr Aastha Munjal, who was found dead under mysterious circumstances at Maharaja Agrasen Hospital, have claimed that she had protested against some practices of the hospital management due to which she was allegedly harassed by her seniors. Munjal’s friends have started a campaign on change.org to demand justice. Her uncle, Jitender Harjai, said Munjal had joined the hospital five months ago and had allegedly raised questions about the authorities keeping brain-dead patients on ventilators for long duration. She had also opposed the management’s decision asking doctors to get themselves vaccinated against swine flu from government hospitals.“She had got into arguments with her seniors about this and spoke about it on social media as well. We feel that her conflicts had led to her murder,” said Harjai. The uncle said that she had planned to complete her specialisation and practise medicine elsewhere.On Saturday night, Munjal called her husband, Udit Dhingra, and sounded flustered. Police suspect this to be a case of abatement to suicide and are questioning her colleagues and seniors. In their campaign for justice, the relatives stated, “She was very happy on family front . She was murdered on duty on the hospital premises.” Her father R K Munjal, a businessman in south Delhi, claims she did not plan to pursue her job at the hospital due to the friction with the seniors.He said, “Aastha had got a new phone and had texted me about having lunch on Saturday morning. Why would she commit suicide? Meanwhile, a spokesperson of the hospital said the management is conducting an internal inquiry. “She was a cooperative, cheerful and intelligent doctor. She never had any issue with any of her colleagues or staff. She was a hardworking and responsible student,” the spokesperson said.
