For Bhiwadi Dalit couple, marriage is the message

ALWAR: In the nondescript Dalit-dominated Karoli village of Bhiwadi tehsil , a marriage has challenged age-old social taboos, sending a strong message of social justice, gender equality and eco-friendliness to society in the process.The marriage, solemnized on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday, saw the groom, Ajay Jatav, gifting a full-fledged library to villagers, the first repository of books in the village. Jatav, who works for a private company in Hyderabad, urged the ‘baraatis’ to use the library to increase their understanding and knowledge.The bride, Babita Jatav, did the unthinkable by riding a chariot to the groom’s house. The message of social equality and gender neutrality has come in a region where Dalits are often prevented from using horses or chariots for marriage ceremonies.“I and Ajay had long decided that our marriage should provoke the thought of social justice in our society. I am happy that our ideas were accepted by both families and I hope that the society will follow the new rules set by our marriage,” said Babita. The ceremony was kept simple with no exchange of gifts.The couple also distributed a short summary of the Constitution and a sapling to each ‘baraati’. The duo didn’t stop there. They planned each and every ritual without the use of plastic, by using steel utensils in place of disposables and serving water in traditional earthen glasses.The wedding card was also wrapped in a piece of cloth. “I am inspired by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the way he is battling the menace of plastics. I just thought to do my bit to save the environment,” said Ajay.
