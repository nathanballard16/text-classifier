NEW DELHI, Nov. 7 (Xinhua) -- A paramilitary trooper belonging to Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) was killed Thursday in a fierce gunfight with Naxals in central Indian state of Chattisgarh, officials said.

The gunfight broke out at Pamed area of Bijapur district, about 508 km south of Raipur, the capital city of Chhattisgarh.

"Early today a gunfight broke out between Naxals and joint team of police and CRPF personnel in which a CRPF paramilitary trooper was killed," a police official said.

According to officials, the joint contingents of police and CRPF have cordoned off the area and launched search operation on specific intelligence information suggesting presence of Naxals.

A CRPF spokesman identified the slain paramilitary trooper as Kamta Prasad.

"Constable Kamta Prasad sacrificed his life fighting Maoists (Naxals) in forests of Pamed in Bijapur of Chhattisgarh," the spokesman said.

Police officials said it was not known whether Naxals have suffered any casualties in the stand-off. However, reports said they escaped from the spot.

Naxalites are also known as "Maoists."

Currently Maoists are active in more than a third of India's 600-odd districts across central and eastern India.

India's former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once termed the Naxalite movement as India's "greatest internal security challenge."

New Delhi has deployed several companies of its paramilitary forces to take on Naxals in their strongholds.
