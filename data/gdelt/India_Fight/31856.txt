Officers who allowed illegal construction yet to be booked

SURAT: Many officials of Surat Municipal Corporation (SMC), who allowed illegal construction of a floor atop Takshashila Arcade where 22 people were killed in a fire accident on May 24, still remain unscathed. Parents of the deceased students are demanding strict action against these officials, but police are yet to take any action against them.Soon after the fire accident, senior SMC officers came to know that an individual had complained about encroachment of a public road by the builders of Takshashila Arcade.The online complaint was made by a citizen in February 2019 and junior engineer H D Singh was asked to look into it. However, no action was taken in the matter and Singh was then suspended for negligence by SMC authorities. Police are yet to take any action against Singh.“If SMC officers had acted on the complaint, lives of many people who died in the fire accident could have been saved. Officers did not take any action to clear the road and not even checked unauthorized construction in the building,” said the complainant.Multiple applications under RTI were made by Dipak Patel, an activist, to check fire safety in the buildings where educational institutes were operational.However, Patel did not receive any reply to his queries from the authorities concerned.“I had filed several RTI applications in the education department, but no action was taken by the officials. They did not even care to reply to many of my applications,” said Patel.Exactly a month after the tragedy, Patel started an indefinite fast on Monday demanding strict action against the officials of various government departments for negligence. Patel was detained by police and later released. Patel claims he is still continuing with his fast.“We are investigating the role of Singh. Action will be taken if his negligence is found,” city police commissioner Satish Sharma said.
