A 19-year-old Dalit girl was stabbed to death in broad daylight at a busy market place in Ahmedabad city on Wednesday evening. According to police, three persons have been arrested for the murder of Mittal Jadav, who was murdered outside her house in Main Bazar area of Bavla in Ahmedabad.

The accused have been identified as Ketan Vaghela, Shravan and Dhanraj, all believed to be in their early twenties.

“A murder case was registered at Bavla police station on Wednesday evening and the case was transferred to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Atrocities Cell. We have nabbed the two accused on Thursday morning while the third accused was arrested late night on the same day,” said PD Manvar, Deputy Superintendent of Police, SC/ST Cell.

Police have not revealed the motive behind the murder, saying that the parents of the victim have remained tight-lipped about the case.
