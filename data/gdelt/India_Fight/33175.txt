Fan thanks Vikrant Massey for his kindness

Vikrant Massey is one of the most versatile actors in Bollywood today. The actor started his acting journey on the small screen and then dazzled the audience with his acting chops on the silver screen. However, this is not the only amazing thing about the Lipstick Under My Burkha actor, as he also has a heart of gold.

Recently, a fan of Vikrant named Soumyajyoti Paul, took to Instagram to share a delightful tale of how the actor helped him when he was stuck at the airport and needed a phone to make his booking. Soumyajyoti shared a photo with Vikrant Massey and wrote, "Bollywood celebs are selfless and wonderful. This man, I repeat, @vikrantmassey87 has saved us at Heathrow Terminal 2 by helping us book our car to our hotel, when our phones weren’t working. Fanboying since Dhoom Machao Dhoom. "

Here's how Vikrant Massey helped a fan during his time of need:

Earlier, the actor was in news for a shocking incident involving a female fan. According to the report in Mid-day, the fan disrupted the shooting of his film in Delhi and insisted on meeting the actor, but that's not all, the person in question was dressed in bridal finery and insisted on meeting Vikrant.

In an interview with the daily, the actor confirmed the news and said, "Initially, I didn't know how to react. Although I was humbled, the fact was that I couldn't let her leave her wedding functions and had to ensure that she returned safely to her family. I will always be grateful for people loving my work and admiring me, but sometimes we are left in situations that throw us off balance. This was a bizarre incident."

On the work front, the actor has wrapped up shooting of Meghna Gulzar's Chhapaak. The film stars Deepika Padukone in the role of an acid attack survivor.
