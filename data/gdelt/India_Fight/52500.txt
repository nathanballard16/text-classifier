Money Bills and the Pakistan Supreme Court

In Mohd. Siddiqui, an amendment to extend the term of office of a Lokayukta through the Uttar Pradesh Lokayuktas (Amendment) Act, 2012, which was introduced and certified as a Money Bill, was upheld on the ground that the Speaker’s decision was final. A similar view was taken in Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal [2016 3 SCC 183], wherein it upheld the amendments that provided for confiscation of property, which were passed as Money Bills, on the ground that the Speaker’s decision was final. This was, in spite of the fact that the Supreme Court had taken a consistent view that the power of judicial review was a part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and that finality clauses could not exclude its power of judicial review. The Speaker’s decision is final only for the purposes of the legislative business in the Lok Sabha.
