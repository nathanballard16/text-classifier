Shriya Saran surprises Rajinikanth at Darbar shoot. See new pic

Shriya Saran has been maintaining a low profile in films after her marriage to Russian-based entrepreneur Andrei Koscheev in 2018. It looks like the actress is picky while choosing her upcoming films. She will be seen in Tamil film Sandakari with Vemal, which is expected to release later this year or early next year.

Recently, the actress came down to Mumbai for unknown reasons and she decided to surprise her Sivaji co-star Superstar Rajinikanth. She paid a casual visit to Darbar shooting spot in Mumbai and greeted Thalaivar, AR Murugadoss and stunt choreographer Peter Hein.

She also took a photo with Rajinikanth and the Darbar team, which is going viral on social media. Ever since the photo found its way to the internet, rumours are rife that Shriya might be roped in to do a cameo role in Darbar.

Here's the photo:

Sources close to the Darbar team revealed that Shriya is not doing a cameo and she just came to the set to visit Rajinikanth. Shriya and Rajinikanth shared screen space in director Shankar's Sivaji, which became a blockbuster hit.

Recently, Rajinikanth revealed that he has wrapped up the shooting of Darbar and that the film has shaped up well. Bankrolled by Lyca Productions, Darbar will hit the theatres on Pongal 2020. In the film, Rajinikanth will be seen in two roles, as that of a cop and a social activist.

Darbar, directed by AR Murugadoss, is a proper commercial venture starring Nayanthara, Suniel Shetty, Prateik Babbar, Yogi Babu and several others in pivotal roles.
