1 arrested for killing relative of RJD ex-MP Shahabuddin

Property dispute reason behind the murder, say police

A 53-year-old man was arrested for allegedly killing a relative of former RJD MP Mohammad Shahabuddin last month over a property dispute in Bihar, the police said on Monday.

On February 1, Mohammed Yusuf (28), was shot dead and his body was dumped near a mosque. An FIR has been lodged against unknown persons at Hussainganj police station in Siwan.

Unrest after murder

After the murder, there was a state of unrest in the area due to the upcoming elections and political connections of Yusuf.

The accused Mohammad Qayyum, a resident of Siwan district in Bihar, used to run a mobile shop and had been absconding since the incident.

Yusuf, a relative of gangster turned politician Mohammad Shahabuddin, was killed by Mohammad Kaif, Raunak, Islam, Maqbool, Sandeep and Qayyum on February 1.

Held from Batla House

The police arrested Qayyum on March 22 after they received a tip-off that he had taken shelter at Batla House in Delhi.

Family members of the deceased and victim had several altercations in the past over a property dispute.

“Qayyum along with four other accused hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Yusuf,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime) Rajesh Deo.

Four others absconding

Qayyum along with other accused visited Yusuf's house on the night of February 1 and asked him to accompany them to a party, Mr. Deo said. They took Yusuf to a secluded place in Siwan, shot him and dumped his body near a mosque. Since then, Qayyum had been absconding from Bihar and had taken shelter in Batla House, the police said. They added that efforts are on to nab the other accused.
