Syrian troops capture key village in Idlib: Government forces captured a key village in the northwestern province of Idlib, drawing close to a major town in the last rebel stronghold in Syria, state media and opposition activists said. The capture of Habeet opens up an approach to the southern regions of Idlib, a stronghold of al-Qaeda-linked militants and other armed groups. Habeet is also close to Khan Sheikhoun, a town held by rebels since 2012, and to parts of the highway linking the capital, Damascus, with the northern city of Aleppo. Troops have been attacking Idlib since April 30.
