Kodandaram said, “KCR was born out of the votes of the people of Telangana and now he is ill-treating them.”TPCC chief Uttam Kumar Reddy said instead of being sympathetic, KCR is maintaining attitude just to satisfy his false ego. “CM was not willing to meet or discuss with RTC employees to resolve their problems and the ministers are not authorised to take a decision. The CM and his team are insulting RTC employees and want them to surrender unconditionally,” Uttam said.Earlier, the government employees and leaders of Telangana Non-Gazetted Officers (TNGO) said RTC employees did not even consult them before going on strike. “Leave the political parties and talk to us. We will take up your problems with CM KCR. The demands of RTC unions are genuine,” said K Sivaji of TNGO.
