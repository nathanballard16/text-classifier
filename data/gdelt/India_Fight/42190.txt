The Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to look into the incident of attack on Iqbal Ansari, one of the litigants in the Ayodhya-Babri Masjid case.

The incident was brought to the attention of the CJI-led bench by Senior Advocate Rajeev Dhavan, who is appearing for Sunni Waqf Board in the case.

Dhavan complained that Ansari was attacked despite the police protection given to him.

Ansari, a resident of Faizabad, alleged on Tuesday evening that a man-woman duo attacked him at his home asking him to withdraw his claim from the case.

"The woman introduced herself as Vartika Singh and claimed that she was an international shooter. They asked me to withdraw my claim from the dispute, threatening that she would otherwise shoot me," told reporters.



"They then attacked me but I was saved by my security personnel," Ansari said, adding that he did not sustain any injuries in the attack. Faizabad police was reported to have detained the attackers.

Before starting the arguments on the 19th day of hearing in the case, Dhavan mentioned this incident.

"Whether the incident requires investigation or not I do not know. But sometimes a simple word from the bench is enough", he added.

"We will look into it", said the CJI in reply.

Dhavan has filed a contempt petition against a Chennai based Professor, who had allegedly threatened him for representing Muslim parties in the case. The Court yesterday issued notice in the contempt plea.
