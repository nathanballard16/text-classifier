Three young men were killed on the spot at the outskirts of Hyderabad after a speeding car rammed into them on Sunday when they were standing at the side of the Nagarjuna Sagar highway near Gurrumguda village after having their dinner.

According to media reports, the incident happened at around 1 am near Runway Food Court and the victims were flung more than 30 metres away after they were hit by the car. The three young men, reported to be living under the jurisdiction of the Vanasthalipuram police station, hailed from Nalgonda district in Telangana.

“The speeding MUV (TS 08 UE 6797) rammed into the trio and the bike. The driver of the car was negligent which resulted in the accident. The victims suffered critical injuries and died on the spot,” Vanasthalipuram Inspector A Venkataiah was quoted as saying.

The police said that the SUV was speeding and suspect that the driver may have lost control of the wheel. The deceased were identified as 18-year-old Kethavath Ganapathi and Daravath Sai Kumar and Daravath Vamshi, aged 25 and 19 respectively. One of them worked as a lab technician in the city, and two of them were students.

A case has also been registered under Section 304 A (Causing death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the bodies were shifted to the state-run Osmania General Hospital (OGH) for an autopsy before being handed over to their families.

While the vehicle came to a grinding halt after hitting the victims, the driver fled from the scene of the accident and the police have launched a hunt to nab the accused. It is unclear whether the driver was in an inebriated condition during the time of the incident.
