I went through a long struggle period initially: Malhar Pandya

MUMBAI: Actor Malhar Pandya is no stranger when it comes to struggling to make a name for yourself in the industry. The actor, who would be seen in the show Aghori, says that the phase taught him a lot. “I had a little long struggling period in my initial phase of career and yes, it is considered as a major disadvantage in today’s time. However, I am positive that all the work which I have done so far has surely gained attention from the industry people and fans as well, so now it will be of great support here onwards,” he says, adding, “Initially, I was very unknown to the city and its people, in terms of getting or searching for work. I didn’t really know what to do or where to even start from. But slowly and gradually, I found my path.”

Talking about his current show, he says, “I am playing the parallel negative lead, Indra. I have grey shades to portray in the show. I am very happy with my character as I get to showcase my craft very well.”

The actor, who has been part of shows such as Hamari Saas Leela, Ramayan, Devo Ke Dev Mahadev, Kasam Tere Pyaar Ki, Surya Putra Karn, Kavach - Kaali Shaktiyon Se, Naagin 2 and Ishqbaaz, says that the industry has changed a lot over the years. “I can recall my initial shoot days where the same scene would be shot again and again just to capture every angle and make it look perfect on screen. But now life has become much easier with a lot of technical expertise in today’s time. As an actor, only one good shot is required,” he says.
