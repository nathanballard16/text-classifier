New Delhi, June 15

More than 100 militants have been killed in around 50 encounters in the state of Jammu and Kashmir since January 2019. However, terror attacks continue to take place in the Valley. To put an end to this and to ensure concerted action against terror groups, the Ministry of Home Affairs has constituted a ‘terror monitoring group’.

This group will include representatives from the Information Bureau (IB), the National Investigation Agency (NIA), the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) along with the state’s Additional DGP CID.

According to reports, the TMG will monitor terror activities and especially their funding on a weekly basis.

Earlier in March, J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik had announced the formation of the group, describing it as a body to deal with terror sympathisers. “Terror funding and militant sympathisers are everywhere. Unless they are dealt with firmly, militancy cannot be wiped out,” Satya Pal told IANS.

The body is aimed to take swift action in all registered cases relating to terror and terror financing. According to top officials, the body will identify persons who are involved in terror funding in any form and take action against them.

Governor Satya Pal had made it clear that even state government employees will be under the body’s lens. “I am talking about all those who are connected with militants and are supporting them as sympathisers,” he had asserted.

Earlier on Wednesday, the Centre approved the extension of President’s rule in Jammu and Kashmir for six more months beginning July 3.

The Governor’s rule in the state was first imposed on June 20, last year after the state plunged into a political crisis when the Mehbooba Mufti-led coalition government was reduced to a minority following withdrawal of support by the 25-member BJP in the state.
