Islamabad: A Pakistan activist has filed a writ petition in a Pakistan Court challenging the release of Indian Air Force (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. It remains to be seen whether the petition will be admitted for hearing.

The release of Wing Commander Abhinandan is slated for Friday afternoon. He is expected to cross-over into India from the Attari border in Amritsar district.

Varthaman's MIG-21 Bison crashed after a fierce dogfight in which he shot down a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) , along the Line of Control (LoC). Varthaman's fighter jet was part of a contingent that thwarted a bid by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) to target military installations in India a day after IAF bombed a JeM terror camp in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's (KPK's) Balakot in Pakistan.

He was taken into custody by Pakistan forces on February 27, a day later Prime Minister Imran Khan announced he will be released in order to de-escalate the dangerous stand-off with India.

India on February 26, bombed a JeM terror camp in KPK's Balakot based on intelligence that the banned terror outfit is planning more attacks in India after Pulwama. A 19-year-old JeM terrorist Adil Ahmad Dar rammed an explosive-laden Scorpio SUV into a bus plying with the 278-vehicle strong Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy snuffing 40 lives on board.

After the Pulwama attack, India's Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) blamed Pakistan for allowing JeM to use its territory to "target India with impunity". Imran Khan promised to act if India provides "actionable evidence" against the group.

New Delhi on Wednesday handed a dossier to Islamabad on Pulwama but Pakistan said it did not have enough substantial evidence.
