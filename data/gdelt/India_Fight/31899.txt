Parliament Monsoon Session 2019 HIGHLIGHTS: Breaking his silence over the Jharkhand lynching, Prime Minister Narendra Modi replying to the ‘Motion Of Thanks on the President’s address’ in the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday said he was saddened by the death of the 22-year-old man, however, it is unfair to blame the entire state for the incident. “The lynching in Jharkhand has pained me. It has saddened others too. But, some here in the Rajya Sabha are calling Jharkhand a hub of lynching. Is this fair? Why are they insulting a whole state? None of us have the right to insult the state of Jharkhand.”

Kickstarting his address in Rajya Sabha, Modi said the massive mandate the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gained, shows the maturity of voters and nobody should question their decision. Targetting the Congress for saying that “with BJP’s win, the Country and the Democracy lost elections”, the Prime Minister said, “I was saddened when some leaders said that the BJP and allies won the elections but the country lost and democracy lost. These statements are really unfortunate. Why should we question the decision of voters?” “Did India lose in Wayanad? Did India lose in Rae Bareli? Did India lose in Trivandrum, what about Amethi? What kind of argument is this? If Congress loses then does that mean India lost? There is a limit to arrogance. Congress could not win a single seat in 17 states,” he added. On Tuesday, he had addressed Lok Sabha.
