A 60-year-old man was celebrating his birthday on Tuesday when he was surprised as a group of policemen from the Amboli police station in Mumbai turned up with a bouquet.

Valerian Santos is the father of late Keenan Santos, who was murdered along with his friend Reuben outside a Mumbai bar when they had tried to stop a group of men from harassing their friends.

Keenan & Reuben will be eternally missed by the city & we will always try our best to be there for their family. Our best wishes to Mr Valerian Santos #MumbaiFirst pic.twitter.com/EPb5PGB01L — Mumbai Police (@MumbaiPolice) 31 May 2019

Santos had recently requested for police protection after they were informed that the prime accused in his son’s murder case was granted furlough for 14 days.

Keenan and Reuben were murdered outside a bar at Amboli in October 2011 .

All four accused–Jitendra Rana, Sunil Bodh, Satish Dulhaj and Dipak Tival–were convicted by a Mumbai court in 2016 and were sentenced to life imprisonment.

After Santo’s plea the police deployed a constable outside their home and even increased patrolling in the area.

But the policemen went beyond the call of duty and they made sure that the birthday of the father, who had lost his son, was a memorable one.
