Congress leader slams Kamal Nath govt for invoking NSA for cow protection

New Delhi [India], Feb 7 (ANI): Congress leader Naseem Khan on Thursday slammed chief minister Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government for invoking NSA for cow protection in the state.

Addressing the Congress minority convention meet, Khan, a former minister in Maharashtra Government said, “If BJP indulges in wrongdoings then we can understand that their government being run on the thoughts of RSS hence it is doing so. But in Madhya Pradesh, our own government has invoked NSA for cow protection. If for cow protection, we impose a strict law like National Security Act (NSA) during our (in Madhya Pradesh) rule then NSA should also be imposed on all those who commit atrocities on innocents in the name of cow protection.”

On February 5, the National Security Act (NSA) was on Tuesday invoked against three persons accused of illegal cow slaughter in the communally sensitive Khandwa region, said the police.

The incident took place on Friday in Khandwa. The three accused had escaped taking advantage of the dark. The NSA has been slapped by police against the accused with the consent of the district administration.

This is the first incident in which police have charged those accused of cow slaughter with NSA.

Khan further criticised Central government on the Triple Talaq bill and said, “There is a conspiracy to create a particular type of atmosphere in the country since after 2014. Today our constitution is in danger. There are attempts and conspiracies to change the constitution. I want to say that Muslim of the country or the world can tolerate anything but no interference in Shariat. The constitution grants us right to live with freedom and practice our religious beliefs.”

AICC minority department national convention was also attended by Congress president Rahul Gandhi who had also addressed the gathering and had attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (ANI)
