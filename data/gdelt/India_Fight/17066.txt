Follow us on Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor Khan

Akshay Kumar and Kareena Kapoor Khan are collaborating for the fourth time on silver screen and this has piqued excitement of their fans. The duo kick-started shooting of Good News in February and have been papped multiple times on the sets of the film. Akshay and Kareena are playing a married couple trying for a baby in this upcoming comedy-drama, which also features Kiara Advani and Diljit Dosanjh. The latest development from the sets of Good News is that the film will have a remixed 90s song.



As per a report in Mumbai Mirror, recently, the lead actors of the flick shot for a fun dance number in the studio. The song is the recreated version of Sukhbir's 1999 pop hit Sauda Khara Khara starring Bipasha Basu and Dino Morea. While the original song had a wedding backdrop, the recreated version is set in a Delhi club.

The rehashed version has been composed by DJ Chetas, who told Mumbai Mirror, ''It was a dream come true to work with Akshay sir, Karan (Johar, producer) sir and Kareena ma’am on a film. I can't get into the details of the track, but I can promise that it will be one of the biggest hits of the year.”

Talking about her character in Good News, Kareena said, “Hopefully it'll be a part which will be remembered because it's socially relevant. It's a strong character. The best part is it'll be completely different than what I did in 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham' as Poo.” Good News is being helmed by Raj Mehta.

Kareena will next be seen in historical drama directed by Karan Johar, which will also have Ranveer Singh, Alia Bhatt, Vicky Kaushal, Janhvi Kapoor and Anil Kapoor in important roles.
