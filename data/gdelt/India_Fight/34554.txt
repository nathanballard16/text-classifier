Pakistani Allegedly Trying to Sneak Into India Shot Dead at Border

India's border troops shot dead a Pakistani who was allegedly trying to enter Indian territory in Jammu on Monday.

"A Pakistani intruder was shot dead by BSF troops on the intervening night of 14-15 July, at International Border (IB) in Ramgarh area, Jammu. The body of the Pakistani intruder was handed over to Police for further disposal," a BSF spokesperson said.

Last week, India’s border force launched a massive exercise to fortify the ‘anti-infiltration grid’ in which the entire BSF’s senior field brass, thousands of troops and machinery are being deployed in forward areas of Jammu and Punjab. Official sources said the border guard force has mobilised heavy machinery, communication interceptors and mobile bulletproof bunkers as part of the exercise.
