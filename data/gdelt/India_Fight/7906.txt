Significant. New Zealand is the very first country to pass a motion in their parliament against the Pulwama terror attack in Kashmir in support of India.

This makes New Zealand the first country to official pass a resolution condemning the Pulwama terror attack.

Around 3.20 pm on 14 February, a suicide bomber of the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) group rammed an explosives-laden truck into a CRPF convoy, killing 42 troops and critically injuring several. Days later, on Monday, an encounter broke out merely 12 kilometres from the site of the suicide attack. The mastermind this terror attack, JeM commander Kamran alias Rasheed Ghazi, was killed in this gunfight, along with another member of the terrorist group.
