2 Bangladeshi-origin men held in Delhi for burglary, murder

The Delhi Police on Monday arrested two persons of Bangladeshi origin for their involvement in several cases of burglary and murder across India.

Police said after committing crimes, the duo, Manik and Alamgir, would flee to Bangladesh and return to India after some time.

Convicted in a case earlier, Manik had in 2005 escaped from the court complex of Tihar Jail along with his associates.

With their arrest, police claimed to have solved a dacoity-cum-murder case of Hubballi in Karnataka. They were also wanted in six more cases of dacoity registered in Delhi, Rajasthan and Kerala, an official said.

One country-made pistol, two live cartridges, one gold chain and some house-breaking implements were seized from them.
