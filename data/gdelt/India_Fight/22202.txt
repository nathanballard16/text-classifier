Opposition leaders cannot keep country safe: Amit Shah

He was addressing a rally in the Ghazipur constituency of Uttar Pradesh

BJP president Amit Shah claimed that Opposition leaders cannot take care of the country’s security. He was addressing a rally in the Ghazipur constituency of Uttar Pradesh. Union minister and sitting MP Manoj Sinha is seeking re-election from the constituency.

Mr. Shah alleged that the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) president Mayawati and her Samajwadi Party and the Congress counterparts, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi, respectively, were upset with the Balakot air strikes.

“These ‘mahamilavati’ people talk about the country. Akhilesh, Mayawati and the Congress cannot keep the country safe,” the BJP chief said. Shah said the BJP cannot do “ilu-ilu” with terrorists, an apparent reference to the popular short form of ‘I love you’.

“Though Pakistan-based terrorists were killed in the Balakot air strikes, it was an atmosphere of mourning in the offices of Bua (Mayawati, Bhatija (Akhilesh) and Rahul baba. I could not find out as to why they were so sad, Mr.Shah said.

He said the BJP cannot play with the security of the country. “If a bullet is fired from Pakistan, a bomb will be sent from India... eent ka jawaab patthar se diya jayega (If someone throws bricks, response will be by throwing rocks),” the BJP leader stressed.

Pointing out the Congress manifesto promise of scrapping the sedition law, Mr.Shah claimed the move was to prevent those who had allegedly raised “anti-national” slogans from going to jail.
