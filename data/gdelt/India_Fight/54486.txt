PHOTOS: Candlelight vigil held for Unnao rape victim

People from all walks of lives took out a candlelight march from Raj Ghat to India Gate in the national capital on Saturday, demanding justice for the Unnao rape victim, who breathed her last on Friday after she was set ablaze while on her way to a court hearing in the Uttar Pradesh town.

The incident came days after the gang-rape and murder of a 25-year-old veterinary doctor in Hyderabad that sparked a national outrage.

Members of Indian Youth Congress and National Students' Union of India also took part in the march demanding justice for the family of the victim. "The rising incidents of rape and brutal murder of our daughters and sisters in the country show that the present government has failed to provide the common minimum need of safety to women across the country," an IYC advisory stated.

"Women are very scared. There is resentment everywhere but nothing is being done to stop rape incidents. Laws are there but they are not being implemented," Jyotsna Sharma, one of the protesters, said. Photograph: Arun Sharma/PTI Photo
