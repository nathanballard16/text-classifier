Still no justice for Jamal Khashoggi, says One Free Press Coalition

"I can't breathe." These were the final words of Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was brutally murdered a year ago, according to Turkey's Sabah newspaper.

Neither justice nor a resolution of the cause of his death has been achieved.

The Washington Post columnist had been a longstanding critic of the Saudi regime as well as of the kingdom's de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reported the BBC.

In 2010, he was fired from pro-government newspaper al-Watan and, by 2017, had been banned from writing in Saudi Arabia.

He was visiting the consulate to obtain divorce papers on Oct 2, 2018, so that he could marry his then fiancee, Ms Hatice Cengiz, when a Saudi hit squad subdued and dismembered him.

Mr Khashoggi's case has surfaced for the seventh time on the monthly list of "10 Most Urgent" cases of journalists under attack compiled by the One Free Press Coalition since March.

The group comprises pre-eminent editors and publishers who safeguard journalists persecuted for pursuing the truth.

To counter the rising threat to media freedom, the coalition was established during a meeting of the International Media Council at the World Economic Forum in March.

The Straits Times joined the alliance in May.

"Khashoggi's untimely passing and the continuous threats against journalists prove that the need for a free press worldwide persists more than ever," said Mr Randall Lane, chief content officer at Forbes and a founding member of the One Free Press Coalition.

Mr Lane added that, although Mr Khashoggi paid the ultimate price, there is still much suspicion and lack of transparency around the events that led to his death.

In addition to Mr Khashoggi's, here are nine other cases mentioned in October's list of "10 Most Urgent" cases, in no particular order:
