Clash sparks tension in Assam town

GUWAHATI: The assault of a couple belonging to a linguistic minority community allegedly by a group of youths opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill has resulted in simmering tension between the two communities in Bongaigaon.The couple, identified as Narayan Poddar (28) and his wife Rinku, was assaulted by a group of 15-17 people on Tuesday for keeping their tea shop open for a while during the bandh called by 16 organisations, including the Krishak Mukti Sangram Sammitee (KMSS).Following the assault, another group of youths from the linguistic minority community allegedly tried to vandalise some shops owned by the other community.An FIR was filed at the North Bongaigaon outpost by the couple following which KMSS general secretary Nandan Debnath was picked up by police for questioning. He was let off on Thursday. Police also picked up All Assam Bengali Youth Students’ Federation (AABYSF) president Samrat Bhawal, who was accused of trying to spread tension between the two communities. He was released on Wednesday.“I was called to the police station. But I was released the very next day as there was no proof against me. It was in fact members of KMSS who had shouted slogans against our community,” Bhawal alleged.Additional SP of Bongaigaon, Amar Choudhury, told TOI that he hoped that the situation will be normalized by Friday. “The SP and the deputy commissioner spoke to the president of the Bengali organization. Both the parties will be again called on Friday for a meeting to maintain peace in the district,” he added.
