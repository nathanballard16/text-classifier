Parents of three boys killed in illegal bike-ride responsible rather than Delhi Police

Dear Editor,

It is indeed regretful that Delhi Police is being unnecessarily targeted for death of three boys killed near Turkman Gate in Delhi on night of 30.11.2019 when their speeding bike hit a pole during their joy-ride. It is significant that the three boys broke all traffic-rules by having three riders on a bike that too all without helmets and overspeed. It may also be possible that the killed boys might have been minors.

Fault lied with parents of the three killed boys who did not care to control their children for such unlawful scooter-ride. Delhi witnesses havoc created by bikers on busy Delhi roads including in high security-zone of Leyton Delhi with parents enjoying driving-skill of their children through all traffic-rules.

Higher authorities in Delhi should issue necessary notifications giving Delhi Police clean chit in the matter to keep their morals high so that they may perform their duty well during annual feature of creating havoc by bikers in Delhi violating all traffic-rules and creating fear amonst road-users at night-hours.
