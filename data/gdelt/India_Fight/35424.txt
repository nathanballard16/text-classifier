Youth found dead near railway station

VADODARA: An unidentified youth was found dead near platform 6 of Vadodara railway station on Saturday morning.He was sighted sleeping on the boundary wall of the railway premises near Lalita Tower by railwaymen. However, when they went close to him, they found that he was bleeding from nose. Initially it was suspected that he had been murdered by some person by hitting a stone on his face.When officials of government railway police ( GRP ) reached there, the possibilities of murder were ruled out. “We found foam in his mouth and he was bleeding from nose. There were no injuries on his body so there were no chances that he had been murdered,” said a police official. The prima facie reason sighted by cops was that he could have died of brain haemorrhage caused due to overdose of drugs.Cops said that the exact reason for the death can be ascertained once the post-mortem report arrives. His viscera samples have also been sent to FSL for a detailed probe.
