Mumbai crime branch busts major oil mafia racket, 3 arrested

Mumbai crime branch on Tuesday busted a major oil mafia racket. The police also arrested three people in the matter for partially replacing furnace oil dispatched from JNPT for BPCL oil fields in Mumbai.

The crime branch officials said people working with BPCL will also be questioned in the matter as the racket has been going on for the past several years.

The three arrested by the Mumbai crime branch have been identified as Mohammad Yakun Mohammed Nasim Siddiqi, Saifu Mohammad Nafis Khan and Raju Kailash Saroj. All are currently in police custody and cops are investigating the racket. The accused have been charged under sections 379, 420, 462, 472, 484 and 120b of the Indian Penal Code. According to cops, the main mastermind is still at large. He will be arrested soon, they said.

Modus operandi

According to senior police inspector Mahesh Desai of crime branch unit 9, the gang has been operating for the past several years. Desai said BPCL gave the contract to a third-party for bringing furnace oil from JNPT to BPCL oil fields in Mahul Gaon area of Mumbai.

The people associated with the third-party company, however, used to take the oil tanker to a parking lot en route BPCL facility. At this parking lot, half the furnace oil from the tanker was transferred into another tanker already stationed at the parking lot.

To cover the margin, the gang would refill the company tanker with water and seal it off before taking it to the BPCL oil fields.

The stolen furnace oil was then sold at the black market at a lower price.

The Mumbai crime branch suspects that BPCL employees might also be involved in the scam as the tempered tankers passed the security check while entering the company's storage area.

The police suspect that the oil mafia racket caused heavy loss to the BPCL.
