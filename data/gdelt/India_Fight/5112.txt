Bihar Minister, Jharkhand ASP in the Traffic Police Dragnet

Patna: Traffic police in Patna on Tuesday, during its ongoing 'Operation Safe' campaign in the state capital to crackdown on road law breakers and dangerous drivers, issued a ticket, or challan, to Building Construction Minister Maheshwar Hazari and an Additional SP of Jharkhand for riding in vehicles with dark, tinted glasses.

Hazari's vehicle was stopped by the traffic police near Patna High Court on Bailey Road. Police fined him Rs. 600 for riding in a tinted glass car.

Tinted windows were banned in Bihar nearly a decade ago in an attempt to crackdown on criminals who used to roam freely behind the dark glasses in order to hide their identities. Many of the criminals were wanted by the police in cases involving murder, robbery, rape, and other criminal activities.

Police also ticketed Hazaribagh Special Branch Additional Superintendent of Police (ASP) A K Singh who was found riding in a tinted window vehicle.

During the five-hour long roadblocks at more than 60 places in the state capital, police also arrested two men for transporting liquor bottles in their vehicles.

The first alcohol-related arrested came from near Maurya Lok Shopping Complex when police recovered six bottles of liquor from an auto-rickshaw. A second person was arrested under Digha police station near JP Setu when the police found 20 bottles of liquor hidden in a compartment of his scooter.
