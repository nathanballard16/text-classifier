The BJP on Sunday fielded Union Minister for Electronics and Information Technology SS Ahluwalia from the Burdwan-Durgapur parliamentary seat in West Bengal.

Ahluwalia is currently representing the Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituency.

In Darjeeling, the BJP has replaced Ahluwalia with Raju Singh Bista, who is backed by the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) and Bimal Gurung faction of Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM).

After his candidature was announced, Ahluwalia said he was grateful to the party leadership for nominating him from the seat where he “learnt most important lessons” of his life.

“I spent my student days there. I was a student activist at Burdwan University. And my candidature is an opportunity for me to serve the people of this place,” he said.

With this, the party has announced 408 candidates for the seven-phase Lok Sabha polls which will start on April 11 and continue till May 19. The counting of the votes will take place on May 23.

Ahluwalia is the only BJP minister in the Modi Cabinet who has not used the prefix ‘Chowkidar’ before his name in social media profile. A four-time Rajya Sabha member, he also courted controversy when he made the statement that the purpose of Balakot air strike was to send a message to Pakistan and not inflict casualties. With PTI
