Jalandhar cash misappropriation case: Plugging into Kochi hotel WiFi gave away location of absconding ASIs

Meanwhile, on the order of EC, Gurshrandeep Singh has been appointed as SSP Khanna is the place of Dhruv Dahiya. The moment Joginder Singh and Rajpreet Singh, the two absconding ASIs, connected their mobile phones to surf Internet using the WiFi at Kochi’s Hotel Casa Linda, Fort Kochi, an alarm sounded inside Punjab Police’s Mohali-based Control Room. On March 29, Khanna police team of nearly 18 policeman had raided Father Madassery’s house and had seized Rs 16.65 crore from his residence. But, from Delhi they got the train to Kochi only and hence they landed here. Out of that money, only Rs 9.66 crore was handed over to the Khanna SSP on the same day and remaining Rs 6.65 crore was allegedly misappropriated by both the ASIs.
