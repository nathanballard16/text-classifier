Salman Khan Is ‘Being Real Strong’ For Bharat

Salman Khan will be next seen in Ali Abbas Zafar‘s Bharat and presently the film’s team is shooting the last schedule of the period drama in Mumbai.

Bharat chronicles the journey of a man, which starts in 1947 and ends in 2002. Salman will be seen sporting five different looks, from different eras in the film and he has been working very hard to get into the skin of his character.

Salman recently posted a black-and-white picture, which shows him flaunting his arm muscles. Khan has bulked up for his role and it seems that he will be seen flexing his muscle in the film. Along with the image, Salman wrote, “Being real strong.”

While talking about the film earlier, producer Atul Agnihotri had stated, “It’s the journey of a country and also a person, both of whom go by the name of Bharat.” Bharat also stars Sunil Grover, Katrina Kaif, Jackie Shroff, Disha Patani, Nora Fatehi and Tabu. The film is a remake of hit Korean film, An Ode To My Father and it will release on Eid, this year
