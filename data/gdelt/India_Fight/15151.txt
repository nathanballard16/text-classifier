FACTBOX-Boeing 737 MAX 8 groundings spread around the world

Aviation regulators around the globe are grounding Boeing's 737 MAX aircraft following Sunday's deadly plane crash in Ethiopia. Regulators in the United States, where Boeing is based, remained an exception.

Boeing reiterated that the investigation into the crash remains in its early stages and it has no basis to issue new guidance to operators. The U.S. aviation regulator said it would not ground the planes and that a review "shows no systemic performance issues and provides no basis to order grounding the aircraft", but will "take immediate and appropriate action" if issues are identified.
