Ja New offered police protection – if he gives up activism

Sirawith has yet to decide whether he will agree to the deal.

The anti-junta activist was discharged from hospital on Sunday after having been under medical care since June 28, when he was attacked in Bangkok by four bat-wielding men in broad daylight. This was the second violent assault on Sirawath in the space of a month but police have been unable to identify or catch the attackers in either case.

The latest assault left him with serious injuries including a fractured eye socket that has affected his sight and forced him to postpone travelling to India, where he was due to study for a master’s degree. Told he will need at least six months to recover, Sirawith has asked for his scholarship to be postponed until next year.
