Photos Show the Devastation of Monsoons Ravaging India and Pakistan

NEW DELHI — Furious monsoon rains pounded India and Pakistan over the weekend, wiping away entire villages, submerging cities and leaving civilians desperately crouching on rooftops and, in one instance, frantically clutching onto a construction crane for rescue.

In the south Indian state of Kerala, nearly 290,000 people were displaced from their homes from Thursday to Sunday morning, with 76 people killed, 32 injured and 58 missing, according to the local government, which expects the toll to increase. At least 97 people died in flooding in three other states in India.

Indian military forces fanned out across the south and west of the country to perform rescue missions. In one case, they stripped down tree limbs to haul a wheelchair-bound man to safety through a thick forest and, in another, provided dinghies to ferry civilians to one of the hundreds of relief camps set up across the nation.
