Security guard at Little Italy bar shoots patron

A security guard at a hip Mexican cantina in Little Italy shot and wounded a patron during a fight early Saturday, San Diego police said.

The conflict started at El Camino on India Street, where the security guard works. The guard got into an argument with a few patrons, and the guard threatened them that something would happen to them, police said. Authorities did not say what the argument was about.

When the customers left the bar about 2 a.m., the guard followed them to India and Laurel streets, where they argued again. One of the customers punched the guard in the face, and the guard pulled out a handgun and fired twice at the man, police said. The victim was struck once in the lower abdomen.

The guard left and went home, but then called police and turned himself in to officers.
