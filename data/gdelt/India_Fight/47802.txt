The Delhi Police arrested a miscreant on Thursday with 142 cases registered against him. The 37-year-old accused has already spent 22 years in jail.

The Delhi Police arrested the accused along with his wife in a murder case of one person in Sagarpur, New Delhi.

The accused -- Joginder alias Jagga -- has 142 cases registered against him. Jagga has also been involved in the murder of his brother.

Jagga and his wife were absconding but were nabbed from Odisha on Thursday.

According to Jagga, he is being implicated in the murder of the person in Sagarpur. However, he admits that he has spent 22 years of his life in jail and has 100 cases registered against him.

According to the police, Jagga escaped after the murder and took shelter in some Naxal-affected area of Odisha. When the police learnt of his location, they laid a trap to nab him and he was busted soon.

The police said that his entire family has a history of crminal acitivities.

Jagga was arrested and the police are now on to imposing Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) on him.
