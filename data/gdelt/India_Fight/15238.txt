: Ruling Telugu Desam and opposition YSR Congress parties have entered into mudslinging on the coldblooded murder of YSRCP president YS’s paternal uncle YS Vivekananda Reddy.Jagan expressed doubts that Chandrababu Naidu’shad resorted to the ghastly murder and demanded a CBI enquiry into it. Chandrababu Naidu accused Vivekananda's family of trying to erase evidence of the murder.Jaganmohan Reddy is going to lead a delegation to Governor ESL Narasimhan on Saturday to complain about TDP’s murder politics and called for peaceful protests across the state during the day.Reddy said that Chandrababu Naidu was the chief minister when his grandfather YS Raja Reddy was murdered in 1996. Naidu as leader of the opposition challenged then chief minister YS Rajasekhara Reddy (Jagan’s father) how he would enter the Assembly again. He was soon killed in a helicopter crash in the Nallamala forests.“Even I was attacked with knife at Visakhapatnam airport. Now, my uncle is killed brutally”, Jagan said.Chandrababu Naidu charged the family members of Vivekananda with trying to conceal evidence. “Who took Vivekananda Reddy from bedroom into the bathroom and brought his dead body back to the bedroom? How did the family members allow the blood stains in the bedroom be cleaned? Why did the family members described it as a death due to heart attack for three hours from 5.30 am to 8 am till somebody prompted them to lodge a police complaint because there were injuries in the head and other parts of the body?” Naidu questioned.The state government has set up a Special Investigation Team with five senior officials to probe the case.
