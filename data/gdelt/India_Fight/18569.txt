Vishakhapatnam: A student, who had passed out from Class IX, was found dead at a residential school in Payakaraopeta. He reportedly committed suicide by hanging himself from the ceiling fan in the hostel.

However, the family members alleged that it was a murder and that the school management has been trying to hide the facts.

According to the cousins of the deceased who gave a complaint to the police, Subham Raj, 15, was a native of Samastipur in Bihar and was studying at Sri Prakash Vidya Niketan at Payakaraopeta.

The school authority had informed his mother over phone that he had committed suicide on March 30 evening, during study hour.

Immediately after knowing this, a relative of the deceased Santosh Kumar Yadav from Dhenkanal in Odisha went to the school and observed that it was a case of murder.

“There were different versions of the story from the fellow students. They had chang-ed the spot of death from one fan to another while narrating the incident,” he said.

“We have several doubts over the death. The school management is trying to get away from the case as their reputation is at stake. But, we have complained to the police, expecting justice. The criminal responsible for this must be punished severely,” said Sudheer Kumar, another cousin of the deceased.

Mr Sudheer Kumar informed that a suicide note was found in the pocket of the deceased which says about theft of money.
