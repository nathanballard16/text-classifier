New Delhi: Minister of External Affairs, Sushma Swaraj, on Wednesday put out an assurance that cross-border tensions with Pakistan would not escalate over the Pulwama carnage but stressed that India will not remain silent in the event of another terror attack “from that country”.

“I used to receive calls from foreign ministers who first condoled the Pulwama attack, then express their solidarity…then they used to softly say that we think India will not escalate the situation, to which I used to reply that ‘no, I assure you India will not escalate the situation… But if there is any other terror attack, we will not remain silent as we cannot say Pulwama as our destiny,” news agency PTI quoted Swaraj as saying.

Indian Air Force fighter jets on February 26 launched a major offensive against terrorist organisations using Pakistani soil to carry out terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and annihilated training camps of the Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balakot that falls in the Khyber- Pakhtunkhwa region, along with Muzaffarabad and Chakothi in PoK.

The terror group is responsible for the dastardly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama on February 14 where 40 CRPF personnel were killed.
