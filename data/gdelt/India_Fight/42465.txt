Itâ€™s A Wrap For Vicky Kaushal And Bhumi Pednekarâ€™s Horror Drama â€˜Bhoot Part 1- The Haunted Shipâ€™

New Delhi:

Vicky Kaushal on Friday announced the wrap of his forthcoming horror drama Bhoot Part One: The Haunted Ship on Instagram. The film also stars Bhumi Pednekar in a prominent role.

''Rolled our last shot for 'BHOOT Part 1- The Haunted Ship' and we finally wrap this very special film of ours. Fought many of my own fears through the journey of this Film. Can’t wait to spook you all out with this one on #Nov15th. #Bhoot ...,'' he wrote on Instagram.

In June, the makers released the first-look poster of the film where the Manmarziyan actor has an extremely frightened look on his face. In the poster, a bloodied hand with long nails is seen grabbing the 31-year-old’s bruised face as he peeps out of a ship’s broken window.

Directed by Bhanu Pratap Singh, the film is slated to hit the theatres on November 15 this year. It is produced by Karan Johar, Hiroo Yash Johar, Apoorva Mehta, and Shashank Khaitan.

On the other hand, Vicky Kaushal will be also seen in two biopics, one on freedom fighter Sardar Udham Singh and the other on 1971 war hero Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. Titled Sardar Udham Singh, the film is directed by Shoojit Sircar and written by Ritesh Shah and Shubendu Bhattacharya.

It follows Singh, the revolutionary who assassinated Michael O'Dwyer, the former Lieutenant Governor of Punjab in British India in 1940, to avenge the 1919 Jallianwala Bagh massacre. "It was my dream to work with Shoojit Sircar. I am glad I got the opportunity to work with him in a film on Shaheed Udham Singh. It is a great honour but a big responsibility at the same time. The shoot will resume from October and I am excited to start that process," Vicky had earlier said.

He will also be seen playing Manekshaw in "Sam" to be directed by Meghna Gulzar and written by Bhavani Iyer. Manekshaw was the chief of the Indian Army in 1971 when India fought the Bangladesh Liberation War with Pakistan.

"I had heard stories of him from my parents because they are from Punjab. During 1971, they saw the war closely... When I read the script and got to know more, I was blown away. He was truly a legend this country had. It's an honour of the highest order to get an opportunity to play this part," he had said.
