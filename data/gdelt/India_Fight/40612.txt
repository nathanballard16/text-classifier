‘Drug dealer’ killed in Satkhira ‘gunfight’

An alleged drug dealer was killed in a reported gunfight between two rival groups in Satkhira early today, police said.

The deceased identified as Munsur Rahman Gaji, 45, a drug dealer from Shyamnagar upazila of Satkhira, said Mostafizur Rahman, officer-in-charge of Satkhira Sadar Police Station.

Police found the bullet-hit body of Munsur near a shrimp enclosure in Bakal Islampur area of Satkhira after locals informed them of hearing gunshots around 3:00am, the OC told our satkhira correspondent.

It is suspected that Munsur died in a gunfight between two rival gangs, the police official also said.

The law enforcers also recovered a one-shooter gun and 50 pieces of yaba from the spot, he added.

However, a resident of Shyamnagar upazila told this correspondent seeking anonymity that Munsur was picked up by plainclothes men on Monday after he appeared before a Satkhira court in a case against him.

He had long been hiding in India before that, the resident added.
