The CM had ordered the police to kill those accused of murdering his party worker. It is such a blatant misuse of his power and violation of his oath as an elected chief minister –V Shashidhar

The controversial ‘outburst’ by the CM

In complaint, he seeks action against Kumaraswamy for a few incidents, including comment urging police chief to kill murderer of party workerAfter spending 22 days in prison under sedition charges for his Facebook comments onHD Kumaraswamy, V, President offiled a police complaint against Chief Ministerdemanding action against him for multiple recent incidents. These include Kumaraswamy’s comment to Mandya police chief to kill the alleged murderer of his party worker in a police encounter.Shashidhar, through his lawyer M Muddayya, had stated in the complaint that the CM had violated his oath of office and had requested the police to take appropriate action. They also alleged that though an Assistant Sub Inspector Rank police officer accepted the complaint at the station, it was given back to them after a few minutes and they claimed they could not accept it since it was against the Chief Minister.“The CM had ordered the police to mercilessly kill those accused of murdering his party worker to the police chief. It is such a blatant misuse of his power and violation of his oath as an elected chief minister. It is shocking that no action has been taken against him even as people are getting booked for sedition by just criticising the government and the chief minister on social media,” said Shashidhar.The complaint that was reportedly given at the police station also states that KUmaraswamy had openly made another comment asking the public to revolt against the BJP as his reaction to Operation Kamala by the opposition to overthrow his government. The opposition had also demanded the invocation of sedition charge against the CM citing that he was trying to instigate the public and break down law and order of the state.“If the police is under pressure and claim that it cannot act against the CM even if there is valid grounds, then we will definitely approach the judiciary seeking justice. The law has to be the same for everyone,” Shashidhar added.According to M Muddayya, the complaint was filed at Yelahanja police station on Saturday and initially it was attended by an Assistant Sub Inspector but within thirty minutes of that, the inspector arrived and said that the complaint against the Chief Minister on these grounds cannot be accepted. When contacted, Yelahanka police inspector claimed that he has not received any such complaint against the CM, Shashidhar was initially booked under sedition charge in 2016 for allegedly trying to incite resentment among police constabulary and provoking them to go on mass leave demanding better salary and working conditions. The High Court recently ordered in his favour and stayed the proceedings in this case but a fresh sedition case was charged and he was arrested on February 14 citing that he made provocative posts on social media against the CM for his delay in implementing the Auradkar committee recommendation for better wages for police constables.On December 25,2018, Kumaraswamy was caught on camera giving directions to someone to “mercilessly kill” the attackers of JD(S) worker H Prakash. The video went viral and the CM was supposedly speaking to a senior police official. After a controversy erupted, he tried to bury the issue by saying it was an emotional outburst and not an order.Shashidhar and his lawyer contend that such a speech is clearly in violation of the CM’s oath and if the police do not take action against this, they plan to take legal recourse.
