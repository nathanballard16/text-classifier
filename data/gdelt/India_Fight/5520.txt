New Delhi fire: 17 people killed and more injured as blaze engulfs hotel

S eventeen people have been killed in a fire at a hotel in New Delhi, police say.

Firefighters battled the blaze at the Arpit Palace Hotel, in Karol Bagh, a popular tourist hub in India's capital city.

At least four people were injured and have been taken to local hospitals. It is not known how badly hurt they are.

Shocking images show the roof of the hotel completely ablaze as bright orange flames rip through and thick black smoke billows into the air.

Local media reported that people had to jump from windows as the fire took hold.

The blaze has been put out but the cause is being investigated.

"We have to check the stability of the structure, check every room," deputy police commissioner Mandeep Singh Randhawa said

Twenty-five fire engines were called to the blaze, which engulfed all but the ground floor of the five-story hotel, according to fire officer Vijay Paul.

Mr Paul said about 40 people were rescued from the hotel.

Among those rescued was Sivanand Chand, 43, a hotel guest who was jolted awake around 4am struggling to breathe.

"When I got out of my room, I could hear 'help, help!' from adjoining rooms," he said, adding that he opened the window and saw flames rising fast.

"In 15 minutes, the whole room was black."

The rescue took about 30 minutes because fire engine ladders could not initially reach Mr Chand's floor, he added.
