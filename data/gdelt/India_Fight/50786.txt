New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Saturday pronounced a historic verdict in the seven-decade-old legal battle in the Ayodhya land dispute case. A five-judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court headed by Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi directed the Central government to form a trust which would ensure the construction of a Ram Temple in Ayodhya.

The Constitution bench, comprising of the CJI, Justices DY Chandrachud, SA Bobde, Ashok Bhushan and S Abdul Nazeer pronounced the verdict in the Ram Janmbhoomi-Babri Masjid land dispute case. The apex court bench unanimously decided to handover the possession of the disputed 2.77 acre land rights to the deity Ram Lalla, who is one of the three litigants in the case.

The top court further ruled that the Muslims should be alloted an alternative land at a "prominent site" for the construction of a mosque. While observing that the 2010 Allahabad High Court verdict was wrong, the Supreme Court said that the faith of the Hindus that Lord Ram was born at the demolished structure is undisputed. The apex court said the HC was wrong in giving land to the Sunni Waqf Board and Nirmohi Akhara.

Meanwhile, while welcoming the historic order, Union Home Minister Amit Shah appealed to all communities to accept the judgement and maintain peace. The Home Minister urged the countrymen to remain committed to the idea of 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha Bharat'. The Home Minister expressed gratitude to all groups, countless unknown people who strived for legal resolution of Ram Janmaboomi-Babri Masjid dispute.
