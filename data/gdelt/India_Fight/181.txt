In a stormy start to the Lok Sabha , Congress President Rahul Gandhi today continued his attack on the Prime Minister and the BJP over the Rafale aircraft controversy. Gandhi said that the whole nation is questioning the Prime Minister over the deal and demanded a JPC to probe the deal.Rahul said that the controversy of Rafale occur on "three pillars - the process, the pricing and paisa."Questioning the Prime Minister over the Rafale deal Gandhi said, "Rafale was chosen after eight years of work done by the Indian Air Force (IAF). 126 aircrafts were needed but the dead was chopped down to 36. Why? Did the national security change or did the IAF ask the government that we do not want more planes?Gandhi also questioned the defence put forward by the NDA in the Rafale controversy. He said, "You (NDA) said that we need the aircraft early so the deal was changed. But if you needed the aircraft early why is it that no aircraft has landed in India till now."On the pricing of the Rafale jet, Rahul said that the price of each aircraft was changed from Rs 526 crore each to Rs 1600 crore each and demanded that the Prime Minister tell the nation the reason behind the change in price.Speaking amidst protesting AIADMK members, Rahul said that the contract was given to a "failed businessman", instead of HAL. "HAL provides jobs, is the future of India's defence space and is the bedrock of defence technology, whereas Ambani started his company 10 days prior to getting the contract, why was the contract given to your dear friend?"Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley rebuffed the allegations made by Rahul Gandhi saying that the Congress president has lied to house on the rafale issue. "Rahul Gandhi lied saying he talked to the French President which was a lie, he is trying to lie again today," Jaitley said.
