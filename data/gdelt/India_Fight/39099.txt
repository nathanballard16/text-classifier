New Delhi, Aug 13 : The National Investigation Agency on Tuesday said it has arrested an absconding Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) operative, wanted in the 2014 Burdwan blast case, from Madhya Pradesh's Indore.

The JMB operative was identified as Jahirul Sheikh, a resident of Nadia in West Bengal. An NIA official said Sheikh was arrested by NIA from Indore on Sunday in connection with the case.

The official said Sheikh is a senior leader of JMB Nadia Module in West Bengal. "He had attended a number of training camps conducted by JMB and he was also involved in activities of JMB in India to further its cause," the official said.

The official said Sheikh was chargesheeted by the agency on July 23, 2015 for his direct involvement in the conspiracy of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) to commit terrorist acts and wage war against government of India and Bangladesh.
