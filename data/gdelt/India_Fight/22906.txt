Amateur navigators and inadequate safety arrangements are jeopardising the lives of adventure-seeking tourists who opt for river rafting in Kullu district.

A series of fatal mishaps have occurred over the past few years as raft operators have chosen to flout the safety norms. Two days ago, Mumbai tourist Sara Sagar Jagey (32), on holiday with husband Sagar Ramakant Jagey and son, was killed and four others injured when their raft deflated and capsized near Bhunter airport.

Her death has once again raised a question mark on the safety of unsuspecting tourists who are lured into adventure activities.

Several deaths have been reported in incidents linked to paragliding and river rafting in the recent past. Since 2013, seven persons have lost their lives in rafting-related accidents alone.

The administration had in the past asked the raft operators to procure safety equipment and deploy expert navigators, but to no avail.

Bhag Chand, District Tourism Officer, said: “I had directed the raft operators to follow the safety norms and get registered with the Tourism Department, but most are yet to do so. Illegal rafting operations will be dealt with strictly.

The department will conduct surprise checks and impose heavy penalty on offenders.”

“So far, 82 companies have been registered to run rafting operations at three places between Raison and Bhunter on the Beas. Around 350 rafts are being used in adventure activities for tourists.”

The raft involved in the latest incident, which left a woman dead, deflated moments before it capsized. It had a guide and five tourists on board, including the couple. While four tourists were saved, the victim drowned as she was swept away by the strong river current.
