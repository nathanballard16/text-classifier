Lok Sabha Election 2019, Madhya Pradesh profile: Gwalior, Mandsaur, Bhopal key seats with BJP hoping to repeat 2014 feat-Politics News , Firstpost

Madhya Pradesh, the second largest state in India, has 29 Lok Sabha seats spread across six different regions.

The state of Madhya Pradesh will be electing its representatives in four phases, starting 29 April. In the first phase, six constituencies will be voting. On 6 May, seven constituencies will be electing their representatives. In the final two phases, which are on 12 and 19 May, eight constituencies each will go to vote.

Madhya Pradesh, the second largest state in India, has 29 Lok Sabha seats spread across six different regions. While Malwa-Nimar, a region which borders Gujarat and Maharashtra, has eight seats, Mahakoshal has six Lok Sabha seats. Vindhya, Bundelkhand and Chambal have four Lok Sabha seats each. The Madhya region only has three Lok Sabha seats but includes the state capital Bhopal.

The electoral fight in the state is between the BJP and the Congress. Last time, BJP swept the Lok Sabha elections, winning 27 out of the 29 seats. The only saving graces for Congress were Jyotiraditya Scindia and Kamal Nath.

However, the political situation has changed in the state. After a 15-year-long exile, Congress came to power after the recently-concluded Assembly elections. Buoyed by the success, the Kamal Nath-led Congress is targeting to win at least 20 seats.

The BJP, on the other hand, will be going the extra mile to maintain its 2014 tally in the state.

Madhya Pradesh has a significant tribal population as well as numerically superior OBC communities. These two factors are likely to play a major role in determining the fate of the two parties. Here is a look at the constituencies in the state:

According to reports, caste has always played a major role during elections in this region. Dalits make up over 21 percent of Morena district and are also found in sizeable numbers in Sheopur district.
