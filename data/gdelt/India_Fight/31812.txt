A-300 aircraft: Where 300 turned out to be 250

European aircraft manufacturer Airbus started its journey 50 years ago when it produced the first A-300 aircraft which it sold to Lufthansa. The A in A-300 stood for Airbus and 300 indicated the number of seats on offer on the aircraft.

When the aircraft was introduced commercially, the market made it clear that it wanted to seat fewer people and eventually the A-300 retained its name but could only seat up to 250 passengers.

The company has grown manifold since then. In 2018, Airbus had revenues of €64 billion and employed a workforce of around 1,34,000. It is involved in a range of activities, including manufacturing civilian aircraft, tanker, combat, transport and mission aircraft, besides helicopters. The company also provides data services, navigation, secure communications, urban mobility and other solutions for customers on a global scale.

Today its aircraft are flown by over 400 international airlines including Singapore Airlines, Qantas, Lufthansa and Emirates, among others. In India, its aircraft are flown by carriers like Vistara, Air India and GoAir.
