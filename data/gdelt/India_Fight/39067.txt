New Delhi: A fire broke out in Mother's Pride play school in Noida Sector-61 on Tuesday. A total of six fire tenders were immediately rushed to the spot to douse the flame. While no casualty has been reported so far, the firefighting operation is still underway.

Earlier in June, a fire was reported from Noida's Yadu Public school located in Sector 73. It was doused by five fire tenders. According to the officials, the fire was caused due to a short circuit at the principal's office.

In March, a bone-chilling incident had come to light from Noida when eight students had a narrow escape after their moving school bus caught fire near Sector 119. The incident happened around 1 pm near Gaur Grandeaur Society when the bus was on its way to drop the students at their home.

In May, a massive fire at a four-storey commercial complex in Gujarat's Surat had engulfed 19 students, many of whom jumped from the 3rd floor in order to save their lives. A video of the incident had gone viral where students can be seen jumping off the floor amid plumes of thick air.
