Killers unknown, father still fighting for justice

CHANDIGARH: For N K Kalia, a 70-year-old retired senior CSIR scientist, the Kargil battle is continuing. His pleas to the Government of India (GoI) to pressurize Pakistan to apologize, identify and punish those Pakistani soldiers who inhumanly tortured his son and Kargil martyr Captain Saurabh Kalia have failed to bring any positive results.A disheartened but desperate father has now pinned hope on the Supreme Court, where his plea seeking directions to the ministry of external affairs to take up his son’s torture case at international platform, is pending for the past seven years.Immediately after getting commissioned into 4 Jat regiment of the Army, Captain Kalia was posted in Kargil. In May 1999, he had gone for a patrol in Kaksar area of Kargil along with five other soldiers — Sepoys Arjunram Baswana, Mula Ram Bidiasar, Naresh Singh Sinsinwar, Bhanwar Lal Bagaria and Bhika Ram Mudh. They were captured by the Pakistan army, kept in captivity for over 22 days and subjected to brutal torture — as was evident from their bodies which were handed over by the Pakistan army on June 9, 1999. Parts of their bodies were burnt with cigarettes, eyes removed before puncturing, teeth and bones broken and various limbs and private organs chopped off.Their Prisoners of War (POW) status was not revealed by the Pakistan army to India and instead they were subjected to unprecedented brutal torture in violation of the Geneva Convention.
