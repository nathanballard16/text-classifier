: The recent confrontation could have been avoidable yet necessary. There are also many who feel that the engagement of such nature was not needed and could have been dealt in a different way.

Sputnik: As an analyst, do you completely agree with the Indian government view that the Pulwama attack was the handiwork of Pakistan-based elements.

Ajay Lele: Yes, we do believe that Pulwama cannot be the result of a domestic homegrown terror module.
