“I am scared of the dark,” Gauahar Khan

“I am trying to take up projects that have really exciting roles for me and currently, they are on the web,” said Gauahar Khan, who has shot for a horror digital show. The actor who had never attempted horror, found the script interesting as she loves watching horror movies and was interested in this genre. The Begum Jaan (2017) actor, who shot for the project in Mussoorie, Uttarakhand, shared with media in India, “The experience of shooting a horror show was a new one for me, as most of the scenes were shot with minimal light. I am pretty scared of the dark. I have to keep a low light on in my bedroom even at night. It was scary, at times, to be in rooms that were empty or walk to the washroom which was at the other end of the set. I was spooked out as the property that we shot in was a bit eerie (laughs). Thankfully, the unit members took care of me and that’s why the experience of shooting this film turned out to be a good one.”

Gauahar has been part of a few projects on the digital medium and admits that the medium is still being explored. “It will take time before people can differentiate between the good and not-so-good content. I can’t say which medium provides better content — TV or digital but, right now, I am getting a lot of interesting roles to play in the web space. There are some really good platforms that are working towards creating superlative content. As for TV, I would love to do it if I got a romantic drama.”
