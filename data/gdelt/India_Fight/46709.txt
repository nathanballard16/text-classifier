Cyril Amarchand’s legal tech incubator Prarambh announces first winners

“We received a stellar response from across the country. The quality of ideas reflect that Prarambh will be a major contributor to driving innovation in the Indian legal sector. As we look forward to inducting the first cohort, we will make sure that these ideas get quality mentorship, and the final products serve the legal community at large by maximizing functional efficiencies. We have laid down a detailed mentorship program bearing in mind the needs of a startup. This program will not only help them develop their product but will also strengthen their business acumen and make them future ready. We look forward to making a difference!”
