The US is seeking more information from Islamabad on the potential misuse of American-made F-16 fighter jets by Pakistan against India in violation of the end-user agreement, the state department has said. The Indian Air Force on Thursday displayed parts of an AMRAAM, an air-to-air missile, as evidence that Pakistan had deployed F-16 fighters during an aerial raid targeting Indian military installations in Jammu on Wednesday.

“The only aircraft Pakistan has to transport such a missile is the F-16,” Air Vice-Marshal R.G.K. Kapoor told the news briefing on Thursday in New Delhi. Pakistan had said that no F-16s were used in the operation and denied that India had downed any of its planes. “We are aware of these reports and are seeking more information,” a US state department spokesperson said. The US, which sold the F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, does not allow their use against India. The F-16s are meant to be used only to combat terrorism. “Due to non-disclosure agreements in foreign military sales contracts, we cannot discuss the specifics of end-user agreements contained within,” Lt Col Kone Faulkner, a defence department spokesperson, said. The US, the largest seller of high-tech defence equipment globally, has a strong end-user monitoring agreement and takes all allegations of misuse of defence articles very seriously. Publicly available documents reveal that Washington has imposed more than a dozen restrictions on Pakistan relating to its use of the F-16 fighter jets.
