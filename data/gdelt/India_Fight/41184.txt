Two held for killing BJP leader over land dispute

Deepak alias Hitesh Vadariya

RAJKOT: Two persons were arrested for their alleged involvement in murder of Vanthali BJP unit’s general secretary and former president of Vanthali municipality, Deepak alias Hitesh Vadariya (45), on August 23.

Vadariya was stabbed to death by three assailants over a land dispute on the outskirts of Vanthali in Junagadh district on Friday last.

Police arrested one of the accused Bharat Bhoy (32), a resident of Junagadh, from one of his relative’s house in Virar locality of Mumbai in Maharashtra. Another accused Navgan Chandela was arrested from his home in Dhandhuisar village of Junagadh.

While Bhoy was arrested for Vadariya’s murder, Chandela was held for helping the other two accused — Bhupat Sutreja and Kamal Mehta — escape by providing them with vehicle and cash.

According to Junagadh police, they had tracked Bhoy using mobile phone records and arrested him from his sister’s house in Mumbai on Monday and brought him to Junagadh on Tuesday.

Bhoy had revealed the name of Chandela and told police that he had helped the main accused Sutreja and his aide Mehta.

Police said that Sutreja nurtured a dispute over possession of land which he had earlier bought from Vadariya’s elder brother, Suresh. The elder brother allegedly sold off their ancestral land which was in the name of their mother Kanta, to Sutreja and his partner Gaurav Ruparaliya. However, Vadariya challenged the land deal in court on behalf of his mother Kanta and as a result Sutreja and Ruparaliya were unable to secure possession of the land.

This angered Sutreja who started threatening Vadariya on WhatsApp and also through phone calls, asking him to withdraw the case and hand him possession of the land. But Vadariya refused to give in which led Sutreja and his partner decide to bump him off, said police.
