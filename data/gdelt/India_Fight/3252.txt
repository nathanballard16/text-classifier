He killed the three terrorists in close combat,” said an officer.Sepoy Kumar (22 Rashtriya Rifles ), in turn, laid down his life while eliminating two terrorists during an operation in village Darsu in Baramulla district in August last year. “He came out in the open to cover the movement of some of his fellow soldiers who had come under heavy fire. He directly engaged the terrorists, killing one in the firefight. Despite being injured, he refused evacuation and later killed the second terrorist in hand-to-hand combat before succumbing to his injuries,” said the officer.The nine Shaurya Chakras awarded this Republic Day are also all connected to counter-terror operations in J&K.
