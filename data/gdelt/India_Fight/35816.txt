Man killed in Muzaffarnagar characterless, says Yogi Adityanath

New Delhi: One of the two Muslim youths murdered in 2013 in an incident in Muzaffarnagar was "characterless", had an "illicit affair with a married woman" and the "misbehaviour" of both was proved in the investigation, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said in a written reply in the state assembly on Tuesday.A question was asked by Samajwadi Party MLA Irfan Solanki in the state assembly about the murder of two brothers, Nawab and Shahid, on September 9, 2013 "during the Muzaffarnagar riots" and the subsequent murder of their brother and a key witness, Wahab, as well on March 11 this year. Wahab was the complainant in the initial case and was gunned down in broad daylight in Khatauli in Muzaffarnagar. Solanki asked what UP government was doing regarding providing security to witnesses in Muzaffarnagar riots cases.In his written reply, Adityanath cited a report he had received through the office of the director general of police from the senior superintendent of police Muzaffarnagar and said that the murder of the two brothers in 2013 was in no way connected with the Muzaffarnagar riots.“Investigation into the case found that Nawab and Shahid sold milk and hence went to people’s homes. Nawab was a badchalan (ill-behaved) and charitraheen (characterless) kind of person who had illicit relations with the wife of one Krishnapal. The investigation confirmed the misbehaviour of Nawab and Shahid and the truth was revealed in the interrogation of the accused,” Adityanath said.The CM, who also holds the home portfolio, said one person had been arrested and five had surrendered in court subsequent to the murder of the complainant in the initial case, Wahab, in March. “Wahab’s testimony in the murder case of Nawab and Shahid was recorded in the court on October 18 last year,” Adityanath said. He said that orders had been issued to the police and administrative authorities in Muzaffarnagar to provide security to the rest of the witnesses in the case and get their statements recorded before court in the ongoing trial.
