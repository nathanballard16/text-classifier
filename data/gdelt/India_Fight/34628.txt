Gujarat: Leopard that attacked five 'sentenced' to life in zoo

VADODARA: The leopard that had attacked five persons including two forest officials at Moti Sadhli village in Chhota Udepur will now spend rest of its life in a zoo.The big cat , aged around 16 years, has lost two canine teeth essential for hunting and has also developed a cataract in its right eye. On Monday it was sent to the rescue centre at Pavagadh where the veterinary doctors will administer treatment for removing the cataract. Forest officials learnt that the leopard had developed cataract after it was captured on July 12.“Its one eye was only functioning due to which it was not able to judge objects in front of it. Even when it attacked us and the two villagers it was not able to judge us properly, so the injury was not grave,” said deputy conservator of forest Nilesh Pandya. He added that due to its age the leopard had lost two canine teeth. “There could have been possibilities that it may not be able to hunt properly and so it entered human settlement,” he said.Pandya also said that looking at its age, the leopard will be sent to Sakkarbaug zoo at Junagadh after treatment of its eye so that it can get proper food without hunting for prey.
