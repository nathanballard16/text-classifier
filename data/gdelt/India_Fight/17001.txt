Dilip Kumar gets Bombay High Court relief in property dispute; Read Details

Veteran actor Dilip Kumar can now heave a sigh of relief as the Bombay High Court on Monday cancelled an arbitration tribunal's order asking the actor to give an undertaking to secure property worth Rs 25 crore in a dispute with a builder over his Pali Hill property, reported The Times of India. The builder was claiming Rs 176 crore in damages from the 95-year-old actor for backing out of a 2006 agreement to redevelop his bungalow in Mumbai, Bandra.

The report also quoted HC judge Burgess Colabawalla saying, "Looking at it from any angle, the tribunal was wholly unjustified in directing Kumar to give an undertaking that he will not alienate or encumber or part with possession of the property which was subject-matter of the arbitration to the extent of Rs 25 crore till the proceedings are concluded."

Dilip Kumar has been embroiled in this property dispute since 2006 when he first signed a development agreement with Sharyans Developers to redevelop his Pali Hill property in Bandra. However, in 2010, Sharyans handed over the deal to Prajita Developers. But, Dilip Kumar was unhappy with the progress and backed out in 2015. This is when Prajita approached the Bombay High Court and invoked the Arbitration clause. The case then reached the Supreme Court and it asked Dilip Kumar to deposit Rs 20 crore and said that Prajita could withdraw the money only after giving up possession of the property, which it did.

Later, the SC appointed an arbitration tribunal to decide if there was a breach of contract and if the developer was entitled to any further damages. The tribunal then asked the actor to furnish the undertaking of Rs 25 crore which has now been struck down by the Bombay High Court.
