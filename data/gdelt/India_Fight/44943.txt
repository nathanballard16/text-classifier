Bulandshahr violence: Allahabad high court grants bail to Bajrang Dal leader, 3 others

MEERUT: In less than three months after the UP government sanctioned sedition case against 44 jailed accused in the December 2018 Bulandshahr violence , the Allahabad high court on Wednesday granted bail to four accused, including Bajrang Dal leader Yogesh Raj, whose alleged role in instigating the locals had hogged national headlines.On December 3 last year, in the case of alleged cow slaughter, villagers loaded cattle carcasses in a tractor trolley and placed it in front of Chingrawati police post which resulted in a heated argument between the police and the agitated youths.Soon, enough mob violence erupted in the region wherein the mob outnumbered cops leading to the murder of station house officer (SHO) of Siyana police station Subodh Singh and an agitator Sumit Singh. Chingrawati picket was also set on fire.Soon after the violence, police had booked 27 (named) and more than 60 unnamed people in the violence under more than a dozen IPC sections, including 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 395 (dacoity), 333 (grievous hurt to public servant) and 124 A (sedition).On Tuesday, two bail applications were filed by advocate of the accused Anand Pati Tiwari in court 78 of the the Allahabad high court. Justice Siddharth allowed the bail in the sedition case on Wednesday.The first case pertained to Chaman, Devender and Sonu who had been in jail since December 4 last year. The court order said, "The case of the applicants stands on identical footing, hence the applicants are also entitled to bail on the ground of parity. The applicants are languishing in jail since December 4, 2018."The second application was solely of Yogesh Raj. The order could not be accessed by TOI but Tiwari confirmed the bail of Yogesh as well. All the accused have been granted bail in other crimes pertaining to the incident including an attempt to murder and dacoity.It may be noted that a local (Bulandshahr) court of the chief judicial magistrate had already granted bail to seven of the accused, including Shikhar Agarwal, Jeetu Fauji, Kalua, Sachin Kumar, Hemu, Rohit Raghav and others on August 13. Shikhar was heading the district unit of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of BJP.Yogesh Raj and BJP youth wing leader Shikhar Agarwal were accused of instigating crowds and later played hide and seek with police by uploading videos on social media claiming their innocence. Yogesh was finally arrested on January 3 while Agarwal was nabbed from Hapur on January 10 this year.It may be noted, on March 6, 2019, after police had filed the chargesheet, including the sedition charges, under IPC section 124 A, the CJM court had pulled up investigation officer Mishra as to "Why sedition charges were applied without the approval by the state government."Reacting to the development, Mishra had replied back then, "The court had sought clarification as to why IPC section 124 A was slapped without government approval. We have informed the court that at the time of filing of the chargesheet the permission had not yet arrived and we will submit the same moment we receive it in writing."Later, in June, the UP government had granted the sanction and on June 28 the then circle officer Khurja and investigation officer in the case Raghvendra Mishra had deposited the letter of sanction in the court.
