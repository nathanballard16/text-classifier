Trinamool leader shot dead in Murshidabad

Kolkata: A Trinamool Congress leader was shot dead on Friday afternoon at Hariharpara in Murshidabad. While he was waiting, a few miscreants came there in a car and blocked the way of Hasan's car. To save himself, the Trinamool leader got down from his car and tried to run. It has been alleged that a few BJP workers had yelled at some Trinamool workers on Friday afternoon, saying 'Jai Sree Ram'. When the Trinamool workers protested, the saffron party workers allegedly started beating them up.
