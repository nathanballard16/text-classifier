Man killed after truck hits bike in Maha

A 39-year-old man was killed when a container truck hit his motorcycle in Akola district of Maharashtra, a police official said Thursday.

The mishap took place on Nagpur-Mumbai highway late Wednesday night when Nitin Sudhakar Daberao was going on his two-wheeler to Amravati, he said.

A container truck moving on the same side hit Daberao's bike, following which his head got entangled in a hook of the four-wheeler.

As a result, the victim got dragged for about two kms where his body was later spotted by a passer-by, he said.

A search was on for the absconding truck driver who was booked under IPC Section 304-A (causing death by negligence), he said, adding that the body was sent for postmortem.
