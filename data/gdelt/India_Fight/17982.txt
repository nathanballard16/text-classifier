Modi trying to derive mileage out of Pulwama attack: D. Raja

‘Secularism is under attack with mob lynchings’

CPI national secretary D. Raja has said that the time has come for people to defeat the BJP at the Centre, the TDP in Andhra Pradesh and to elect the JSP, CPI, CPI(M) and BSP combine, which represents the genuine aspirations of them.

Addressing the media here on Sunday, Mr. Raja said that ever since Mr. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he has been making systematic efforts to undermine the secular and democratic fabric of India. He alleged that secularism was under attack with mob lynchings and continuing attacks on adivasis and minorities.

Disinvestment of PSUs, fall in rupee value, dismantling of the Planning Commission and replacing it with Niti Aayog have all left the economy in a shambles.

At a time when the Left parties were fighting for education, healthcare and employment for all, the Niti Aayog was planning to privatise everything. He wondered as to what happened to the promises of two crore jobs and bringing back black money from abroad. Describing the last four years as ‘misrule’ of the Modi government, he said Mr. Modi’s slogans were nothing but rhetoric to mislead the public.

Alleging that Mr. Modi and Mr. Amit Shah were desperate to come back to power, he said they were intimidating the media in the name of national security in a bid to create fear psychosis. He also alleged that Mr. Modi was politicising the Pulwama incident and trying to gain mileage out of the sacrifices made by the armed forces.

‘Mood has changed’

Mr. Raja said that the mood of the people has changed and they were prepared to go against Mr. Modi and the RSS. He appealed to the people to vote for a secular and democratic force. CPI State secretary K. Ramakrishnaalso spoke.
