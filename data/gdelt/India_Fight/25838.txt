Sonia Gandhi: Congress plays Sonia Gandhi's card for unity meet

New Delhi: Increasing expectations of a hung parliament have prompted anti-NDA opposition parties to prepare for coalition-building talks and the Congress to turn to Sonia Gandhi , its former President and chairperson of Congress-led United Progressive Alliance, to explore the possibility of convening a meeting of various opposition leaders as soon as the general election results are declared after counting begins on May 23.The development comes even as Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad said on Thursday that his party would not make the post of Prime Minister a matter of tussle among opposition parties and cited ouster of the Modi government as its top priority.While the DMK leadership reportedly confirmed receiving a message from Gandhi suggesting a meeting of opposition parties in Delhi after the results are announced, similar messages are said to have been conveyed to leaders of many other regional parties as well. A group of 21 opposition parties has been working on common issues even though some of them – such as Congress, SP, BSP and TMC – fought against each other in the general election.“I don’t want to either deny or confirm it,” Congress spokesman Surjewala said about Gandhi reaching out to opposition leaders. However, a senior Congress leader told ET on condition of anonymity, “We are exploring a unity meeting soon after the results are announced… Some parties will open their cards only after seeing the results.”There are indications, for instance, that Gandhi reached out to West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee after the recent clashes in Kolkata, according to people aware of the matter.They said that while many senior Congress leaders such as Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Ashok Gehlot and Kamal Nath are in touch with leaders of allies as well as “neutral parties” such as BJD, TRS and YSRCP, some other prominent opposition leaders such as Mamata Banerjee, Sharad Pawar and N Chandrababu Naidu have also reached out to the allies. In case of a hung parliament, the opposition camps are keen to act swiftly on vital issues such as putting up a unity show, reaching out to Rashtrapati Bhavan and even attempting a consensus on leadership issue, and hence the intensified outreach among opposition parties.To a question of media persons about who could be the prime ministerial candidate of opposition parties be in the event of a fractured verdict, Ghulam Nabi Azad said in Patna, “We (Congress) have already made our stand clear. If a consensus is made in the favour of Congress, then the party will take the leadership, but our aim has always been that the NDA government should not come. We will go with the unanimous decision. Conress will not insist on prime minister post if it is not offered to it.”
