Delhi Sex Worker Brutally Murdered After Refusing Marriage Proposal From A 32-Year-Old Married Man

A 32-year-old Delhi man was arrested by the Delhi Police Special Cell for murdering and chopping the body parts of a sex worker who rejected his marriage proposal.

Preliminary investigations revealed that 32-year-old Mohammad Ayub was in a relationship with Lata, the sex-worker.

Mohamad Ayub got married in 2008, but he got into an extra-marital affair with Lata, also known a Salma, after he met her in a brothel.

Mohammad Ayub told Lata to marry him and quit her job.

It is reported that Mohammad was rejected for a couple of times, and on August 20, 2019, the 32-year-old man brought Lata on an evening stroll and murdered her.

Mohammad Ayub slit the throat of Lata with a butcher’s knife and chopped her body with the same knife.

The police seized the vehicle that Mohammad Ayub used in the crime.

The Delhi police arrested Ayub from the Turkman Gate area of Delhi after receiving an Intel about his location.

Ayub is currently facing charges under the Indian Penal Code.

The chopped body of Mohammad Ayub was recovered from a canal in Delhi.
