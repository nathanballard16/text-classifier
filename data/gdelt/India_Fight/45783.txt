India of last 5 years will shake Mahatma Gandhi's idea of India: Sonia Gandhi

UPA chairperson and Congress interim chief launched an attack on the Modi government while speaking on Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary celebrations at the Rajghat. Sonia Gandhi said the India of last five years will shake the idea of India Mahatma Gandhi had.

Addressing a gathering of Congress workers at Rajghat after a padyatra led by Rahul Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi said, "India has Gandhi's principles as its foundation. The India we have seen in last five years will shake Gandhi's idea of India."

She also said, "Quoting Mahatma Gandhi is easy but it is tough to follow his path. Those who are trying to use his name but are taking India astray from his teachings will not succeed."

"Some people who are trying make RSS the symbol of India and sideline Mahatma Gandhi, those who want to have absolute power, will never understand Gandhi," said the Congress leader.

She also said how Congress has always followed the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi and had brought India this far by following the path shown by the Father of the Nation.

Sonia Gandhi observed how the previous Congress governments had created jobs, uplifted the poor, empowered women and created education opportunities for the youth. She added the India we see today will be a jolt to Mahatma Gandhi's ideals.

She said, "Only Congress has followed Gandhi's path and will continue to do so."

Referring to the rape charges involving BJP leaders Swami Chinmayanand and Kuldeep Singh Sengar, Sonia Gandhi said, "Today women are not safe and those powerful and commit crimes are at ease."

Congress took out a huge padyatra in the heart of Delhi on Wednesday to celebrate Mahatma Gandhi's 150th birth anniversary while BJP too has taken out a separate padyatra led by Amit Shah.
