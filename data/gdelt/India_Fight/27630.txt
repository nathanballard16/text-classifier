New Delhi: Bengali actors and newly-elected MPs of Trinamool Congress Mimi Chakraborty and Nusrat Jahan faced ire on social media for their choice of clothing as they posted their pictures posing in front of the Parliament.

Chakraborty and Jahan, who won the recently-held Lok Sabha elections from Jadavpur and Basirhat seats, on Monday shared photos of their first day in the Parliament on social media, only to get trolled.

In one of the photographs, the young parliamentarians can be seen displaying their identity cards as MPs outside the premises of Parliament.

Jahan won the elections by 3,50,369 votes while Chakraborty registered victory by a margin of 2,95,239 votes.

"And its us again. First day at Parliament Nusrat Jahan," Chakraborty tweeted tagging Jahan.

The newly-elected TMC MP also shared a picture of herself wearing jeans and top on Instagram flashing victory sign.

Chakraborty’s pictures did not go down well with the social media users with one of them saying "this is not film shooting".

A user ridiculed her for the way she dressed up while another asked her not to do drama at the Parliament and shame Bengal.

Jahan also faced similar wrath when she shared a photo of her on Instagram account. "This is not a place for a photoshoot. This is a place where you should fight for the people's rights and legislate for the country. You don't belong here,” a user commented on her post.

There were also some people who hailed the young MPs for breaking the preconceived notion of how female parliamentarian should dress up.
