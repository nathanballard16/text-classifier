Confer Param Vir Chakra on Abhinandan Varthaman, Tamil Nadu CM requests PM Narendra Modi

Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami on Friday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to confer the nation's highest military honour 'Param Vir Chakra' on Wing Commander Abhinandaan Varthaman.



"Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman displayed amazing poise and confidence in the face of adverse conditions, which has won him many hearts across the country. It is appropriate that he be awarded India's highest military honour 'Param Vir Chakra (PVC)' for displaying most inimitable gallantry and valour," he wrote in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.



After a suicide terror attack by Pakistan-based terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed on February 14 resulted in the killing of 40 CRPF jawans, India responded with counter-terrorism action against a training camp of JeM in Pakistan by using its Air Force.



A day after India's fighter jets bombed the terror camp, Pakistani jets on February 27 crossed the Line of Control (LoC) to target Indian military installations. Abhinandan, who hails from Tamil Nadu, was among the IAF pilots that engaged the Pakistani jets in the first aerial combat between the neighbours in nearly 50 years. In the dogfight, Abhinandan shot down a F-16 jet, but his MIG-21 Bison too was downed and he landed across the LoC where he was captured.



"Abhinandan was released by Pakistan on March 1 due to the diplomatic initiatives of the Prime Minister and international pressure," the CM said.



The Wing Commander's father retired from the Indian Air Force (IAF) as Air Marshal in 2012 and the serving officer's grandfather also served in the Indian Army. Abhinandhan's family hails from Tirupanamoor village in Tiruvannamalai district of Tamil Nadu.
