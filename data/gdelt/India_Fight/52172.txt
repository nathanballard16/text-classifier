Opposition, government clash over poll bonds

NEW DELHI: The opposition and the government clashed over electoral bonds in both Houses of Parliament on Thursday, with Congress alleging that the advice of the RBI and the Election Commission were disregarded.Congress claimed the NDA government still went ahead and introduced the bonds, which it said lacked transparency as regard donors’ identity and contribution. Party MPs, led by Sonia Gandhi, walked out soon after Speaker Om Birla disallowed Manish Tewari ’s attempt to mention a high office.Later in the day, commerce minister Piyush Goyal responded to the Congress charge and said electoral bonds had, in fact, worked to reduce black money in donations and increased transparency. He said the allegations were being levelled by those who flourished under an opaque and unaccountable system. Electoral bonds had a KYC requirement for donors and donations were from tax-paid money, he added.Electoral bonds provide anonymity to donors who can buy bonds and deposit them with a political party of their choice.In Lok Sabha, Tewari said there used to be control over the influence of the rich on politics earlier, but the scheme introduced through the 2017 Budget made donation anonymous. “People don’t know who is the donor, who is the receiver and how much money has been given,” he said. The Congress MP mentioned documents received through the RTI Act to make his point.Addressing reporters later, Tewari demanded an inquiry by a Joint Parliamentary Committee into what he said were opaque donations. The party also sought an early decision by the Supreme Court on the legality of these bonds. Rajya Sabha was adjourned till noon as Congress and other parties protested after the chair did not allow a discussion on electoral bonds.Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said he had received notices from several members to suspend business and take up discussions on the RBI’s objection to electoral bonds, and disinvestment of PSUs. “They (the notices) do not warrant suspension of other business,” he said.However, Congress and other opposition party members were on their feet and held protests, prompting Naidu to adjourn the House till noon.Earlier in the day, Sonia chaired a meeting of party leaders in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha who were briefed on the “electoral bond scandal” by leader of opposition in RS Ghulam Nabi Azad and deputy leader Anand Sharma.Later, when Congress members assembled in the House and one MP raised the issue of withdrawal of SPG cover to the Gandhi family, the Speaker cautioned against questioning the chair’s impartiality.
