Five FIRs have been filed against lawyers in Rajasthan’s Alwar after they clashed with police on Wednesday. The incident occurred when the lawyers were protesting against the clash between lawyers and the police at Delhi’s Tis Hazari court last Saturday.

“The lawyers were urging people and witnesses not to participate in court proceedings and were also misbehaving with them. When the police arrived, they started misbehaving with the force, which resulted in the clash by a mob of lawyers. They manhandled police personnel and civilians,” said Alwar Add-itional Superintendent of Police Vishnaram. He said four of the FIRs were registered by the police.

“The mob misbehaved with a lady constable and a case has been registered for outraging modesty of a woman against 6-7 people who were inciting the crowd. We have also lodged cases against the mob for hindering in official duty of a public servant,” he said, adding that the fifth case against the lawyers has been filed by a person with whom they had misbehaved.

The ASP added that an investigation is being conducted and any decision on arrests will be taken soon.

Meanwhile, the lawyers denied that they had misbehaved with the police and public.

“We were taking out a rally inside the Alwar court complex against police atrocities against lawyers during the incident in Delhi when the police charged at us. It is totally false that the mob misbehaved with a woman constable. We are convening a meeting today to decide our further course of action and are mulling filing FIRs against the police violence against us,” Uday Singh, president of the Alwar district bar association told The Indian Express.
