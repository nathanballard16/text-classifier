Abrogation of Article 370: Indian Navy puts all bases, warships on alert

Fearing a possible terror attack using the sea route like the November 2008 Mumbai attack, the Indian Navy has on Friday put all its bases and warships on high alert. The specific threats of the attack came after the central government revoked Article 370 and split Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories. "All stations have been activated and the situation is being monitored on the western and eastern coast of India," senior Indian Navy officer said.

The chain of 46 coastal radars set up after the November 2008 Mumbai terror attacks feed a constant picture to control rooms, including the Gurugram-based Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC). The IMAC collates information and then makes an assessment of the threat and then tasks assets to tackle the threat. The radar feeds and camera feeds — all in high definition real-life imagery — are being scanned for any suspicious movement along the 7516-km coastline after Parliament on August 5 scrapped Article 370 in J&K.

Pakistan government had expressed strong protest against the move and expelled the Indian envoy. Pakistan also suspended trade and halted rail transport across the border after India's decision to revoked Article 370. Pakistan has also stated that India should not blame of Pulwama type attack if happens.

Even Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan warned of 'serious repercussions' even as India has maintained that the matter of bifurcating the state into union territories under The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill 2019 on August 5 is an internal matter and advised other parties to stay out of its parliamentary decisions.
