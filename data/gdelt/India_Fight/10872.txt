India-Pakistan tension highlights: Imran Khan says IAF pilot to return today

India-Pakistan tension LIVE News: Hours after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced that the captured IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan will be released tomorrow as a “peace gesture”, the Indian Air Forces expressed its happiness over the development and said that his release is in consonance with the Geneva Convention.

In a joint presser by the armed forces, the IAF also said there is enough evidence to show that Pakistan used F-16s to target Indian military installations in this mission. Pakistan has denied that F-16 was part of the operation–any such admission would violate US sale conditions of not letting Pakistan use F-16s in an offensive role.

India on Tuesday conducted non-military preemptive air strikes on a terror camp in Balakot. A day later, Pakistan Air Force aircraft (PAF) violated Indian airspace in J&K and attempted air strikes but caused little damage on the ground as the bombs fell in uninhabited areas near military installations. In the process of thwarting the PAF’s intrusion, the IAF lost a MiG-21 Bison–its pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who ejected across the Line of Control, after bringing down a Pakistani F-16 during the aerial confrontation to repel the Pakistani attack.
