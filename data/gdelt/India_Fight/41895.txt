Father-son shot dead over property dispute in Maha's Nagpur

A senior citizen and his 35-year- old son were gunned down over a property dispute in Parseoni taluka of Maharashtra's Nagpur district, police said on Monday.

The bodies of Bandu Meshram (65) and his son Suraj were found with bullet wounds behind the neck in their farm in Gundaripande village at around 5pm on Sunday, a Parseoni police station official said.

"The shots came from a country-made pistol. We have arrested Avinash Sangode (30) for the crime. He had sold his land to the deceased and there was some dispute rising from the transaction, as well as over an adjoining government plot," he said.
