Mahindra xuv 700 is a very good car overall but just like everything else there are some pros and cons of this car as well.The upside of thee car is the sharp design elements, Comfortable ride quality, Clean dashboard layout, Powerful drivetrain options, Awd & diesel options.The downside of the car is the performance isn't the most exciting, Silly feature omissions, Noisy diesel, Cabin quality in some areas.I will give this car 4 out of 5 stars.
