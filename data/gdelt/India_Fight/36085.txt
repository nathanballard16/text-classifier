P. Rajagopal, Restaurant Mogul Convicted of Murder, Dies at 71

P. Rajagopal, who founded Saravana Bhavan, one of the largest South Indian vegetarian restaurant chains in the world, died on July 18 in Chennai, India, as he was facing life in prison in the murder of a man over a woman’s affections. He was 71.

His death, at Vijaya Health Center, was confirmed by the company. It said he had suffered cardiac arrest.

Mr. Rajagopal had been expected to begin his sentence this month before he was admitted to a hospital in poor health. But even after his initial conviction, in 2004, his company had continued to expand, and his employees, receiving generous benefits, had remained loyal to him. Saravana Bhavan now has 127 restaurants in 24 countries , employing about 5,000 people.

Court documents in his murder case said Mr. Rajagopal had wanted to marry the daughter of one of his assistant managers but was spurned by her. She soon eloped with another man, but Mr. Rajagopal was said to have continued to send her gifts.
