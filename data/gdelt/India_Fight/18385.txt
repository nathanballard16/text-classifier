Election Commission: State-level nodal officers to help Election Commission battle fake information

NEW DELHI: The Election Commission of India has directed its state-level bodies to appoint nodal officers immediately to keep an eye on possible violations on platforms such as Facebook Twitter and YouTube , as it takes another step to crack a whip on fake news, hate speech and other problematic content that violate the election model code of conduct.ET has seen a copy of the letter, addressed to chief electoral officers in states and Union territories, with the subject line reading, “Appointment of Nodal Officers at State Level-Instructions”.Facebook, WhatsApp Google , Twitter, ShareChat and ByteDance had in March agreed to a ‘Voluntary Code of Ethics’ to follow during the parliamentary elections.Cases of violation of the model code of conduct on social media should be immediately intimated to the grievance officers of the concerned social media platform as well as the commission, the letter said.EC has appointed three nodal officers in New Delhi. The commission said a copy of the violations should also be forwarded to nodal officers appointed by it and that they would examine the matter instantly and, after the approval of its director general (media), write to the platforms to take appropriate action.The EC said it would examine social media content for violations, including those of the model code of conduct or any of its instructions, provisions of the law or court orders related to election matters.The commission did not respond to an email seeking comment until press time Tuesday.The ‘voluntary code’ is expected to help the EC take down ‘problematic content’ and bring transparency in political advertising on social media during elections.Almost a third of India’s 900 million voters are active on social media, making this one of the world’s biggest-ever attempts to monitor Internet content.
