CSK to donate proceeds from 1st IPL home match to kin of Pulwama bravehearts

Chennai: The Chennai Super Kings (CSK) will donate proceeds from its first home match in this year’s edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL) to the families of the Pulwama bravehearts, the team’s director said on Wednesday.

Ticket proceeds of CSK’s match against Royal Challengers Bangalore, slated to be held at Chepauk on March 23, will go to the kin of the CRPF personnel who lost their lives in the February 14 terror attack, said CSK’s director Rakesh Singh.

“Our captain MS Dhoni, who is honorary lieutenant colonel of the Indian Territorial Army, will present the cheque,” he added.

Tickets to the highly-anticipated clash between defending champions CSK and Virat Kohli’s RCB were sold out within hours on the opening day of sale.

40 CRPF personnel lost their lives in an attack carried out by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district.

A convoy of 78 buses, in which around 2,500 CRPF personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar, came under attack at Ladhu Modi Lethpora on February 14.
