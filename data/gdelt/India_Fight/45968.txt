ALLAHABAD: A man wanted in several cases of murder and extortion was arrested after a police encounter in Pratapgarh district on Thursday.

Police recovered a 0.315 bore country-made pistol, four live cartridges and a motorcycle from the accused Rahul Tiwari’s possesion.

He was wanted in connection with three murder cases and several extortion cases, and had a regard of Rs 25,000 on his head.

SP (Pratapgarh) Abhishek Singh said, “Police were tipped-off that Tiwari was spotted moving towards Jethwara area. The Jethwara police cordoned off the area and launched a checking drive of vehicles near Saray Makai Road.”

Around 4.40am, a man opened fire at the police when they tried to stop him during the drive. The police team fired in retaliation. Tiwari injured his left leg in the encounter and was rushed to the district hospital in Pratapgarh.

The SP said that Tiwari was a sharp shooter and was an aide of gangster Bhanu Dubey. He was a part of the gang’s extortion racket and was wanted by police in Pratapgarh, Rai Bareilly and Allahabad.

The SP said that Bhanu Dubey operated from around Lalganj and adjoining areas and had been evading arrest since 2014.

Tiwari along with his accomplices had killed a salesman at a petrol pump in Baghrai area in 2015 over a monetary dispute.

In 2016, Tiwari and his aides had murdered a man in Yahiapur village under the limits of Kanhai police station.
