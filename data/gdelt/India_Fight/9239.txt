Indian Hotels Company moves into homestays with Ama Trails & Stays

The Indian Hotels Company (IHCL), South Asia’s largest hospitality company which owns the Taj chain of luxury hotels, has launched Ama Trails & Stays as the first branded product in the homestay market in India.

Ama Trails & Stays are a group of heritage bungalows, guesthouses and homestays at unique locations across the country.

The company has signed a management contract for nine heritage bungalows with Tata Coffee in Coorg and Chikmagalur, and is adding two of its own bungalows in Goa by mid next year under the Ama umbrella.

“IHCL has launched Ama Trails & Stays in response to evolving guest needs for local, immersive and authentic experiences. We are delighted to partner with Tata Coffee for the first collection of plantation trails leveraging Tata Group synergies,” said Puneet Chhatwal, managing director and CEO of IHCL.

“With India’s rich diversity we are confident that we will be able to scale this product to the first 100 units before the end of 2020 and bring distinctive offerings for our guests across the Indian sub-continent,” he added.

Guests will be able to earn and burn loyalty points through the Taj InnerCircle Loyalty Programme. Bookings open effective March 1, 2019.
