March 21, 2019

Mandya: All through her actor-husband Ambarish’s political career, Sumalatha kept a low profile politically. But now, after his death, she has entered the electoral battle as an Independent Candidate as Congress, her husband’s party, ceded the Mandya Lok Sabha seat to coalition partner JD(S).

She filed her nomination papers yesterday amidst much fanfare. Sumalatha is now pitted against Nikhil Kumaraswamy, son of Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy, who is contesting from JD(S). What was considered a cakewalk for Nikhil a few months ago will be a tough battle between the two now.

Sumalatha has declared assets worth Rs.23.41 crore in the affidavit filed before the Election Commission, along with her nomination papers. She has a loan to repay worth Rs.1.42 crore and has Rs.12.70 lakh cash in her hand and possesses 5.5 kgs of gold worth Rs.1.66 crore and 31 kg silver worth Rs.12.57 lakh.

She has a fixed deposit of Rs.1.31 crore and movable properties worth Rs.5,68,62,989, a house in J.P. Nagar, Uttarahalli and apartment which she owns on a partnership basis. Her immovable assets amounts to Rs.17,72,91,150. All the properties are inherited by her husband and Sumalatha does not even own a car. She has invested in various properties worth Rs.1.97 crore and commercial properties worth Rs.41 lakh.

Fifty-five-year-old Sumalatha said that she is a resident of Bengaluru and has her name in the voters list of Doddarasinakere in Maddur. She stated that she has studied SSLC at a Convent School in Guntur, Andhra Pradesh.
