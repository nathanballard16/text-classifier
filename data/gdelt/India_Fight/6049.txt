London [UK], Feb 15 (ANI): Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) chief Altaf Hussain strongly condemned the deadly terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district which was carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit based in Pakistan, saying that such acts of terrorism will be futile for the peace in the region.
