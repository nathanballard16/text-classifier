India’s and Pakistan’s Lies Thwarted a War—For Now

Slightly better analysis this time from Christine Fair....though her bias is evident, still doctoring a version that is palatable to her and her Indian audiences.



She has lost credibility as a scholar....due to her extreme bias. She supports a nation, the USA that is currently dropping a bomb every 12 minutes somewhere in the word.

She is an ardent supporter of western state terrorism....under the guise of regime change and so-called democracy.

Look at the current hostility when attempt by the USA and other western countries to cause political instability in Venezuela!
