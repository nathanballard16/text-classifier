'Convince yourself I was murdered': Kolkata schoolgirl's 'suicide note' reveals fight with depression

1/3

The three-page suicide note that has been recovered by the police shows, however, that she was in tremendous depression. Zee Media got exclusive access to the macabre contents of the suicide note, which reflect that she was suffering from depression and her mind, battling with the illness, was in a state of mess.

In this suicide note, she wrote that only she is to be held responsible for her death and that she should be given a 'nice funeral'.

It has been stressed repeatedly what she was battling for a long time. "Some saw it some didn't," the letter reads, "They thought their arrogance would suppress her."

However, it is not clear yet who she has been referring to here by 'they', as repeated various times in the three-page suicide note.

What is discernible from the letter, though, is the fact that she was tremendously unhappy with her parents. The letter reads, "Mom and dad better keep your nose out of stuff. You don't get it. I know you have done a lot for me. Okay, yeah, a lot. But you know, not everyone pays back."

The forensic team is investigating the handwriting. If they do find out that the letter is indeed a suicide note written by her, it then brings out a serious issue that perhaps plagued the girl's daily life - the amount of pressure she was going through without anyone even noticing.
