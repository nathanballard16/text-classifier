Two members of gang arrested for planning series of murders

The Delhi police special cell has arrested two members of a gang operating in Khora Colony of Ghaziabad before they could execute a series of murders to stamp their supremacy in the area, said the police on Tuesday. They were acting on instructions from their gang leader who is currently in jail.

The arrested persons were identified as Bal Kishan, a resident of Trilokpuri and Mohd Ateek, a resident of Khora colony. “We have recovered a stolen motorcycle and arms and ammunition from their possession. They are accomplices of one Chanderbhan alias Aman Yadav who is currently lodged in Mandoli Jail,” said DCP (Special Cell) Pramod Kushwah.

Mr. Kushwah said that it was learnt through sources that some of the gang leaders lodged in jail have been procuring sophisticated weapons through their accomplices to eliminate their rivals and also to establish supremacy in their area for running extortion racket. “We got to know that Chanderbhan had directed his associates to eliminate two persons to stamp his authority in Khora Colony for running a smooth extortion racket,” said Mr. Kushwah.

A special team was constituted and in a swift operation, two members of his gang were arrested from near Bal Bharti School. Both of them are hardcore criminals and were previously involved in heinous crimes.

Subsequently, a search was conducted at cell no.11 in Mandoli jail and a diary containing the details of Ateek was recovered from Chanderbhan. During interrogation, it was disclosed that Chanderbhan had earlier extorted money from a person. During subsequent extortion attempts, the person had lodged a case of extortion against him and he was arrested, said the officer.

“Chanderbhan had hatched a conspiracy with the arrested persons to eliminate the complainant so that it will create fear among others. He also wanted to kill another person to maintain his supremacy in the area,” said Mr. Kushwah.
