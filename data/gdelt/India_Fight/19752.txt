Yasin Malik shifted to Tihar, Mirwaiz Questioning Gets Into Third Day

SRINAGAR: Muhammad Yasin Malik, the leader of the proscribed Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) was late Tuesday shifted to Delhi’s Tihar Jail after the National Investigation Agency (NIA) secured his production remand in connection with an alleged terror funding case, an official said on Wednesday. He is the second top separatist who will be investigated by the NIA. Already, Mirwaiz is in Delhi where he is facing questioning since Monday.

Malik, who was arrested after his party was banned by the ministry of home affairs and shifted to Kot Balwal Jail in Jammu, will be facing questions from NIA related to funding of his organisation.

Soon after his arrest from his Srinagar residence, a team of NIA raided his house along with others that included Mirwaiz Umar Farooq. Pertinently, Mirwaiz is also in Delhi where he faced questioning by NIA since Monday. For the last three days, he is being questioned for 13 hours daily, reports said, adding he has been mentioned as a witness in a terror funding case. The political parties campaigning for Lok Sabha polls have made an issue of Mirwaiz’s summoning.

Reportedly the NIA had approached a special court in Jammu, seeking Malik’s remand for custodial interrogation in the terror-funding case. And sources informed Kashmir Life from New Delhi that “Mirwaiz and Malik will be questioned face to face.”
