It is an all-out political war following the Pulwama terror attack. Congress’s strident strike against the BJP, particularly Prime Minister Narendra Modi, received an equally forceful reaction from the ruling party.

While Union Minister Ravi Shakar Prasad will be issuing a point-by-point rebuttal of the Congress’s allegations, Union Minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said he was not surprised over such statements given the past record of the Congress.

Meanwhile, BJP chief Amit Shah accused the Congress of playing politics and trusting Pakistan more than the BJP. He said Prime Minister Modi worked for more than 18 hours every day and allegations regarding his commitment on the country’s security would have no affect on the people of the country who knew this well.

The Congress on Thursday targeted Modi for “indulging in self-promotion by way of a film shoot at the Jim Corbett park even minutes after the Pulwama terror attack”.

Speaking in Andhra Pradesh, Shah said the problems and the situation in Kashmir, because of which Pakistan was carrying out such dastardly attacks against India, was all because of Congress’s Jawaharlal Nehru.

“Had Sardar Patel been the Prime Minister, India would not have faced the Kashmir problem as the issue would have been resolved there and then,” Shah was quoted as saying by a news agency.
