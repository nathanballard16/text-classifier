Monsoon chaos kills dozens in India and Nepal, more than 1.5 million affected

NEW DELHI (DPA, AFP) - At least 35 people have been killed and more than 1.5 million affected by flooding triggered by monsoon rains in northern and eastern India, officials and news reports said on Sunday (July 14).

At least 19 people have been killed in incidents of house collapses and electrocution during rains in Uttar Pradesh state since July 10, an official at the state disaster management control room said.

Uttar Pradesh shares a border with Nepal, which has also seen many deaths due to torrential rains.

In the north-eastern state of Assam, seven people were killed in the same period, as incessant rains flooded 25 of the state's 33 districts.

Over 1.5 million people have been affected, including being displaced, stranded in their homes and suffering damage to their crops, lands and livelihood, state officials said.

Over 20,000 people have been shifted to 234 government-run relief camps and centres, they said.

Nine more rain-related deaths have been reported in the north-eastern region - five in Meghalaya, and two in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram states, respectively - in the last four days, local media reported.

The weather office has forecast more rainfall in the regions over the next few days, prompting the federal home ministry to direct officials to ensure proper rescue and relief mechanisms are in place to help flood victims.

Monsoon rains from June to September cause widespread death and destruction across South Asia each year.
