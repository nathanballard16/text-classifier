SC upholds life term for Saravana Bhavan owner P Rajagopal for employee's murder in 2001

Supreme Court gives life term to South Indian restaurant Saravana Bhavan proprietor P Rajagopal, for getting an employee murdered in 2001 so as to marry the victim's wife on an astrologer's advise.

The Supreme Court upheld the Madras High Court order.

Rajagopal was out on bail and now he will have to surrender by July.

In 2009, the Madras High Court had awarded life term to popular restaurant chain Saravana Bhavan owner Rajagopal and eight others in the murder case.

According to reports, 18 years ago, Rajagopal had hired eight henchmen to abduct and murder the victim identified as Prince Santhakumar.

Prince Santhakumar had married a woman who Rajagopal wanted to marry and make her his third wife. This was all thanks to the advice of an astrologer.

The woman was the daughter of a Saravana employee and she refused to marry Rajagopal. She got married to Santhakumar in 1999.
