India shoots down live satellite to demonstrate anti-satellite missile capability

NEW DELHI: India successfully tested an anti-satellite (ASAT) missile to destroy an orbiting satellite at an altitude of almost 300-km on Wednesday, jettisoning its long-standing reluctance to flex military muscle in the final frontier of space.Gatecrashing into the extremely exclusive club to have this deadly capability, which includes only the US, Russia and China as of now, India test-fired the three-stage interceptor missile from the Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Island off the Odisha coast at 11.10 am under a project code-named “Mission Shakti”.The 18-tonne missile, with two solid rocket boosters, tore into space to hit the 740-kg satellite, flying in a low earth orbit (LEO), bang in the middle barely three minutes later over the Bay of Bengal.“It was direct-ascent kinetic kill. The relative velocity between the missile and the orbiting Microsat-R satellite, which was launched by ISRO on January 24 for the test, was around 10-km per second,” said a top defence scientist.Though the ASAT missile was tested for a 300-km altitude, DRDO scientists are confident it “can go up to 1,000-km” if required. “We need the capability to neutralize surveillance, communication, navigation and other military satellites during a conflict to render enemy forces deaf and blind as well as disrupt their precision-targeting capabilities,” he added.India, in particular, is worried about the huge strides made in the military space arena by China, which tested its first ASAT missile in January 2007 and also has robust programmes for kinetic and directed-energy laser weapons as well as nano-satellites.Prime Minister Narendra Modi , in a televised address to the nation in poll season, said India with the ASAT test had become the fourth country to acquire “this global space power” status.“The new capability we have developed is not directed against anyone. India has no intention to threaten anyone,” said Modi, reiterating India’s opposition to weaponization of space and arms race in outer space But noting that India had a large number of satellites orbiting the earth to aid the country’s economic development, Modi said “defending and securing these valuable assets” in outer-space is equally important.DRDO chief G Satheesh Reddy, in turn, told TOI that all the technologies required for the ASAT mission were developed indigenously. “In the ASAT test, we achieved an accuracy of a few centimeters, meeting all technical parameters and objectives. We have the capability to do it at much higher altitudes but conducted the test in LEO or lower atmosphere to ensure the space debris decays and falls back to earth,” he said.India has had the “building blocks” for the ASAT capability through spin-offs from the over 5,000-km Agni-V strategic missile and two-tier ballistic missile defence (BMD) programmes for several years now.In April 2012, for instance, the then DRDO chief V K Saraswat (now a Niti Ayog member) had told TOI that it would require “marrying” the Agni-V missile’s propulsion system with the “kill vehicle’’ of the BMD system, which has interceptor missiles to destroy hostile missiles both inside (endo) and outside (exo) the earth's atmosphere.But India did not cross the red-line due to its self-imposed moratorium as well as the world-wide condemnation of China’s first ASAT test in January 2007.With the Modi government giving the green signal, DRDO scientists began working on the ASAT missile around two years ago, with the preparations becoming “serious in mission-mode” in the last six months.“The ASAT missile is quite a new system, with a lot of thrusters. It borrows some of the technologies like seekers, communications etc from the BMD system,” said a scientist.
