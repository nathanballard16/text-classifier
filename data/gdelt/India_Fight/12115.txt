Union Minister SS Ahluwalia says air strikes were meant to display India capability, not to kill anyone

Union Minister Surendrajeet Singh Ahluwalia on Sunday asserted that the main aim of the air strikes carried out by the Indian Air Forces (IAF) across the Line of Control (LoC) was to send out a message that India can hit within Pakistan if the situation arises. On the question of if the IAF was able to inflict any causality, Ahluwalia said that neither the Prime Minister nor any BJP spokesperson or any defence official had given any figures and there were only "unconfirmed” reports of around 300 terrorists being eliminated.

"The intention of the strike was to send out a message that India is capable of destruction in Pakistan's own backyard if needed. We didn't want any human casualty," SS Ahluwalia was quoted by PTI as saying.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) (CPI-M) was quick to tweak Ahluwalia's comments asking if the government was backtracking from its comments to which the minister of state for electronics and information technology said that he had only reiterated what the government had said.

On the CPI-M's questioning, Ahluwalia said that he was asked if he stood by the government's stand or media reports to which he replied that he stands by the government. "I was asked whether I stand by the government's statement or by the reports of Indian media which have said, 300-350 terrorists, where killed. I stand by the government's statement. How can I vouch for media reports," he told PTI.

Ahluwalia's comments have come in the backdrop of West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee raising questions over the strike. Banerjee had asked the government to clarify how many terrorists were neutralised or "if did anyone die at all?"
