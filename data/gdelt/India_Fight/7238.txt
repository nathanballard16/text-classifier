2 militants linked to Feb 14 Pulwama attack killed

Two Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists suspected to be linked with last Thursday's deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir on Indian paramilitary troops killing 40 of them, was killed in a gun battle in the state's Pulwama district today, defence officials said.



Meanwhile four Indian army men, including a major, were also killed in the gun battle today.



A civilian was also killed in the exchange of fire in Pinglan area of south Kashmir's Pulwama district, our New Delhi correspondent reports quoting the defence officials.



"The terrorists are believed to be linked to the February 14 car bombing. The exact identities of the two terrorists killed are being ascertained," a defence spokesperson said.



Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in the early hours after receiving inputs about the presence of militants in the area, a police official said. Militants fired at forces as the searches got under way, triggering a gun battle, officials said.



Today's gun fight came three days after a Jaish suicide bomber from the group rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a bus carrying the paramilitary personnel on February 14, leaving 40 of the dead.



Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed responsibility for the February 14 terror attack in Pulwama.
