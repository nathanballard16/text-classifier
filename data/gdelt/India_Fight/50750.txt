VIJAYAWADA: A 47-year-old Andhra Pradesh man on Friday jumped to his death from the top of a three-storey building while being questioned by police about his wife allegedly dressing up as a male and abusing minor girls using an assortment of sex toys.The deceased, a resident of Ongole town, ran up the stairs and jumped off the terrace soon after a police team raided the house and found a large bag containing sex toys. He was moved to a hospital, where he died in the evening.Police identified him as the third husband of the accused, a 32-year-old woman whom at least one of her alleged victims mistook for a male because of her cropped hair and attire. The case came to light after the 17-year-old girl filed a complaint with the SP’s office in Prakasam, alleging that she had been sexually abused by a man named Krishna Kishore Reddy.When Prakasam SP Sidharth Kaushal ordered an inquiry, investigators discovered that Krishna Kishore was actually a woman masquerading as a man. Ongole DSP B Ravi Chandra told TOI that the accused would befriend minor girls and either lure or coerce them into starting an intimate relationship with her. The woman has been arrested and booked under the Pocso Act.
