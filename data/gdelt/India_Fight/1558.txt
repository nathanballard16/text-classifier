Curbing fake call centres top priority for new Noida SSP

NOIDA: Former Ghaziabad SSP Vaibhav Krishna took over as the new police chief of Gautam Budh Nagar on Friday, putting to rest rumours that his transfer could be stayed. The order for Krishna’s transfer had come late on Monday evening. He was among 64 police officers transferred that day.Since Krishna, a 2010-batch officer, did not take charge for three days, speculation was rife in police circles that his transfer may be reversed. He interacted with the media after taking charge on Friday and said he would soon prepare a mechanism to rein in sham call centres. “Cyber crime and call centres will be one of my priorities. A special cell will handle such cases,” he said.On a question about encounters, he said there would be “a specific strategy” against organised crime. Krishna’s predecessor in Gautam Budh Nagar, Ajay Pal Sharma, was known as an “encounter specialist”. Under him, police teams had carried out at least 170 shootouts with criminals, possibly the highest in the district in recent years. A 2010-batch officer, Sharma was sent to the police headquarters in Prayagraj on Monday.One of the challenges awaiting Krishna is the rapid mushrooming of call centres in Noida. Bogus centres in the region have spread their tentacles to the US, Canada and Europe.Cyber frauds against US citizens orchestrated from Noida had triggered a visit by an FBI team, which lead to a series of raids.Krishna, however, is not new to the region. He had been the police chief of neighbouring Ghaziabad, from where he was transferred to the police headquarters in Prayagraj in November last year. He had handed over charge to Upendra Agarwal, a 2005-batch officer.He has also previously served in Etawah and Bulandshahr districts.
