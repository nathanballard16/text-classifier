Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday sought to link the Opposition’s mega rally in Calcutta with corruption, saying his government’s crackdown on graft had pushed desperate “wrongdoers” into joining hands. Modi called the Opposition’s proposed “mahagathbandhan” (grand alliance) a combine of leaders he had prevented from “looting India” and claimed they were not only against him but also the people of the country.

“They (the Opposition leaders) are angry, why Modi is taking strong action against corruption…. Due to this anger, now these people are trying to form a grand alliance,” Modi told a rally in Silvassa, the capital of the Union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli that borders Gujarat. “This grand alliance is not only against Modi but also against the people of the country.” The Prime Minister’s rally came on the same day leaders from over a dozen Opposition parties came together at the rally in Calcutta where they vowed to put up a united fight to oust Modi and the BJP from power in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. While Modi sought to project the planned mahagathbandhan as an alliance of corrupt and opportunistic leaders, BJP sources said aggressive Opposition attacks on the Prime Minister might end up helping the ruling party. “We want the Opposition leaders to launch an aggressive attack against Modi. This will have a counter-effect and increase the Prime Minister’s standing among voters, particularly youths and first-time voters,” a BJP leader said.
