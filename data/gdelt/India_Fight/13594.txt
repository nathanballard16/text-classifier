Fire breaks out at Delhi’s CGO Complex

A massive fire broke out on the fifth floor of Pandit Deendayal Antyodaya Bhawan at CGO Complex in Delhi this morning. Twenty-eight fire tenders have rushed to the site and rescue operations are continuing.

An inspector from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) died in the incident.

Many central government offices, including a branch of the Indian Air Force, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, Ministry of Social Justice Empowerment and Disability, and the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change operate out of the 11-storeyed building previously known as the Paryavaran Bhawan.

The blaze started from the office of Social Justice Empowerment ministry at around 8:30 am and soon spread across the building, the reports said.

This comes days after the Karol Bagh fire that took away lives of 17 people.
