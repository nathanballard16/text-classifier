In MP Kirit Somaiya's absence, Marathi votes to play decider in Mumbai North East

In the absence of any wave, nearly 56.31 per cent polling took place in North East Mumbai where BJP candidate Manoj Kotak is locked in a straight fight against NCP nominee Sanjay Patil. Voters weathered heat wave to cast their votes especially between 7 am and 1 pm, but the voter turnout dipped post lunch till 4 pm. Thereafter, there were long queues until the voting ended at around 6 pm.

86-year-old Gunwantiben Somaiya, the mother of outgoing BJP MP Kirit Somaiya, cast vote along with her family members. She has been voting since 1952, the first general elections held after Independence. First-time voter Adarsh Bakre said he voted for economic development. "I want India to be among three leading economies,'' he added.

Another first-time voter Sabina Sheikh hoped that the strengthening of infrastructure is needed badly to remove traffic jams.

BJP initially had to struggle to project Kotak among voters after it had dropped the incumbent MP Kirit Somaiya following strong opposition from ally Shiv Sena. However, the housing minister Prakash Mehta with Somaiya and other leaders carried out high octane campaign by reaching out to voters in the constituency which is marked by slums, chawls, high rise buildings and malls. BJP also worked hard to pacify Sena and brought its leaders and rank and file on board. The Gujarati dominated Ghatkopar, parts of Mulund witnessed serpentine queues. Some of the voters wanted PM Modi to return to power as they had serious doubts about an alternative.

On the other hand, Patil made all efforts to take the benefit of division between saffron allies. Maharashtra Navnirman Sena's decision not to contest the poll but its decision to support Patil came quite handy for the latter to lure traditional Marathi voters who are in a sizeable number in Bhandup, Kanjurmarg, Vikhroli and Mulund. He also banked on Dalit and Muslim voters.
