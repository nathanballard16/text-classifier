Major Nishant Dogra of the Indian Army was killed in a sudden snow slide at Yongdi in North Sikkim.

Major Dogra was with his battalion at a high-altitude posting. He was inside his make-shift accommodation when the snow slide carried away the entire accommodation on February 9.

The Major, who is from an armoured unit, was found very seriously injured under mounds of snow late that night. Weather conditions prevented an immediate evacuation.

He died on Sunday. Army authorities in Delhi have confirmed the death. The Major's family originally hails from Jammu, and is now in Delhi.
