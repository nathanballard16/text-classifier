Won’t disclose 3rd of 3 cross-border strikes in 5 years: Rajnath

India carried out three cross border strikes in the last five years, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh said here on Saturday, without disclosing which was the third.

Singh spoke about the 2016 surgical strike after the Uri terror attack and the air strike after the Pulwama incident in which a CRPF convoy was attacked by a suicide bomber martyring 44 jawans, but he did not reveal about the third.

“I want to tell you brothers and sisters that in the last five years, we have gone beyond our borders thrice and our men have successfully conducted airstrikes. About two I will tell you, but won’t tell you about the third one,” Singh told BJP’s Shakti Kendra office bearers convention here.

“One time you saw in Uri, terrorists who came from Pakistan killed 17 of our soldiers, who were sleeping at night in a cowardly attack.

“After that, our soldiers also decided. Whatever happened after that you too know it very well, I need not tell....Now you are seeing.

“First attack happened. Second one was air strike... happened after Pulwama attack. I won’t give you information about the third one,” Singh said without elaborating.

Singh asserted that “it is no more a weak India.”

“...Leaving aside all our differences, we have to stand together. Time and again India has done this.”
