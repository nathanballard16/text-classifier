NEW DELHI: The government on Monday revoked Article 370 to take away Jammu and Kashmir's special status, and proposed the bifurcation of the state into two union territories — Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh — a bold and far-reaching decision that seeks to redraw the map and future of a region at the centre of a protracted militancy movement.Fulfilling an electoral promise of the BJP less than 90 days after the Modi 2.0 government took power, Union home minister Amit Shah announced the decision in the Rajya Sabha, which approved both the resolution and the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Bill., Jammu and Kashmir was the only state in the country with its separate constitution as per the provisions mentioned in Article 370, a 'temporary provision' that grants special autonomous status to Jammu & Kashmir., the government's decision to revoke Article 370 will revoke the special provision which grants power to J&K to have its own constitution. With the revocation of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir will adhere to the Constitution of India, much like the rest of the country. Article 35A , which is based on Article 370, empowered the J&K legislature to define the state's 'permanent residents' and grant them special rights and privileges., with the scrapping of Article 370 (and hence Article 35A) people from outside J&K will also be able to to buy property in the state and settle there., law and order was under the control of the state government, following the bifurcation of the state into two Union Territories — J&K and Ladakh, the law and order machinery will have to be restructured. The government can structure the power-sharing model on the lines of either Delhi or Puducherry, both union territories. In Delhi, law and order is under the control of the Union government, while in Puducherry, law and order is a state subject., the central government had to seek approval of the state legislature to draft and enact laws., central laws will automatically apply to the state., Article 370 granted special permission to J&K to have its own flag along with the national flag., it will depend upon Parliament to decide if the state can continue having its own flag.
