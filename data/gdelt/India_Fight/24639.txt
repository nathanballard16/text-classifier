2019 Hero Pleasure (facelift) to launch on May 13

Along with the Maestro Edge 125, Hero Motocorp will launch the all-new 2019 Pleasure, on the 13th of this month. At the start of this month, the XPulse 200, XPulse 200T and Xtreme 200S were simultaneously launched.

The Pleasure was left unattended while Hero MotoCorp focused on expanding its line-up. Finally, next week, the company will give it a full model change that has been a long time coming. The company has remained tight-lipped about the all-new 2019 Pleasure, but in March, a spy shot captured during its TVC shoot finally spilt the beans.

The all-new 2019 Hero Pleasure looks more modern thanks to the new front apron that integrates redesigned direction indicators and the retro-style upright headlamp. The side panel looks sleeker and the brushed silver plastic inserts on them lend the scooter a premium look. At the rear, it is safe to assume that there will be a redesigned tail lamp. A new instrument panel is a given, and it may be a semi-digital unit. Other highlights may include optional alloy wheels, under-seat storage light and USB charging port.

The 2019 Hero Pleasure will most likely be powered by the outgoing model's BS-IV 102 cc single-cylinder air-cooled engine that delivers 5.15 kW (7.00 PS) of maximum power 7,000 rpm and 8.1 Nm of peak torque at 5,000 rpm. Significant enhancements to this engine can be expected along with the BS-VI upgrade by March 2020. The all-new model will feature IBS (Integrated Braking System) which is Hero MotoCorp's branding for combi-braking technology.
