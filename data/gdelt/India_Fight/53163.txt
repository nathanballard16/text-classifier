Abhishek, a resident of Kuvempu Nagar in Mysuru, had completed his engineering course from Vidya Vikas College before moving to the US in March last year for higher studies.

The family said it had approached Mysuru MP Pratap Simha to help bring the body back to India. Simha, they said, had contacted the Ministry of External Affairs to coordinate with the Indian Embassy in the United States for the same.

BJP Karnataka president Nalin Kumar Kateel condoled the death of Abhishek in a tweet on Friday.
