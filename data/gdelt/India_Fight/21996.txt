Firoz Nadiadwala to make a movie on Mira Road call centre scam

Filmmaker Firoz Nadiadwala is all set to make a film on the Mira Road call centre scam in 2016, Mumbai. The scam that ran through seven call centres, targeted loan defaulters of the US .

Titled Hot Shots- Dare to Dream, the film will be shot in Mumbai, Dubai and New York. The director and cast of the film are yet to be finalised. Firoz confirmed the news to Mumbai Mirror and told them, “It’s the world’s biggest corporate call centre scam. The Americans who consider themselves to be the most intelligent in the world, were duped by a bunch of Indians living in a remote suburb of Mumbai. We will be going on the floors as soon as we lock our director and cast.”

The scam was discovered on October 4, 2016, when the Thane crime branch, along with the Thane rural police raided seven call centres at Mira Road and arrested more than 75 people, including floor managers, accountants and an investor. It was then found that fake call centre employees targeted loan defaulters in the US by posing as officials from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and department of treasury to extort millions of dollars by threatening these citizens with tax fraud or tax evasion.

The mastermind of the entire escam, Sagar Thakkar aka Shaggy, had roped in his childhood friends to form a network of floor managers, who ran the multi-million dollar con across cities. Employees would either buy or use software to obtain information from the white pages in America, which is similar to the yellow pages in India. The accused duped more than 6500 people to over Rs 500 crore.
