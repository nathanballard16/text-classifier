HC lawyers boycott work, demand safer courts

Allahabad: Over 3.5 lakh lawyers across the state did not attend court and boycotted work to protest against the rising number of attacks against advocates across the state on Monday.The agitation followed a statewide call for protest by the Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh (BCUP), the apex body of the lawyers of the state. The council demanded more security for lawyers as well as in court campuses across the state.More than 10,000 lawyers also joined the protest and abstained from judicial work on Monday.Allahabad High Court Bar Association (HCBA) president Rakesh Pandey and its secretary JB Singh said the association demanded that the three tribunals—GST Appellate Tribunal, Educational Tribunal and State Service Tribunal—be set up in Allahabad, as the principal seat of the high court is located in the district.Pandey said the benches of these tribunals could be set up in other UP districts, but the main tribunals must be set up in Allahabad.On June 12, UP Bar Councils first woman president Darvesh Yadav was shot dead by a colleague at a district court campus in Agra. The accused, Manish Sharma, shot himself after attacking Yadav. He was rushed to hospital, but he succumbed to his injuries after a few days. She was shot just three days after being elected to the post. Both Sharma and Yadav had known each other for over a decade and were close friends. As per reports, their allegedly relations soured after Yadavs elections as the bar council president.According to the Uttar Pradesh Bar Council chief Hari Shankar Singh, lawyers from the tehsil level to the high court level will participate in the strike.“We are demanding better working conditions and security for all lawyers. In cases where lawyers have been murdered, their families should be given adequate compensation by the government,” he said. TNN & agencies
