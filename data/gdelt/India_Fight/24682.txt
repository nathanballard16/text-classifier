SCOOPS: Salman Khan took 2.5 hours to look old in Bharat, Ekta Kapoor's message gets lost in Kangana vs Hrithik

1/3

In his upcoming Eid release, Bharat, Salman Khan plays a man who ages nearly 50 years during the course of the story. Incidentally, this is the first time the actor has used prosthetics for his look in his older stages. It would take him two-and-a-half hours to get ready for his scenes and at the end of the day’s shoot, just as long to remove the prosthetics and make-up.

Ali Abbas Zafar, director of the film, which also stars Katrina Kaif, Disha Patani and Tabu, says they used major prosthetics for Salman’s older portion. “The prosthetics were designed by a UK-based company and executed with Indian make-up artistes. SK sir also tried over 20 different kinds of beards and moustaches for this look,” he states, adding, “It’s a very tedious process, but he would be patient. It would take him two-and-a-half hours to get ready. After the narration, he understood that not only did the script demand it, but this look is also very significant in keeping with his character graph. He was very supportive about the idea and the entire process.”

What is also important to note is that because of his neurological condition — trigeminal neuralgia, for which he underwent surgery in 2011 — Salman was cautioned against doing dangerous stunts and using prosthetics as his skin needs to breathe. That’s one reason why, after considerable thought, decided to opt for this technology for his older look in the movie.
