Delhi High Court rejects plea seeking use of ‘martyr’ word

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Tuesday dismissed a plea seeking direction to the media to use the word “martyr” in place of killed and died for soldiers. The bench comprising Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V. Kameswar Rao also slammed the petitioner and advocate Abhishek Choudhury for filing the frivolous application on the same ground which was already disposed off by another bench in October 2016.

Choudhury has filed the plea seeking direction to the press and electronic media to use “respectful words on the martyrdom of soldiers”. He urged the court to direct the media to use the word “martyr” as “brave soldiers are never killed.” The plea was filed after 40 CRPF troopers were killed in a terror attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir on February 14.
