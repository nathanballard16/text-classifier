New Delhi/Srinagar, January 24

A 38-year-old reformed Kashmiri militant who joined the Territorial Army will be posthumously awarded the Ashok Chakra, country’s highest peacetime gallantry award.

Lance Naik Nazir Ahmad Wani’s wife Mahajabeen will receive the award and citation from President Ram Nath Kovind on Republic Day in New Delhi.

Wani, a resident of Cheki Ashmuji of Kulgam district, was a member of the ‘Ikhwan’ (pro-government militia) before he joined Indian Army’s 162 Infantry Battalion (Territorial Army), also known as (Home and Hearth) Jammu and Kashmir Light Infantry, in 2004. He went on to receive the Sena Medal for gallantry twice in 2007 and 2018.

The Ashok Chakra is being awarded for his role in eliminating the “district commander” of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Toiba during an operation against six militants at Batagund in Shopian district on November 25 last year. In the ensuing gunfight, he was hit multiple times, including in the head. He injured another terrorist before succumbing to his wounds.

“He shunned violence having realised its futility and assisted the forces in its endeavour against terrorism. His indomitable courage and bravery led to many successful operations,” a defence official said in Srinagar.

Apart from his wife, he is survived by two sons, Athar (20) and Shaid (18).
