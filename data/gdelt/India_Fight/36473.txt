Indias Unregistered Churches Caught in the Crosshairs

Prior to her interview with ICC, one of the house churches Pastor Thomas leads was attacked by Hindu radicals three Sundays in a row. After the third attack, local authorities finally shut down the house church altogether.

Pastor Thomas is a widow and a mother of two children. Over the course of 13 years of ministry, she has established several unregistered house churches in and around Hyderabad.

“I have been enduring persecution for the entire 13 years of my ministry,” Pastor Thomas explained to ICC. “But what is happening now is unprecedented. Me and my daughter had to sit in the police station as criminals while the people who attacked the Sunday worship service enjoyed the support of the police officers right in front of our eyes.”

In addition to having her house church closed down and being harassed, beaten, and arrested, Pastor Thomas was kicked out of her rented home by her landlord. “Due to pressure from the Hindu radicals, my landlord asked me to vacate the house,” Pastor Thomas said. “When I went on searching for a new rented place I was told by seven different Hindu landlords that they don’t want to rent to me because I am a Christian.”

Pastor Thomas and her family continue to search for a new place to call home. In addition, the 20 Christians who used to gather for worship in Pastor Thomas’ home anxiously await news of a new space where they can worship together. However, the prospect of this coming true appears very slim.
