Media vitiated atmosphere on raid of Mirwaiz house: Forum

Srinagar, March 14, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the Hurriyat forum led by Mirwaiz Umar Farooq has strongly denounced the lies and canards being circulated by some media outlets through unsubstantiated leaks by agencies bent on harassing the Mirwaiz. Hurriyat forum spokesman in a statement issued in Srinagar said after the illegal raid at Mirwaiz residence the media through propaganda and lies is already passing its verdict on Mirwaiz to vitiate public opinion against him.

He said so-called high-tech system recovered from the Mirwaiz residence is a legal direct internet class B lease line free to air from a private internet provider in Regal Chowk. The tower in the premise was erected after the service provider said that for last mile connectivity between Regal Chowk and his house a tower needed to be erected. To say it was recovered and used as some kind of hotline with other country is ridiculous, he added.

He said despite knowing that it is an attempt to harass him, Mirwaiz has said that he is willing to cooperate in the matter in Srinagar but the way it is being done and the propaganda campaign being run around it, putting his safety in danger outside Kashmir.

Meanwhile, Jammu and Kashmir Democratic Freedom Party (JKDFP) in a statement in Srinagar said that former puppet Chief Minster Mehbooba Mufti allowed Bharatiya Janata Party to launch crackdown on the Hurriyat leaders during her rule. As a result, senior resistance leader Shabbir Ahmad Shah along with many others were arrested in July 2017, and were lodged in Tihar jail, Delhi.
