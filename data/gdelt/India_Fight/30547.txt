The army vehicle, ‘Army Casper’ of 44 Rashtriya Rifles is a bullet and mine proof vehicle which explains that the soldiers have suffered minor injuries.

A few months ago in February, in Pulwama district, a suicide bomber had driven a vehicle laden with explosives into a bus in which there were 40 soldiers and killed them. This attack on the troopers had angered the whole nation resulting in the government order to the army to retaliate. However this militant attack also saw innocent Kashmiri being targeted in other parts of India.

According to Greater Kashmir, the locals informed them that after the attack there was intense firing.
