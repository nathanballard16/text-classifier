Woman shooter heckles Ayodhya Muslim litigant

AYODHYA: Iqbal Ansari, a key litigant from the Muslim side in the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi dispute, was allegedly attacked in his Ayodhya residence on Tuesday afternoon. Police said the accused included an "international" woman shooter and her male associate.Ansari told the police that a woman approached his security guard at around 1 pm and introduced herself as shooter Vartika Singh and wanted to meet him. She kicked off her discussion on triple talaq and Ayodhya and within minutes grew violent, the litigant said in his police complaint.Vartika and her male associate were detained, but later escorted to Lucknow. Police are yet to register an FIR.Talking to TOI, Ansari said, "The woman asked me to withdraw the claim on the title suit and threatened to shoot me if I didn't comply. The woman and her male associate suddenly lunged at me. If policemen guarding me hadn't intervened, I would have been grievously injured. They blamed me for not allowing the construction of a Ram mandir. I told them there are hundreds of temples in Ayodhya and I was not opposed to any temple."When sparks flew, Ansari's guard, constable Mohammad Tahir, jumped to his rescue. Talking to TOI, Tahir said, "The woman suddenly got up and charged at him. Had there been a delay on my part, the woman would have inflicted injuries on Ansari. The man accompanying her was also assisting her in the attack." After Vartika Singh reached Lucknow, she told TOI on the phone that she had indeed attacked Ansari. "When he told me that Ayodhya will be turned into Pakistan and a temple won't be built, I slapped him."
