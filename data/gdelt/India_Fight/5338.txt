Australia's Amcor closes in on takeover after US government shutdown

Australian manufacturing giant Amcor is in "advanced discussions" with regulators in the United States, Brazil and Europe to secure approvals for a multibillion-dollar buyout of a major American rival after the original time-frame blew out due to the US government shutdown.

Amcor, a $16 billion packaging manufacturer, had initially hoped to complete its $9 billion all-stock buyout of Wisconsin-based Bemis by the first quarter of 2019 – a combination that would make Amcor the largest plastic packaging company in the world. But the expected date was pushed back to the second quarter of 2019 due to regulatory delays caused by the partial US government shutdown.

Amcor is poised to become the world's largest flexible plastic packaging manufacturer.

The shutdown, affecting nine federal departments and hundreds of thousands of employees, came amid deadlocked negotiations over funding for US President Donald Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico.

Amcor on Monday told investors the process of securing required antitrust clearances and other regulatory consents in all jurisdictions had "either been completed or is progressing in line with expectations".
