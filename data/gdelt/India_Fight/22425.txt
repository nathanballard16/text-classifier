ECI acting in biased manner, alleges TDP

‘Only Naidu being restricted from holding review meets and not KCR’

The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) has alleged that the Election Commission of India (ECI) was imposing restrictions on Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu in holding review meetings in Andhra Pradesh while it was not objecting to Telangana Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao regularly conducting such meetings.

Addressing a press conference near the Grievance hall at Undavalli near here on Friday, TDP official spokesperson Lanka Dinakar alleged that the model code of conduct turned out to be ‘Modi code of conduct’. “When there were no restrictions in Telangana, why only in Andhra Pradesh?” People were demanding that the State Cabinet meeting be convened immediately to take necessary decisions on Phani cyclone and other major issues. People were feeling that the officials were not functioning properly and the elected government should take control of the affairs, he said.

‘Officials being lax’

At another press conference, TDP executive secretary Gurajala Malyadri said officials had become roadblocks in implementation of welfare schemes and addressing problems such as drinking water. There was a need for chalking out plans for kharif season also. But the officials were not taking any steps in that direction. The Chief Secretary owed an explanation to the public on plans and measures taken with regard to these issues, he said.
