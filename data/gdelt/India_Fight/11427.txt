After every citizen of India, Amul also saluted the fighters of our country for taking revenge from the terrorist against their cowardly act of February 14th. Less than fifteen days ago, in one of the worst attacks in the valley so far, more than 40 CRPF personnel were killed in south Kashmir's Pulwama district after a suicide bomber hit his car with a CRPF bus. While the country was in deep shock after the incident, citizens were burning with anger since the moment Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack. Post the Pulwama attack on Tuesday, Indian Air Force conducted an air strike and targeted Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) biggest terror training camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.

Every citizen of the country hailed the Indian army for their non-military, pre-emptive strike and now dairy brand Amul has also saluted the Indian Air Force with their latest poster. The poster features Amul Girl who is seen saluting two pilots in flying gear and it also features a fighter jet in the background. The poster reads, “Air Farz”. Amul shared the poster on Twitter saying, “#Amul Topical: Congrats to our IAF pilots for their skill and bravery!”

The cartoon impressed the Twitterati in no time and many lauded the efforts of India’s defense forces as well as Amul’s thoughtfulness. While one user wrote, “If something could replace Google Doodles, this is it.,” another said, “Only corporate that knows every Indians heartbeat”. Check out the reactions-
