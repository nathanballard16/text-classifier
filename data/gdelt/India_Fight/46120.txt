Indian Air Force clip features Balakot strike

During the first big presser of the newly anointed Air Chief Marshall R K S Bhadauria on the Air Force Day, the Indian Air Force released a promotional video, featuring the story of airstrikes India conducted at Jaish-e-Mohammed's terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26.

The video featured IAF personnel scrambling on-board fighter jets, taking off in the dead of the night, dropping missiles with radars zooming in on the targets and showing the suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed's training centre blowing into clouds of dust.

The video talked about the Indian Air Force's heroic acts during the Balakot strikes and aerial engagements with Pakistani Air Force after the Indian airstrikes on the Pakistani soil. "Air Force has achieved many important milestones in the last year including February 26 when we successfully targeted terror camps in Balakot," said Bhadauria.

The video with a voiceover said the "Indian Air Force had formed a complex plan to avenge the attack on the CRPF jawans in Pumwana, which gave birth to the Balakot airstrike mission. The India Air Force braves turned several terror camps in Balakot into smithereens in just a few minutes and took revenge of the martyrs who lost their lives in the Pulwama attack." The video also showed a dogfight purportedly between the IAF and PAF fighter jets.

After the end of the promotional video, Bhadauria said, "Pakistan had lost an F-16 and India a MiG-21 in aerial engagement with the PAF a day after the Balakot strikes."
