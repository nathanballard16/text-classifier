Rape convict kills his mother, dumps body near highway

VADODARA: The cold-blooded murder of 50-year-old woman, whose body was found in a decomposed state on national highway-48, has turned out to be a crime committed by her own younger son.Vadodara (rural) police on Thursday arrested the woman Kanta Gohil’s son Mukund Gohil who killed her over a petty issue.Mukund has already served an 11-year sentence for raping a six-year-old girl in Dabhoi.He killed his mother on June 16 using a shovel and dumped her body after packing it in a fodder bag on NH-48 near Alamgir village in Varnama. Mukund admitted to the police that he got enraged when his mother scolded him over the previous day’s fight with his elder brother.“It was a very trivial issue, but Mukund said that he found his mother’s tone very insulting. So he picked up a shovel and hit her repeatedly until she died,” said a police official.Police said that Mukund packed Gohil’s body in a nylon bag used for packing cattle food and took it 35 km away from his home in Tarsana village in Dabhoi taluka. On reaching near Alamgir on NH-48, Mukund dumped it in the bushes and left. As the body started to emanate stench on Wednesday, former sarpanch of Alamgir Bipin Patel alerted the police. On untying the sack, cops found the body of Gohil along with her mobile phone.“The woman’s identity was known through her mobile phone and it also helped us in tracing down her sons,” said the police official.From the moment the two brothers were informed about the death, Mukund’s behaviour looked very suspicious and police questioned him separately. During the interrogation, he broke down and admitted to the crime.Cops said that Gohil’s other son did not inquire about his mother for all these days as he assumed that she might have been away for some labour work.
