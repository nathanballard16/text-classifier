Woman killed after being hit by motorcycle during foot march near Bengaluru

Renukamma was part of the Madhya Nishedha Andolana Karnataka foot march when she was hit in Nelamangala

A 60-year-old woman, part of Madhya Nishedha Andolana Karnataka foot march, was killed when a motorcycle knocked her down near Nelamangala on Monday morning.

Renukamma, a labourer from Kairavadagi, Ligasaguru, was part of the march that began from Chitradurga, ending at Vidhana Soudha to press their demand for a liquor ban.

Renukamma was walking along with over 2000 women when the bike hit her on the highway near Kuluvanahalli, where the protesters had planned to camp.

She was taken to a private hospital where she succumbed to her injuries.

The death sparked anger among the protesters who blamed the Governor for the death. They gathered at Nelamangala government hospital, where the body was kept for post mortem.

There was no police deployment, no medical facility provided despite knowing that women students and activists are taking a massive foot march, Ravi Krishna Reddy, who is heading the andolana, said.

The Nelamangala traffic police are investigating.
