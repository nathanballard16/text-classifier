NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Sunday slammed former PM Manmohan Singh for his comments on the economy."Manmohan Singh left behind an economic slowdown , policy paralysis and corruption in 2014. He brought down his party to its lowest ever strength in Parliament.India was part of the fragile five. Today, he regards the world's fastest growing major economy as disastrous," Jaitley tweeted on Sunday evening.In an interview, Singh said that the economy was headed towards a slowdown and accused the Modi government of leaving it in "dire straits". The Modi administration has repeatedly taken credit for "turning around" a weak economy that it had inherited."When an economist turns into a politician, he loses sense of both economy and politics," the finance minister said.
