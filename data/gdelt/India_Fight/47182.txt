Police have detained two persons today in connection with the recent triple murder case in Murshidabad District of West Bengal.

A team of CID officials visited the crime spot this morning after taking over the responsibilities of investigations over the incident. The School teacher who was killed at Jiaganj in Murshidabad District on last Tuesday is claimed to be a BJP-RSS supporter.

The triple murder had acquired political overtones with the BJP and West Bengal Governor Mr. Jagdeep Dhankhar hitting out at the Mamata Banerjee Government over the killings. The State Police however said that the brutal killing of school teacher, his wife and minor son was a result of personal enmity and there is no connection of political connotation.

Meanwhile, the State BJP sat on ‘dharna near Gandhi Statue in Kolkata today protesting recent killings of party workers at different places of West Bengal.

Addressing a gathering, party’s State Unit President and MP, Mr. Dilip Ghosh blamed the ruling Trinamool Congress for deterioration of law and order in the State. He alleged that the ruling party supporters are behind of all killings.

The party has sought time from the President, Mr. Ramnath Kovind and Home Minister, Mr. Amit Shah to apprise them about the law and order situation in West Bengal.
