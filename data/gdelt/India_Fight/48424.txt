NEW DELHI: Incidents of communal violence, particularly cases of those killed (lynched) over rumours on social media, are likely to be taken up by Union home minister Amit Shah during the meeting of Eastern Zonal Council to be held on October 23 in Patna.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik and Jharkhand CM Raghubar Das are likely to attend the meet.The four states have recorded the highest incidents of lynching with Jharkhand and Bihar accounting for the maximum cases while violent clashes have been reported between Trinamool and BJP workers in West Bengal.Among the four eastern states, only West Bengal has passed an anti-lynching bill proposing life imprisonment and fine as punishments on those involved in lynching. It may be recalled that Jharkhand police recently dropped murder charges against the accused involved in the Tabrez Ansari lynching case but soon reinstated it after the intervention of the Union home ministry.Shah, who will be attending his first meeting of the Eastern Zonal Council, according to officials, has already held discussions with the Western Zonal Council in Goa and Northern Zonal Council at Chandigarh, after taking over in June.Officials said 16 zonal council meetings have been held in the past five years where more than 750 issues between states had been discussed, of which nearly 500 have been resolved.Shah is likely to take up the development of allocated coal mines, implementation of various national health programmes, establishment of shelters for the urban homeless under DAY-National Urban Livelihood Mission, expeditious clearance for right of way for laying optical fibre cable, teachers’ education, land acquisition for development of 11 airports in four states, among others.The four states are also affected by Left Wing Extremism (LWE), officials said. “There are intelligence reports that Maoists are trying to regroup in Jharkhand, Bihar and Odisha. The home secretary has been sending advisory to states asking them to take steps.During the review, Shah may ask the chief ministers to strengthen measures to curb LWE,” a senior home ministry official told ET. The five zonal councils (Western, Eastern, Northern, Southern and Central) were set up under the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, to foster interstate co-operation and co-ordination among states. They are mandated to make recommendations on matters of common interest on economic and social planning, border disputes, linguistic minorities or inter-state transport.
