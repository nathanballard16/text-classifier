Amarinder wants coercive action against Pak

Pulwama terror attack

CHANDIGARH, Feb 18 (Agencies): Asserting that the entire country was “fed up” with the senseless killings of Indian soldiers in Kashmir, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh on Monday called for coercive action against Pakistan, which, he suggested, could be military, diplomatic or economic, or a combination of all the three.

Calling for the death of two “of them” for every Indian soldier killed in Pulwama attack, Singh said it’s clear that the Pakistan army was calling the shots, with Prime Minister Imran Khan also a “plant” of the military.

“We should get 82 of them since 41 of our men have been killed,” the chief minister asserted, demanding an “eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”.

He said it was for the Centre to decide what action should be taken, but it was clear that some measures have to be taken urgently.

“India wants it now,” he said.

“No one is asking anyone to go to war, but these killings of soldiers are not a joke. Something has to be done. I’m fed up, the country is fed up,” he said.
