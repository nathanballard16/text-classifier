Karnataka: With desertion, factionalism rife, Congress faces worst crisis

BENGALURU: Ever since the drubbing it received in the parliamentary elections in May this year, the Congress has staggered from one crisis to another, mostly because of factionalism and the fact that leaders at various levels have been quitting the party.In the past four months, several sitting and former MLAs and MPs have quit, some of the resignations even dealing a fatal blow to the government it formed in alliance with the JD(S). The defections began in July with the resignation of 11 legislators which brought morale within the ranks to an abysmal low.Besides defections, allegations of corruption against top leaders have left the party in tatters. Former deputy chief minister G Parameshwara, who harboured aspirations of landing the leader of opposition post, has been in a massive sulk after incometax sleuths raided education institutions owned by him.This was preceded by the arrest of party troubleshooter DK Shivakumar on charges of money laundering by the Enforcement Directorate . Four senior leaders are also under the CBI lens for their alleged role in the multi-crore IMA Ponzi scam.If all this wasn’t enough, the party received a shock when KC Ramamurthy, the party’s Rajya Sabha member, quit and announced he would join the BJP. And now, credible reports suggest at least two more prominent MPs will follow suit.“It looks like there will be no prominent leader left in the party by December when bypolls are due,” said a senior Congress leader with a tinge of sarcasm.What the party lacks is a unifying, charismatic leader because of which the grand old party is facing an uphill task ahead of the bypolls, as the BJP and the JD(S) make advances.Most analysts argue that the leadership vacuum at the top and internal squabbles within the state leadership is at the core of the crisis.“Desertion is beyond the control of the state leadership. It’s a problem that must be addressed by the central leadership,” said Harish Ramaswamy, a political analyst. “But still, regional satraps can tackle this and win the trust of fellow Congressmen by showing that his or her leadership is result oriented. At the moment, Siddaramaiah is the only leader who is capable of achieving this.”
