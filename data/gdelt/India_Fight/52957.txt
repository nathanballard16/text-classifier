Hyderabad: A day after taking back all the striking employees to the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation (TSRTC), Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Friday announced that the state government will provide Rs 100 crore to the corporation to cover up the losses incurred by it in the last two turbulent months. The Telangana Rashtriya Samiti (TRS) supremo also stressed that he doesn't make false promises and will issue orders for the financial assistance to the TRSTC immediately.

Before making the huge announcement, K Chandrasekhar Rao iterated, "All the RTC employees can happily join back their work tomorrow morning. We will issue orders for the same immediately. RTC should survive. We don't make duplicate promises."

"RTC went into more losses due to the strike in these two months. When asked what's the balance, RTC MD told us that it is Rs 13 crore. We want the RTC employees to live happily. We will give Rs 100 crores from the govt to RTC," added the Telangana CM.

Nearly 50,000 TSRTC employees had gone to strike against the state government on October 5. The unions which led the strike put forth some 26 demands, with the primary one being the merger of TSRTC with the state government.

During the strike, the Telangana CM had rejected the demands of the employees and warned the employees to return to work by November 5 or they would be considered "self-dismissed". The then agitating employees did not pay heed to the CM's warning.

The strike was finally called off by the unions on November 25 but a big twist came when the TSRTC managing director Sunil Sharma said that the entire workforce would not be allowed to join back.

CM K Chandrasekhar Rao's decision to take all the employees back along with a cash injection to the TSRTC has come as a boon to them.
