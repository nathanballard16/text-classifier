Anurag Basu To Make 'Life In A Metro' Spin-Off Starring Rajkummar Rao & Fatima Shaikh

The last of Rajkummar Rao and Fatima Shaikh that we saw in 2018 was a mixed bag of highs and lows.

Whereas Rajkummar ended the year with a high, given the commercial and critical success of 'Stree', Fatima's year in Bollywood could have been better if 'Thugs of Hindostan' hadn't been the major disappointment that it was.

However, regardless of what the past year brought to their film careers, 2019 holds new possibilities for both of them.

Why we say that is because according to the latest reports, Rajkummar and Fatima are all set to star in Anurag Basu's yet-untitled movie, which is said to be a spin-off of Basu's 2007 directorial venture 'Life In A Metro' showcasing four different stories in one film.

The first look of the film was earlier released on Twitter by Rajkummar and from the looks of it, it looks like a recreation of a song sequence from the 90s.

While Rajkummar can be seen posing away from the camera in Mithun's iconic pose, Fatima is seen waving her saree with her back to the camera.

As per latest reports, the shooting for the film has already started in Bhopal, where the cast is supposed to be shooting on a 15-day schedule, with 12-hour shifts.

What is more, a Mumbai Mirror report has also suggested that a portion of the film will be shot in the ancestral property of Saif Ali Khan, which is now a luxury hotel.

Fans can expect to taste the flavour of Bhopal in Anurag Basu's upcoming film, and we cannot wait to see what the trio has in store for us.
