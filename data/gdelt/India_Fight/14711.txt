Setback for India as China blocks UN Terror tag for Jaish chief Masood Azhar, yet again

India suffered a big diplomatic setback at the United Nations on Wednesday as China blocked the country’s attempts to have Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as an international terrorist in the Security Council.

Indian ministry of external affairs has expressed its disappointment over the development. “We are disappointed by this outcome. This has prevented action by the international community to designate the leader of (JeM), a proscribed and active terrorist organization which has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir on 14 February 2019,” news agency quoted the MEA as saying.

The ministry of external affairs, according to ANI, added, “We will continue to pursue all available avenues to ensure that terrorist leaders who are involved in heinous attacks on our citizens are brought to justice.”

JeM had claimed responsibility for the 14 February Pulwama terror attack that killed 45 CRPF soldiers. This had led to military skirmishes between India and Pakistan. India had carried out air strikes deep inside Pakistan, while Pakistan had responded by breaching the Indian airspace. It had also shot down one Indian MiG 21 while caturing Wing Commander Abhinandan, the Indian Air Force Officer.

This is not the first time China has blocked India’s bid to have an UN terror tag against Azhar. In 2017, China had blocked attempts to designate Azhar as a global terrorist at the UN.

A veto-wielding permanent member of the Security Council, China has repeatedly blocked India’s move to put a ban on the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist.

In March 2016, China was the only member in the 15-nation United Nations organ to put a hold on India’s application with all other 14 members of the Council supporting New Delhi’s bid to place Masood Azhar on the 1267 sanctions list that would subject him to an assets freeze and travel ban.
