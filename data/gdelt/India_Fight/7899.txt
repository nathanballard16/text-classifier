Bengaluru: French Ambassador to India Alexander Ziegler, on Wednesday, said that France is “pushing” to put Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar on the UN global terror list. The diplomat further said that France has been trying to put Azhar on the UN sanction list for the past two years.

“We are very much pushing in that direction. It has been two years that we are trying to put him on the UN sanction list,” Ziegler told news agency ANI at the Aero India 2019 show which began here today.

Earlier in 2017, France, backed by the United States and the United Kingdom had moved a proposal in the UN Sanctions Committee 1267, seeking to declare Azhar as a “global terrorist”. However, China blocked the proposal then. China also blocked India's repeated attempts to list Azhar in the UN Security Council.

The Pakistan-based terror outfit, JeM carried out a dastardly attack on CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on February 18, killing 40 CRPF personnel and injuring many. The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar.

Following the attack, India withdrew the Most Favoured Nation’ status accorded to Pakistan. Several countries, including the US, France, Russia also came out in support of India and called for complete isolation of Pakistan.

Earlier today, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern over the increasing tensions between India and Pakistan.

"We are deeply concerned at the increasing tensions between the two countries. The Secretary-General stresses the importance for both sides to exercise maximum restraint and take immediate steps to de-escalation, and his good offices are always available should both sides ask,” said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric.
