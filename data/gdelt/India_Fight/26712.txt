Two days on, Arjun Kapoor’s next cinematic offering, India’s Most Wanted, will hit the screens. The action thriller, directed by Raj Kumar Gupta, is based on the manhunt of “India’s Osama” by a team of five “unlikely heroes” headed by Arjun’s character of Prabhat Kapoor. While the film will witness a significant release in India, it will miss its Dubai release.

According to a recent report in Bollywood Hungama, India’s Most Wanted features a dialogue that the UAE Censor Board found “derogatory” and “objectionable,” and hence, decided to ban the film in the Gulf nation.

A source in the report has been quoted as saying, “In India’s Most Wanted, there is a dialogue that says most terrorists are based either in Pakistan or Dubai, and it was this reference that didn’t go down too well with the censors there. Had this dialogue been deleted, the film would have been permitted to release, but the makers of the film did not budge and hence it will not release.”

The news has been confirmed by Gupta as well. He told the web portal, “Yes, the film will not release in Dubai. There were some issues which could not be sorted and hence this decision.”

“Yes, the said dialogue is there in the film and it is a factual one based on the research that has been conducted. So we did not want to do away with the dialogue and decided on retaining it in the film even if it entailed a non-release in Dubai,” the director added.

India’s Most Wanted will release in India on May 24 on nearly 1200 screens. At the box-office, the film will clash with the Vivek Oberoi-starrer PM Narendra Modi, the biopic on the incumbent Prime Minister of India.
