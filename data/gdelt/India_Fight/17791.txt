We have detained seven policemen, including an inspector, but they are still not in their senses. Baddo was lodged in Fatehgarh jail and was on way to a court in Ghaziabad in connection with hearing of a case. Nearly 10 cases, including those of murder and dacoity, are lodged against him. We hope to arrest him soon,” said Nitin Tiwari, Senior Superintendent of Police, Meerut. “Those detained are constables Omveer, Santosh, Sunil, Rajkumar, Bhupinder and Ihetashamam and police inspector of Farrukhabad, Deshraj Tyagi,” said Nitin Tiwari according to MSN.
