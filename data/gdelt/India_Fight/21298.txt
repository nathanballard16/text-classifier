‘Attack on me a BJP conspiracy’

RAJKOT: Smarting under the ignominy of being publicly slapped, Patidar quota stir leader Hardik Patel said the attack was a pre-planned conspiracy by the BJP to gag the voice of people who are speaking for distressed farmers and youth of Gujarat.Talking to reporters after landing at Rajkot airport, Hardik said the attacker Tarun Gajjar is a BJP sympathizer and a close confidante of Mehsana BJP MP Jayshree Patel.“A man specially comes down from Kadi to attack me. He was in village since early morning and was talking with locals. If police scans his mobile phone, they will to unravel many things,” he said.Asked about Gajjar’ blaming him for the death of 14 Patidars, the Congress leader said, “In 2002, 60 Hindus were charred to death in Godhra. Will Narendra Modi take the responsibility for their deaths? In 1993, when Babri mosque was demolished, large number of Hindus were killed. Will Kalyan Singh (then UP CM) take responsibility?.”Hardik said he would remain unfazed by such attacks, but the incident has raised a serious question mark on the security of other Congress and even the BJP leaders. “It’s possible that tomorrow anybody will throw acid or shoot me with a gun If a person like me has no safety, what’s about the security of common man?.”Hardik said BJP camp is getting jitters due to his aggressive campaigning and raising serious issues of people.Asked about the complaint he lodged against Gajjar, Hardik said it was necessary, lest the government accused him of ‘internal setting.”
