BOX: Upcoming Kannada movies that are being shot at college campuses in the state

From Thuntata (2002) to Kirik Party (2016) and the upcoming Yuvarathnaa — there are several Kannada films that have stories that are either completely or partially based on college life. While some have been shot at campuses in, many featureinand cities in Karnataka. Considering that most film crews are based in, and several scenes are shot at different parts of the city, why is it that when it comes to college campuses,opt to shoot outside of the capital city?A big reason for looing for campuses outsideis convenience. Filmmaker Tharun Sudhir shares that even though he’s shot for films in city, he knows of friends in the fraternity whoto shoot inand cities for the sake of convenience. “Inare usually packed with students, so you have to shootthe weekends to ensure that students and actors are not disturbed. Tier II cities are usually not that hectic, so shooting there becomes easy,” he says.Another factor that makesseekoutsideis that campuses here are too cosmopolitan for their liking. “Most films that demand a college setting are high on nostalgia.inare cosmopolitan, whileinstill retain an old-world feel. This is why directorsgoing tocities, like Mangaluru and Mysuru, to shoot college scenes,” says actor and director Raj B Shetty. He highlights this by adding, “The makers of Kirik Party had initially approachedinand Mysuru for locations, but they quoted a huge fee. Finally, they shot in small-town Hassan without having to shell out a penny. Such places are more accommodating and friendly when compared toin bigger cities.”Filmmaker Indrajit Lankesh, however, chooses to differ. “From Thuntata to Dev Son of Mudde Gowda, I’ve shot for many films at. Institutions here have gone out of their way to fit our shoot into their schedule, and made it a smooth process for us. Ultimately, it is what your film demands. So, you shoot as per the story,” he sums up.Director Chethan Kumar, who shot parts of his film upcoming film with Sriimurali, Bharaate, at the University of Mysore campus in Mysuru, and has also shot at the Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering in, says that the ease of shooting depends on the college management. “There are no issues with shooting at the campus of the University of Mysore throughout the year. I also had no issues while shooting for Bharjari at Dayanand Sagar College of Engineering. So, it is purely a management decision to give permission to shoot or not. If the shoot is at campus and it doesn’t disturb ongoing classes, securing permission is not an issue. The only thing is that if you have to shoot inside classrooms, you have to wait till the holiday season,” says Chethan.Geetha: The Ganesh and Shanvi Srivastava-starrer has been shot at Mysuru’s St Philomena’s CollegeBharaate: The Sriimurali-Sreeleela film was shot at the Jayalakshmi Vilas Palace that is located on University of Mysore campusYuvarathnaa: Since Puneeth Rajkumar plays a college student in the Santhosh Ananddram directorial, key portion were shot at the University of Agricultural Sciences in Dharwad
