Trader booked for Rs 5-crore billing scam

Rajkot: The state GST department booked a city-based trader of healthcare products, handicraft and gift articles in connection with a bogus billing scam committed during the regime of VAT. The FIR filed by the department alleged that the fraud was around Rs 4.98 crore.

Magan Surani, owner of Sadhna Trading Company on Gondal Road and a resident of Madhav Residency on 150-feet Road, was booked under Sections of the Gujarat Value Added Tax Act. According to the FIR, during the period between October 2015 and July 2017, the trader issued bills of Rs 99.57 crore without making any sales.

The trader had secured the VAT number only to issue bills to various firms across the state. When his business premise was raided, neither any stock was found, nor did the records show transactions. The accused submitted bogus bills for the purchaser to claim input tax credit. Thus, the trader got input tax credit to the tune of Rs 4.98 crore. tnn
