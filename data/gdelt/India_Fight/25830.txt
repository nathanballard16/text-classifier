Myanmar army continues offensive against NSCN-K

Myanmar army Thursday launched a clearance operation against the National Socialist Council of Nagaland – Khaplang (NSCN-K) near Hoyat village and Laonyu village along India-Myanmar border, the Nagaland Post reported.

Myanmar army had accused NSCN (K) of breaching the 2012 ceasefire agreement by sheltering leaders and cadres of other rebel outfits of North East India.

Myanmar army carried out similar operations against North East insurgents, particularly NSCN (K) since January this year.
