Election 2019: Lok Sabha polls: BJP readies key strategy

The BJP has got cracking on its strategy for the Lok Sabha elections, with its campaign committee working on various issues that could be highlighted to woo voters and take on the opposition. Rakesh Mohan Chaturvedi takes a look at some aspects, even as the party moves towards a more concrete plan in the days to come.Prime Minister Narendra Modi may have emphasised on a collective leadership and not banking solely on him to win elections, but BJP appears to be headed towards turning 2019 polls into a presidential one, with him as the face of the campaign. The BJP campaign will highlight that there is no one in the opposition ranks who can match Modi and only he can give a strong and stable government.Notwithstanding the opposition campaign on Rafale and the likes of Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya fleeing the country, the BJP feels Narendra Modi government is “taint free” and no charges have stuck against it. This is one aspect where the Congress has launched a strong attack on the government.The campaign is likely to highlight that though the achievements of the last five years are commendable, a lot is yet to be accomplished. This is a work in progress and that justifies another term to this government. The target set for most programmes anyway is 2022 — for ushering in a New India.The “bold” decisions taken by the govt will be highlighted during the campaign. These include demonetisation, goods and services tax, surgical strike, the 10% reservation for the economically weaker sections, extradition of Agusta-Westland middleman Christian Michel, etc.The welfare schemes for the poor and the weaker sections, which form a part of almost every speech made by Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah, will be a strong selling point: Ujjwala, Ayushman Bharat, Saubhagya, Swachh Bharat, Jan Dhan, Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana & Deen Dayal Upadhayay Gram Jyoti Yojana.Though ‘abki baar phir Modi sarkar’ was used at the BJP National Convention, the party is working on a more catchy slogan, such as ‘ek baar phir Modi sarkar’. Whatever is finalised, Modi would be a part of it.With the opposition ganging up against the BJP in many states, the most important being the SP-BSP alliance in Uttar Pradesh that sends 80 MPs to the Lok Sabha, the ruling party is getting ready for the challenge. The BJP will dismiss the grouping challenging it as one aimed at establishing a weak government that would facilitate corruption — a “majboor sarkar (helpless government)” against a “majboot sarkar (strong government)” led by Modi.
