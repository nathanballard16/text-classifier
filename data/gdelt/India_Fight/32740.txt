Pakistani Army Violated Ceasefire Pact With India 1,248 Times in 2019 - Indian Defence Minister

The minister also told parliament that this year four persons were killed in shelling by Pakistan forces along the LoC.

In 2003, the two neighbours signed a ceasefire agreement at the LoC, it was billed as the biggest confidence building measure (CBM) between them at the time.

Relations between New Delhi and Islamabad soured after a series of incidents, the Kargil conflict in 1999, failed Summit between the two countries in Agra and the attack on Indian Parliament in 2001.

Earlier this year, tensions between the two countries escalated, after 40 members of the paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force were killed by a suicide bomber in the Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district. India accused Pakistan of providing safe heaven and logistic support to the secessionists and bombed suspected terror camps in the Pakistan-controlled Balakot area on 26 February. The Pakistan Air Force retaliated a day later, leading to a dogfight.
