For 15 months she unleashed a tidal wave of invective via email to her daughter, Wendi Adelson.

Dan Markel was a preeminent legal scholar, with degrees from Harvard and the University of Toronto. He was also embroiled in a bitter child custody fight with his ex.

In the words of Donna, he was “an idiot” and a “bastard.”

“You suffered under his ‘reign,'” Donna wrote in one email. “Narcissistic personality disorder causes major problems in a marriage.”

She added: “I’m too angry to write any more. I’m going to shower, wash my hair, and get ready for you and the boys to come home.”

Cops believe this monster of a mother-in-law was pulling the strings in a twisted murder plot that would leave Markel bleeding out on the driveway of his Tallahassee home.

Markel arrived home from his job at the University of Florida around 11 a.m. on July 18, 2014.

Instead of a welcome mat, two bullets were parked in the father of two. He died in hospital 14 hours later.

Two people — Sigfredo Garcia, 37, and Kathy Magbanua, 34, the mother of his two children — will soon go on trial in the Panhandle for first-degree murder.

But detectives are under no illusions who really pulled the trigger that sweaty day five years ago.

“This is such an unusual situation, in that law enforcement is alleging a conspiracy but only some members of that conspiracy have been charged,” lawyer and blogger David Lat told the Miami New Times.

So what are the cops saying?
