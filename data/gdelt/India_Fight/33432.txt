Bengal: Nadia man dies after being beaten up by mob, BJP, TMC blame game starts

The incident took place late in the evening on July 3.

The deceased, Krishna Debnath, was thrashed when he was returning home. He was later found in a pool of blood near a local club.

Debnath was rushed to Shantinagar Hospital in the vicinity. His health deteriorated after which he was shifted to NRS Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, where he succumbed to his injuries on Friday.

Debnath used to work as a chef in Chennai and had come to visit his family in Nabadwip last week.

West Bengal Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leadership has alleged that Debnath was their supporter and has been killed for chanting 'Jai Shree Ram'.

However, Trinamool Congress (TMC) denied the allegations and said that the incident has nothing to do with politics.

A local TMC leader alleged that the victim was drunk and had misbehaved with a woman in his inebriated state, following which he was beaten up by angry locals.

The police have registered a case based on a complaint by the family of the deceased and have prima facie ruled out any political connection to the murder.
