SCOOPS: Shah Rukh Khan begins shooting for TED Talks India 2, Rape case against Jeetendra quashed by Court

1/4

The second season of TED Talks India hosted by Shah Rukh Khan has finally gone on floors. The first one was aired in December 2017.

Initially, the makers had planned to telecast the second season in November-December last year, but the superstar was busy with his film, Zero. Now, sources say that it is being planned for mid-July, August this year. Says a source, “SRK will shoot for it continuously for the next 12 days at Filmistan.”

Information about the guest speakers is being kept under wraps, but we have learnt that Bani J is likely to be one of the speakers.

Last year, celebrities like Karan Johar, Ekta Kapoor and Javed Akhtar had appeared on the show, and given a motivational talk on different issues. Comprising eight episodes, it was aired on Sunday at 7 pm, but this time the makers are contemplating a different time slot. “It will be telecast on Sundays only, but either in the morning at 11 am, the same slot which had Aamir Khan’s Satyamev Jayate or in the evening at 8 pm. That’s because at 7 pm, they already have another property, the supernatural show Divya Drishti,” adds the source.
