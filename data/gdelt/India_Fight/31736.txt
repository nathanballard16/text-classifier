NEW DELHI, June 25 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed and 45 others injured in India's eastern state of Jharkhand on Tuesday when a bus fell into a gorge, a police official said.

The accident took place at Anuraj Ghati in Garhwa district of Jharkhand at around 3:30 a.m. local time. The bus was heading to Garhwa in Jharkhand from Ambikapur in the neighboring state of Chhattisgarh.

"Among the 45 injured seven were referred to the hospital in Ranchi (the capital city of Jharkhand) and the rest were admitted to a local hospital," the police official added.

The bus accident occurred within a week of a similar accident that took place in the Kullu district of northern hilly state Himachal Pradesh in which nearly 43 people were killed.
