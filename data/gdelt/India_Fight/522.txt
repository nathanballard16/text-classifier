The series of raids , which started simultaneously, sent shock waves in the local movie industry, which has not seen an operation of this scale before.Actor brothers Shiv and Puneeth Rajkumar, hailing from what the industry considers the first family of Kannada cinema, were among the people raided. Popular stars Sudeep and Yash, Yash’s wife Radhika Pandit , and producers Rockline Venkatesh (who produced Rajinikanth-starrer Lingaa), Vijay Kiragandur (who produced KGF), Jayanna and filmmaker-cum-JD(S) legislator CR Manohar and his brother CR Gopi were the other targets of the search operations. The officials arrived in private cars and presented the actors and producers with search warrants.Yash has acted the lead role in the latest multi-lingual blockbuster KGF, which was made on a budget of Rs 80 crore and is reporting robust earnings from screens. An IT official said they had been keeping a watch on some of their transactions for the past one year, and on their real estate investments. Some of the producers are also real estate barons. The raids began at 7 am simultaneously at all their homes in Bengaluru, and income tax officials said they will continue the search for two or three more days. Director-general (investigations) BR Balakrishnan and principal commissioner (investigation) R Ravichandran supervised the search operations.“We have covered big actors and all major movie producers, and will be verifying their documents,” an IT official said.
