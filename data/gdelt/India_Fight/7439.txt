Is Masood Azhar the Global terrorist in Pulwama attack

New Delhi sources stated that US National Security Adviser Ambassador John Bolton, in a telephonic conversation with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, has extended support for India’s bid to designate Jaish-e-Muhammad (JeM) chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist. Meanwhile Washington extended and reiterated its support towards India’s right to self-defense against cross-border terrorism under the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council after the toll in the deadly Jaish attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama on Thursday reached 49.









Furthermore the suicide attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy carrying troopers towards Srinagar had blown up a bus when an explosive packed SUV rammed into the paramilitary vehicle, causing the death of some 40 troopers at the spot. Moreover Doval and Bolton have resolved to hold Pakistan to account for its obligations under UN resolutions and to remove all obstacles to designate Azhar as a global terrorist under the UN Security Council Resolution which has already designated JeM as a terror body.





During the conversation, Bolton expressed condolences and outrage over the Pulwama attack by the Pakistan based terror group. Apparently the American diplomat also offered all assistance to India to bring the perpetrators and sympathizers of the attack promptly to justice.
