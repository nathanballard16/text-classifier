Earlier, Katrina Kaif opted out of this Remo D’souza’s dance film, which also features Varun Dhawan. She had to let go of the project due to the hectic schedule for “Bharat“. Katrina’s official spokesperson on Saturday shared the update on the project with a statement.

“Katrina Kaif had to opt out of Remo D’souza’s upcoming dance film owing to her hectic schedule for ‘Bharat‘. Katrina has always been a thorough professional. She decided to step out of the film as her dates were clashing with ‘Bharat‘, which she is currently shooting for. She wishes the team all the best,” read the statement.

Touted to be India’s biggest dance film, it also stars choreographer-actor-filmmaker Prabhudheva besides Dharmesh Yelande, Raghav Juyal and Punit Pathak.
