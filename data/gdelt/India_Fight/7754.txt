Dattatreya calls out TDP for remarks on Pulwama attack

Hyderabad: Former Union Minister and BJP MP Bandaru Dattatreya asked TDP not to raise a political stink over the terrorist attack in Pulwama of Jammu and Kashmir in which 42 CRPF Jawans were killed.Addressing the media here on Tuesday, the BJP leader said that the TDP and the Trinamool Congress Party (TCP) are questioning the happening of the terrorist attacks ahead of the ensuing parliament elections in June this year.

“This is unbecoming on the part of the political parties to rise stink over such a ghastly attack on the security forces in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir and trying to attribute political motives,” he added.Terming such statements from the TDP leaders on the incident as an insult to the sacrifices made by the security forces, Dattatreya demanded that the TDP withdraw its statements. Terming the security forces neutralising the masterminds behind the incidents within two days of the Pulwama incident, the BJP leader said, “the achievement goes to the security forces fighting against terrorism in the Kashmir valley.”

That apart, the BJP leader released the posters of the BC Convention going to be organised by the party. He said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government at the Centre has been fulfilling its promises rolling out several welfare schemes for the development of BCs, poor and all other sections of the people in the country. Contrary to this, the TRS government in Telangana has failed to deliver its promises of allocating higher budgetary allocations to the BCs and OBCs in the State, he said.
