Woman asks robbers not to threaten her with ‘toy weapons’, gets shot at

Victim suffers bullet injury below knee, undergoes surgery

Three unidentified robbers allegedly shot at a 28-year-old woman in south-east Delhi’s New Friends Colony, the police said on Thursday.

The victim is undergoing treatment at a hospital, they said, adding that the accused are on the run.

The incident took place on Tuesday at 8.30 p.m. when the woman, a senior executive with an MNC in south Delhi, was walking towards a market with her friend.

Blocked way

The woman allegedly told the police that she was near CV Raman Marg crossing with her friend when three men on a black bike blocked their way.

She said that two of them got off the vehicle and pointed pistols, asking them to hand over their belongings.

The third accomplice sat on the bike and kept the ignition on, she alleged.

The woman refused to accept their demands following which they threatened to shoot her.

She then asked them not to threaten her with “toy weapons”.

The robbers then allegedly shot at her below the knee and sped off.

“Her friend rushed her to a private hospital. She underwent a surgery and has been kept under observation,” said an officer.

Later, her family informed the police about the incident following which a team reached the hospital and recorded her statement.

“The victim said that the robbers were not wearing masks. We will show her the crime dossier to identify the suspects. We have scanned CCTV footage of the area but the number plate of the motorbike is not clearly visible," added the officer.

Case registered

A case of robbery, causing grievous injuries has been registered, the police said, adding that search is on to nab the accused.
