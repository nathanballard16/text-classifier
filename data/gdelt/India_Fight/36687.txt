Interpol again refuses to issue Red Corner notice against Zakir Naik

WEB DESK / New Delhi

Interpol has for the third time refused to issue a Red Corner Notice against Indian Islamic scholar Dr Zakir Naik. It is seen as yet another setback for the government of India. The global police body cited lack of evidence and any proof of wrongdoing as the reasons behind its decision to not issue the notice.

Interpol has further instructed all its offices to delete all data on Dr Naik from its files.The decision was taken by Commission for Control of INTERPOL’s Files in its 109th session, which took place from July 1-5, 2019. In a letter dated July 22, Interpol said Naik is “not subject to an Interpol Red Notice or diffusion”.

In a letter addressed to Naik, Interpol’s Commission Secretariat stated that “after a thorough examination of the elements before it, the Commission found that data (read “charges”) challenged raised questions as to compliance with applicable rules”. The statement implies that the charges and allegations against Naik were unsubstantiated and vague, and Indian authorities had failed to follow the due process of Interpol’s rules of charges and proof submission. India had on June 12 formally requested Malaysia to extradite him, who is wanted in India in many cases.
