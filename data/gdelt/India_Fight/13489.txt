India has had an excellent Information Warfare capability - it has caused massive amount loss of lives in Indian Occupied Kashmir, estimated at killing/murdering over 90,000 kashmiris since 1989. Yet it's information warfare capability has successfully hidden this from mainstream media channels.Another false narrative that India has continuously stated, that Kashmir is their integral matter has been encouraged across mainly western media outlets - when in reality it has always been a disputed territory.However, with the advent of modi/BJP government this will change - they are single handedlyUndermining India cohesiveness with their extreme Hindutva ideology, they have alienated the kashmiris, christians, large Muslim population....they are gagging any one criticising the government. Look at the recent attacks on their university professors.....I think it they continue this policy of hatred they will cause an IMPLOSION within.........if you want to destroy India vote for modi/BJP?
