India To Soon Develop Sophisticated Weapon Tech For Space Warfare Under New Defence Space Agency

The Modi government has approved the setting up of a new agency to develop sophisticated weapon systems and technologies for enhancing armed forces’ capability to fight wars in the space, reports ANI.

The approval for the setting up of the new agency, Defence Space Research Agency (DSRA), was granted by the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-headed Cabinet Committee on Security.

"The Cabinet Committee on Security headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi has cleared the setting up of this new agency called the Defence Space Research Agency (DSRA) which has been entrusted with the task of creating space warfare weapon systems and technologies," Defence Ministry sources were quoted in the report as saying.

According to the report, the decision for setting up of the agency was taken at the topmost level of government some time ago. The agency has reportedly started taking shape under a Joint Secretary-level scientist. It would be provided with a team of scientists which will be working in close coordination with the tri-services integrated defence staff officers.

The DSRA would provide research and development support to the Defence Space Agency (DSA), which has been created to help the country fight wars in the space. The DSA comprises members of all the three services and is being set up in Bengaluru under an Air Vice Marshal-rank officer. It will gradually take over the space-related capabilities of the three armed forces.
