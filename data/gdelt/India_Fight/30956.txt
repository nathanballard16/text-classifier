NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed and three others injured Thursday during clashes between two groups in India's eastern state of West Bengal, officials said.

The violent clashes broke out in Bhatpara area of North 24 Parganas district, about 73 km east of Kolkata, the capital city of West Bengal.

Authorities have rushed huge contingents of government forces to the area to contain the situation.

"Clashes between unidentified people today broke out here, during which two people were killed and three others injured," a police official posted in North 24 Parganas district said.

"While one person was killed on spot, another succumbed in the hospital. The three others injured critically are undergoing treatment."

Locals told Xinhua that during the clashes, crude bombs were hurled and gunshots were heard, following which police arrived at the spot and fired tear gas shells and warning shots to disperse the two groups.

Authorities have imposed prohibitory orders in the area to prevent further clashes.

The clashes broke out hours ahead of West Bengal police chief's visit to the area to inaugurate a new building for a local police station in the district.

Reports said the police chief's convoy was turned around following the clashes and the inauguration of the new police station was put on hold.

Following the clashes, shops and markets were closed in the area.

Bhatpara has witnessed a series of clashes in the past month.
