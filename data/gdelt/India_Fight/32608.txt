'Only Muslims and Dalits being targeted': Owaisi says organisations behind lynching are linked to Sangh Parivar

Lynching of people across the country for not chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Vande Mataram' is being carried out by the organisations linked to Sangh Parivar, Owaisi said.

President of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Asaduddin Owaisi on Sunday alleged that the lynching of people across the country for not chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' and 'Vande Mataram' is being carried out by the organisations linked to the Sangh Parivar or the RSS.

"These incidents are not going to stop. Only Muslims and Dalits are being targeted. There are organisations behind such incidents and all of them are linked to the Sangh Parivar," he said while speaking to media persons.

The statement from Owaisi comes two days after a Muslim boy was thrashed by unidentified men for not chanting 'Jai Shri Ram' in Kanpur. Police said the incident occurred when Mohammad Taj, a resident of Barra, was returning home after offering 'namaz' at a mosque in Kidwai Nagar, on Friday.
