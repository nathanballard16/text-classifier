Broken slab adds to drivers’ woes in Vellore new bus stand

A 4-ft-high water drum has been placed in the gap as a temporary solution.

Bus drivers in the new Vellore bus stand, who already have a tough time negotiating commuter traffic, now have a new hurdle — a broken concrete slab, in the service lane, at the far end of the bus stand.

Government bus drivers who operate buses to Hosur, Dharmapuri, and Bengaluru are the worst affected.

The concrete slab was damaged a week ago and since then, several drivers have complained of back injury while driving the bus over the big gap.

Drivers also point out the damage caused to the vehicle due to this.

Instead of raising a complaint with the Vellore Municipal Corporation (VMC), the transport officials placed a 4-ft-high water drum in the hole, which has worsened the problem, they said.

The corporation’s garbage trucks pass through this damaged stretch at least 8 to 10 times in a day. It is a problem for them too, but no one is keen to address it, said a conductor from Kuppam.

“The roads connecting the bus bays are usually packed and the service lane is used instead, by motorists and buses. Hundreds of buses, two-wheelers and auto rickshaws use the service lane,” said R. Santhanam, a motorist.

Sources in Tamil Nadu State Transport Corporation said since they cannot block the service road because of the hole, a temporary arrangement was made.

Transport officials are in touch with the Vellore city municipality officials, they said.
