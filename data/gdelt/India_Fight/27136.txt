Principal shoots live-in partner, self after argument

Allahabad: A school principal shot himself after murdering his live-in partner at their Preetam Nagar home on Friday, after the latter started forcing him to marry her.

As per reports, 56-year-old Pramod Chaudhary was a principal in Lal Bahadur Shastri Inter College in Chail, Kaushambi. He used to live with his live-in partner Rakhi (32), and his three children from his first wife — Goldy (22) and twins Chhotu and Baku (18) — in an EWS flat in Preetam Nagar area of the city. Inspector at Dhoomanganj police station, Jay Prakash Sharma, said, “Chaudhary’s younger brother told the police that the deceased had recently fixed his daughter Goldy’s marriage. However, Rakhi had been adamant that he marry her first, before making arrangements for his daughter’s wedding.”

Sharma said, “The couple had been fighting over the issue on Friday, when Chaudhary lost his patience and shot Rakshi with a country-made pistol.”

He reloaded the pistol and minutes later shot himself. Chaudhary’s son Chhotu was present at the house when the incident occurred and was an eyewitness. Although Rakhi died on the spot, Chaudhary was seriously injured and was rushed to the hospital, but was declared brought dead.
