Life term to Ambala man who drove family into river

Ludhiana: A local court has sentenced a man to life imprisonment in a 2016 murder case.

In February that year, police had booked 30-year-old Dalvir Singh of Shahpur, Ambala, for murder after he “intentionally” drove his car into a river near Machhiwara bridge, leading to the deaths of four of his family.

The complainant, Gurdev Singh, alleged that his daughter Gurpreet Kaur had tied the knot with Dalvir in 2013. While returning from a wedding in Nawanshahar on February 8, 2016, Dalvir deliberately drove his car into the river. While he jumped out, his wife, son and two other members of his family drowned.

During the case trial, Dalvir pleaded innocence.

Taking on record the evidence and the statements, the court sentenced him to life imprisonment.
