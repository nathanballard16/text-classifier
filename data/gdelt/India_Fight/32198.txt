Bail denied to 12 accused in Gokulraj case

The Special Court in Madurai hearing cases booked under Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act of 1989 has denied bail to 12 accused in the Dalit youth Gokulraj murder case.

III Additional District Judge A. Dhanasekaran dismissed the bail petitions filed by 12 accused in the case on Wednesday. However, the main accused, S. Yuvaraj, the founder of Theeran Chinnamalai Gounder Peravai, and P. Arun, did not move court seeking bail in the case.

The Madras High Court in May had transferred the trial from Namakkal to Madurai, after the mother of Gokulraj ,V. Chitra, had moved the High Court apprehending that she may be denied justice if the trial continued in Namakkal.

The body of Gokulraj was found on railway tracks near Pallipalayam on June 24, 2015. The mother of the victim alleged that her son was murdered for being in a relationship with a caste Hindu girl.
