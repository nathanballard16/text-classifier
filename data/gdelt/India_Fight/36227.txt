Adulterated petrol supply in Williamnagar alleged

TURA: The Garo Students’ Union in Williamnagar has approached the district administration accusing a fuel station of serving adulterated petrol to customers leading to many vehicles breaking down from engine failure and owners being compelled to spend large amounts to restore it into working condition.

In a petition to deputy commissioner Swapnil Tembe, GSU leaders accused those operating the Bharat Petroleum fuel station at Williamnagar town of adulterating petrol with water and other substances to make illegal profit.

“There has been serious complaints by commuters who use the fuel from the station and most of those include breakdown of the vehicles leaving people stranded in the middle of nowhere while travelling outside of the town,” alleged student leaders in their petition.

The union has urged upon the district administration to look into the issue since citizens are suffering from the use of such substandard fuel in their vehicles.

It is worth mentioning that allegations of fuel adulteration have plagued the Garo Hills for a long time. Sometime ago, even one of the oldest fuel stations in Tura, the AOC petrol pump, was accused of fuel adulteration by a large number of customers leading many to stop filling up at the station.

Those in the adulteration business are known to use water and kerosene as a mixture with the petrol in the tanks to shoot up their profit margins at the cost of the innocent customer.
