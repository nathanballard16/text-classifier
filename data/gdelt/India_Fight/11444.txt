MiG21 Downing Pakistan's F-16 Could Soil Lockheed's $21Bln India Dream - Scholar

Lockheed Martin displayed its ambitions in India earlier this month at the AeroIndia show where it unveiled a prototype of the F-21, a modified version of the F-16 Block 70.

"I think it will have a negative impact on the prospect of F-21 in the 114 fighter jet tender. Current generation Russian weapon systems are effective and better value for money than their western analogs," Vijainder K Thakur, a former squadron leader of IAF and a defence analyst, told Sputnik.

India started the process to purchase 114 fighter jets under the Strategic Partnership program in 2018 and six foreign firms had responded to the request for information. Global fighter manufacturers Boeing and Lockheed Martin of the US, Dassault Aviation of France, European consortium Eurofighter, Saab of Sweden and United Aircraft Corporation of Russia submitted their responses in July 2018, while the MiG-35 later joined the race.

Russian MiG Aircraft Corporation, during the AeroIndia Show in Bengaluru earlier this month, claimed that the company does not have any competition in this sphere, describing the MiG-35 as the most up-to-date aircraft in the world. The company also claimed that India would have to pay at least 20 per cent less than that it may have to pay for similar models manufactured by other firms.
