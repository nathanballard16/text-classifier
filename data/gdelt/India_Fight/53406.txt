ET Awards: Evening that set agenda for GoI & India Inc

MUMBAI: There was no mistaking, even in a city so used to India Inc gatherings, that this was a truly consequential evening.It’s not just that three key members of the Narendra Modi cabinet were on the stage. It’s not even that front rows of the audience were chock-a-block with industry’s who’s who. Or that Mukesh Ambani and Sunil Mittal , two key warriors in the telecom battle, gave each other a brotherly hug.What made Saturday evening special was that the political heavy hitters spoke candidly on issues that mattered most to industry heavy hitters, the latter responded, and through this lively discussion the event virtually became an agenda setter for the government and India Inc as both continue their efforts to get some zing back in the economy.And it wasn’t all economy either. Home Minister Amit Shah ’s robust explanation for what’s happening in Kashmir — he asked India Inc members to spend a few days in the Valley before deciding whether normalcy had returned — was a consequential intervention in itself. Nirmala Sitharaman disarmed India Inc by saying its inputs helped her fashion her response to the slowdown. Piyush Goyal agreed procedures needed more streamlining. Let’s not talk ourselves into a deep slowdown, he said. We will be on recovery path soon, said Sitharaman. Don’t lose hope, said Shah to industry captains.A day after it was reported that FY20 second quarter had seen just 4.5% growth, this was exactly the tonic industry needed.Unsurprisingly, the chatter about what the ministers had said continued much after the event ended. The audience knew this wasn’t just another Mumbai gathering — it had made a difference.
