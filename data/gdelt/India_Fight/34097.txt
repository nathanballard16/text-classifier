Man found murdered near Una

Rajkot: A man was found murdered on the outskirts of Rampara village on Nava Bandar Road near Una of Gir Somnath district on Thursday morning.

Police said the deceased, identified as Ramesh Solanki (35), was first strangled and then bludgeoned to death. The assailants thereafter tied Solanki’s body to a vehicle and dragged him, trying to make it look like an accident, said police.

“Though the identities and the number of the assailants are yet to be ascertained, it is suspected that they wanted to avenge Solanki’s video in which he had worn a skull cap worn by Muslims, for which he had an altercation with Yunus Pedhali, who accused him of hurting his religious sentiments,” said S I Mandhara, sub-inspector with Nava Bandar marine police station.

Pedhali and six unidentified aides have been booked based on a complaint by Solanki’s brother Bharat. Meanwhile, the police have launched a manhunt for Pedhali.
