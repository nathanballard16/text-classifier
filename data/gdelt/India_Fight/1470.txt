Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim convicted; quantum of punishment to be handed out on Jan 17

Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has been convicted in the murder case of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati and will be handed out the quantum of punishment on January 17.

A special CBI court on Friday announced its verdict in the case where the sect chief was named as the prime accused.

The self-styled godman was present for the sentencing via video-conferencing from the Sunaria jail.

Ram Rahim is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence in Haryana's Sunaria Jail.

Chhatrapati, the editor of a regional evening daily 'Poora Such' was shot dead at point-blank range on October 24, 2002 right outside his home in Sirsa, Haryana.

An investigation into the matter revealed that he was murdered in cold blood by two carpenters who were associated with the religious sect led by Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.

Investigators believed that Chhatrapati was killed after he published an anonymous letter in his evening daily. The letter was reportedly written by a 'sadhvi' who alleged that the

Dera chief sexually abused her and other female disciples.

Following the release of the letter, an inquiry was initiated into the allegations by the Punjab and Haryana High Court on September 22, 2002.

Less than a month later, the man who was responsible for exposing the sect chief and his heinous actions was shot right outside his home by Nirmal Singh and Kuldeep Singh.

Ram Chander Chhatrapati was taken to the Appolo Hospital in New Delhi where he succumbed to his wounds on November 21, 2002. His family sought a CBI probe into his death in 2003.

In the wake of the verdict, Security has been beefed up in Haryana and parts of Punjab.
