Chennai: Weeks after stopping child marriage, Chennai man hacked to death in public view. On the fateful night of Sunday, 45-year-old auto driver Jebaseelan was murdered in front of his family members by an armed gang. His wife, who protested the attack, was severely injured, The New Indian Express reported.

The shocking incident came two weeks after the deceased intervened to stop a child marriage in his Ayanavaram locality, hence giving rise to speculation that 'revenge' could be the motive.

On the auspicious day of his daughter's wedding reception, Jebaseelan was attacked by the armed gang on his way to the event, just a few metres away from his home. Relatives and other guests were the silent spectators of the murder, the police said.

On April 17, the Jebaseelan saw a poster of the wedding of a 16-year-old girl and informed the police about it. He later accompanied the cops to stop the wedding.

“Two days ago, Jebaseelan’s daughter got married in Tirupati. The reception was scheduled to happen on Sunday evening,” said a police officer.
