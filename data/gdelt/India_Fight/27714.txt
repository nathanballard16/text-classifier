Veeru Devgan's demise: Karan Johar, John Abraham & Rakesh Roshan reach Ajay Devgn's home to offer condolences

Actor Ajay Devgn lost his father Veeru Devgan yesterday and personalities from the film fraternity turned up to offer their last respects to the action director. From Shah Rukh Khan to Amitabh Bachchan, stars made sure to be by Ajay Devgn and Kajol's side in their time of grief. However, a few stars who could not make it yesterday, paid their condolence visit today. This included Kajol's closest friend Karan Johar. The filmmaker who recently celebrated his 47th birthday in New York returned to Mumbai today morning and was snapped at the airport.

Karan Johar visited Ajay and Kajol's residence in the afternoon. Apart from him, Rakesh Roshan and John Abraham also visited their residence to offer their condolences. John was snapped with a shoulder sling after he was injured on the sets of Pagalpanti last week in Mumbai.

The 77-year-old action director suffered a cardiac arrest on Monday morning and passed away soon after. Ajay Devgn performed the last rites of his father yesterday. Whereas, Kajol was spotted at their residence being consoled by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. The late Veeru Devgan was the brains behind many stunts in films like Hindustan Ki Kasam, Mr. India, Roop Ki Rani Choron Ka Raja and Shahenshah. The renowned stunt director has choreographed action sequences in nearly 80 Bollywood films, with his main work in the 90s.
