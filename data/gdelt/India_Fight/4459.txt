Inspector transferred

A police inspector with the Hyderabad Commissionerate, whose name cropped up in the sensational murder of Chigurupati Jayaram, director of Coastal Bank and managing director of a defunct Telugu news channel, was transferred on Monday.

The development came a day after The Hindu carried a report, ‘AP police looking into ‘role’ of TS cops in Jayaram case’.

Police from Nandigama of Krishna district in Andhra Pradesh, who are investigating the case, suspected that the inspector from Hyderabad, and an officer of the rank of Assistant Commissioner of Police with Rachakonda Commissionerate, were in regular touch with Jayaram.

A senior police officer said that so far they had not got any report from their counterparts in AP about his (Inspector’s) involvement in the crime or his connection with the victim. The officer maintained the inspector was transferred owing to negligence in discharging duties.

When asked about the scope for transferring the case to Hyderabad, the officer said it could be so as the offence took place in the capital of Telangana.

Later in the day, Hyderabad Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar said the transfer of the inspector along with four other officials was is ‘purely’ on administrative grounds.
