My terrifying ordeal: After getting bit by a feral dog in India, I needed rabies shots

Being Canadian, the thought of flying home had crossed our minds, but we were worried we couldn’t make it back in only 72 hours. We’d first have to get to New Delhi and find a last-minute flight to some Canadian city — most likely Toronto, which was a nearly 17-hour flight away. Then we’d have to find a hospital there that had rabies vaccines or possibly continue on to my hometown of Winnipeg, where my provincial health coverage would be guaranteed. Either way, it’d be very close.
