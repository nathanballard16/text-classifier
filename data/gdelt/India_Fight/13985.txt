Madhya Pradesh: No hearse, they walk 6km with decomposing body on their shoulders

JABALPUR: Unable to find a hearse, a group of villagers was forced to carry a decomposing body on their shoulders for 6km in Dindori district on Saturday. Collector Surbhi Gupta said, “We don’t have a vehicle to transport bodies. Neither police nor locals or taxi operators agreed to help the hapless people in carrying the body home.According to sources, Vishnu Singh of Sarangpur village, who was missing since February 3, was found dead in a forest under mysterious circumstances. His body was brought to a health centre in Bajag on shoulder.After autopsy, it was handed over to his family, who requested the hospital to provide an ambulance to take the body home, but in vain.They had no option but to carry it home on their shoulders. When I asked the block medical officer why no help was provided, he said that he was not even aware of the problem as there was no demand.” She said that since the body had decomposed, auto-wallahs also turned down the villagers’ pleas.
