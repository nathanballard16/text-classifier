Rachita Ram springs a surprise!

Having starred in more than 25 Kannada films over the last seven years, Rachita Ram recently signed her first film in Telugu, titled Super Machi.

Directed by Puli Vasu and co-starring Kalyandhev, Rachita states that she’s grateful for the opportunity.

“I have already started shooting and I am having a gala time on the sets,” she says, adding, “Branching out to another industry only broadens my scope for portraying interesting roles.”

Describing her eagerness to do the romantic entertainer, the Pushpaka Vimana star says, “I spoke to my parents and took just one day to flag off the project.”

While the actress is tightlipped about her role, she reveals, “It is very close to how I am in real life, and that’s one of the reasons I signed the film. I love the way my character is designed and how it plays out.”

As to how she is coping up with the Telugu language, she shares, “My entire staff is from Hyderabad, and I have been speaking to them for quite some time. In fact, when I spoke in Telugu on the first day of my shoot, the crew was surprised. But my team is also helping with the lines.”
