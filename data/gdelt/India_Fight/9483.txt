India strikes inside Pakistan

International Desk: India carried out pre-dawn air strikes on terror camps across the Line of Control on Tuesday, according to reports.



At around 3:30 this morning, 12 Mirage 2000 fighter jets of the Indian Air Force dropped 1,000 kg bombs on terror camps of the Jaish e Mohammad, completely destroying them.



Sources told NDTV that the strikes were "100 per cent successful" and went on "exactly as planned".



Terror launch pads in Balakot, Chakothi and Muzaffrabad across the Line of Control were destroyed by the laser-guided bombs and so were the control rooms of the Jaish, reported ANI.



The Air Force has put on high alert all air defence systems along the international border and the Line of Control, the news agency reported.



India carried out the strikes two weeks after the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, in which over 40 soldiers of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed when a suicide bomber of the Jaish-e-Mohammed exploded a car full of bombs next to a security convoy.



The Jaish-e-Mohammed, which is led by Masood Azhar, had claimed responsibility for the February 14 attack and had also posted videos of the bomber, who had joined the terror group a year ago.



On September 29, 2016, the army had carried out surgical strikes on seven terrorist launch pads across the Line of Control (LoC) in retaliation to an attack on its base in Jammu and Kashmir's Uri earlier that month.
