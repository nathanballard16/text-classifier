Check out Parth's post:

A few weeks ago, Parth Samthaan had bought his own flat in Mumbai for his parents. As his family used to not stay in Mumbai with him, he bought the new house to stay along with them.

Parth had shared photos of it on social media and had captioned them as, "Gift to my Parents —-MY FIRST HOUSE IN MUMBAI This feeling is beyond happiness ! Since the time one travels to a new city to aspire his/her dream .. you are always away from your home .. and while pursuing your dream you want to get your ‘home sweet home’ asap .. So with god’s blessings ...finally m glad that I am able to achieve one of the goals from my wishlist #myownhouse #2801 #hariom Ganpati Bappa Maurya."
