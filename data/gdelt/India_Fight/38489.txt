Kashmir may be the powderkeg that sparks WW IV

THE world is familiar with World War I and World War II: literally a military free-for-all, with the exception of Latin America, parts of Africa and Switzerland, the last of which had declared total neutrality.

Since the attacks of 9/11 (Sept 11) in 2001, the world has witnessed something close to a World War III. The non-stop attacks and counter-attacks against Afghanistan and Iraq, marked by the reprisals of the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq, and also the rest of the world, have made the world less safe.
