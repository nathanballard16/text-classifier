Likeminded Associations Protest against Mob Lynching in the Country

Udupi: Protesting against the increasing cases of mob lynching various likeminded associations took out a rally here on Friday, July 12, 2019.

Addressing the gathering Phaniraj secretary of Karnataka Komu Souharda Vedike said lynching is not only a blot on secularism but also an organised effort to create fear among minorities and Dalits.

Stating that Muslims and Hindus had been living in harmony in India for generations, they pointed out that now, some anti-social elements of the Hindutva outfits are killing innocent people in the name of cow protection and protection of Hindu culture.

Referring to the lynching of Tabrez Ansari recently in Jharkhand, he said Tabrez Ansari was accused of stealing motorcycles and was brutally beaten while being asked to chant ‘Jai Sri Ram’. In the name of Cow protection minorities and Dalits are being targeted and victimised through lynching. The ruling government at the Centre must be held responsible for such inhuman acts.

Listing out several cases in which innocent people have been killed in the last five years in the country, the government must take stringent action. It should send a clear message that it does not tolerate such incidents and take tough action against those involved in such criminal acts. He demanded the maintenance of peace and religious harmony in India.

Various leaders like Yogish Shetty, Fr William Martis, Shayam Raj Birthi, Rehaman Kodavoor, Prashanth Jattanna, Louis Lobo, Idrees Hoode, Hussain Kodibengre and others were present.
