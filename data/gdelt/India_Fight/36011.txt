Baby boy whose transplant was funded through pa's banana cakes dies

MANILA - A 1-year-old boy from Laguna whose father sold banana cakes to raise funds for his liver surgery died Monday, weeks after his operation in India.

Aquiro Jazz Detablan, who underwent a liver transplant at the Apollo Hospital in India last June 27, ended his long battle with biliary atresia, a rare liver disease afflicting babies.

His mom Jabee Imano Galindes-Detablan confirmed Baby Aki's death on her Facebook account.

Aki's father Antonio touched the hearts of netizens last March when a photo of him selling banana cakes on the side of a street in Calamba, Laguna went viral, as he worked to raise P1.6 million for his son's medical procedure.

After the viral post, donations started pouring in for the family, who was eventually able to earn enough to fly to India for the operation in May.

Aki's mother said a wake will be held for the baby as soon as they return home.

After that, Aki's remains will be brought to his final resting place in Bicol.

Jabee also thanked those who sent donations for their son and asked for prayers at this difficult time.
