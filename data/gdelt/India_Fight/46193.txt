New Delhi: Indian Air Force (IAF) on Saturday approved the case to include the name of Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna on the National War Memorial in New Delhi, said top IAF sources. Khanna died in the line of duty in January 1990 in a terror attack allegedly carried out by the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF).

The Squadron Leader, along with three IAF personnel, were killed on January 25, 1990, in a terror attack by JKLF terrorists. It is alleged that separatist leader Yasin Malik had killed Ravi Khanna in the terror attack.

After the attack, Malik was charge-sheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) before the TADA court in Jammu on August 31, 1990, in connection with the case. Malik, who has been arrested in a terror funding case by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) and currently lodged in Tihar Jail, would be produced in the special court through video conferencing.

The latest development in the case will come as a boon to Khanna's widow Nirmal who has been demanding her husband's name to appear on the National War Memorial. She has been fighting for justice for her late husband.

National War Memorial was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this year in the national capital. It has names of all the defence personnel killed in different operations on its walls.
