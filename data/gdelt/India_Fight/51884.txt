Siraha, November 18

Police today made public five persons arrested on charge of murdering Indian national Raj Kumar Yadav, 40, of Bihar, India.

Organising a press meet at District Police Office, Siraha, police made public the arrested. The arrested are Fulgen Sah, 38, Ram Kumar Sah, 19, Jitendra Sah, 20 and Ajay Kumar Mahato, 25 and Rajlal Mahato, 25. They were nabbed from Siraha last week.

Body of Yadav was found on the banks of the Kamal River in Siraha Municipality-12, on November 7. Yadav worked as a shaman in Siraha and Dhanusha. A preliminary police investigation showed that Yadav might have been killed as he was involved in immoral activities, said Spokesperson Abhiraj Bohora at District Police Office.

It is learnt that Yadav had borrowed Rs 85,000 for his daughter’s wedding from Fulgen and when the latter asked Yadav to return his money, a dispute had broken out between them. According to police investigation, Yadav had hatched a plot to murder Fulgen when he asked his money back. When Fulgen came to know about that, he called a meeting of people who were cheated by Yadav and made a plan to kill him.

As per the plan, Fulgen had called Yadav to Siraha headquarters saying that his mother-in-law was ill. On a different pretext, Yadav was taken to the banks of the Kamala River and stabbed to death with a knife at around 6:00pm on

November 6.

Police had reached the incident site the next day after the locals reported about the incident to the police. Police first nabbed Fulgen and following the information provided by him, four others were arrested.

Police said that Fulgen and his aides had thrown Yadav’s bag and clothes at different places. The bag was recovered from a pond in Dhangadi. Police have also seized the knife used in the murder. Yadav had treated Fulgen’s aides. Yadav might have been killed as his treatment was ineffective in curing their illness and he was also involved in unethical activities, said police.
