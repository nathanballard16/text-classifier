Telugu TV serial 'Pavithra Bandham' actress Naga Jhansi commits suicide

Naga Jhansi, better known as Jhansi, the lead star of the serial Pavithra Bandham on MAA TV (now Star MAA), was found dead on Tuesday after she committed suicide at her apartment in Hyderabad. News of the 21-year-old actress’ death came to light after her brother Durga Prasad, who stays with her, alerted the police when she didn’t respond to the ringing of the doorbell and other attempts to reach out to her. The police found her hanging from the ceiling after breaking into her house after the alert.

While not much is known about the reason behind her death, the police have told the media that Jhansi was chatting with a man she grew close to over the last six months, shortly before she took the step.

The youngster is said to have been in a relationship with a distant relative Surya for a while now and even quit her work in movies and serials to be able to eventually settle into married life. It is being reported that her parents weren’t in approval of the relationship and it is for that reason that she has been distant from them for a while. The police are looking at the possibility of a failed relationship being the reason for her death.

Hailing from Vadali village in Krishna district, Jhansi enjoyed quite the popularity after her stint on TV and movies eventually. However, she hasn’t been seen on the screen for a long time now and established a well-functioning salon in the Srinagar Colony area of Hyderabad.
