Dubai: A one-and-a- half year old girl was killed in the Indian state of Haryana, and her body was hidden in her house for two days. The culprits? Her father and stepmother.

What happened?

According to a report by Indian magazine India Today, the man identified as Dilip, with the help of his second wife Ritu, killed his daughter, and tried to cover-up the crime by throwing the body of the little girl in a nearby canal.

The duo decided to drop the body in the canal, for fear that the smell of the body would reveal their crime. They body was wrapped in “blankets and a nightgown”, and placed it in a bag, the report said.

On their way to the canal, the couple was circled by dogs and in fright, they left the bag in the corner of the street and ran away.

How was the body found?

Deputy Superintendent of Police Yashpal Khatana received information on October 1 of the incident and found the body of the little girl on a street in Sheikhpura locality, in Haryana.

Was there a motive for the crime?

Yes. A year-and-a-half ago, Dilip’s first wife Pushpa gave birth to a baby girl but died soon after.

Dilip remarried after his wife’s death and his new wife, Ritu, disliked the little girl. According to the report, the woman used to beat up the child daily.
