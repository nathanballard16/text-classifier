New Delhi: Bahujan Samaj Party supremo Mayawati launched a scathing attack on the Kamal Nath-led Madhya Pradesh government and Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government for harassing Muslims. Slamming the Congress government in MP, Mayawati said that like earlier BJP regime the state government has slapped NSA on Muslims for alleged cow slaughter. She also lambasted the UP government for filing sedition charges against 14 students from Aligarh Muslim University.

Speaking to ANI, Mayawati termed both the actions as examples of government repression and urged the public to decide the difference between both the governments.

This is not the first time that Bahujan Samaj Party chief attacked the Kamal Nath-led Congress government. She had earlier accused the state government of “oppressing” the people of Madhya Pradesh. While addressing a press conference, Mayawati said the people of MP were relieved after Shivraj Singh Chouhan was ousted from power but said state oppression still continues under the current Congress government.

“The initial functioning of the new government isn't satisfying people either. Government oppression is still continuing,” she had said.

The BSP had supported the Congress to form the government in Madhya Pradesh to keep the saffron party out of power.

Since the Congress came to power in MP, it has imposed NSA on five people for cow slaughter and illegally transporting cattle. CM Kamal Nath has been accused of indulging in soft-Hindutva and has initiated many cow welfare schemes in the state.

As per PTI report, 14 students from AMU were booked under sedition charges after they entered into a confrontation with a TV channel crew over reports of a visit by AIMIM lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi.
