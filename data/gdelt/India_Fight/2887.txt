Photos: Varun Dhawan starts shooting for ABCD3D in Punjab



After mesmerising the audience with their moves in ABCD 2, Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor have collaborated again for ABCD 3D. The film is being directed by Remo D’Souza and is being marketed as the biggest dance film to be ever made in Bollywood. Varun left for Punjab yesterday to shoot for the film sans Shraddha as she will be joining them straight in London for the next schedule. Varun visited the Golden Temple in Amritsar yesterday with the team of the film and today he began shooting for the film.







Pictures from their first day on the sets of the film were released on social media and the entire team seems excited to kick-start this project.







Varun will be shooting for a wedding song from the film in Punjab and a few emotional sequences according to sources close to the film. The film hits the theatres on November 8, 2019. We are eager to watch this man in action again, aren’t you too?
