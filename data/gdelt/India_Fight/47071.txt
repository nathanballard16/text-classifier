Bengal violence: BJP, RSS question silence of liberals

NEW DELHI: Outraged by the spate of political killings in West Bengal, including the latest gruesome murder of three members of a family, BJP leaders have sought time from President Ram Nath Kovind and home minister Amit Shah to apprise them of the "complete breakdown" of law and order in the state.Saffron leaders are not only aghast at the police inaction in the killing of an RSS worker and his pregnant wife and child, they have also expressed anguish over the alleged silence of the 'liberals' over the incident."Deeply condemn this barbaric act of murder of RSS worker, his wife and child in West Bengal. Hope liberals will find it ghastly enough to empathise with the bereaved family if not condemn and criticise it outrightly," law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said.BJP's Rajya Sabha MP Swapan Dasgupta said, "Eight political murders in West Bengal in the past 4 days. How much more must the state endure? The time for change is fast approaching." RSS-affiliated weekly Organiser said the Murshidabad incident in which RSS worker Swayamsevak Bandhu Prakash Pal and family members were killed showed "a complete breakdown of law and order in the state". It also hinted at possible involvement of jihadi elements in the crime.Two other BJP workers were murdered last Wednesday-Animesh Chakraborty in Birbhum and Ahmed Sheikh in Nadia- who were active during the recent membership drive."The culprits are from the TMC and even Jihadi elements could be involved to deter people from working for BJP," Organiser said.RSS mouthpiece Panchjanya said in an editorial: "Why is the secular brigade, which minces no word about alleged mob lynching, is silent about West Bengal murders. Questions about mob lynching are directed at those, who themselves have been its victims."Panchjanya has also mentioned a report of National Union of Journalists, which reported over 150 incidents of political violence in West Bengal from May 19 to June 21. BJP's Bengal unit says a total of 81 party workers have been murdered under the Mamata Banerjee regime.BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said, "We have sought time from President Kovind and home minister Amit Shah to apprise them about the worsening law and order situation in Bengal. People are being killed in broad daylight."
