Amaravati: Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Sunday, launched a blistering attack on Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu, saying that the latter has deviated from the vision of development for personal benefits.

Addressing a rally in Guntur, the Prime Minister said, “The chief minister has joined the competition of abusing Modi, forgetting the development vision for Andhra Pradesh. He had promised that he would turn around the infrastructure, but he himself took U-turn. He had promised formation of new Amaravati but has been busy in rebuilding himself.”

Stepping up his attack on Naidu, the Prime Minister said that the Andhra Pradesh CM has been busy in helping his son and cabinet minister Nara Lokesh, overlooking the poor people of the state.

“He had promised a new sunrise in Andhra Pradesh but has been busy in helping his own son. He had promised to bring new development scheme for poor in Andhra Pradesh but has pasted his sticker on the schemes of Modi,” the PM added.

The Prime Minister also accused the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief of back-stabbing his father-in-law and thespian NT Rama Rao, commonly known as NTR in 1995 to become the Chief Minister.

“He often says that he is a senior politician. Senior in changing colors last minute and form alliances. Senior in back-stabbing his own father-in-law for power," the Prime Minister asserted, adding that Naidu is not giving respect to NTR by joining the Congress-led opposition parties' alliance.

The Prime Minister also spoke about the posters put up in the state against his visit, saying, “I am happy TDP has told me to 'go back' to Delhi! I am glad TDP people are holding slogans - ‘go back Modi.’ Meaning I will go back and take authority again in Delhi. Meaning, I will come back to power again and be back in Delhi.”
