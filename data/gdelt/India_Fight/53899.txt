‘Nobody Visited Us’: Family, Neighbours Of Dalit Woman Gangraped And Killed In Telangana Appeal For Justice

As per Gopi’s statement in the first information report (FIR) registered after the body was found (accessed by Swarajya), he and Lakshmi left home together around 6 am on 24 November with their individual supplies.

He dropped Lakshmi in Ellapatar and himself went to Modiguda. When he returned to Ellapatar to pick her up around 2 pm as usual, he did not find her. Her mobile number was also switched off. He searched all around but could not find her. The same night, he gave a complaint to the police.

The next morning, he and a few villagers went around looking for Lakshmi. He eventually found her body around 9 am between Ramnayaktanda and Ellapatar villages within Lingapur mandal. Her saree was pulled up above knees, the upper body was unclothed and she had severe injury marks on her head, throat and hands.

The statement further says that Lakshmi and Gopi belong to Budaga Jangam, a scheduled caste. Gopi suspected three men – Shaboddin, Babu and Makdum – behind the crime as they too were found missing from their homes.

Gopi, who has been living in Gosampally since the crime, told Swarajya that he fears that Lakshmi might have been hit badly on her face and body during the crime. Her eyes were bulging. Her fingers were broken as if hit repeatedly by stones. Her legs were bent in an awkward position, he said.
