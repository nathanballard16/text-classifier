SC order on quota in promotion will face test

NEW DELHI: The SC judgment upholding reservation in promotion for SCs/STs may have led to cheers in the target constituency but the political reality suggests it remains an uphill task.The judicial nod to Karnataka 's 2018 law reiterates there is no getting away from Nagaraj judgment, which has mandated the need for quantifiable data to establish "backwardness, inadequacy of representation and no effect on efficiency" for the measure to be activated.The law upheld was brought by Karnataka after the top court in a 2018 judgment struck down its original version for not being Nagaraj compliant. It means that states are at liberty to enact promotion quota but would have to back them with the record showing that dalits and tribals are not adequately represented in various echelons of government."The states have all the data about their employees. They should bring the law without delay," Ashok Bharti, activist coordinating dalit protests nationally, said.But it may not be so easy now. When in August 2012, the UPA brought a constitutional amendment to neutralise an Allahabad HC order and restore promotion quota, Samajwadi Party vociferously opposed it. It was in power in UP then.The political realities appear to be more tricky seven years later.After MP and Rajasthan poll defeats of BJP, upper castes have emerged as a strong lobby group threatening a backlash for any aggressive affirmative action.So much so, that Modi government this January even introduced 10% reservation for upper castes by making 'economic backwardness', in addition to social backwardness, a criterion for quota. Would the political parties have the courage to reintroduce promotion quota for SCs and STs? When the SP opposed the constitutional amendment in 2012, it was responding to the pressure from its support base of OBCs.Any revived hostility from upper castes and OBCs would seriously test the resolve of the ruling parties in moving on the quota provision.Given the change in ground reality over the years, promotion quota had a better chance in 2012 when upper castes were not a pressure group in politics, and definitely did not define themselves in hostility to the backward classes.In fact, SAPAKS, the party of 'forward castes' in MP, was launched mid 2018 in reaction to the Centre's decision to bring a constitutional amendment to neutralise the apex court's dilution of "SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act". The 10% upper caste quota is rooted in SAPAKS.
