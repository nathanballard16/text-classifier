used as dump after vehicles blocked road; work on building quarters at site also begins.A plot in Bandra West, on which the cyber crime police headquarters is to be built but was instead used as afor seized vehicles, has finally been cleared.Mirror had on February 14 reported that the plot at the junction of Guru Nanak Road and S V Road and diagonally opposite Lucky Restaurant in Bandra had also been allotted for construction of Mumbai Police’s residential quarters.The Bandra police used to park seized vehicles outside the station, but that led to constant traffic jams. After the then deputy commissioner advised them to clear the area, the vehicles— including four Mercedes cars and more than 100 motorcycles—were moved to the plot. This held up construction of the cyber lab for over a year, despite the Bandra police being issued several missives to shift the vehicles out.The vehicles were finally moved around 10 days ago.Now that the plot has been cleared, the Maharashtra State Police Housing and Welfare Corporation has begun work on constructing the residential quarters.Girish Anavkar, senior Bandra police inspector, said, “We have shifted all old cars to a dumpyard at Mankhurd and cleared the plot.”An officer of Maharashtra State Police Housing and Welfare Corporation said in the first phase of construction, five cyber police stations (one for each city region) will be built on the plot, and a six-storey building will also come up on it. Eight floors will be added in the second phase.The administrative approval for the construction has been given and Rs 35 crore sanctioned for the work. Phase 1 alone will cost Rs 24 crore. “The Land belongs to the Mumbai police commissioner and it is the police’s duty to give a clear plot for quarters for their personnel,” said another officer.
