Rahul slams PM Modi over Shastri Bhawan fire

Says ‘burning files won’t save him’

After a minor fire broke out at Shastri Bhawan on Tuesday, Congress president took a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Mr. Gandhi tweeted: “Modi ji burning files is not going to save you. Your day of judgement is coming.”

No casualties

After Mr. Gandhi’s tweet, the Delhi Fire Services (DFS) clarified that the fire which broke out on the sixth floor of Shastri Bhawan was immediately doused.

“We got the call about the fire at 2.50 p.m. Seven fire engines were rushed to extinguish the blaze. The fire was doused within half an hour. There were no casualties reported,” said a DFS officer. The firemen who were inside the building told that the AC repairing waste material dumped on the terrace had caught fire.

The reason of fire is yet to be ascertained. Shastri Bhawan houses several important ministries including Ministries of Information and Broadcasting and Human Resources Development.
