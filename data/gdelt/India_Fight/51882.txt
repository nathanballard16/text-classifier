In a horrific incident, a six-year-old girl was allegedly thrown from a three-story building by her uncle, who was inebriated, in Vambay Colony, Vijayawada. The Times of India reported that the girl, Janaki, is critical and in a comatose state at Guntur Government General Hospital. The incident took place on Sunday, but only came to light the next day.

According to reports, the accused, 28-year-old Kondaraju Krishna, works as a mason and was staying with his brother’s family. Kondaraju had reportedly moved in with his brother Yesuraju, Yesuraju’s wife Sridevi and their three children, after his wife had left him due to his alleged alcohol addiction. Krishna had gotten married in 2018.

The Hindu reported that on Sunday evening, Krishna was in an inebriated condition and had gotten into a fight with Sridevi, Janaki's mother, after he had dirtied the house which she had just cleaned.

The argument escalated quickly and Krishna, in a fit of rage, allegedly picked up Janaki and tossed her off the building. Janaki was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital and then taken to Guntur GGH.

The accused has reportedly been arrested by Nunna police under Sections 307 (Attempt to murder) and 509 (Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman.)

Reportedly, Janaki suffered injuries to her head, as well as bleeding from her nose and ears.
