Newly-elected Uttar Pradesh Bar Council chairperson Darvesh Yadav was shot dead inside the premises of a Agra court on Wednesday allegedly by another advocate at a welcome ceremony organised in her honour. The lawyer, identified as Manish Sharma, then shot himself, police said.

The attack happened at around 2.30 pm when Sharma suddenly got up during the ceremony and shot her three times, police said.

Agra City’s Additional Superintendent of Police Praveen Verma said Sharma, a long-time acquaintance of Yadav, is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital and is in a critical condition.

“After spraying three bullets on her, Sharma also shot himself,” Verma told PTI.

The pistol used in the attack was a licensed weapon and has been recovered, he said. An eyewitness told PTI that Yadav visited the Civil Court for the first time after her appointment as UP Bar Council president.

The Bar Council of India condemned the murder of Yadav and demanded security for its members. The council also demanded a minimum compensation of Rs 50 lakh from the UP government to Yadav’s family, news agency ANI reported.
