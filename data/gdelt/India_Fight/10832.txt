Siddaramaiah’s twitter handle hacked

Bengaluru : Congress Legislative Party leader Siddaramaiah’s twitter handle was compromised on Wednesday, following Indian air strikes in Pakistan.

Siddaramaiah’s official Twitter handle @siddaramaiah had a rather strange tweet stating: “Today Indian Air Force has attacked on BAGALAKOT. Deep codomienses (sic) to the terrorists families. May their souls rest in piece (sic).

This was tweeted at 5.15 pm and was retweeted once. The former chief minister was trolled on social media for his spelling bloopers of Bagalkot instead of Balakot and expressing condolences for the terrorists’ family. He is an MLA from Badami constituency in Bagalkot district.

When Siddaramaiah got to know this, he immediately tweeted the image with Fake News watermarks: “Morphed tweets with my official handle are being circulated in social media by few unethical users. This image has a logo of a group ‘Troll Sisyandru’. I urge @BlrCityPolice to take immediate action against those involved &I also request Shri. @MBPatil to look into the issue.

His media coordinator, Prabhakar said: The leader is in Vijapura, and when he returns to Bengaluru, he will file a complaint with the city police.

However, the city police maintained that they are unaware of the tweet and that they are yet to get a police complaint from Siddaramaiah’s office.
