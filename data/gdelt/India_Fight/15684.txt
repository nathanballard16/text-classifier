Haryana Professor's 'Love Formulas' Get Caught On Tape, Wannabe 'Love Guru' Gets Suspended

In a bid to make his classes creative, this Mathematics professor chose to teach his students love rather than math formulas. Charan Singh, an assistant professor at a government college for women in Karnal, Haryana, tried to explain love, friendship, closeness and attraction to first-year B.Com students.

A video of the incident is going viral on social media. He wrote three formulas on the board, one of which read, ‘Closeness- Attraction = Friendship’. He went on to speak about the relationship between a husband and a wife which according to him falls apart with growing age.





“Husband and wife become friends in old age after the physical attraction dies down. The feeling of love comes when both the partners get attracted to each other. Both will quarrel with each other if the closeness is missing."

"In foreign countries, people change vehicle, house and even spouse if any of the ingredients are missing. Whereas in India, people continue with the relationship even if closeness and attraction are missing but this is good for the children.”

Unfortunately, this did not end well for the professor. He was suspended after one of the students in his class shot a video of one of his lectures. He got a suspension letter through email according to which he can no longer teach math and has instead been allotted another subject.

A Karnal-based social activist has also demanded the arrest of Singh by writing a complaint letter to the police which hasn’t been registered yet.
