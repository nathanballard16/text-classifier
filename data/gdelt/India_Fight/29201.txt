Soroan double murder and dacoity case: Cops fail to make any breakthrough

ALLAHABAD: Twenty four hours after the sensational Soraon double murder and dacoity case, red-faced police have failed to make significant headway. Despite forming two special teams, cops are unable to get leads.However, senior police authorities on Sunday deployed adequate police forces to defuse the tension in the village. Local residents of Soraon and adjoining areas have demanded the police higher-ups to solve the double murder mystery at the earliest.A couple identified as Nagendra Bhushan Tiwari (35) and his wife Manorama (30) was bludgeoned to death in Soraon area on the intervening night of Friday and Saturday. The bodies of the couple were found lying on separate cots on the terrace of their residence at Sarai Lal Khatu village early Saturday morning.Inspector, Soraon said, "Police teams are running from pillar to post to get clues and also to ensure the arrest of assailants involved in the incident." He, however, said that the motive behind double murder would be cracked only after the arrest of criminals.He, meanwhile, said slain Nagendra was a son of retired police sub-inspector of Pratapgarh district and survived by his wife, and three children. The forensic team is analysing the brick having blood stains to get clues, he added."Cops are probing the case on two angles including internal property dispute and involvement of a criminal tribe gang,” said a cop associated with investigations," adding that the police have picked up two persons for quizzing suspecting their role regarding the incident.Following the incident, the family members had lodged an FIR against three persons including two named and one unidentified accusing them to kill the couple. Apart from looking for named persons, the police have also been collecting the sequence of incident suspecting the role of the criminal tribe."The sequence of incidences where a couple was attacked with a brick while sleeping indicates towards the involvement of criminal tribe as they execute crime\kill victims with brick or sticks only," said an official, adding, missing of jewellery and other valuables also confirm their role.
