Kolkata, September 28

Working president JP Nadda today took part in a programme organised by the party to pay ritual homage to comrades slain in political violence in West Bengal during the last seven years of the Trinamool Congress regime in the state.

The saffron party erected a stage at Kolkata’s Bagbazar Ghat and organised an elaborate “tarpan” ceremony with family members of BJP workers allegedly killed in political violence in attendance.

The Bagbazar Ghat, where the stairs lead to the Ganga, is popular among devout Hindus who gather there on the occasion of ‘Mahalaya’ every year to offer water to departed ancestors. The ritual is known as “tarpan”. ‘Mahalaya’ is celebrated at the end of a 16-day period when Hindus pay homage to their ancestors. This year ‘Mahalaya’ was observed today.

Nadda himself got down to the river and paid homage to party workers killed in the political violence. He was accompanied by other party heavyweights, including Debasree Chaudhuri, union minister, Dilip Ghosh, Lok Sabha member and state BJP president, Kailash Vijaybargya, general secretary, and others.

Attacking West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee, Nadda alleged that there was ‘jungle raj’ and ‘state terrorism’ in West Bengal. He further alleged the state police stood as mute spectators even as the TMC goons unleash murderous assaults targetting their political opponents. Eighty BJP workers have been murdered by the TMC during past seven years, Nadda said, adding more than 2,500 left their homes owing to attack by TMC goons.
