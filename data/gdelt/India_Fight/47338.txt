The actor began shooting for the film by the end of September this year. Suniel will be playing a Sikh cop in the film which will be directed by American-Chinese filmmaker Jeffery Chin. Reportedly the film is based on a real story of a multimillion-dollar call centre scam which was busted by an Indian cop.

A source close to the development told a tabloid, “The premise revolves around four guys who worked at a call centre in India and robbed a US-based company of $381 million. While American agencies were involved in the investigation, it was the Indian police that cracked the case.”
