Here's why Trump skipped the climate meeting, according to White House officials

A White House official says President Trump didn’t attend the climate summit because he “had meetings and bilats with Germany and India. Both went long.”

“We sent staff to that session,” the official added.

White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham, asked why he skipped it, said, told the pool: “The President had scheduled meetings and bilaterals with Germany and India, so a senior member of the Administration attended in his stead.”

Both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi were seen attending the climate session that Trump skipped.
