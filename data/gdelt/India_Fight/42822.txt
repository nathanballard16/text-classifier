50 Jaish terrorists training in deep diving, may launch attack on India via sea: BSF sources

At least 50 Jaish-e-Mohammed(JeM) terrorists are undergoing training in deep-sea diving to launch an attack on India, according to Border Security Force sources.

Sources said terrorists are being given special training to attack Indian security forces deployed at sea, according to BSF which has forwarded the Intel to Southern Command.

Lt General SK Saini, GOC-in-C, Army Southern Command, confirmed that he has received inputs that there may a terrorist attack in the southern part of India.

Saini added that some abandoned boats have been spotted in Sir Creek--a 96 km tidal estuary on the border of India and Pakistan dividing Gujarat from Sindh province--and precautions are being taken to prevent any terrorist attack.

Kerala Police chief has also alerted all district police chiefs after security forces provided intel on a possible terrorist attack across southern India.

The district police chief have been instructed to maintain caution at busy areas including bus stands, railway stations, airports, and other crowded places. According to information, police will be on high alert at all crowded places in the wake of Onam celebrations in the state.

Earlier, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Karambir Singh said in Pune that Pakistan-based terror group JeM is training terrorists to carry out underwater attacks on India. He, however, added that the Indian Navy is ready to thwart any such attempts.

Singh said all stakeholders in coastal security are ensuring that there is no breach or intrusion from the sea route.

"We have received intelligence (input) that an underwater wing of Jaish-e-Mohammed is training people to carry out attacks from water and that is one change. But we are fully prepared and will thwart any such attempt," he added.
