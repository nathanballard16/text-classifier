The Imran Khan government has been under pressure from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to act against terror outfits and terrorists operating out of Pakistan. Hafiz Saeed was earlier this month booked along with 12 accomplices for terror funding. He is facing 23 terror-related cases in Pakistan. But he was granted bail as the government did not produce concrete evidence to before the court.
