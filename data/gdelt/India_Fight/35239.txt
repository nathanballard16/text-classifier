Alia Bhatt Gives Us A BTS Peek Into The Day She Moved Into Her Own House

Who doesn’t like looking at pictures of celebrity homes? After all, we get a sense of their tastes and it gives us a voyeuristic peek into their lives. Alia Bhatt, now also a newly minted YouTube star, shared a behind the scenes video of the day she moved into her own apartment.





In the video titled ‘Alia’s Moving Day Vlog’, Alia shares with her fans the process of moving into her first home “with her own money and own effort”. She explains that the whole process took about two years. “Moving out of my house was a very, very special experience because it was the first time I was moving away from my home and into my own house… Initially I was gonna move in alone, then I decided to take my sister along with me and she was more than happy. She decided to live part time with me and part time with my mom”

Alia further elaborates that she was very particular about her space, much like cats. Big sis Shaheen Bhatt and she had ordered plenty of knick knacks for their home and also taken a special trip to pick-up pieces for their new home.

The house, which was designed by Richa Bahl, was featured earlier this year in a leading decor magazine, and is a mix of Swiss chalet and New York City loft. Alia admitted to the magazine, “I told Richa I didn’t want it to be too modern. I wanted it to feel a little old, with a New York loft kind of feel. And I didn’t want anything overtly glamorous, like chandeliers, or marble floors.”

The apartment--situated in Juhu, Mumbai--is in close proximity to Alia’s parents’ home and was the location was a deciding factor in buying her current apartment. Alia reveals that she is now in the process of moving into her office, which we’re sure will have the same amazing style and behind-the scenes video too.
