Mamata slams PM over ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’

Kolkata: West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi without naming him while inaugurating a theatre festival Friday evening here. Talking in context of the film ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’ which hit the screens Friday, the firebrand leader said that she is also thinking of another film before the upcoming elections and she will title it ‘The Disastrous Prime Minister’.

‘The Accidental Prime Minister’ is film based on former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The film has been conceptualised from the book written by Sanjaya Baru who had been Singh’s media advisor and depicts the former PM’s tenure and his struggle with the internal politics in the Congress.

“Look what they are doing in the name of ‘The Accidental Prime Minister’. That way they are all accidental Prime Ministers,” said Mamata, who was once in the Congress before leaving the party to form the Trinamool Congress.

“Those who are doing drama before elections over ‘Accidental Prime Minister’ should see another film ‘The Disastrous PM’. It will be shown in the coming days. No one will be spared. You will get back what you show. What has been shown is pure caricature and distortion,” she shot back.

The West Bengal Chief Minister also launched a personal attack on Modi and termed him ‘Gabbar Singh’.
