Kolkata, Dec 04: Members of fringe outfit Hindu Jagaran Manch clashed with police in Sealdah after they were stopped from taking out a rally on Wednesday, leading to a massive traffic pile up in central Kolkata.

Police had to baton-charge hundreds of HJM members who tried to break barricades and move forward, a senior officer of the Kolkata Police said. Over 60 of them were arrested, he said.

A large number of police personnel, led by Deputy Commissioner (Central) Sudheer Kumar Neelakantam, were deployed to tackle the situation, he added.
