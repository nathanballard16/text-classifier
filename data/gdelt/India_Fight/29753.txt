Clashes break out between BJP workers, police in Kolkata during BJP’s protest march

Clashes broke out between BJP workers and police personnel in Kolkata on Wednesday as the party tried to hold a protest march towards the state Police headquarters in Lalbazar.

Police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse BJP workers who were holding a protest march against post-poll violence and alleged attack on its workers and supporters.

In retaliation, the saffron party workers raised slogans and hurled stones and bottles at the police officers.

All 18 newly elected MPs of the party, including its state president Dilip Ghosh and the BJP’s state in-charge Kailash Vijayvargiya senior party leader Mukul Roy had joined in the march.

The political slugfest between the BJP and the Trinamool Congress has increased in West Bengal post the Lok Sabha polls in which the BJP secured 18 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats.
