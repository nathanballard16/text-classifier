Terming as 'irresponsible' and 'preposterous', India on Sunday rejected Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi's claim that India was planning to carry out another attack on Pakistan. Qureshi's comments were aimed at whipping up war hysteria in the region, India said. Pakistan has "reliable intelligence" that India was planning to attack Pakistan again between April 16 and 20, Qureshi had told reporters in Multan, adding five permanent members of the UN Security Council were apprised about it.

Commenting on the claims, External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Ravesh Kumar said Qureshi's comments are a "public gimmick" that appear to be "a call to Pakistan-based terrorists to undertake a terror attack in India".

"India rejects the irresponsible and preposterous statement by the foreign minister of Pakistan with a clear objective of whipping up war hysteria in the region. This public gimmick appears to be a call to Pakistan-based terrorists to undertake a terror attack in India," Kumar said.

He said India reserves the right to respond "firmly and decisively" to any cross-border terrorist attack.

Meanwhile, the Indian Deputy High Commissioner was summoned to Pakistan Foreign office in Islamabad and was issued a warning against "any misadventure" by India.

Qureshi's claim comes nearly six weeks after India struck the biggest terrorist training camp of Jaish-e-Muhammed deep inside Pakistan in retaliation to the dastardly Pulwama terror attack, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed. The JeM had claimed responsibility for the attack.
