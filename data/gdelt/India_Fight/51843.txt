VADODARA: Two history-sheeters were arrested on Monday for allegedly murdering their labourer friend in Waghodiya last week.

Ajay Vasava and Ganesh alias Gautam Chunara are accused of killing Ganpat Vasava by smashing his face with stones under the influence of alcohol. The three friends were consuming liquor at a crematorium on the outskirts of Vejalpur village on November 11 night.

Police said that the trio had decided to go to crematorium as Ajay and Ganesh wanted to talk to Ganpat regarding his rift with their friend Zaver Mer.

A police official said that the trio had heated altercations as Ajay and Chunara raised the issue of Mer. They asked him to stop harassing Mer and that he had been bullying around a lot. As heated arguments ensued, Ganpat commented about Ajay’s mother who had passed away last month which angered the latter more. The duo then picked up a stone and wooden log and started hitting on Ganpat’s face until he collapsed.

After reaching home, on suspecting that Ganpat may not have died, they went to the crematorium again with Shobhana, who lives with Chunara. They had however not apprised Shobhana about the killing, so they asked her to get down near a bridge on Dev river. They went to the crematorium by making an excuse that they are going to relieve themselves.

At the crematorium when they found Ganpat dead, they tied his hands with a cloth and dumped his body in the river. Ajay, Chunara and Shobhana then fled to Dakor and Fagvel in Kheda.

According to police records, Chunara has been arrested in the past in murder cases by Wadi and Navapura police and Ajay has also been nabbed in assault cases registered at Bapod and Warasia police stations.
