RSS wants to counter what it considers ‘negative propaganda’ with awareness campaigns spearheaded by its student and labour wings.The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) and its affiliate organisations, better known as the, have decided to go on the offensive on the issues of Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and National Register of Citizens (NRC) to counter the ‘propaganda’ by ‘anti-social elements’. The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the students’ wing of the RSS, will spearhead awareness campaigns to bust myths around the CAA and NRC.The Sangh Parivar had appeared flummoxed in the wake of the initial clashes between the students and the police at Jamia Millia Islamia university in Delhi in the second week of this month.However, since then the Sangh Parivar has quickly regrouped and decided to stand firm behind Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government.Political analyst Prakash Akolkar said, “Though former PM AB Vajpayee was from the Sangh Parivar, his government was never considered to be an extension of the family since he was running a coalition government. Moreover, Vajpayee had put abolition ofand, the three issues that form the Parivar’s ideological core, on the backburner.”“However, with the abrogation of Article 370, a ban on triple talaq and the Supreme Court giving favourable judgement on Ram Mandir, Modi has endeared himself to the Parivar. It now sees the issues of CAA and NRC as an extension of its core agenda,” he added.Along with the BJP, the ABVP has also taken the lead in reaching out to the student community. It was the first to hold a rally in support of the CAA and NRC outside CST station on December 19. Later, it organised similar demonstrations in IIT Bombay andMilind Marathe, former national president of ABVP and a member of its executive committee, said, “Out of more than 900 universities across the country, protests against the CAA and NRC took place in only 22 institutions such Jamia,, JNU, Jadavpur University. But the media has created an impression that the entire student community is up in arms against the government.”“In fact, in 330 universities across the nation we carried out marches, campus meetings and awareness programmes that were hardly reported in the media,” he added.Aspokesperson of the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP), Shriraj Nair, said, “In the last 15 days or so, we have organised more than 100 meetings in various community halls and temples across Konkan Prant and our activists have taken up similar initiatives across the nation.”The Parivar calls the coastal region from Palghar to Goa as Konkan Prant or province.The Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the labour wing of the RSS, is organising gate meetings in commercial and industrial establishments to educate its cadre on CAA and NRC, said its national general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay.RSS’s Prachar Pramukh or head of communication, Arun Kumar, said, “At the central level, the Parivar is not participating in any outreach programme but our state units are free do so. They are already doing that in West Bengal and in the Northeast.”A Sangh functionary, who did not want to be named, said, “A common Hindu understands that the CAA has nothing to do with Indians, including the Muslim citizens, as it is all about giving citizenship to persecuted minorities in Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.”
