Action & probe necessary against self-termed intellectuals, celebrities & politicians for provoking people against legitimate governance-system

Dear Editor,

It refers to noted writer Arundhiti Roy publicly provoking people to give misleading and common information about their names (as Ranga-Billa), address (as 7 Racecourse Road, New Delhi) and a unanimously decided mobile-number when government-officials come to their residences for compiling information for National Population Register (NPR).

It has become a pseudo-secular political fashion of some intellectuals, celebrities and politicians to oppose usual administrative-procedures just for sake of opposition. Compilation of such details has been a usual feature even in earlier UPA regime, and its opposition now is just political aimed to disturb governance-system. Strict-most action should be taken against such provocation by concerned ones against the state.

Intelligence-enquiries should be made against such provoking persons and their motives, and should be made public. It is beyond understanding that all such pseudo-secular persons causing disturbance against governance, are curiously silent on atrocities against majority-community like they did at time of mass murder of Kashmiri pandits in the year 1990 causing their exodus from Kashmir valley.
