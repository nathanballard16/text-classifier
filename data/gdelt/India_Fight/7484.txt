New Delhi, February 18

A 51-year-old foreign national was killed and three others critically injured today after a speeding Bentley car hit an autorickshaw in Lutyens’ Delhi, police said.

The speeding car was being driven by Asees Singh Chadha, 19, nephew of tycoon Ponty Chadha who was killed along with his brother in a 2012 shootout. The deceased was identified as Turkmenistan national Gulshat Alijanova, police said.

Asees, accompanied by two Punjab Police personnel, was caught by locals and thrashed before the police reached the spot, a senior police officer said.

A case was registered under Sections 279 (rash driving) and 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) of the IPC, said DCP Madhur Verma. Sources said the harsher Section of 304 IPC was invoked since Chadha was driving a high speed. The accident happened on Vinay Marg in Chanakyapuri, which houses several embassies. — PTI
