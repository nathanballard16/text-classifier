This is when Bharat’s teaser will be out

Salman Khan starrer Bharat has been making noise ever since its announcement. Starring Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif in the lead, the film is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. While the film’s first shoot schedule took place in Malta, the location later shifted to Abu Dhabi, Punjab, Delhi, and a few other places. Earlier there were reports that the teaser/trailer of the film will be unveiled on star’s birthday but since that didn’t happen, fans had no other option than to wait.





Ali Abbas Zafar even tweeted about the same saying, “All the @BeingSalmanKhan fans, don’t loose your hearts , it was our conscious decision not to release anything about @Bharat_TheFilm on Bhai’s birthday, we are still shooting the film , Naye saal mein nayi film ki baat karegein , Naam Bharat hai ..date bhi special Hogi”
