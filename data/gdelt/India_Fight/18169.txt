Congress Maharajganj candidate Supriya calls BJP MP ‘useless’

GORAKHPUR: Congress candidate from Maharajganj parliamentary constituency Supriya Srinate on Monday termed BJP candidate and sitting MP Pankaj Choudhary as a “useless MP who has done nothing for the constituency”.“The MP of Maharajganj is useless, as even after getting so much time (five terms) he did nothing for the development of the constituency. The sugar mill, which was set up here during my father’s time, is lying closed and the area still lacks employment and connectivity,” Supriya said at a press conference.Choudhary could not be contacted for comments as his official phone was switched off. A party worker who picked up his optional number, said the the MP could not take calls as he was busy in his constituency.Supriya, who is making her electoral debut, is the daughter of two-term Maharajganj MP Harshvardhan Singh, who had contested on Janata Dal and Congress tickets. She had earlier worked as TV news anchor and joined joined politics recently.“I will contest on real issues and not on slogans like depositing Rs 15 lakh in everyone’s account. My father did honest politics and I will follow in his footsteps,” added Supriya.When asked about Tanushree, she said, “Everyone knows about her family.”Tanushree is the daughter of Amarmani Tripathi , a former UP minister jailed in the Madhumita Shukla murder case. Earlier, PSPL and Congress had both declared Tanushree as their candidate. But the Congress later changed its decision and named Supriya. Tanushree, who is technically still a PSPL candidate after the Congress cancelled her name, claimed that “Supriya won’t get enough votes”.“No one knows Supriya. She claims of carrying forward her father’s work and politics, but she had rarely visited the district. She won’t get enough votes to even safeguard her security deposit. I am confident of my victory with a huge margin,” Tanushree told TOI on phone.
