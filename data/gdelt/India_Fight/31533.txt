New Delhi, June 23

Over the past few days, monsoon has further advanced into some more parts of central Maharashtra, most parts of Marathwada and parts of Vidarbha and East Uttar Pradesh. However, it is running late and continues to suffer deep deficiency in rain — around 43 per cent.

Currently the northern limit of monsoon is passing through Ratnagiri, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Pendra, Varanasi and Bahraich.

According to the IMD, conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of southwest monsoon into remaining parts of central Arabian Sea, Konkan, central Maharashtra, Marathwada, Vidarbha and Chhattisgarh and some parts of south Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and east Uttar Pradesh during the next 48 hours. Monsoon may hit Delhi around July 10.
