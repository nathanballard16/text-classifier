Police said that Muslim men were stopped on a road in Godhra and told to chant ‘Jai Shri Ram’. The accused assaulted them when they refused to chant slogans, police added.

“We have registered a case,” a senior police official said, adding that the case appears to be a scuffle between two groups of youngsters.
