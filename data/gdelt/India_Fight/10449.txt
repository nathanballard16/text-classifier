Pakistan claims 2 IAF pilots arrested, one injured pilot shifted to hospital

"After PAF decided on targets, two Indian jets entered Pakistani airspace. PAF was ready, faced them. The two planes were shot down. One fell in our space, another on their side. Two pilots were arrested. One of the pilots was injured and has been taken to CMH. He will be given proper care. Another is in our custody," he added.

New Delhi: Asserting that today’s action was in self-defence, Pakistan Army on Wednesday said that it has apprehended two Indian Air Force pilots for violating their airspace, one of whom it claimed is injured and is being medically treated. Reiterating multiple times that that Pakistan wanted “peace” in the region, Major General Asif Ghafoor said the Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across LoC to demonstrate its right, will and capability for self defence. Ghafoor said both Indian Air Force aircrafts were shot down and wreckage of one fell into their territory.
