The City Task Force (CTF) and the airport police arrested four of a five-member gang and seized 252 kg ganja from a stock point in Madhavadhara VUDA Colony on Thursday.

According to police, the accused, including two men from Tamil Nadu, allegedly procured the contraband from Viskahapatnam Agency and stored it in a house. They were planning to transport the ganja to other States.

Acting on a tip-off, the CTF and airport police raided the house and seized more than 100 packets of ganja. “Apart from smuggling, the gang had been allegedly supplying ganja to college students. They had fabricated vehicles to smuggle the contraband without being caught during vehicle checks,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone II) B. Uday Bhaskar told the media here.

The accused will be produced before the VII Additional Metropolitan Magistrate in Visakhapatnam.
