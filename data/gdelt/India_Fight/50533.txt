Pak, China May Have Emitted Toxic Gas to Pollute Delhi: BJP Leader

On the other hand, Uttar Pradesh minister Sunil Bharala suggested a 'unique' solution to the health emergency caused by pollution, believing that a 'yagna' will please Lord Indra, who would help reduce pollution by bringing rainfall.

Bharala said stubble burning is a natural process and does not cause pollution to such an extent.

"Farmers have always practised stubble burning and it is a natural process. Repeated criticism of it is unfortunate," he said. The UP minister suggested praying to Lord Indra will help combat pollution.

"Governments should hold 'Yagya' to please Lord Indra (God of Rain), as it has been done traditionally. Lord Indra will set things right," said Bharala, who is chairperson of Labour Welfare Board and enjoys the status of a state minister.

The minister added that when the farmers cultivate sugarcane and other crops, waste products are bound to generate and criticising the farmers for burning them is an attack on them.
