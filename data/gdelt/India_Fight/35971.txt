Indian envoy summoned over unprovoked shelling on LoC villages

ISLAMABAD: A senior Indian diplomat was on Wed­nes­day summoned to the Foreign Office over killing of two civilians and injuries to several others in unprovoked shelling by Indian troops on villages along the Line of Control (LoC).

“The Director General of (SA & Saarc), Dr Moham­mad Faisal, summoned the Indian Deputy High Commissio­ner, Mr Gaurav Ahluwalia, and condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by Indian occupation forces along the LoC,” the FO said in a statement.

Two civilians, Moham­mad Riaz, 12, and Jan Bibi, were killed due to Indian shelling on July 22 and 23, respectively. Latest ceasefire violations were reported from Bagsar, Hotspring, Jandrot and Banchirian sectors. Four other civilians were wounded due to the Indian shelling.

“The Indian forces along the Line of Control and the Working Boundary are continuously targeting civilian populated areas with heavy weapons. This unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1970 ceasefire violations,” the FO said.

The statement said that targeting of civilian populated areas was not only “deplorable and contrary to human dignity, international human rights and humanitarian laws”, but also posed a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation.
