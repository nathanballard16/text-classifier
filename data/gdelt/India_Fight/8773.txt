Given the way the web space is growing, several actors, filmmakers and talented technicians are jumping on the bandwagon. We hear that Kunal Kapoor, too, was considering taking the plunge. The Gold actor was offered the lead part of a Gujarati businessman in Indo-American director Abi Varghese’s (of Brown Nation fame) new web series, Metro Park. He’s said to have done the look test and even as things were being finalised, he opted out.

Apparently, he bounced the idea off good friend Hrithik Roshan, who suggested he should focus on movies instead. As our source reveals, “Hrithik told Kunal that he shouldn’t rush into the web space with the first tempting offer. He also suggested that the latter should wait a while and concentrate on films instead. Later on, there’s always time for him to venture into the digital arena.”

Kunal reportedly heeded his buddy’s advice and opted out of the web project. After his exit, the streaming platform backing it roped in Ranvir Shorey in his place.
