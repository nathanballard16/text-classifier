The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been planning to make its inroad in the state riding high on the Sabarimala protests. While the CPI-led Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF) have footing in the stateâ€™s Lok Sabha constituencies, the saffron party had no major presence in the state.

According to the 2011 Census, the state had a population of 33,387,677, of which 52.3 percent live in rural areas. Although the state has a Hindu majority, it has a sizeable minorities population. Around 26.56 percent of the population are Muslims and 18.38 percent are Christians, according to the 2011 Census data.

The state of Kerala has always been a battleground for the left and the right parties and the pollical murders have always marred the Kerala politics over the years. During the election campaigns the LDF, the UDF as well as the BJP evoked voter sentiments by bringing up the murders. Another campaigning point this election was the visibility of women. Although the number of women electors is more than that of men, there are only two women MPs in the state.
