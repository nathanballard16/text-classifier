CBI makes first arrest in Mata Chand Kaur murder case

PATIALA: Almost three years after Namdhari sect matriarch Mata Chand Kaur (88), wife of the former sect head late Satguru Jagjit Singh , was shot dead by two unidentified bike-borne assailants at Bhaini Sahib gurdwara complex, 30km from Ludhiana, the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has made first arrest in the case.The CBI on Thursday secured the custody of Palwinder Singh alias Dimpa, who was lodged at Patiala Central Jail, in connection with the Jalandhar tiffin car bomb blast and produced him before the court of GS Sekhon, special CBI judge Punjab at Mohali. He has been remanded to CBI custody till September 30.According to the CBI, Dimpa, who was the former driver of Thakur Dalip Singh, head of Sirsa-based rival faction of the Namdharis and is being investigated for his role in the Jalandhar tiffin car bomb blast that took place in Jalandhar’s Dugri village in December 2015, had during a polygraph test revealed information suggesting that he knew about the assailants who had shot at Mata Chand Kaur.Following the revelation, the CBI moved court seeking Dimpa’s remand. He was produced before the CBI court on production warrants where he was placed under arrest. It was on September 24, that the CBI had moved a formal application before the CBI court for his production warrants. The CBI told the court that the accused was not cooperating in the investigations and, thus, he needed to be integrated in custody.The case had been handed over to the CBI in September 2017 by the previous SAD-BJP government.Dimpa, who is said to be closely related to Thakur Dalip Singh, was arrested in Bangkok and was deported to India in connection with the Jalandhar tiffin bomb case. He is believed to have hatched the conspiracy to target Namdhari sect head Uday Singh in Jalandhar on December 25, 2015, with a tiffin bomb. However, these bombs had exploded in the car when they were being brought to Jalandhar. Immediately after the bid to kill Uday Singh got foiled, Dimpa had gone missing. He is also a suspect in the killing of Namdhari follower Avtar Singh Tari, a close associate of Uday Singh, who was shot dead at Bhaini Sahib in 2011.
