2 terror groups clash over weapon in South Kashmir, 2 killed

Aadil Ahmed Dass, a terror operative affiliated with Zakir Musa group, is believed to have been killed in the gunfight with Hizbul Mujahideen. Another militant's body was also retrieved later.

The gunfight happened between four to five Hizbul operatives who came to retrieve weapon handed over to Dass after he joined Hizbul Mujahideen.

But recently Dass moved away from the largest indigenous group to join Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK). Hizbul Mujahideen then decided to get the weapon back which it had decided to give to its own cadre.

The fight is said to have broken out in Branpathri forests of Tral. Sources told India Today that police received the input that Aadil had been killed in a shootout between two groups.

The body of the militant and the weapon are yet to be retrieved. The information came out on Wednesday morning.

Police teams were sent out into the thick forest but no recovery has been made.
