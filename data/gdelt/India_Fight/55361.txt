Man-eater shot, but big cats keep villages on edge

RAJKOT: Even though one man-eater leopard was gunned down on Wednesday, the threat is far from over. Wary villagers are still living on the edge as they fear there are many more man-eaters lurking in the nearby forests.According to sources, even a team of forest officials sighted a suspected leopard near Visavadar and fired nearly three rounds on Wednesday, the animal managed to escape into the forest. Forest department officials said that the firing was merely to force the wild cat come out in the open from its hiding behind the bushes and not to kill it.Meanwhile, the department is not winding up its operation in Bagasara taluka and deployment of cameras and armed staff of forest department is continued for the sixth day on Thursday. It will continue for a few more days till the department can eradicate all possibilities of suspected wild cat movement in the area.The department has also also started a control room on Wednesday making the numbers public so that even locals can report about any sighting of any big cat in their respective areas.Even the State Wildlife Board has decided to upgrade their helpline number 112 to gather information on leopard or lion straying in these areas or even of any other illegal activities there. The forest department officials also be a part of this helpline number.After Wednesday, the intensity of the operation has slightly reduced after the staff was relieved of the burden of shooting the animal down.Conservator of forest, Rajkot, Ashwin Parmar said, “Leopard is a wild animal and we cannot underestimate the presence of more man-eaters moving in the area. There can be two leopards who have tasted human blood and so we will continue our operation to eradicate all such possibilities.”Section 144 IPC is still in force till December 15 and the forest department wants to continue it till their operation lasts. At the same time, officials are meeting villagers regularly to sensitize them as well as assure them of safety.
