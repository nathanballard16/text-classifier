andexperiment with hair, make-up to age gracefully for their upcoming film.The final schedule of Nitesh Tiwari’skicks off this week in Mumbai and the monthlong shoot will feature all its seven actors—Sushant Singh Rajput, Shraddha Kapoor,, Naveen Polishetty, Tushar Pandey and Saharsh Kumar Shukla. Set in an engineering college, the Sajid Nadiadwala production sees the actors transition from collegians to middle-aged characters.To get the look right, the actors attended one-on-one sessions with make-up and prosthetic artist Preetisheel Singh. Shraddha’s workshop was on February 7, two days before she flew to London for Street Dancer, while Sushant’s was just a few days ago.Talking about the process, Preeti Sheel admits the actors will have to go through the grind of transforming into their characters for the next 30 days. “It will take an hour-and-a-half to get them ready and another 20 minutes to remove the make-up,” she states, promising a seamless change in the film because every character has been designed keeping the respective actor’s personality traits in mind. “Both Shraddha and Sushant have been given salt-and-pepper wigs, with a receding hairline for the latter. For their middle-aged looks, we have used an old stipple, with under-eye, nasolabial lines, and highlighted their jaws,” she adds.Chhichhore chronicles the life of seven friends from 1992 to the present day and is inspired by Nitesh’s own college days.
