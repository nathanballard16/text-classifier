Shopper walks backwards waiting for mall lift - and plummets straight down hole

This is the moment a customer fell into a gaping hole in the floor of a shopping mall.

He fails to notice that there is a huge hole right behind him and almost inevitably falls into it.

The man fell from the ground floor to the basement and was injured during the bizarre incident in Surat, Gujarat, India.
