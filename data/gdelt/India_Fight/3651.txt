Honor View20 with 48MP AI camera launched in India: All you need to know

After weeks of teasing, Huawei subsidiary Honor finally pulled the wraps off the new Honor View20 in Gurugram on January 29.

The company claims that the new Honor View20 is the world's first phone to boast 48MP rear shooter with Sony IMX586 sensor and TOF (Time of Flight) 3D camera. They are coupled with the Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing power which is capable of recognising over 60 categories and 1500 scenarios in real time and graphics processing power enabled by the dual-ISP and dual-NPU of Kirin 980 AI chipset, can provide users with unmatched photo quality and clarity. It is also capable of capturing slow-motion videos at 960 fps (frames per seconds).

On the front, Honor View20 houses a 25MP front snapper with F2.0 aperture and thanks to AI, it can also detect background and set the scene mode to optimise the camera to capture the best possible selfies.

Another notable aspect of the Honor View20 is its screen. It boasts All-view display with world-first, in-screen front camera design. Honor achieved this marvellous feat by using an advanced 18-layer technology stack method that carefully embeds the front camera in the display area of the screen, achieving the screen to body ratio of 91.8-percent.

It also runs Android Pie-based Magic 2.0 UI, which is said to be different from EMUI we see in other Honor devices. boasts 4,000mAh battery, which is more than enough to keep the phone running for a whole day under mixed usage.

Honor also unveiled feature-rich Honor Watch Magic, Band 4 and Band 4 smart fitness bands in India. They come with several health tracking features and more.
