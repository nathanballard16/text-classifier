Pakistan hands over captured fighter pilot to India

In a video message aired on Pakistani television channels, Varthaman was seen in his green flight suit saying he was rescued by two Pakistani military personnel when he ejected and found himself in Pakistani controlled Kashmir surrounded by a small mob of seemingly angry residents. It wasn't clear when he recorded this statement, but it was clearly while he was in the custody of the Pakistan military.
