Indian Traders Want to Burn Chinese Goods Due to ‘Proximity With Pakistan’

The statement was echoed by Ashwani Mahajan, a leader of the Swadeshi Jagran Manch organisation with close ties to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Mahajan invoked a call by the “Father of the Nation” Mahatma Gandhi to boycott Chinese products.

“Taking a cue from history, best way to defeat China is #BoycottChinese and strong action from govt on trade front,” Mahajan tweeted, posting an image of a newspaper ad dating back to 1921, which urged people to burn foreign-made clothes as part of a Gandhi-led protest against British colonial rule.

Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, for his part, warned against jumping to conclusions, saying that “it’s a diplomatic issue", and that "India will take a decision after a careful thought".

“We’re not a small player on the global stage, but foreign policy issues are tackled in a measured way, not in a knee-jerk manner”, he pointed out.
