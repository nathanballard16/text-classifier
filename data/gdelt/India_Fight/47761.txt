Priyanka Chopra and Hina Khan’s social media banter as Hina praises PeeCee for The Sky Is Pink cannot go amiss

That Hina Khan made her red carpet debut at the 72nd Cannes Film Festival is known to all and besides all the paparazzi and media glare, for us, one of the major highlights of the festival was Hina Khan’s bond with Priyanka Chopra. That’s right! Since PeeCee and Hina Khan, both were present at the Cannes Film Festival, Priyanka invited Hina Khan for a party and Hina took to social media to thank Priyanka Chopra and posted photos with Priyanka and Nick Jonas as they all bonded at the French Rivera.



On Priyanka Chopra’s birthday, Hina Khan had penned a birthday wish for PeeCee and The Sky Is Pink actress was sweet enough to thank Hina for the love. And today, it so happened that Hina Khan, after watching Shonali Bose’s The Sky Is Pink, took to Instagram to post a picture of PeeCee from the film and hailed her performance as she wrote, “You Killed it”, and Priyanka didn’t let it go unnoticed as she left a heart emoticon for Hina, and Hina posted her social media banter with PeeCee and wrote, “A lil show off. Love you PeeCee.”



On the work front, while PeeCee has jetted off to USA post the release of the film, Hina Khan recently wrapped up the Mumbai shooting of Vikram Bhatt’s Hacked and next, she will head to Lucknow to shoot for the film.
