Deepika Padukone's Chhapaak will be 'a slap on the face' of my attacker, says Laxmi Agarwal

The Deepika Padukone-starring biopic on acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal has gone on floors and it's sent Agarwal on an emotional rollercoaster.

Speaking to India Today, the activist said that she's in awe of the fact that a film is being made on her struggle and campaigning efforts:

"I have never won a medal in school. Who would have thought about a biopic being made on me? I am thankful to [director] Meghna ji for considering my work worthy enough to be converted into a film."

Agarwal is confident that the film will be "a tight slap on that attacker who thought he has ruined my life and to the society who looked at me like a criminal."

She further said, "I am also elated that a celebrity like Deepika is playing me" and that the actor's Chhapaak first look inspired a trend on social media.

“I saw a lot of makeup artists on social media recreating Deepika's look from the film. Unhone vaisa makeup karke apni photos mujhe bheji hui hain. Kabhi socha nahi tha ki ek acid-attack survivor ke face ko bhi log recreate karenge. [They've done makeup like hers and sent me photos. I could have never imagined that people would want to recreate the face of an acid attack survivor.]”

This week, a video from the Chhapaak sets was leaked, in which Deepika was seen in the uniform of a school-going girl.

The film's Delhi shoot schedule has been concluded. It is expected to release on January 10, 2020.
