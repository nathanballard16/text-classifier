Man 'taunted wife about not having baby'

A Sydney man accused of burning his wife to death would taunt her because she couldn't have a baby, her sister has told his murder trial.

Gurvinder Kaur said when her sister visited the family in India she had a bruise on her thigh and her stomach and revealed that her husband had kicked her in the belly.

Kulwinder Singh, 41, has pleaded not guilty in the NSW Supreme Court to murdering his wife Parwinder Kaur, 32, in December 2013.

She sustained burns to 90 per cent of her body in the petrol-fuelled blaze at their Rouse Hill home.

The Crown alleges Singh was responsible for her death, but he told police "she did it to herself" while he was upstairs.

Under cross-examination on Thursday, Ms Kaur denied making up her evidence that she had seen bruises on her sister, that they were caused by her husband and that he also swore at her.

"I suggest she never told you she was taunted by this man's family or Kulwinder Singh about not having a baby," his barrister, Margaret Cunneen SC, said.

"My sister was always taunted in that house, in both houses," Ms Kaur replied, speaking through a Punjabi interpreter.

The sisters' father, Jagat Singh, told the jury he and his wife visited their daughter Parwinder and her husband in Sydney in October 2013.

On their departure date, he saw Singh "holding her arm and pulling it and swearing".

She did not go to the airport to see them off.

"She wanted to come but wasn't let by Kulwinder," he said, speaking through a Punjabi interpreter.

Ms Cunneen showed Mr Singh a 2013 photo which she said showed the "pleasantness" between him and his son-in-law, but Mr Singh denied that the photo depicted his son-in-law.

She also presented a document which she said showed Singh had sent money to his father-in-law in India.

"I don't need money. I have enough money," he replied.

The trail is continuing.
