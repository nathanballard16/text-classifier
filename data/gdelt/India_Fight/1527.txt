Pakistan Should Be the Last Country to Lecture India - Foreign Ministry

India came down heavily on Pakistan after Prime Minister Imran Khan commented on the situation of minorities living in India. Earlier, the Pakistani PM cited Indian actor Naseeruddin Shah's concerns over the the killing of a policeman by a mob in Bulandshahr over cow slaughter allegations.

"Pakistan said that minorities are not treated well in India, I think Pakistan should be the last country to lecture us on plurality and inclusive society. We and the world are fully aware of the situation of minorities in their country," spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said during Friday's weekly briefing.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan earlier commented that Pakistan treats minorities as equal citizens, while the same is not true for India. The Indian government has also repeatedly slammed Pakistan's alleged double standards in dealing with terrorism.
