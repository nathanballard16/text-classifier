Four states in North India including Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab and Haryana have been badly hit by the spread of H1N1 virus, with the latest data indicating a major outbreak of swine flu. That is at least five times higher than what was seen last year.As of Thursday, the 6,701 people have been diagnosed with swine flu with 226 reported deaths in the four states, Hindustan Times reported citing data from National Centre for Disease Control.

Only one death has been reported in Delhi so far.

As of now, 16 people have reportedly died, and 113 diagnosed, according to Hindustan Times. Himachal Pradesh Assembly Speaker Rajeev Bindal was been diagnosed positive for swine flu on Thursday.Medical experts believe that the H1N1 virus can attack every alternate year and people with low immunity are the most vulnerable. Long winters in northern parts of India may have helped the virus to live longer, thus spreading the disease, say experts.India’s government has issued an advisory to all the states directing them to step up efforts to combat the epidemic.H1N1 is an airborne viral disease that can spread through coughing and sneezing and even indirect contact like touching a contaminated object or surface such as door knobs, cell phones and computers."The symptoms include fever and cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, difficulty in breathing. Other symptoms may include body aches, headache, fatigue, chills, diarrhea and vomiting, and blood-stained sputum," the government advisory said, adding that children and elderly with weak immunity are more at risk.( With IANS inputs)
