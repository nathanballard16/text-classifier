Sheena Bora murder case: Indrani Mukerjea's bail plea rejected

A special CBI court in Mumbai has rejected a petition filed by Indrani Mukerjea, who is imprisoned for alleged role in her daughter Sheena Bora's murder, seeking bail citing deteriorating health.

This was her fourth bail plea which has been rejected by the court.

In 2012, Indrani along with Peter and her former husband Sanjeev Khanna allegedly murdered Sheena over a financial dispute.

The alleged crime was uncovered three years later in 2015.

Indrani came to the notice of police after her driver, Shyamvar Rai, who was arrested in another case in August 2015, revealed the murder plot.

The police then arrested Indrani, Khanna and the driver for the alleged murder. Peter was put behind bars later for allegedly being involved in the murder. Peter and Indrani are now divorced.
