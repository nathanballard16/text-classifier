Woman found murdered in Meharban village field

Ludhiana: Panic gripped Kaneja village of Meharban after a woman was found murdered in a field on Friday morning.

A worker spotted the body when he went to the farm around 7.30am. As he raised the alarm, villagers gathered at the spot and called up the police.

Assistant commissioner of police (ACP East) Devinder Chaudhary said, “It seems the woman was strangulated to death as there are injury marks on her neck. She appears to be about 22-year-old and a migrant.”

Even as the cops showed pictures of the woman to residents of the village and nearby areas, they could not establish her identity.

“We have sent her pictures to other police stations, too, to identify her. The body will be kept in the civil hospital for 72 hours. We are scanning the footage of CCTV cameras installed in and around the area to find clues,” the ACP added.

Police suspect the woman was murdered somewhere else and her body dumped here. On whether she was sexually assaulted, the ACP said, “It cannot be ruled out. The post-mortem report will make things clear.”

“Sunil Kumar Ahuja, a village resident, owns the field. The body was first spotted by his employee, Walait Singh, when he reported to work,” said a villager.

Avtar Singh, the village sarpanch, said, “The farm is near my house. On learning about the incident, I rushed there and sounded the police. The cops have circulated her pictures among other village heads, too.”

Handiwork of one person?

The police suspect the murder to be the handiwork of one person. “Her body was dumped in the field, which is merely 5 feet from the main Rahon Road. While the accused was dragging the body, it seems, it got stuck in the barbed wire around the farm as a hairband, hair strands and a piece of her shirt were found entangled in it. Had there been more than one accused, they would have taken the body a little further,” said a cop.
