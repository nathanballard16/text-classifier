‘Terrorists, their mentors will not be spared’

Goyal says CRPF jawans’ supreme sacrifice will not go in vain

The Narendra Modi-led government, which gave complete freedom to the armed forces in taking punitive action against terrorists, will never spare terrorists and those sheltering them, Union Minister for Railways and Coal Piyush Goyal has said.

Addressing a function organised here on Monday to mark the dedication of a thermal power station jointly established by Neyveli Lignite Corporation and Tangedco, Mr. Goyal said the supreme sacrifice made by 40 CRPF jawans, including two from Tamil Nadu, at Pulwama would not go in vain as the Modi-led government would continue to avenge the dastardly attack.

Terrorists and those who were harbouring them should be extremely cautious as India would not spare them. The big round of applause made here (at the function venue) should be heard in Delhi and it should be a warning to terrorists and their mentors, Mr. Goyal said.

Accepting a plea from his ministerial colleague Pon. Radhakrishnan, Mr. Goyal announced the extension of Tambaram– Tirunelveli Antyodaya Express up to Nagercoil from March 5. Mr. Goyal also announced that this express would stop at Kovilpatti following an appeal from State Minister for Information ‘Kadambur’ C. Raju.

Earlier, speaking to reporters at Thoothukudi airport, the Union Minister came down heavily on former Finance Minister P. Chidambaram for having reportedly demanded proof for the terrorists killed in the recent air raids on their camps in Pakistan.

“By raising such questions, they (Opposition parties) are suspecting the valour and supreme sacrifice of our armed forces. It shows that they believe what Pakistan is telling. It’s highly condemnable,” he said.

Mr. Goyal predicted a resounding victory for AIADMK–BJP combine candidates in the Lok Sabha polls.
