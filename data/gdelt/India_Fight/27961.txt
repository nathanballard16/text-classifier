NEW DELHI, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An activist of hardline Hindu nationalist Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) was stabbed to death Thursday by unknown persons in eastern Indian state of West Bengal, police said.

The 52-year-old Sunil Mandal was attacked in Pandugram village of East Bardhaman district, about 160 km north of Kolkata, the capital city of West Bengal.

"This afternoon a person identified as Sunil Mandal was killed by a sharp edged weapon," a police official posted in East Bardhaman said.

BJP in West Bengal alleged Mandal was killed by workers affiliated with ruling All India Trinamool Congress (TMC).

"Sunil Mandal, a BJP worker from Ketugram has been brutally murdered by TMC goons. People of West Bengal rejected Mamta's (Mamata Banerjee) brand of violent politics but she has refused to change and her goons continue their murdering spree," reads a statement posted on twitter by BJP in West Bengal.

According to locals Mandal was putting up BJP flags to celebrate the Narendra Modi's swearing-in ceremony scheduled Thursday evening, when he was attacked.

Police officials said they have registered a case and ordered investigations into the incident.

Post-poll clashes erupted across West Bengal and state witnessed large-scale violence following confrontation between the workers of ruling TMC and BJP.

BJP under the leadership of Modi registered a spectacular victory by winning 303 seats at its own and together with its allies of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) it has strength of 353 lawmakers out of the total 542 in the Indian parliament.
