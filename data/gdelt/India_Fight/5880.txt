New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday condemned the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district. In one of the worst terror strikes in Jammu and Kashmir in recent years, at least 30 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in Pulwama district when a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into the bus they were travelling in.

Over 2,500 CRPF personnel were travelling in the convoy of 78 vehicles from the transit camp in Jammu to Srinagar when they were ambushed on the Srinagar-Jammu highway at Latoomode in Awantipora.

Condemning the attack, the PM said the "sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain", adding the whole nation "stands shoulder to shoulder with the families of the brave martyrs".

He added that he has spoken to Home Minister Rajnath Singh regarding the situation.

Taking to Twitter, PM Modi said: "Attack on CRPF personnel in Pulwama is despicable. I strongly condemn this dastardly attack. The sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain. The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the families of the brave martyrs. May the injured recover quickly," tweeted the PM.

"Spoke to Home Minister Rajnath Singh Ji and other top officials regarding the situation in the wake of the attack in Pulwama."

The Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) militant group has claimed responsibly for the audacious attack. In a statement to a local news agency GNS, a caller claiming to a JeM spokesman said it was a 'fidayeen' attack. As per the Jammu and Kashmir Police, the terrorist who was driving the suicide vehicle has been identified as Adil Ahmad from Kakapora (Pulwama) who joined the terrorist organisation in 2018.
