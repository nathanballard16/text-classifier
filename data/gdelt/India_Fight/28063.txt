Did not book extras from Hrithik Roshan film as terrorists, says Mumbai Police

The Mumbai Police has denied booking two individuals in Vasai, allegedly dressed as terrorists in the vicinity of the sets of Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff's film. Certain sections of the press reported on Wednesday that Mumbai Police, after an hour-long search operation, had arrested two terrorist suspects.

However, the alleged suspects later, were identified as extras from the sets of the film.

The Mumbai Police, however, has categorically dismissed such reports with a fell tweet on their official account that read, "Mumbai Police has not picked up any such persons. Kindly verify facts."

Twitter, in fact, is pretty much upset with such reports after being made aware of the fact that Mumbai Police had no role in the story. We spotted some angry responses on the thread.

Sample these:

The individuals, Balram Ginwala, 23, and Arbaaz Khan, 20, were shooting in the Palghar district during the reported incident.

Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff co-star in an action film, which is being directed by Siddharth Anand.
