Chourasia and his son Somesh were attacked in Hata town in the district by the group whose members were armed with iron rods and wooden sticks, he said.

The incident led to tension in Hata where shops were shut as soon as the of his death spread, the official said.

Chourasia and his son were injured in the attack and rushed to Jabalpur in serious condition, but the 54-year-old politician died before reaching hospital, said Damoh district Superintendent of Police Raghvendra Singh Belvanshi.

Police have registered a case under relevant sections of the IPC against seven persons, including Govind Singh (the husband of MLA Ram Bai), his relatives and associates, said Belvanshi.

They were booked on charges like murder, attempt to murder, criminal intimidation and voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means, among others, the SP said.

The accused persons will be arrested soon, he said, adding heavy police force was deployed in the town to main law and order.
