PM Narendra Modi made India ‘corruption free’: Yogi Adityanath

Inaugurating and laying the foundation stone of projects worth Rs 131 crore in Maharajganj district, Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath claimed that Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi made India “corruption-free”.

Adityanath praised the soldiers and said: “Terrorists don’t understand the language of love, so Indian soldiers did ‘Shiv Tandav’ with surgical strike.”



“Actually, a lot of terrorists were killed during surgical strike but Pakistan is hiding the facts,” he claimed at an event on Monday.

Giving a remark of criticism, he said: “The Modi government started several welfare schemes for poor and realised the dream of corruption-free India.” He also directed the officials to complete all development tasks of the state as soon as possible.

The Chief Minister later visited Deoria to inaugurate and lay foundation stone of projects worth Rs 71 crore. He said if Mr. Modi comes into power for five more years, India would be among the three big economies in the world.

“During Congress regime, India stood at number 11 in respect to economy (in the world), but during the Modi government, it rose to the sixth position… After return to power, he will bring it to number 3 slot,” he said.

Describing Nepal as a friend country, Adityanath said: “We are working on roads construction at Indo-Nepal border.”
