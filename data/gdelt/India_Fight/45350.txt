Gujarat man donates Rs 3 lakh for slain J&K cops’ kin

SRINAGAR: A businessman from Gujarat ’s Kutch region has donated Rs 1.5 lakh each to the families of two young Kashmiri policemen — Ghulam Mustafa and Naseer Ahmad — who died fighting Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists on March 1 in the Valley.J&K DGP Dilbagh Singh said the donation by Dinesh Gupta (58), who runs a logistics business at Gandhidham, was the first known contribution by an individual from outside the Valley towards the family of any Kashmiri cop killed in the line of duty.Gupta’s generosity has inspired the kin of the slain policemen to rethink about their young family members joining the force. “I forbade my daughter-in-law from sending any of my grandchildren to the force, as I didn’t want another death in the family. But this gesture has reinforced the thought that brotherhood and sacrifices are an important part of our lives,” said Raza Begum, Naseer’s mother.Touched by Gupta’s generosity, DGP Singh said J&K Police would felicitate him.
