Pakistan Warns India of 'Consequences' as New Delhi Hints at Potential Cross-Border 'Anti-Terror Op'

The media wing of the Pakistan Armed Forces, ISPR, claimed on Tuesday that India is trying to divert world's attention away from the situation of Kashmir, which was stripped of its special status in August.

"Accusations of infiltration/presence of alleged terrorists camps are pretext for a false flag operation/misadventure which if tried shall have serious consequences for regional peace Pak Armed Forces are fully prepared to respond to any aggression/misadventure regardless of cost," it said.

Indian army chief General Bipin Rawat on Monday claimed Pakistan had reactivated a terror camp in the Balakot area of that country’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province, and that around 500 terrorists have been positioned to infiltrate the border to spread violence in India.
