FIRST LOOK: SUZUKI GIXXER SF 250

NEW DELHI: Taking a cue from MotoGP circuit experience, Japanese two-wheeler manufacturer Suzuki rolled out two fully-faired units in India, the Gixxer SF 250 and updated Gixxer SF 155, on Monday at Rs 1,70,655 and Rs 1,0,870(ex-showroom, Delhi) respectively.The fairing in the front fascia renders a bold and muscular look to the Gixxer SF 250. The sports-cum-touring bike gets LED lights in the headlamp and tail cluster and is set up with digital instrument cluster and clip-on handlebars. Stubby exhaust with twin muffler, stepped seat and split grab rails give the bike a decent rear look. The Gixxer SF 250 is available in metallic matte black and metallic matte platinum silver colour schemes.A quarter-litre, single cylinder, fuel-injected, oil-cooled (Suzuki oil cooling system) unit is offered in Gixxer SF 250 that generates 26.5 PS of power at 9,000 rpm and 22.6 Nm of torque at 7,500 rpm. The engine is mated to a six-speed gearbox. The cycle parts are telescopic forks units upfront and mono shock at the rear. Disc brakes at both the ends with standard dual-channel ABS (anti-lock braking system) would ensure the braking duties. Tipping at 161 kg, the bike is shod with 110/70R and 150/60R radial tubeless tires at the front and rear respectively.The Gixxer SF continues to be powered by the same 155-cc single cylinder air-cooled engine that churns out 14.1 PS at 8,000 rpm and 14Nm of torque at 6,000 rpm. The fuel injected engine is linked to the 5-speed gearbox.The Gixxer SF would be available in glass sparkle black and metallic sonic silver colour tones. Updates features in the built include SC socket for charging, smoked visor, a graphic on the tank and clip-on handlebars.The Yamaha Fazer 250, Honda CBR250R and KTM Duke 250 would provide a cut-throat competition to Gixxer SF 250. The smaller offering of the two, the Gixxer SF would lock horns with the Hero Xtreme 200S and TVS Apache 4V RTR200.
