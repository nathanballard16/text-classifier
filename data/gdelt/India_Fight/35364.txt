Maha cops arrest 2 persons from Indore for call centre racket

Thane police in Maharashtra raided a call centre in Indore in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh and arrested two persons for allegedly duping people through promises of high returns on share market investments, an official said Saturday.

Thane Additional Commissioner of Police (West) Anil Kumbhare said the raid was carried out after a local resident filed a complaint in Kalwa police station here in June that he had been duped of Rs 2.16 lakh.

"He was contacted over phone by those operating this call centre and asked to invest in the share market through them. He was promised higher returns. However, once the money was transferred by the victim, the accused stopped taking his calls," Kumbhare said.

A probe zeroed in on Indore as the location of the calls and a Thane police team raided a call centre there, the official informed.

He identified the arrested accused as Arvind Chouhan (26) and Tapesh Sharma (22).

"Both were arrested on Thursday. We've seized 59 hard disks, 26 wireless phones, four other phones. Preliminary probe has revealed the accused might have duped people of over Rs 1 crore," Kumbhare said.
