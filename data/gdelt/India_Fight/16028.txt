Delhi Crime: Shefali Shah talks about the most harrowing scene that left her in tears

Sehfali Shah will soon be seen in Netflix's Delhi Crime, a web series based on the Nirbhaya rape case. The series directed by Indo-Canadian filmmaker Richie Mehta, is all set to begin streaming from March 22 on Netflix. The seven-part anthology series stars Shefali Shah, Rasika Dugal, Rajesh Tailang, Adil Hussain, Anurag Arora, Gopal Datt, and Vinod Sherawat in pivotal roles.

Recently, Shefali Shah who plays deputy commissioner of police Vartika Chaturvedi talked about the most difficult scene that she shot for Delhi Crime. The scene is featured in the very first episode of the series when Vartika gets the details about the case from the doctors and instructs her team outside the hospital so that they can nab the culprits as soon as possible.

Shefali Shah said, "There is one particular scene which was harrowing for me. I didn't want to start doing it. Even before it started I wanted to end it. The scene where she gives instructions and it is cut here (in the series) but when it was shot, it was of 12 pages. Before the scene, I was sitting in the vanity van, in the loo on the floor and bawling because I was like I can't do this. I just can't do it. When I was on set I kept begging, 'Please send the actors back because I am making a fool of myself in front of them.'"

Shefali Shah elaborated on why the scene was so grueling for her. "The scene was difficult because it was not one superfluous line of thought. She is instructing do this, do that and tick marking all the pointers there. She is working on multiple levels there. And then there is a momentit's a very little moment where you see the almost human side of Vartika, where she comes out for a moment and says 'It's not just heinous, it's insanity.' That was not an easy one for me to do. It took a lot out of me," she added.
