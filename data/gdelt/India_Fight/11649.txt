New pictures of Pulkit Samrat and rumoured ladylove Kriti Kharbanda spark dating rumours

Speculations are rife that Pulkit Samrat and Kriti Kharbanda are dating. Actor Pulkit, who was reportedly in a relationship with Yami Gautam, has found love again. Rumours began doing the rounds when Pulkit and Kriti were spotted together at Varun Sharma’s birthday party. There were also reports that Kriti surprised Pulkit on his birthday by visiting him in Chennai. Pulkit and Kriti, who were last seen together in ‘Veerey Ki Wedding’, are shooting for ‘Pagalpanti’. Talking about rumours, Pulkit said, “Yami ke saath, Kriti ke saath... I don’t pay too much heed to these kinds of articles. They are part and parcel of the business. My affair is with one person — Varun Sharma. Nobody is writing about it — I’ve done two films with him! My focus is only on work. I would rather be written about for that.” According to new reports, Kriti has now shifted to Pulkit’s building as the couple wants to spend quality time together. Kriti also once spoke about her thoughts on love and wedding and said, “I am all for love marriage. I am not the kind of person who can be instructed to fall in love. I am not saying that it cannot happen. Most of my family members met the person and decided to get married. Their marriages have worked beautifully. I am a little more than that as I believe in love and companionship.” (All photos: Instagram)
