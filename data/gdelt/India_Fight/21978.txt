Keenan-Reuben murder case: Accused gets furlough; parents of the deceased ask for police protection

Keenan's father stated that he was demanding police protection especially for the witnesses.

Mumbai: A new development has been made in the Keenan-Reuben murder case. The families of the two deceased have urged the police to give them protection. The families asked for protection after the accused in the case, Jitendra Rana was granted furlough.

Last year, the key eyewitness of the case was found dead in Andheri East. The witness, Avinash Solanki was allegedly stabbed to death. The accused, Rana has been granted furlough by the Bombay High Court for 14 days.

While speaking to Mirror Now, Valerian Santos, Keenan's father stated that he was demanding police protection especially for the witnesses. While he thanked the witnesses for standing by their side, he also stated that it is a part of his duties to keep them protected.

Santos stated that he had written to the police asking for the protection of the witnesses. He also stated that though the accused, Jitendra Rana had threatened him initially, he was not scared for himself. The families of the deceased are concerned about the fact that the accused might jump the furlough and be a threat to them.

The incident took place in 2011. The two deceased were Keenan Santos and Reuben Fernandez. The two deceased allegedly lost their lives while fighting eve-teasers. The two deceased were dining with their friends when some people present at the restaurant passed lewd comments at the woman accompanying them.

The two deceased were stabbed to death outside the Amboli Bar and Kitchen restaurant. While Keenan passed away on the spot, Reuben succumbed to his injuries days after. The Special Women's Court pronounced all the four accused guilty and awarded life imprisonment to them.
