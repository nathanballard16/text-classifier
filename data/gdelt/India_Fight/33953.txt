AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal claims he was shot at

AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal said an illicit liquor distributor of south Delhi has allegedly shot at him in Sangam Vihar area on Wednesday.

Jarwal claimed that he went to Shani Vihar area to inaugurate a water pipeline where one Rajesh Shasi allegedly fired three rounds at him. "Following the incident, I have immediately called PCR. The alleged person has also threatened me with dire consequences," Jarwal told the media persons.

The incident has created chaos in the area and Jarwal immediately left the place. The AAP MLA also claimed that Shasi has been chasing him for the last few days.

"Some goons attacked me on Sunday and the incident was reported to the police but no action was taken so far. My life is in danger and I have sought for police protection," Jarwal said.

Meanwhile, south Delhi's DCP Vijay Kumar denied any firing incident in the area. "We have checked the CCTV cameras of the area but not found any proof of the claim," he said.

Soon after the incident, Shasi also told the media and denied all allegations made by Jarwal. "No firing incident took place in the area. He has framed me and I will challenge his claim in court and file defamation suit against him," Shasi said.

Jarwal came into lime light last year when chief secretary Anshu Prakash levelled allegations against him for allegedly assaulting him at the CM residence.
