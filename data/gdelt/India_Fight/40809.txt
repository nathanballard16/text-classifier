17 tourists on way to visit Statue of Unity hurt in accident

Seventeen tourists on way to visit the Statue of Unity in Gujarat's Narmada district were injured on Saturday, three of them seriously, when the bus they were travelling in was rammed from side by another bus, an official said.

One of the injured, Kinniben Patel (18) was first referred to a private hospital in Vadodara from where she was flown to Ahmedabad in a helicopter belonging to the Statue of Unity authority, the official said, adding that the incident occurred when the tourist bus was taking a U-turn, around two kms away from the world's tallest statue.

"Six tourists were admitted in different hospitals in Vadodara for treatment. One tourist, Gordhanbhai Hirani, who suffered injuries to his eyes was shifted to hospital in Ahmedabad," Narmada district collector and chief administrator of Statue of Unity, I K Patel said.

He said rest of the injured persons were taken to a local community health centre at Garudeshwar where they were given primary treatment before being discharged.

He said the Statue of Unity authority will bear the entire cost of treatment for the injured tourists.
