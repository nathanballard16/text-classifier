Gujarat: Mercury shoots up by 5 degree C in a day

There was finally some relief on Monday from the intense cold that had gripped the city. In the last 24 hours, the city has experienced a major change in temperature. Night temperatures which hovered around 12-13 degrees until Saturday, rose to 17 degrees Celsius on Sunday night, states the Met department.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), in the coming days, temperatures are likely to increase by 2 to 3 degree Celsius. However, the increase will only last for the next two to three days, after which, there will be a decrease again, during the weekend.

The sudden change in weather is attributed to a change in the wind pattern. Earlier, northeasterly winds were blowing across the state, which were cold. Now, easterly to south-easterly winds are blowing across the state, which are humid and warm in nature. This may cause partly cloudy weather.

There is a western disturbance in north Pakistan which may result in scattered rains in the Saurashtra region over the coming two da-ys. It will remain partly clou-dy across the state due to the effect of the western disturbance. On Tuesday, partly cloudy skies are expected in Ahmedabad. The maximum temperature is expected to remain around 29 degree Celsius while the minimum temperature co-uld be around 16 degree Celsius.

On Monday, the maximum temperature in the city was recorded at 28.2 degree Celsius, a degree below normal, while the minimum temperature was 17.6 degree Celsius, five degrees above normal.

Night temperatures rose appreciably across parts of Gujarat, Saurashtra and Kutch.
