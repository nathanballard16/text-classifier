Indian security forces are fully prepared, says Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on reactivation of terror camps at Balakot

Chennai, Sep 25 (UNI) Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Wednesday said the Indian security forces were fully prepared to face any challenges from across the border.

Asked about Chief of Army Staff Bipin Rawat's assertion that Pakistan has reactivated its terror camps at Balakot, which was destroyed by India in a surgical strike in February after the terror attack at a CRPF camp in Pulwama, Rajnath Singh said the Indian security forces were fully prepared to meet the situation.

“Don’t worry our security forces are fully prepared,” he told reporters after commissioning the ICG Ship Varaha, at the Chennai Port Trust.

Gen Rawat had on Monday told reporters at OTA here that Pakistan has very recently 'reactivated' its terror camp in Balakot and sounded a warning to its neighbour that India's response might be even beyond its response to Balakot.

Stating that about 500 infiltrators were waiting to infiltrate into India from across the border, he said the Army has pushed in more troops along the LoC.

Asserting that the Indian Army was prepared to the challenge, he strongly indicated that India’s response might be similar to that of Balakot or “even beyond”.

"Pakistan violates ceasefire to push terrorists into our territory. We know how to deal with the ceasefire violations. Our troops know how to position themselves and take action. We are alert and will ensure that maximum infiltration bids are foiled."

Asked whether there would be a repeat of India’s reaction like in Balakot, he shot back “Why repeat? Why not beyond that? Let them keep guessing.”
