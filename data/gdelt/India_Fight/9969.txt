All parties vow to end terrorism

New Delhi: Leaders of different political parties congratulated the Indian Air Force (IAF) at an all-party meeting called by External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, to explain about the air strikes conducted on terrorist training camps situated across the Line of Control (LoC) during the early hours of Tuesday.

The Congress said that it will support security forces in their endeavour to stop terroist attacks in India.

Ms Swaraj briefed the leaders including Congress’ Ghulam Nabi Azad, CPI(M)’s Sitaram Yechury, TMC’s Derek O’Brian, Omar Abdullah of National Conference and Bhartruhari Mahtab from BJD.

Union ministers Rajnath Singh and Arun Jaitley, also members of the Cabinet Committee on Security like Ms Swaraj, were also present in the meeting.

Mr Azad later told reporters that political parties lauded the IAF’s strikes in a “clean” operation as there were no civilian casualties.

“We will support our security forces in their endeavour to stop terrorism in India from outside,” he said.

NCP’s Praful Patel, BSP’s Satish Mishra and BJP ally Ramdas Athawale also attended the meeting.

Earlier in a swift and precise air strike, India bombed and destroyed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest training camp in Pakistan, killing many terrorists.

The action came almost two weeks after the Pulwama attacks where over 40 CRPF personnel were killed when an explosives-laden vehicle collided with their bus on February 14.

"I am happy that representatives of all parties unanimously congratulated the IAF. They also assured their support in the actions its taking against terrorism," Ms Swaraj said after the meeting.
