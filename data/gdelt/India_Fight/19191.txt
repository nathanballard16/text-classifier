What Mamata did in Bengal, same game is being played in MP: Shivraj Singh Chouhan on CPRF clash with police

In a high-level drama, CRPF personnel accompanying IT officials conducting raids at the premises of Ashwin Sharma linked to Chief Minister Kamal Nath clashed with the state police in scenes, which evoked memories of the face-off between Kolkata police and CBI earlier this year.

In a high-level drama, CRPF personnel accompanying IT officials conducting raids at the premises of Ashwin Sharma linked to Chief Minister Kamal Nath clashed with the state police in scenes, which evoked memories of the face-off between Kolkata police and CBI earlier this year.



Madhya Pradesh police personnel alleged that people inside the housing complex of Sharma, an associate of Praveen Kakkar, who is Kamal Nath's officer on special duty (OSD) had reached out to the Station House Officer (SHO) of the area seeking assistance.



Reacting, former Madhya Pradesh CM SS Chouhan said: “ I-T dept is doing its work, it's their constitutional right. CRPF soldiers were on duty, they were being stopped; MP Police clashed with CRPF. What Mamata ji did in Bengal, the same game is being played in MP. It's an attempt to save corrupts.”



He added: “Cash is being recovered, documents are found, properties are unearthed. I'm surprised that the Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh instead of cooperating, he is trying to stop the Income Tax department's proceedings.”
