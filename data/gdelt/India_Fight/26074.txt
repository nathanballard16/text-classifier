EC's flying squad raids home of Congress candidate's aide

Indore (Madhya Pradesh) [India], May 18 (ANI): A flying squad team (FST) of the Election Commission carried out a raid at the residence of an aide of Indore Congress candidate Pankaj Sanghvi here on Saturday.

The team carried out the raid after it was informed about blanket distribution at a flat in Maurya Residency in the city.

Kamlesh, a part of the squad, said, "We had got information about the blanket distribution. A team came here to inquire. The team recorded the statement of the people. They told us that they were there to get blankets."

The team, however, said that they were not aware of Jhanwar family's political affiliations.

"It was a case related to a Jhanwar family. Their party affiliation is not known," the officer said.

Another officer, Manoj, said: "We got the information that a political party was distributing blankets. We reached there and recorded the statements of the people who were present there."

Cabinet Minister Sajjan Singh Verma sought to downplay the raid and said that the family of the Congress candidate has always helped the needy.

"Pankan Singhvi family has been distributing blankets, clothes, and so on for long. They stood with the people in the time of the flood too," Singh said.

Indore along with seven other Lok Sabha seats of Madhya Pradesh will vote in the last leg of general polls on Sunday. The counting of votes will take place on May 23. (ANI)
