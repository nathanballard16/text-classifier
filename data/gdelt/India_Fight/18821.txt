Salman Khan diffuses tense situation during Dabangg 3 shoot

Mumbai: Superstar Salman Khan who has started shooting April 1 for the third episode of the ‘Dabangg ‘, has sported fresh controversy again. A video of the shoot of ‘Dabangg – 3’ which has gone viral showed Salman dancing on a set created atop a Shivling in Maheshwar Ghat of Madhya Pradesh. The video shot created a lot of resentment among the Hindus of the area.

Taking notice of Salman’s act, the BJP’s legislator and MP unit’s vice-president Rameshwar Sharma was about to file an FIR against the actor. Salman, however, put an end to the controversy by apologising and stating that he too is a ‘devotee of Lord Shiva’,

Salman informed that the film was to be shot in UP, but they decided to shift to MP because of a personal request by Chief Minister Kamal Nath. He had requested the producers to shoot the film in MP as it would help boost tourism in the state.

Meanwhile, Sonakshi Sinha expressed her happiness to be a part of the Dabangg team once again.”Being back with the ‘Dabangg 3’ team certainly feels like home because this is where I started. My life changed completely after ‘Dabangg’, it’s how I found my calling and it will always be most special to me. I cannot wait to begin its third installment.”
