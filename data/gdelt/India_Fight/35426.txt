Top cop wants 3 more police stns

Coimbatore: City police commissioner Sumit Sharan has requested senior officials to set up new police stations at Saravanampatti, Rathinapuri and Podanur for criminal investigation.

As of now, the city police have 15 law and order police stations at Big Bazaar Street, RS Puram, Variety Hall Road, Ukkadam, Kattoor, Race Course, Saibaba Colony, Rathinapuri, Singanallur, Peelamedu, Saravanampatti, Ramanathapuram, Selvapuram, Podanur and Kuniyamuthur manned by inspectors. But to investigate criminal cases like murder, burglary, robbery and chain snatching, the city police has only 13 stations.

Officers deputed as inspectors and sub-inspectors on temporary basis are in charge of criminal cases at Saravanampatti, Rathinapuri and Podanur stations.

Officers in Saravanampatti and Podanur stations have to manage vast areas. The number of criminal cases reported from the areas has also gone up considerably as they have witnessed development in the recent years. “We sent a proposal to director general of police (DGP) JK Tripathy requesting him to set up three police stations. We need more than 150 personnel including inspectors, sub-inspectors and other cadres to manage the three areas,” he said.

If the government sanctions the new stations, officers, who are currently investigating crimes there, will be posted at law&order police stations, Sharan added.
