YouTube Plans to Shut Down Its Toronto Creator Space Studio

"Given the size of the country and the fact that our creators are not all based in one city, we hope this new approach will help us to better connect with the unique communities of creators in every region," Swierszcz added.

The 3,500-square-foot facility of YouTube Space Toronto opened at George Brown College in the spring of 2016 amid a boom in the growth of the creator community. It was accessible to YouTube personalities with over 10,000 subscribers, with the time divided representatively to the popularity of the channels, helping with the equipment, workshops and space to hold launch parties.

The company also plans to close another YouTube Space in Mumbai, India, that operates on the grounds of a school, yet locations in other cities, including New York, London, Paris and Los Angeles will stay open.

According to Swierszcz, YouTube is looking into options for a different kind of permanent Toronto facility for local creators and "will have more to share very soon about a future home."
