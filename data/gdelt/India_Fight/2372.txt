According to police, the victim had befriended Kumar when she was working at the night club, where Kumar was employed as a bouncer. In March 2017, the victim had filed an FIR against Kumar, accusing him of raping her. Kumar was later arrested by Gurugram Police but he was granted bail by the court/

"On the statement of victim's mother, we have registered an FIR against Sandeep in DLF phase 1 Police Station. The accused, a resident of Tigaon in Faridabad, is at large," said Gurgaon Police PRO Subhash Bokan said.
