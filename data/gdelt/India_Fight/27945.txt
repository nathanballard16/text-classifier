According to reports, on May 27, Anil Mahajan, a bank watchman and ex- Border Security Force soldier, informed the police about spotting two people—who turned out to be actors Balram Ginwala and Arbaaz Khan—who looked like "bombers" roaming around in Mumbai.

The CCTV footage helped police identify the bus that the two men had boarded. Police found out that the bus was headed for a movie shoot and the suspects were side-actors.

Besides the actors, the movie's production unit in-charge was also booked by the police.

Despite the false alarm, however, police reportedly felicitated the security guard for his “alertness”.
