'Sooryavanshi': Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif kickstart Hyderabad schedule of Rohit Shetty's film with a romantic song

Akshay Kumar has been extensively shooting for his forthcoming film, Sooryavanshi from the past few weeks. The film which is directed by Rohit Shetty went on floors in Mumbai and then the team headed to Bangkok. Now, Akshay and Rohit are back in India and have headed to Hyderabad for a month-long schedule. They will be joined by none other than Katrina Kaif, who is the female lead of the film.

Katrina shot little for Sooryavanshi in Mumbai with Akshay and Neena Gupta. Now, for the Hyderabad schedule, the actors will be staying there for about a month to shoot for the major chunk for the film. Interestingly, the shooting in Hyderabad kickstarted with a romantic sequence between Akshay and Katrina. The latter will also be filming high-octane action sequences during the schedule.

Talking about it, a source stated to Mumbai Mirror, "This one is the film’s longest schedule. Rohit plans to wrap it up before he leaves for Bulgaria where he will shoot for the 10th season of the adventure-based reality show, Khatron Ke Khiladi, for around 45 days. Once back, Rohit will start filming the final schedule of Sooryavanshi in Goa with his lead actors and the antagonists—Gulshan Grover, Abhimanyu Singh and Nikitin Dheer."

The tabloid also reported that Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh are likely to have special appearances in Sooryavanshi. The actors along with Akshay are a part of Rohit's Cop Universe.

Meanwhile, the new release date for Sooryavanshi was announced recently and it's hitting the screens on March 27, 2020.
