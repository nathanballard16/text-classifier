Lawmakers fear for their lives in Mumbai, say rural areas safer

As the tension between India and Pakistan escalated on Wednesday, elected representatives who had come to Mumbai for state interim budget session fear their stay here.



According to these MLAs, MLCs, the rural areas are far safer, than Mumbai. "Mumbai is the financial capital and an international hub, so its likely to be targetted. Mumbai was attacked by terrorist a few years back too. Hence the rural areas are safer," said the elected representatives requesting anonymity.



"We are reading about the possibilities of war everyday. Our families are worried and concerned. They told us come back once the budget is tabled in the state assembly session," said senior ruling party MLA.



"Our Manora MLA hostel is being demolished so we are staying in hotel at Nariman Point. In last terrorist attack, Taj and Trident hotels were targeted." He further added that, "It's easy to sitback and talk about war, but it's always the common and soldiers who suffer the brunt. We should try to ease the tension between two neighbouring country," said Congress MLA requested anonymity.



Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis is likely to conclude the state assembly's interim budget session on February 28 rather than March 2 ahead of a security review that he undertook on Wednesday. It is also reasoned that 5 to 6 thousand police personnel would be available for beefing up the security apparatus in Mumbai.
