The actress will reportedly start the shooting from May 15 and then fly to London in June where a major part of the film will be shot.

Mumbai Mirror quoted a source saying, ''Kareena has started prep for Angrezi Medium. Since she’s playing a cop for the first time, she’s been discussing her character with director Homi Adajania. She will shoot in Mumbai for around a week before the team flies to London in June where a big chunk will be shot. She is not romantically paired with Irrfan but has an important role in the narrative.''
