Bulandshahr violence: Man who attacked Inspector Subodh Singh with axe arrested

In a fresh breakthrough in the Bulandshahr violence case, a key accused who allegedly attacked Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh with an axe was arrested at a bus stand by Uttar Pradesh Police on Monday night. The police recovered an axe, allegedly used in the attack, from his possession.

The arrest of Kalua takes the total number of accused held in this case to 30, a police officer said. According to the police, he was among the four men who are accused of first attacking Subodh Singh with an axe and then pelting stones at him as he ran across the field for cover.

Kalua told police that on December 3, he was felling a tree to block a road. When the inspector stopped him from doing so, he attacked him with an axe, the officer said.

“During interrogation, it was revealed that he was the person who attacked Inspector Subodh Kumar with an axe. The axe has been recovered from his possession; other accused persons will be arrested shortly,” Atul Kumar Srivastava, Additional SP City, told news agency ANI.

However, Bajrang Dal activist Yogesh Raj, who has been identified as the prime suspect in the killing, continues to evade arrest.

Last week, a Delhi taxi driver, Prashant Natt, was arrested for allegedly shooting Singh. Police claimed Natt took Singh’s revolver and shot him in the head. Natt (30), who was not named in the FIR registered, was arrested after he was seen in videos of the incident, which was corroborated with testimonies of other accused and technical evidence.

On December 3, Inspector Singh and a local youth Sumit Kumar were killed in mob violence near Siyana village during protests against alleged cow slaughter.
