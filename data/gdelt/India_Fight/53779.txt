Police have booked Amjad Pathan and Azgar Pathan for beating up Jayanti Bhati (27), a truck driver, on afternoon of November 26 near Green Palace hotel in Gandhidham.

According to case details, when Bhati was taking tea near the hotel, the accused duo came on a motorbike and started arguing with him. They asked Bhati as to why was he wearing a ‘pathani’ suit. Following a heated argument, one of the accused lifted the ‘pathani’ suit from behind and covered Bhati’s face and both of them beat him black and blue.

The accused duo threatened him saying, “You belong to lower caste and should not wear a pathani.” They further threatened to kill Bhati if he dared to wear a ‘pathani’ again.

After this incident, Bhati lodged a complaint with the A Division police station of Gandhidham on the same day, and left for his job. After returning, an FIR was lodged against the accused under SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocity) Act, assault and criminal intimidation. Both the accused are yet to be arrested.
