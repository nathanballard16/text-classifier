Prime Minister Narendra Modi was briefed about the security situation after Pakistan violated India’s air space and claimed to have shot down two IAF jets and arrested a pilot.

The IAF instead has said a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet was shot down in retaliatory fire 3km within Pakistan territory in Lam valley.

Meanwhile Home Minister Rajnath Singh today chaired a high level security meeting in New Delhi. Sources in the Ministry said, National Security Advisor, RAW Chief, Intelligence Bureau chief, Home Secretary and other senior officials attended the meeting.

The meeting assumes significance in the backdrop of pre-emptive air strikes yesterday on terror camps in Pakistan.

Officials said the Pakistani jets were pushed back by Indian aircraft and they dropped bombs while returning. There were no immediate reports of any casualties or damage.

Denying that its jet was shot down, Pakistan claims to have arrested an IAF pilot after bringing down two Indian military aircraft. Major General Asif Ghafoor, head of Pak military’s media wing, said the PAF strikes were after IAF crossed the Line of Control again on Wednesday. “PAF shot down two Indian aircraft inside Pakistani airspace. One of the aircraft fell inside AJ&K while other fell inside IOK. One Indian pilot arrested by troops on ground while two in the area,” he tweeted. However, India denied the claims and said all its pilots were accounted for.
