The increased sales would help shore up the business,” said Amit, a shopkeeper in Civil Lines.The slump in auto sector seemed to have little effect on the sale of vehicles (both two-wheelers and four-wheelers) during the festive season.People also splurged on gold, silver and diamond ornaments and utensils, as it is considered auspicious to buy metal on Dhanteras.Scores of customers were seen crowding shops selling jewellery, electronic goods and gadgets. The cherry on the cake was the attractive offers and discounts offered by shopkeepers on products. “This Dhanteras has undoubtedly brought smiles on the faces of traders, who had been hit by a slowdown,” said Azmat Siddqui, who owns a popular jewellery showroom in the city.“I didn’t buy an outfit and crackers for myself this year. Instead, I asked my father to buy me a laptop. We ended getting a good deal with several shops offering great discounts. It was worth the wait,” said Shashwat.However, buyers were trapped in traffic jams in several parts of the city till late Friday night. Roads leading up to ppopular markers like Civil Lines, Katra and Chowk were choked with vehicles and snarls.
