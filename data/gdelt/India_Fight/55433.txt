Congress Politician Rahul Gandhi's 'Rape in India' Remark Sparks Row in Parliament

The remark prompted a strong objection by lawmakers from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and a demand for an apology from Rahul Gandhi. The party accused him of insulting Indian women.

In parliament’s Lower House (Lok Sabha), Textile Minister and BJP lawmaker Smriti Irani, criticising Gandhi, said: “It’s happened for the first time in the history of India that a Gandhi family's son is saying 'come and rape women in India'".

“Rahul Gandhi should be punished for politically using women," she demanded.

Another lawmaker Kanimozhi, a politician from the Indian state of Tamil Nadu, defended Gandhi, saying that the Congress politician was only flagging his concern over the growing incidents of rape in India.

"The PM has always been saying it has to be Make in India so that India flourishes… what Rahul Gandhi said was that situation in India has changed," she added.

In the Upper House of Parliament, several lawmakers complained about Gandhi’s remark while refusing to heed the chair’s caution that taking the name of a person who was not a member of the House was against the rules.

Earlier on Friday, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Leader of main opposition party Congress in the Lok Sabha, raised the recent rape and murder of a 23-year-old woman in Uttar Pradesh.

Incidents of rape and murder have led to unprecedented protests across India of late, but have been most visible in New Delhi.

Last week, people took part in a candlelit march in New Delhi to demand justice for the families of rape victims from Hyderabad (Telangana state) and Unnao (Uttar Pradesh state).
