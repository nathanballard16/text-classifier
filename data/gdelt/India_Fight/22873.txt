Eyewitnesses said first a few temporary shops in the area became the victim of the fire that immediately spread in the 16 shops located in the A-Block. Continuing to move eastward, the fire then engulfed 20 shops under the shed and 10 others located on the sidewalk.

The biggest damage was incurred in shops numbered between 52 and 66 and between 144 and 146.

Fortunately, no one was said to be injured in the massive fire.

Seven fire trucks, four from Kankarbagh and three from Patna City, battled the flame for over three hours before getting full control of the situation.

Shop owners blamed the administration for not removing trash for days and threatened to go on a hunger strike on Monday if the government failed to compensate them for their loss.
