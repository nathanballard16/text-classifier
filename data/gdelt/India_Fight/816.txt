Hartal violence: Kozhikode police chief comes under flak

Kozhikode: The city police commissioner has come under fire in connection with the action taken in Kozhikode during the hartal day called by Sabarimala Karma Samithi to protest over the young women entry in Sabarimala. There are allegations that city police commissioner S Kaliraj Mahesh Kumar IPS was not vigilant enough while deploying police force despite being aware of the potential attack.

The police officers point out that the commissioner’s action paved way for hartal supporters to create chaos just like in North India and that his strategies were a failure. Even higher officers opined that the commissioner deployed the force in a way that allowed a small group of attackers to wreak havoc all over the city. Many policemen commented on the issue though they are likely to face disciplinary actions.

Meanwhile, the intelligence wing did not submit a report even after coming to know the lapses in the commissioner’s plans because the commissioner himself handles the special branch, it is learnt. It is considered as a serious lapse to allow both hartal supporters and the shop owners into SM street at the same time. The DGP had alerted the district police chiefs prior to the hartal.

An intelligence report had stated that attacks are likely to happen in Kozhikode city. But the commissioner deployed police force the usual way like in other hartals. 16 persons including women police officers were injured in the hartal. Two SIs, 11 civil police officers, 1 Grade SI, 1 senior civil police officer and a woman police were hospitalised.
