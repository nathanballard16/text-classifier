Soul-stirring tribute

Vengala Bhaskar pens a song in memory of Pulwama martyrs

A soul-stirring song penned by 36-year-old Vengala Bhaskar of the coal town of Manuguru in memory of the martyrs of the Pulwama terrorist attack is invoking patriotic spirit among social media users, extolling the valour of jawans combating cross-border terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir.

The five-minute song, Jai Jawan Jaya He, exemplifies the acts of bravery and heroic deeds of the Indian Army jawans along the country’s border with Pakistan in extreme sub-zero temperatures for defending the nation’s territorial integrity.

The song begins with glowing tributes to the martyrs of the Pulwama terror attack.

Mera Tera Ye Bharat Hamara ... Tera Mera Jawan Hamara ... Jai Jawan Jaya He Bharat Ki Jai ... Nee Tyagam Maruvanidi - Nee Pranam Velakattanid... reads the first few lines of the patriotic song depicting heart-rending pictures of martyrs draped in the tricolour and the family members, relatives and colleagues paying homage to the valiant jawans. Venkat of Hyderabad composed music for the song and Shyam, also from the same city, lent voice to the soul-stirring lyric. “I had written the song a few hours after watching the horrific incidents of dastardly terror attack on our jawans Pulwama district on February 14 on television,” says Mr Bhaskar, who earned accolades for his famous lyrics on Godavari Pushkaralu, Mission Kakatiya and the Singareni coal belt, the growth engine of Telangana. Social media could serve as a powerful tool to channelise public opinion to foster unity and patriotism, he remarked.
