Policeman shot at by bike-borne assailants

Victim out of danger; investigation on

A Delhi Police Assistant Sub Inspector (ASI) was allegedly shot at by two unidentified bike-borne men in north Delhi’s Kotwali, the police said on Friday.

The ASI, identified as Bedi Ram (50), is posted at Nizamuddin police station and was on his way home in Seelampur when he was attacked, they said.

Harendra Singh, ADCP (North) said that the incident took place on Thursday night around 11.30 p.m. when the officer was heading home after work. When he reached an underpass behind Vijay Ghat, two men who had been apparently chasing him, intercepted his vehicle and overpowered him. An argument ensued, following which the accused shot him on the lower abdomen and fled.

The police said that a passer-by informed the police about the incident.

The officer was rushed to AIIMS Trauma Centre in a PCR van. He is currently undergoing treatment. He has been operated upon and is now said to be out of danger, Mr. Singh said. Whether the officer was robbed of his valuables will be clear only after he gives a statement to the police, he said. A case has been registered at Kotwali police station and the matter is being probed, he also said.

“We have been told that the victim’s wallet and mobile phone are missing. We are trying to find out whether he was robbed or he lost those,” said a police officer.

The officer said that prima facie, it appeared to be a case of robbery, but the police are probing the matter from all angles since they suspect that personal enmity or rivalry could as well be the reason behind. The area where the incident took place is a secluded spot.. No CCTV camera has been found installed at the spot or adjoining areas, he said.
