NEW DELHI: Finance minister Arun Jaitley on Monday slammed BSP chief Mayawati over her remarks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his estranged wife , saying that she was "unfit for public life."Mayawati had earlier attacked the PM over his charge that she was "shedding crocodile tears" over the Alwar gang-rape case and said, "How can he respect others' sisters and wives when he has left his own wife for political gains?"Jaitley was responding to Mayawati's comments and said that the BSP chief's discourse has stooped to an all-time low.Taking to Twitter , the BJP leader wrote, "Behan Mayawati - She is firm on becoming a Prime Minister. Her governance, ethics and discourse stoops to an all-time low. Her personal attack today on the Prime Minister exposes her as unfit for public life."PM Modi had on Sunday accused the BSP chief of "shedding crocodile tears" over the gangrape incident in Alwar and demanded that her party withdraw support from the Congress government in that state if she is "serious".Jaitley also attacked TMC chief Mamata Banerjee and said that democracy has become a casualty in Bengal.He said, "Mamata Didi – Democracy has become a casualty in Bengal. Opposition workers are murdered, candidates are attacked, polling booths are captured and Opposition leaders are not entitled to organise rallies."
