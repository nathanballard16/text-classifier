Maharashtra BJP moves into state poll mode

Mumbai: The state executive of the BJP met on Tuesday to take stock of the Lok Sabha polls. Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis , state BJP chief Raosaheb Danve, many MPs, MLAs and district chiefs were all present for the daylong meeting.Sources said that the CM met district chiefs and office-bearers of different Lok Sabha constituency separately and asked them about their views, prospects of the elections and things that could be improved upon.He even discussed organisational and Shiv Sena support to candidates with them. Sources said that in quite a few constituencies, BJP leaders complained of lack of proper co ordination and support from the Sena.A BJP leader said that the feedback will be used for the Maharashtra assembly polls, scheduled for later this year.Interestingly, Maharashtra BJP chief Raosaheb Danve, who is no stranger to controversy, claimed that the state government will go in for a blanket farm loan waiver.The remark led to raised eyebrows as it was seen as the BJP effort to tide over the anger of farmers over rural distress. However, later in the day, FM Sudhir Mungantiwar said that the BJP government will not give a blanket farm loan waiver.“Giving a blanket farm loan waiver means helping even farmers like Sharad Pawar (alluding to the Pawar family being rich and also being invovled in farming).We will not give that. We will give the farm loan waviers to those who are in need of it and are eligible as per the state government norms,”said Mungantiwar.
