Indian Navy Conducts Co-operative Engagement Test with Barak Missile

The Indian Navy has conducted the maiden co-operative engagement test of the medium range surface to air missile (MRSAM), a ship-based version of Israel's Barak 8 supersonic missile, enhancing India's anti air warfare capabilities.

"With the successful 'Co-operative Engagement' firing of Medium Range Surface to Air Missile, Indian Navy achieves a significant milestone in enhancing its Anti-Air Warfare Capability," Spokesperson for the Indian Navy tweeted on Friday.

The firing trial was carried out by India's Defense Research and Development Organization (DRDO) and Israel Aerospace Industries.



Co-operative Engagement Capability allows combat systems to share unfiltered sensor measurements data associated with tracks with rapid timing and precision to enable the battlegroup units to operate as one.

The firing was carried out on the Western Seaboard by Indian Naval Ships Kochi and Chenna. The missiles of both ships were controlled by one vessel to intercept different aerial targets at extended ranges.

These Surface to Air Missiles are fitted onboard the Kolkata Class Destroyers and would also be fitted on all future major warships of the Indian Navy, the Indian Navy stated in a press release.

The Indian Navy added that the successful test is the result of sustained efforts by all stakeholders over the years. The state-funded DRDL Hyderabad, a Defence Research and Development Organisation Lab, jointly developed this missile in collaboration with Israel Aerospace Industries.
