ONGC General Manager Sacrifices His Life To Save Colleagues, Plant In Navi Mumbai Fire

Not all heroes wear capes and sometimes they don't even survive to tell their tales. This is what happened with 50-year-old C N Rao, ONGC resident production superintendent (general manager, production) at the Uran processing plant in Navi Mumbai.

He averted a major disaster but he paid the price with his life.

An ONGC official who was present at the time of mishap, reportedly said, "On smelling gas, Rao went to find out more and tried to close the main gas pipeline valve and succeeded. But a blast and a fire followed while Rao and others were trying to find any other leaking spots."

"Rao was a dedicated and sincere person. He took the risk of his life to save the lives of others. This proves his diligence to his profession," TOI quoted one of his colleagues as saying. Rao had joined ONGC in 1990 and lived in Kharghar with his wife and two sons.

Another ONGC official said, "He was transferred to the Uran plant around two years ago. Many in ONGC remember him as a very helpful officer, besides being nice to everyone."

The family is naturally, in shock. "His brother has been informed. The charred body is difficult to identify. Hence a DNA sample was taken. Besides, forensic laboratory tests will be conducted," TOI quoted a relative as saying.

It is sad that Rao had to lose his life. He should be awarded for saving the lives of others, they owe their lives to this man.

At least four people, including three Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel and an official of the Oil and Natural Gas Corp. Ltd (ONGC), were killed in a fire on Tuesday at ONGC’s processing plant in Uran, Navi Mumbai.
