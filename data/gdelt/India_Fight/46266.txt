Squadron Leader Minty Agarwal's 601 Signal unit will also be awarded for their role in Balakot aerial strikes and foiling the aerial attack by Pakistan on February 27.

After India attacked the terror facility in Balakot, Pakistan sent its F-16 fighter jets to target the Indian facilities. During this period, Wing Commander Abhinandan flew a MiG-21 Bison multi-role fighter jet and shot a Pakistani F-16. However, in this process, he crossed into Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and his fighter jet was shot down by a Pakistani anti-aircraft missile.

Abhinandan ejected safely from his MiG-21 but was captured by the Pakistanis. He was later released by the Pakistan government after pressure was exerted by India and the international community.

Earlier, Abhinandan was also conferred with the third-highest wartime gallantry award, Vir Chakra on the 73rd Independence Day.
