Kerala elections: Sabarimala, Rahul factor make it a tough battle on Left’s last turf

The one word that has dictated discussions around Kerala politics for months is Sabarimala. The question that hangs over the state, and the CPM-led LDF government, as Kerala votes for all 20 Lok Sabha seats in the third phase of the elections today is: how much will Sabarimala dictate the results?Each party has its own interpretation. BJP sees it as its best opportunity to start winning seats in Kerala. The ruling CPM under Pinarayi Vijayan is confident its decision to implement the Supreme Court order allowing women of reproductive age entry into the temple will not affect its electoral fortunes.Congress and the bloc it leads, the UDF, meanwhile, see their biggest inspiration in the other word that emerged Kerala a few weeks ago and has occupied national political limelight: Wayanad , the picturesque agrarian district from where Congress chief Rahul Gandhi is contesting the election (his second seat after Amethi).Kerala has seen straight fights between UDF and LDF (currently, UDF holds 12 Lok Sabha seats and LDF 8), but in several seats, the contest will be triangular this time because of an energised BJP.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has visited the state four times since January. In his last campaign rally in Thiruvananthapuram, Modi even spoke about bringing in constitutional protection for customs and beliefs, reflecting BJP’s stand on Sabarimala, if elected back to power.But campaigning has not been just about Sabarimala — demonetisation and its impact on small traders, GST, mob lynchings over cow slaughter and consumption of beef, political killings, and the handling of last year’s devastating floods by the state and central governments have also swirled around the electoral battlefield.Congress, which is eyeing gains in the southern states after Rahul’s pitch that he chose Wayanad to show solidarity with South India, has also highlighted its Sabarimala stand: that it believes in protecting faith and customs. With UDF and BJP both claiming votes of believers, there are chances that Hindu votes will be split and thus neutralise the Sabarimala factor.By deciding on candidates much earlier, the LDF had an early advantage in the campaign. Led by Vijayan, the campaign team worked like well-oiled machinery and votes were sought on the basis of the state government’s work. Vijayan, who is a strong critic of RSS, also tried to consolidate minority votes through fiery speeches against Modi and RSS. However, it’s the UDF that appeared most confident of minority consolidation by the end of the campaign, buoyed by the RaGa factor and CPM’s low stakes in national politics.
