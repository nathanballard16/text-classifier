Two fake call centres busted, over 50 arrested by Ahmedabad Police

Over 50 people were arrested by the city police on Thursday for allegedly running two fake call centres, and duping US citizens, in Prahaladnagar and Thaltej of Ahmedabad. The arrests were made by Cyber cell sleuths and Sola police.

Responding to specific leads that fraudsters were running a night call centre for two months, the sleuths of Cyber Cell raided five offices of Palladium Plaza towers in Prahaladnagar. The racket had rented five offices in the building.

Thirty-two people, including the owner of the office, were arrested from here. The sleuths recovered valuables — comprising cash, 35 mobile phones, 26 desktop computers,7 laptops and documents — worth Rs 6.76lakh.

Posing as Social Security Administration (SSA) officers, the accused used to tell the people that drugs and blood stains have been recovered from their vehicles, which amount to suspension of their Social Security Numbers (SSN). The cops are suspecting a bigger network behind the crime.

In the second case, 22 people were arrested by Sola police after sleuths raided an office on the fourth floor of Earth Essence towers in Thaltej. The police seized 10 desktops and laptops, magic jack devices etc from the office. The accused used to pose as Internal Revenue officers to squeeze out money.
