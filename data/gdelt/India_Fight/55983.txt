NEW DELHI: Amid incidents of violent protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act in some parts of the country, the home ministry on Monday issued an advisory to all states and Union territories asking them to take all required steps to contain violence, protect life and property and also act firmly against circulation of fake news on social media.

“MHA has issued an advisory to states and UTs that in view of incidences of violence and damage to public property being reported from some parts of the country, it is imperative that all required measures be taken to contain violence, ensure protection of life and safety of citizens and prevent damage of property,” said sources in the home ministry.

State governments and UT administrations have been requested to take requisite precautionary measures to maintain law and order, peace and public tranquility. They have also been requested to take action against circulation of fake news and rumours on social media having potential to incite violence.

The advisory comes in the wake of protests, including those accompanied with violence and arson, across Delhi, Aligarh Lucknow, Hyderabad and parts of Assam and Kerala. The protests in the national capital were concentrated mostly in and around Jamia Millia Islamia and saw clashes between the police and students.
