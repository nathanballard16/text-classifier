Lansing man killed in rollover crash on Waverly Road Sunday morning

DELHI TWP. - One Lansing man was killed and another injured in a rollover crash early Sunday on Waverly Road, south of Lansing, police said.

James Lewis Thompson, 46, was driving north on Waverly, north of Bishop Road, about 3:45 a.m. when his vehicle went off the road, hit a traffic sign and rolled several times, Michigan State Police said.

Thompson was ejected from the vehicle. A 20-year-old Lansing man who was riding in the vehicle was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, police said.

The preliminary investigation indicates alcohol use was a factor, they said. Investigators were still trying to determine what other factors might have contributed to the crash and whether seatbelts were being used.

Waverly Road was closed for several hours after the crash.

Deputies from the Ingham County and Eaton County Sheriff's departments helped at the scene. So did the Delhi Township and Windsor Township fire departments.
