High taxes blamed after bootleg alcohol kills more than 100 in India

New Delhi: More than 130 people have died in north-eastern India after drinking bootleg liquor, the second mass poisoning from illegal alcohol to hit the country this month.

The deaths occurred in the state of Assam when workers on tea plantations consumed tainted liquor sold by unlicensed vendors, officials said. Dozens are still being treated in local hospitals.

Bootleg liquor is cheap, powerful and widely available in India, making it a popular option for those who cannot afford the alcohol sold at state-licensed outlets.

Such moonshine can also be fatal. Bootleggers have been known to spike their product with methanol, a toxic substance used in antifreeze, to boost potency. Methanol can also result from a mistake in the distilling process.
