Ranveer Singh supports childhood buddy

Simone has been one of my closest friends growing up. I wanted to support her, says Ranveer.

Ranveer Singh is extremely close to his friends and goes out of his way to ensure he is always there for them. And to show his love and support for his designer friend Simone Khambatta, Ranveer has cleared his schedule.

“Ranveer has been friends with Simone Khambatta since they were 11. They have travelled for trips together and she has been one of his closest friends growing up. Simone is a women’s couture/bridal designer and does bespoke menswear. Ever since Ranveer became a superstar, he has been constantly in and out of Mumbai for his film shoots and endorsements. He realised that thankfully he was in town on the day Simone was showcasing her collection at a two-day wedding (luxury) exhibition and he immediately told his team to clear out his calendar for the day so that he could walk for Simone and offer his support. He wanted to be there for his friend’s special moment,” says an insider.

Ranveer says, “Simone has a unique creative expression as a designer. She also has been one of my closest friends growing up. I wanted to support her and celebrate her breakthrough moment in the world of fashion. We share fond memories of growing up together, and it makes me immensely proud to be a small part of her achievement. The show’s going to be fantastic and I’m looking forward to it.”
