Chemical unit raided for dumping waste in creek

Surat: Officials of Gujarat Pollution Control Board’s (GPCB) regional office carried out inspection in the premises of a chemical company located in Sachin GIDC for allegedly releasing hazardous chemical waste directly into Mindhola creek on Tuesday.

Official sources said when GPCB officials raided the chemical company premises on a complaint by office-bearers of Parivartan Trust, they found the owners releasing chemical waste into Mindhola creek. The GPCB officials took waste samples for testing. Parivartan Trust president Prakash Contractor said, “The chemical factory is owned by a leader of Kanakpur-Kansad municipality. His company has been releasing chemical waste into the creek for the past many years. During monsoon season when the creek overflows, the chemical waste spreads to residential areas. We have demanded strict action against the factory owner for flouting environment laws.”
