Kejriwal questions synergy between Imran Khan, Modi

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday questioned the growing synergy between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Pakistani counterpart Imran Khan and accused the former of milking the retaliatory Balakot air strikes for electoral gain.

"Some days back, Imran Khan said that Modi should be PM again. He said it just after the simmering tension on the border and amid fears that both countries would go to war. What is cooking between Imran Khan and Modi? There is something suspicious," Kejriwal told a poll campaign late on Saturday evening, in Margao town in South Goa district where the state Aam Aadmi Party convenor Elvis Gomes is contesting the South Goa Lok Sabha seat.

The AAP leader, who is on a short visit to Goa to campaign for his party's candidates for the upcoming Lok Sabha and assembly bypolls on April 23, also said, that since the Prime Minister had failed on key issues like health, education, economy he was trying to milk the Indian Air Force strike at Balakot.

"People are now asking questions about how Pulwama happened on February 14, when 40 of our brave soldiers died, two months before elections. Why did Imran Khan attack Pulwama just before elections and the only thing Modi saying now, is that we entered their country and killed them?" Kejriwal said.

Pointing out to the irony, Kejriwal said, that the head of the country in which India carried out the air strike was now rooting for Modi ahead of elections.

"There is a dangerous game being played out. When you vote, think about it," the Delhi Chief Minister said.
