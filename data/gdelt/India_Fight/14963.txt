Amritsar, March 14

AAP’s Patiala (rural) unit president was shot at by unidentified assailants in Tarn Taran district on Thursday while he was trying to prevent them from kidnapping a girl, the police said.

The injured, Chetan Singh, belongs to Rurki Kalan in Samana. The victim, a Harike resident, said she had come to the town to get her Aadhaar card issued.

“A car bearing registration number PB-10 B 7474 blocked my way. Its occupants tried to abduct me when Chetan Singh, who was standing near the crossing, came to my rescue. The accused got panicky and shot at him,” the girl said.

Chetan Singh was admitted to Patti Civil Hospital from where he was referred to Amritsar. The accused are Jagga Singh, Sandip Singh, Jatinder Singh and Manna of Harike. Their two accomplices are yet to be identified. — TNS
