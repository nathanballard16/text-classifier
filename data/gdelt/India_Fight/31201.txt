“We are deeply shocked. She was a topper and a very bright student. We saw her in the morning, she seemed fine. We do not know how this happened as our school is alert at all times. A help (maasi) is always there inside the toilet, wonder why she didn’t notice when she kept herself locked inside for so long,” said her classmate.

School teachers say that she left her classroom around 1:30pm and around 2:30pm the teachers realised that she has not returned to her class. On further enquiry, she was found dead inside the toilet.
