Fire breaks out at a plastic godown in Hyderabad

A massive fire broke out at a plastic godown in Bholakpur under Musheerabad police station limits on Friday. No casualties have been reported.

Thick smoke was billowing out of the godown with toxic fumes due to the plastic burning. Fire tenders were alerted who are trying to douse the fire.

Last week, a fire engulfed a Royal Enfield showroom in Erragaddda. As it was a minor fire, none of the vehicles was damaged.
