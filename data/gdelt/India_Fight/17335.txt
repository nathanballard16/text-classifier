Demanding rescheduling of the CET dates, the student body started a petition which garnered 60 signatures within a few hours of starting on Wednesday.“We study some law even for the CS course. I registered for MH CET when it was scheduled on May 11. Later the date was changed to June 1, when the CS Executive exams begin. The CS Executive exam is an all-India exam and its dates have been steady for years. Plus, it is a tough exam and you cannot give both on the same day. Now I have no option, but to appear for MH CET the next year. I will have wasted one year,” Shane Fernandes, a BCom student who is set to graduate this year, told Mirror.CET Cell commissioner Anand Rayate ruled out that possibility of further rescheduling. “May 23 is the counting day. We were told by the administration that security personnel would not be available for the immediate weekend. So we had to push the exam to June 1 (Saturday), which is the latest we can stretch.”
