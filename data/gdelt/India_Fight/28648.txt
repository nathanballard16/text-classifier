Day on, biz partner booked for abetting trader to suicide

Ludhiana: A day after a 46-year-old trader shot himself dead at his house in Machhiwara, the police on Tuesday booked his former business partner for abetment to suicide.

Upset over losses in business, Naresh Kumar Rihal, who owned an ice factory near main market and was into seed business, too, had committed suicide on Monday.

Police said while recording her statement, Naresh’s wife Poonam Rihal alleged that his business partner Sukhwinder Singh Gill, also a resident of Machhiwara, was not returning his money because of which he was upset. “Naresh had taken a bank loan of Rs 63 lakh to construct his house. The bank had sent him a notice for mortgaging it as he was unable to repay it. This added to his troubles,” said a cop.

Police said even as the exact cash transaction between Naresh and Sukhwinder was being ascertained, it was believed to be in crores. “Naresh might have invested in his businesses the bank loan he took for constructing his house,” he added.

Machhiwara SHO Raman Inder Jit Singh said, “A case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against Sukhwinder. Raids are being conducted to arrest him. We are also checking Naresh’s debt details.”

On Monday, Naresh returned home from his factory around 10.30am.

He went to his room, took out his licenced revolver and shot himself in the temple. His wife who was in the adjoining room rushed to the spot on hearing the gunshot. On finding him on the floor in a pool of blood, she raised the alarm. Neighbours rushed to their house and took Naresh to a nearby hospital, where doctors declared him brought dead.

Naresh is survived by his wife, a son and a daughter.
