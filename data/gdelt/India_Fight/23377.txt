Nab assaulter of MC staffer: Women’s panel

Ludhiana: The Punjab State Commission for Women has directed the Ludhiana police to immediately arrest the developer who had assaulted and abused a woman building inspector of the Ludhiana municipal corporation and produce him before it.

The commission issued directions after cops failed to produce him before the commission on Wednesday in accordance with earlier directions. Earlier, the municipal corporation (MC) and police officials appeared before the commission for presenting their side in the incident involving a private developer Gurnam Singh. The commission also directed the cops to ensure safety of building inspector Kashish Garg.

MC assistant town planner Vijay Kumar said the officials had earlier been asked to give their statement before the commission.

“The cops told the commission that the developer is still absconding. They have also been asked not to call the woman official at the police station for her statement. Issuing directions to ensure her safety, cops were directed to take her statement at the MC office,” he said.

Meanwhile, the MC officials claimed that the woman building inspector was unable to overcome the trauma and had been going through a tough phase.

On April 24, a team comprising building branch officials from Zone B had gone for demolition of an illegal colony on Tibba Road near MC garbage dump when a private developer Gurnam Singh had allegedly hit the car carrying MC officials from the rear. He also abused and slapped the building inspector Kashish Garg.

Following her statement, police had registered an FIR against the developer for attempt to murder and other sections of the IPC.
