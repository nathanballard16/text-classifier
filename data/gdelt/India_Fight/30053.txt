New Delhi: Garud commando Jyoti Prakash Nirala had laid down his life in the line of duty. He was martyred during an encounter with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. Before laying down his life for the nation, the commando had gunned down five terrorists in different encounters.

The nation honoured the braveheart by bestowing the Ashok Chakra on him posthumously during the Republic Day celebrations in 2018. Ashok Chakra is the highest peacetime gallantry award that is given in India.

Now, his fellow soldiers from the Indian Air Force’s Garud Commando Force have honoured the martyr by helping in the marriage of his sister in Patna.

Nirala was the lone son in the family which has four daughters. The family had come under financial constraint following Nirala’s martyrdom.

The family was finding it difficult to ensure enough funds for the marriage of Nirala's sister. It is then that the Garud commandos came forward to help their colleague, who had lost his life in the line of duty.

It has been reported that each commando in the force contributed Rs 500 each and in this way, nearly Rs 5 lakhs were collected. The funds were then used to organise the marriage of Nirala's sister.

In pictures that have gone viral on social media, some of the commandos can be seen making the bride walk on their palms as a mark of respect.

While the gesture has earned a lot of praise on the social media, it has also brought forth again the fact that families of security personnel face financial problems after their earning member dies in the line of duty.
