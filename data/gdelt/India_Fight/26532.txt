AP High Court Dismisses TDP Plea On VVPAT Counting

Justice Shyam Prasad of the Andhra Pradesh High Court dismissed a petition filed by lawyer Balaji on behalf of the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) demanding that counting of VVPAT slips from 5 EVMs in each booth, be taken up first. After a three-hour hearing on the subject, the honourable judge turned down the TDP advocate's plea. It may be recalled that TDP supremo, Chandrababu Naidu has been campaigning unsuccessfully for raising the counting of VVPAT slips in each assembly constituency from 5 to 50%. The Supreme Court had struck down a plea by 21 opposition parties earler. Subsequently, the Election Commission of India had also refused to consider the plea of the opposition parties on this matter.

Chandrababu has been resorting to blaming the EVMs from April 11, the day of polling itself. He claimed later in the day that he did not know who he had voted for. YSRCP leaders have pointed out that the TDP chief is driven by fear of defeat and is now seeking to blame the EVMs. It is evident, opposition leaders claim, that Chandrababu is preparing the ground for his impending defeat. His anxiety has gone beyond all acceptable levels, they say, and have even described him as the greatest destablising force in the country.
