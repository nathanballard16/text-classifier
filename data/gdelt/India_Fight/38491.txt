Sidharth has travelled to Kargil to start the second schedule shoot of the film. But due to recent abolition of Article 370 in Kashmir. The Article 370 allows the state to have its own constitution, and now Jammu & Kashmir and Ladakh have become Union Territories.

The Student of the Year actor left on time for the shooting but due to the government’s decision, things are getting delayed. Shabbir Boxwala, producer of the film told Mumbai Mirror, “Some of the heavy equipment, like the lighting truck and some crew members, were delayed as their route to Kargil had to be diverted via Leh instead of Srinagar, where the situation is still said to be a little tense.”

The producer also said that despite of heavy security and checking in Srinagar, the team will start shooting soon. “Sidharth and the rest of the cast and crew have got acclimatized to the setting in the last few days. Sid has also got extra time for his workout and prep.”

Well, we hope the team gets this sorted soon!

Sidharth is going to be seen playing a double role in the film. The first schedule took place in Chandigarh.
