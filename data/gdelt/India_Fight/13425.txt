India denies that Pakistan intercepted one of its submarines

(CNN) Delhi has denied Pakistan's claim that it intercepted an Indian submarine that attempted to sail into its waters, as the two nations continued to trade barbs after a week of escalating tensions.

Pakistan said the incident occurred on Monday night, when the country's navy "detected and blocked" an Indian navy submarine from entering its waters.

Pakistan's military released video footage purporting to show the submarine on the surface of water with a timestamp of 8:35 p.m. on Monday. CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the video.

Pakistan's Navy Director General of Public Relations said in a statement that the submarine could have been "easily engaged and destroyed had it not been Pakistan's policy to exercise restraint in the face of Indian aggression and to give peace a chance to prevail."

The statement described the incident as the latest in a "series of proactive actions against Pakistan." India responded by describing Pakistan's claims as a false narrative being put out by Islamabad.
