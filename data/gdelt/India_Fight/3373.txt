In a video that's going viral, Priyanka Chopra was asked about the hate she receives on social media. The Mary Kom actress gave a fitting reply to those who spread hatred and negativity. She said, "I’ve never really cared about people who talk shit. I mean people who talk shit are shit talkers and their mouths are dirty and not mine. But I think that I am only focused on the people that can be loved and affection."

The actress added, "I focus on the positivity and I think that’s what social media always was supposed to be—it was supposed to be connectivity, it was supposed to be bringing people together; not creating a cesspool for people to put out their anger and hate and if they do, that’s their problem."
