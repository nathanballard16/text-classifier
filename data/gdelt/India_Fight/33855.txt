From Stealth Jets to Killer Subs: Russia Pitches Massive Arm...

(MENAFN- Daily Outlook Afghanistan) NEW DELHI - Russiais offering an array of cutting-edge arms to be produced locally by India,including an advanced killer sub and a fifth-generation fighter jet. The Indianmilitary is also about to take delivery of other weapons.

Moscow is nowcompeting for a tender to deliver six diesel-electric submarines to the IndianNavy, said Vladimir Drozhzhov, the head of a government agency in charge ofarms trade. Russia's bid includes the Lada-class attack submarine (also knownas Amur-1650), an advanced underwater vessel designed for engaging ships,defending naval ports and conducting reconnaissance.

If selected, thesubmarine – which is said to be one of the quietest in her class – won't bejust assembled under a Russian license and from Russian parts, the officialrevealed. The bid suggests that the submersible will be jointly designed byIndian and Russian engineers but built by the Indians themselves.

This is how Indiacould develop its own know-how and acquire sensitive technology that othercountries are reluctant to share, Drozhzhov noted. Also, the Indian-Russian subcould easily be fitted with another joint venture – a supersonic sea-skimmingmissile called BrahMos.

Submarines are notthe only hardware that Russia has in store. India may become the first foreignoperator of the Sukhoi-built Su-57 fighter jet, which is now undergoing finaltrials at Russian airbases, the official said.

The cutting-edgeaircraft once served as a backbone of the Russian-Indian Fifth GenerationFighter Aircraft (FGFA) project until New Delhi chose to quit, citing designflaws. (RT)
