BJYM asks Kodiyeri to break silence

The Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) has asked CPI(M) State secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan to clarify his stand on a rape case registered against his son Binoy Kodiyeri by the Mumbai police.

K.P. Prakash Babu, State president, BJYM, told the media here on Tuesday that Binoy had been implicated earlier too in criminal cases, including murder charges. Mr. Babu alleged that the Left Democratic Front government had used its power to drop those cases. “Mr. Balakrishnan’s silence on the issue is a challenge to the people,” Mr. Babu claimed.

He demanded that Shashi Tharoor, Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram, explain how one of his relatives’ name figured in the list of people who hold an account in Swiss banks. Mr. Babu said that the source of that person’s wealth should be inquired into.
