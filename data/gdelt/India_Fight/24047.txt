Meet 'Maveli' Frog Which Co-Existed With Dinosaurs, It Could Become Kerala’s State Amphibian

Onam is the biggest festival of Kerala - it celebrates the supposed return of a mythical Asura king Mahabali to his people. King Mahabali is also referred to as Maveli.

But now it seems like there is a new entrant to claim the name - a frog. The purple-colored frog which has a rather unique shape could soon get another distinction.

There is an ongoing campaign in the state to declare 'Maveli' as Kerala’s State Amphibian, making it first of its kind in India.

According to Sandeep Das, a researcher at the Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) getting the frog declared as Kerala’s State Amphibian would help in saving the species which is fast disappearing from its habitat in the western ghats.

The frogs which were discovered in 2003 has been listed as endangered on the red list of the International Union for Conservation of Nature. According to researchers, the species which has been given the scientific name Nasikabatrachus sahyadrensis is so old that it qualifies to be called a living fossil. According to researchers, the species could have evolved around 70 million years ago, when dinosaurs were still around.

It doesn't end there - the nearest of its relative was found in Seychelles island, near Madagascar, Africa which suggests that India was once part of the larger continent of Africa.
