It is a known fact that the remake rights of Egyptian film Hepta: The Last Lecture have been bought by Boney Kapoor for a Hindi remake of the film. Rumours suggest that Tamil star Ajith has been roped in to play the lead in the movie. However, close sources to the actor say that there is no truth to this news.

Rumours suggested that Boney Kapoor had screened Hepta: The Last Lecture for Ajith a few days ago. It was also said that since Vinod had suggested that Ajith60 can be delayed a bit, the actor might be working in the remake of the Egyptian film, which will be directed by Siva. However, even though no official confirmation has been made yet.



It is interesting to note that having done four back-to-back movies with Ajith, Siva had said during the interviews around Viswasam release that the next movie he directs won’t have Ajith in it.

After his last release Viswasam, Ajith is working on the Tamil remake of Bollywood film Pink, which is being produced by Boney Kapoor. This remake is being directed by Vinod who had directed the film Deeran Adhikaaram Ondru. The actor is busy shooting in Hyderabad for the film.
