Dhaka cafe attack suspect arrested in Bangladesh

NEW DELHI: The Bangladesh authorities have arrested a key operative of the banned terror group Jamayetul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) for his alleged role in supplying money, arms, ammunition and explosives for a terror attack in Dhaka in 2016 that killed 22 people, including an Indian, days after the Awami League secured an emphatic victory.The arrest comes days after Sheikh Hasina-led Awami League’s massive win in December's election that enabled her to become the prime minister for an unprecedented fourth term.The arrested terrorists, Mamunur Rashid, is a key decision maker of JMB, officials in the Bangladesh government told ET from Dhaka. They said JMB received donations from individuals and trusts in Pakistan and the Gulf to fund its activities.Rashid’s arrest highlights the scaling up of counter terror operations in Bangladesh, which would be a key item on the agenda when the country's new foreign minister A K Abdul Momen visits Delhi next month. Bangladesh has been India 's steadfast partner in countering terror in the region.Eighteen foreigners were among those shot and hacked to death in the 10-hour siege that began on July 1, 2016 at the Holey Artisan Bakery, an upmarket cafe in Dhaka, before military commandos stormed the building and freed some two dozen hostages.Rashid was in a hideout abroad and was trying to reorganise JMB after 100 of its operatives were neutralised by the Hasina government over the past two years. He was also planning to rescue accomplices from custody. Rashid was arrested on his return to Bangladesh, officials said.A former computer operator and Islamic seminary student, Rashid also allegedly provided logistical support to terrorists involved in several deadly attacks on religious minorities in north Bangladesh. The Hasina government has a strict approach in dealing with perpetrators of attacks on minorities, said one of the officials quoted above.A court in Dhaka last month put eight terrorists on trial over the cafe attack. Rashid was one of the two men charged in absentia while six others were in custody.Officials said JMB is a "proxy" established by the pro-Pakistan Jamaat-e-Islami to "push the centre of gravity of the political debate towards radical Islamism" and make Jamaat-e-Islamiappear more centrist.Many of JMB members have been found to be cadres of the Islami Chhatra Shibir, the student wing of the Jamaat-e-Islami, which was a coalition partner of Bangladesh Nationalist Party, now the country’s main opposition party.Jamaat has been banned from contesting polls for refusing to accept Bangladesh’s constitution, which emphasises on secularism.
