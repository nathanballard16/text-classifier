Jawan at Lalu-Rabri house shoots himself

A CRPF constable of 224 Battalion, posted at 10 Circular Road in Patna — the residence of Bihar’s former chief minister couple, Lalu Prasad and Rabri Devi — shot himself fatally in the neck on Friday morning.

A native of Karnataka’s Bagalkot district, Giriyappa Kirasoor, 29, who had joined the service in 2012 and was posted at the Lalu-Rabri residence recently, had used his service weapon, X-95, an Israeli bullpup assault rifle, to end his life.

Though police are tight-lipped over the incident, the victim’s colleagues, requesting not to be quoted, said that family issues, besides work pressure and leave problems, could be the reason. Officials said that a total of eight CRPF jawans were posted at the CMs’ residence in the high security squad. The government had recently enhanced the couple’s security to Z-plus. “The CRPF jawan’s body was sent to his native place by air via Delhi after post-mortem,” said Patna senior SP Garima Mallik. “The state police and the CRPF are carrying out separate investigations.”

Kirasoor had got the elite commando training and carried the Israeli weapons procured by the CRPF five years ago. Patna CRPF sector HQ did not respond to calls for a comment on his death.
