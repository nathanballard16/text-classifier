Police issue new appeal for witnesses to Stamford's Bombay Cottage burglary

Raiders who stole cash during a daylight raid on a Stamford restaurant are still being sought by police.

As reported in the Stamford Mercury, two men were caught on CCTV inside the kitchen of the restaurant - one wore a balaclava over his face and another tried to conceal his identity under a hood.

They used a crowbar to force open a side door which was visible from Scotgate.

Soon after the criminals left the restaurant, the cashbox was found empty in nearby All Saints Churchyard.

Anyone who recognises the offenders or saw suspicious activity in Scotgate at around 1.15pm on Friday, March 29 should call Stamford Police on 101.
