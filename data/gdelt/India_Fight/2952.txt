Family demands probe into Dipendra Chaudhary’s ‘encounter’

SAPTARI, Jan 24: The family members of Dipendra Chaudhary, 35, who was shot dead by police in an 'encounter' have demanded a probe into the 'murder'.

According to Saptari Police Chief Rajendra Bista, Chaudhari, a local of Surunga Municipality-6, opened fire at police during a security screening, and was killed in retaliation. His dead body was found near Rupani market on Wednesday morning.

"We were forced to open fire for self-defense. He died in an encounter," said Bista. "They were two on a motorbike and they opened fire first."

Shedding light on the incident, Bista said that it took place at around 4 am in the morning.

Two people were on the motorbike when a special police force of Province 2 was on duty in the area.

"There was no sufficient light. And taking advantage of the darkness a person fled. We have recovered weapons, pamphlets, documents, bullets from them," Bista said.

"Records show his involvement in serious criminal activities in the past and even now."

Chaudhari was accused of killing ASI Ramesh Subba, in-charge of police post at Jhutaki, three years ago.

He also allegedly injured police constable Mahendra Satar about a week ago. "He also planted an explosive near Kadarbona police post," Bista said.

The recovered pamphlets and documents read 'Pragatishil Tarai Mukti Morcha Kendriya Samyojak'.

Bista said that police 'has to be tough' to discourage criminal outfits, which are trying to raise their heads.

However, terming it a 'fake encounter', the family members of the deceased have demanded a probe into the matter. All the charges by the police are fake, they claim. "It is false that they have killed him in retaliation.

He was working in India and police had brought him from there," said his cousin brother Jitendra Chaudhary.

"We will knock the door of human right bodies for justice," he added. The deceased is survived by two kids and wife.
