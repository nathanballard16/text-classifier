Ludhiana: A fire broke out at a four-storey garment unit in Sudhan Mohalla early on Friday.

A guard on night duty at Anand Enterprises raised the alarm on spotting smoke coming out of the building around 4am. Neighbours rushed out and tried to douse the flames. But as the blaze spread, they called up the fire department.

Fire officials said they received the call at 5.15am and rushed tenders to the spot. “The blaze had spread to the first and the second floor of the building. As the unit was located on a narrow lane, big fire tenders could not reach it. We had to press into service a small fire tender,” said fire station officer SN Sharma.

Firemen had stationed the big fire tenders at the main road. “The unit was quite far from the main road and the small fire tender had to make multiple rounds for a water refill. The situation was brought under control in three hours,” he added.

The unit owner, Sanjeev Sahi, said, “Machinery, raw material and finished products were gutted.”

Though the cause of fire is yet to be ascertained, it is suspected that a short circuit triggered it.
