Functioning of NCLTs requires to be litigant friendly and effective: Bombay HC [Read Judgment]

“Effective work cannot be done unless the Registrar, Superintendent and other staff members are drawn from the courts already functioning and discharging judicial functions. The trained staff of such courts can be deployed as a temporary measure and thereafter, by a proper selection process, the staff to assist and support the Judicial Members and the President should be selected and appointed. The staff ought to be drawn from legal field. If any administrative staff or departmental member is appointed or deputed to work in the tribunals, he may not have any experience of working in a court.”
