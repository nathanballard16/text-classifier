ISIS Claims "Province" in India for First Time

News

The Islamic State (IS) terrorist group announced has claimed for the first time that it has established a "province" in India, in their worldwide Caliphate last friday. In a statement via the IS's Amaq News Agency, it announced the new province named "Waliayah of Hind".

The move comes after Indian military clashed with militants in the Kashmir region where a militant by the name of Ishfaq Ahmad Sofi was killed in Shopian. Sofi is believed to have had links with ISIS and pledged allegence to them. The statement by the terrorist claimed that they inflicted casualties on Indian army soldiers in the town of Amshipora in the Shopian district of Kashmir.

IS’s statement establishing the new province is not a new phenomenon, in April they attributed an terrorist attack in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to a new province called the "Wilayat Central Africa" IS has been mostly driven from its self-styled “caliphate” in Iraq and Syria in April, from where they earlier controlled provinces which were far away.
