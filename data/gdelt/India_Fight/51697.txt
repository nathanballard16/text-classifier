Mumbai, Nov 17 : Actors Arjun Kapoor and Rakul Preet Singh have started shooting for their rom-com film, and they are already being praised for looking "cute" together.

"Picture Shuroo... other information bhi upload hogi soon," he captioned the image.

Reacting to the collage, Janhvi, who is Arjun's step sister, wrote: "Looking so cute." The film, not titled yet, is being directed by debutant Kaashvie Nair and produced by Bhushan Kumar, Nikkhil Advani and John Abraham.
