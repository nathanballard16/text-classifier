Mumbai: Brace for hotter weekend, mercury may cross 38°C

Mumbaikars, brace for hotter days ahead as the temperature is likely to shoot up by this weekend. Experts say that the maximum temperature, which is currently hovering at around 34 °C, may spike up to 38 °C and above this week.

On Wednesday the maximum temperature recorded in the city was 34.5 °C while the minimum was 25.6 °C. Meanwhile, Thane registered a maximum temperature of 40.2 °C. As per the weather forecasters, a change in direction of winds to northerly/north easterly coupled with a delay in setting in of sea breeze is the reason behind soaring temperatures.

According to the popular weather blog Vagaries of Weather, the city will witness a gradual rise of temperature to 37-38 °C by Friday. "By Thursday the temperatures would be around 36°C and the city may reel under 38 °C on Friday and Saturday," informed weather enthusiast Abhijit Modak adding that the temperature during nights are also likely to see a surge and will be around 26 degree Celsius causing even more discomfort.

Meanwhile, the weathermen have predicted heatwave conditions in eastern suburbs, Navi Mumbai, Thane, Kalyan and adjoining areas. "In eastern suburbs, from Powai-Vikhroli, mercury might cross 40 °C and Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Thane, Badlapur and Kalyan-Dombivli will experience heatwave with temperature soaring above 40 °C till Sunday," said Rajesh Kapadia who runs the Vagaries of Weather blog adding that Friday/Saturday may witness the hottest day of season with temperature shooting up to 43 °C mark. However, the heat is likely to subside after Monday.

Popular hill stations like Lonavala and Mahabaleshwar would also not be an ideal destination for those wanting to escape the city's humid climate. Both Lonavala (38-39 °C) and Mahableshwar (36-37 °C) are expected to be reeling under severe heat this weekend.
