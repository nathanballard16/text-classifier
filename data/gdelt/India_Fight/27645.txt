As India Woos Bay Of Bengal Fraternity, Pakistan Not Invited To Modi’s Swearing-In Ceremony Unlike 2014

Indian Government for the swearing-in ceremony of Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not be inviting Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan.

In a press release the government said “the leaders of Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Nepal, and Bhutan - all members, with India, of the little-known Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) - have been invited to Modi's swearing-in.”

A government spokesperson added “This is in line with Government's focus on its 'Neighbourhood First' policy.” The invitation list also included leaders from Kyrgyzstan and Mauritius, in a report by Economic Times.

Tensions between the two nations reached its peak after a Pakistan based militant group carried a suicide attack and killed 40 Indian Army personnel. The two countries carried air strikes in each others territory. Indian Airforce bombed a terrorist training camp in Balakot in Pakistan.

Pakistan not being on the invitation list also shows that the relation between the two nations will take some more time to return to normal and India continue to isolate its neighbour.

Narendra Damodardas Modi who won the recent Lok Sabha elections with a thumping victory will be fifteenth Prime Minister and will be serving his second terms as PM.
