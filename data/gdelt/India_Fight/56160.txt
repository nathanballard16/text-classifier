Watch | Jamia Students and Eyewitnesses Recount the Horrors of Police Violence

The Delhi police on Sunday entered the Jamia Millia Islamia campus, where students had been protesting for thee days against the passage of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, fired tear gas cannons in confined spaces including the library and lathi-charged students to disperse the protests.

A number of students have been grievously injured. Videos doing the rounds on social media and those shot by media houses including The Wire show students bleeding badly, lying on the ground and being beaten anyway. There have also been unconfirmed reports of police firing, though the police have denied this.

The police also reportedly dragged students out of the library and campus mosque, and marched them out with their hands in the air and detained them. At least 100 people were reportedly injured in Sunday’s violence.
