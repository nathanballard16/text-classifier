9-foot-long python rescued in city

Being kept in observation, will be released once deemed fit

A nearly nine-foot-long Indian rock python was rescued from near the Delhi Secretariat on Friday by a Wildlife SOS team, it said in a statement.

The snake is currently under observation and will be released into its natural habitat once deemed fit. The NGO were informed about the snake on Friday morning. A two-member team carried out the rescue operation with help of Delhi Police. After it was rescued, the 12-kg reptile was transferred into a snake bag.

Constable Vijender Singh said, “We received a call from a local who had sighted the python. We then informed the Wildlife SOS.”

Co-founder and CEO of Wildlife SOS, Kartick Satyanarayan, said that the reptile often gets killed when they venture into human habitats. “The Wildlife SOS works towards changing this attitude and sensitising people. We thank the police officers who informed us on time. We thank them for their cooperation in helping manage the panic-stricken crowd,” he said.

Special projects manager of the NGO, Wasim Akram, said that the increasing urbanisation, construction are resulting into shrinking habitats and loss of natural prey base of wildlife species.

“Wildlife species are often forced to move into human settlements in search of shelter and easy prey. Wildlife SOS rescue helpline is run with the objective of rescuing such distressed wildlife and to apprise the people of the prevalence of urban wildlife and reptiles,” said Mr. Akram.
