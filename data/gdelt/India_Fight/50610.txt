In the aftermath of the violence at Tis Hazari Court between lawyers and the Delhi Police on Saturday, Special Commissioner of Police Sanjay Singh and Additional DCP Harendra Singh were transferred on Thursday with immediate effect.

Earlier today, a plea was filed in the Delhi High Court seeking action against police officials who were agitating in public and sitting on ‘dharna’ after their November 2 clash with lawyers at the Tis Hazari Courts Complex.

The Public Interest Litigation (PIL), which also sought action against police officials who had issued statements on social media when the matter is already sub judice, has been listed for hearing on Friday.

The tension between police personnel and lawyers had been building up since last Saturday when a clash over a parking dispute led to at least 20 security personnel and several advocates being injured. Two days after that incident, a policeman was beaten up by lawyers outside Saket court. A clip of that incident had gone viral on social media.

Upset over the incident, thousands of police personnel protested outside the Police Headquarters on Tuesday to demand action against those involved in that attack on their colleague outside the Saket court.

Coming down heavily on lawyers who resorted to violence, especially against policemen, at Delhi’s Tis Hazari and Saket court complexes, the Bar Council of India (BCI) Tuesday slammed these “acts of grave misconduct” and directed Bar associations to identify the lawyers since “hooliganism and violence” have “no place in the Bar”.
