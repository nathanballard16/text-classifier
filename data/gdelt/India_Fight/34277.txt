Ranbir Kapoor celebrates a crew member's birthday on the sets of Brahmastra; WATCH

Post Sanju, Ranbir Kapoor dived straight onto the sets of Ayan Mukerji’s Brahmastra and as we speak, this Rockstar actor is busy shooting for the sci-fi film. While the first schedule of the film kick-started in Bulgaria, later, the cast and crew of the film moved to Mumbai and Varanasi to shoot for the film. And today, while browsing through social media, we came across a video from the sets of the film wherein Ranbir Kapoor is seen celebrating a crew members birthday party. In the video, Ranbir is seen wearing a white tee paired with black pants and zipper, and he is seen telling the birthday girl to have a good day and later, the girl, who is visibly smitten by Kapoor, tells him that she loves him, and Ranbir says thank you. In the video, he is seen shaking hands with the crew member and wishing her on her special day.

While shooting in Varanasi, the shoot had to be postponed by a few days because Alia Bhatt fell sick on the sets and her health deteriorated. After returning to Mumbai, Alia took rest and then headed back to Varanasi for the film. Besides Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt, the Ayan Mukerji directorial also stars Amitabh Bachchan, Nagarjuna Akkineni, Dimple Kapadia and Mouni Roy in pivotal roles. Brahmastra is the first film in the fantasy trilogy and it will release in the Summer of 2020.

Besides work, Ranbir Kapoor has been making headlines for his love affair with Raazi actor Alia Bhatt and often, these two are snapped at the airport while heading to New York to visit Rishi Kapoor and Neetu Kapoor. Thanks to social media, Alia Bhatt is seen spending quality time with Ranbir Kapoor’s family and their pictures always go viral on social media. Post Brahmastra, Alia Bhatt will start shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Inshallah opposite Salman Khan.
