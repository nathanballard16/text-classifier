New Delhi: A day after Pakistan received India's dossier on the Balakot terror camp reports have now emerged according to which the madrasa located in Balakot was run by Masood Azhar's brother in law Maulana Yusuf Azhar, the man who plotted IC 814 hijacking.

Speaking to Times Now, Maulana Ajmal said that Yusuf Azhar runs the madrasa and added that around 300 students from all over Pakistan studied there. India had credible information that this madrasa was a breeding ground for terror.

Yusuf Azhar was the mastermind behind December 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines flight IC-814 from Kathmandu to Kandahar. He is the brother-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammed supremo Masood Azhar. Media channels had reported that Azhar was killed in the IAF air strike at JeM's Balakot camp in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

Pakistani troops are on high alert along the LoC as tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours escalated after Pulwama terror attack followed by IAF’s air strike at Balakot training camp in Pakistan.

Meanwhile, the captured IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman will be released tomorrow. The announcement was made by Pakistan PM Imran Khan today at the parliament while briefing the Senate and the National Assembly.

Varthaman was captured in PoK after his MiG 21 Bison went down while chasing PAF’s F-16s which had entered the Indian airspace.

PM Khan said that the captured IAF pilot will be released tomorrow as a peace gesture. The PM made this statement while briefing the joint session of the parliament where he informed members of the Senate and National Assembly on the current situation with India.

PM Khan also reiterated his stand on dialogue with New Delhi and added that Islamabad stands for peace and stability.
