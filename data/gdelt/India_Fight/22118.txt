RAJKOT: A man was shot in his thigh by two assailants in Joravarnagar locality of Surendranagar over old enmity on Wednesday. Police said the victim, identified as Ranchhod Bharwad (38), a resident of Kumbharpara locality of Surendranagar, was going on his bike when the incident occurred.

“In his statement, Bharwad said that while he was driving his bike, the accused identified as Kewal Rabari and his unidentified associate arrived in their car and rammed his bike from the rear. When Bharwad fell down, the accused came out of their car and fired four rounds from their country-made pistols. Two bullets were lodged in Bharwad’s thigh,” said an official from Joravarnagar police station.

Police investigation has revealed that the attack was the result of old enmity between Bharwad and Rabari. Bharwad had slapped Rabari over a financial dispute about 25 days ago. Nursing a grudge against Bharwad, Rabari hatched a conspiracy to bump him off.

Meanwhile, police have launched a manhunt for Rabari and his aide.
