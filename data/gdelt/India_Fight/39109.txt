Xerox is adding 600 jobs in North Carolina, after the state offered incentives of more than $12 million for a technology development center in Cary in the Research Triangle Park region.

Gov. Roy Cooper announced the expansion on Tuesday, saying the Xerox jobs average have an average salary of $112,000, as reported by the News & Observer.
