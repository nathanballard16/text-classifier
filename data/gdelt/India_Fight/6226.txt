Earlier on February 10, more than 90 people were killed due to consumption of illicit liquor in several villages of India's Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand states.

Around 175 people were arrested and 297 cases were registered after the incident.

Around 10 policemen were also suspended in the case.

Deaths from illegally brewed alcohol are common in India because the poor cannot afford licensed brands.

Illicit liquor has also become a hugely profitable industry across India where bootleggers pay no taxes and sell enormous quantities of their product to poor at a cheap rate.
