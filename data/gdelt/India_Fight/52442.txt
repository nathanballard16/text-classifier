Anjum Fakih and Adnan Khan shoot for 'Ishq Subhan Allah' in Delhi

Coming to Delhi for a day-long shoot was a fun break for Adnan Khan , who plays Kabir in ' Ishq Subhan Allah ', and Anjum Fakih , who plays Shrishti in 'Kundali Bhagya'. They started their day with a shoot at India Gate and visited multiple locations across the city throughout the day. “It was a hectic day but we had a lot of fun. We first went to a park near India Gate. It was quite clean and well-maintained. Then we went to Janpath , where I bought a sherwani for my dad and Anjum bought some jewellery for her mother,” said Adnan.Adnan Khan and Anjum Fakihhe two met a lot of their fans at different locations. Adnan said, “Everywhere we went, there were so many people walking up to Anjum for selfies. She is a rockstar and I have been telling her that considering how popular she is, I should also get some pictures with her.”For Adnan, coming to Delhi in winters is a great experience, but the smog has definitely spoilt it a little. “When I landed in Delhi on Friday, I thought it was foggy as I could barely see anything, but then I was told by my team that it was smog. When I reached my hotel and was getting ready, my hair stylist suggested that I should wear a mask, but thankfully during the day time it was sunny and I didn’t need to wear it. But it is sad that now when we talk about Delhi winters, we talk about smog and not fog,” said Adnan.
