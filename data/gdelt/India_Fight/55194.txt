'I should have moved to the media space earlier': PHD's Shavon Barua

Campaign India's countdown to the end of the decade will feature leading names from the marketing and communications fraternity. We ask senior executives from the advertising, marketing and media fraternity about the last 10 years and the year to come.

Here's what Shavon Barua, chief client officer, PHD India, had to say.

One piece of work created by a competitor in the last decade that you wish you had created/worked on?

To be very honest, a lot of work that we have created at PHD India have been Industry Firsts. In fact, we’ve been punching well above our weight over the last few years in the work we’ve done for HP, Volkswagen Group, SC Johnson, HSBC and Vivo, winning numerous awards for it too. Therefore, it’s not a case of “could have, should have” but rather, “been there, done that”.

If hindsight is 20/20, what is the one thing that you could have done differently in the last decade?

I certainly should have moved into the media space earlier in my career. And there's so much I feel I could now give back to the creative world, if I ever wear the creative agency shoes again.

One skill that you would want to pick up in 2020 and why?
