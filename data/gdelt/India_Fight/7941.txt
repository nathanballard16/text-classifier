Pune: Just a day after Shiv Sena chalked out a seat-sharing formula with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the former said neither Rahul Gandhi nor Priyanka are a match for PM Narendra Modi. An editorial in the Uddhav Thackeray-led party’s mouthpiece – Saamna –said those who question the alliance between the two are political opponents and those “insects” will be crushed.

After a year of throwing verbal brickbats at each other, the two parties finalised a pre-poll alliance even as suspense continues over the post of Chief Minister.

The attack by Saamna comes a day after the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance was attacked by the opposition. Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee (MPCC) president Ashok Chavan termed the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance as “unholy and immoral” saying the tie-up has brought the “corrupt and the helpless together”.

“In the past, Uddhav Thackeray had called Amit Shah 'Afzal Khan' and Amit Shah had called Uddhav Thackeray a 'rat', and today, ironically, they sat together to announce the alliance.”

“During the last Mumbai Municipal Corporation elections, Shiv Sena had released a booklet on corrupt BJP ministers. Today using the paper from the same booklet, Shiv Sena made flowers to welcome Amit Shah in Mumbai. Uddhav Thackeray's past statements of Shiv Sena not allying with BJP were bogus and hollow,” Chavan said on Tuesday.

Out of the 48 Lok Sabha seats in the state, Shiv Sena will contest on 23 seats while the BJP 25 seats. Both will contest on equal number of seats in the Vidhan Sabha elections.
