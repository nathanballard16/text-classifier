Chennai bleeds: Murders up by 13%

CHENNAI: Murder cases reported in Chennai city went up by 13% in 2017 as compared to the previous year, the latest NCRB data shows. In 2017, 154 people were killed; 133 were murdered in 2016.Released on Monday, the NCRB data said Delhi had the maximum number of murder cases, 400, among the metros. It was followed by Bengaluru with 235 murders and Patna where 183 people were bumped off. Chennai is fourth in the list.“Many murders are due to sudden provocation. These cannot be predicted,” said a senior police officer.On how such deadly instances can be brought down, retired police DGP Bholonath said, “Whenever police take immediate action on any complaint and register either a community service register or FIR and begin inquiry, people who try to break the law will be afraid.” Police must take cognizance of offences and resolve them at the earliest, he said.“If a complaint of threat to life is received, a murder can be averted by inquiring the suspect to give an indication that policemen are watching his or her movements,” said another officer.Head of the criminology department of the University of Madras, M Srinivasan, said the crime chart in Tamil Nadu showed no significant change. “Maybe, it is not reflecting the reality. We have to encourage reporting of crimes and police officers need to be positive and receptive about registering cases. Under-reporting of cases will not help us in either understanding the crime or preventing it,” Srinivasan said.Nationally, murder cases reported came down by 6%. In 2017, 28,653 cases were registered compared to 30,450 reported in 2016. Police said the most common motive for murder was dispute. A total of 7,898 murders were reported under this category, followed by 4,660 murders due to previous enmity.Overall, Uttar Pradesh recorded the most murders with 4,324 cases followed by Bihar where 2,803 people were killed. Maharashtra, at 2,103 cases, was third in the list. Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra had the third most murders due to dispute at 824. Uttar Pradesh (1,051) and Bihar (993) had more cases.
