Gurugram, April 26

The Gurugram police have nabbed 14 shooters of the notorious Kaushal gang.

While the police have so far officially confirmed the arrest of only six from Dehradun and Delhi, sources claim that eight other shooters have also been picked up and their arrest would be declared soon.

Among those arrested is Ranbir Saini, for whose arrest Haryana and Delhi governments had announced Rs 5 lakh and Rs 1 lakh awards, respectively. He had been staying with four others in a rented accommodation in Dehradun and would visit Gurugram to execute orders of gangster Kaushal.

Kaushal, who is believed to be hiding in Thailand, reportedly communicated with him through WhatsApp calls.

According to Commissioner Mohammad Akil, they had been on the trail of the accused for two months.

“We have given the Kaushal gang a big blow. Now, the only thing left is to nab Kaushal. The arrests have solved many heinous crimes.”

The other shooters arrested have been identified as Aashu, Sumit and Gaurav, who then led the police to Satish and Sushil in Manesar.

The gang is wanted in over two dozen incidents of murder and extortion, including threatening shootings.

Rap song did them in
