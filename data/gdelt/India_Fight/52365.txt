Congress attacks President, governor for ‘political treachery’

NEW DELHI: Congress on Saturday said Devendra Fadnavis would have to “shamefully” step down as chief minister of Maharashtra even as it attacked the President and governor for “dissolute political treachery”.Calling it a constitutional illegality executed in darkness, senior leader Ahmed Patel said, “There was neither band-baja (celebration) nor a procession as the CM and the deputy CM were sworn-in in a clandestine manner... the incident will be written in black ink in Maharashtra’s history.” AICC general secretary KC Venugopal said, “It is shameful that the President and governor have stooped to the standard of RSS workers for facilitating this dissolute political treachery. The CM was sworn in disgracefully under cover of darkness. The President’s rule was withdrawn without a cabinet meeting and the governor invited Fadnavis without having any clear clue on the numbers they have.”“It is more than apparent that the Prime Minister and other BJP leaders were directly involved in this murder of democracy,” he added.Calling BJP a “contract killer” of democracy, AICC spokesman Randeep Surjewala said, “November 23 shall go down in the history of India as a black chapter when an illegitimate government was constituted by a governor acting as a hit man on the Constitution of India at the instance of a home minister who considers the Constitution as his captive instrument.” He said Ajit Pawar was scared into joining BJP with the threat of putting him in prison in the irrigation scam.CPM referred to Fadnavis taking oath as Maharashtra chief minister as “political immorality” and said the move “showed extent to which BJP can stoop to grab power”. Saying that it is unfortunate that both Constitutional authorities, the President’s office and governor’s office, were “misused” to achieve a political purpose, the party added that it will watch political developments closely.
