Clashes across Kashmir Valley on day two of curfew

SRINAGAR: Clashes between security forces and terrorist sympathisers broke out in Srinagar and several other places across Kashmir Valley on Saturday, even as curfew continued to remain in force for the second consecutive day after terrorist Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind chief Zakir Musa was killed in an anti-insurgency operation in Pulwama’s Tral area.Stone pelters clashed with security forces at Batamallo, Haba Kadal, Eidgah, and Safa Kadal in Srinagar. A huge posse of police and paramilitary personnel have been deployed to maintain peace and barricades have been installed at various points across Kashmir. Strict restrictions are in place in Nowhatta , Rainawari, Khanyar, Safakadal and M R Gung police station areas of Srinagar district.Musa’s killing had triggered massive protests across the Valley, with hundreds of supporters thronging to his funeral on Friday, defying curfew and heavy rain. Violent clashes took place in several regions with protesters taking to the streets, thus prompting authorities to impose a curfew, snap internet services and shut educational institutions, which remained in place on Saturday as well.Meanwhile, terming Musa’s killing as the “death of the radical concept of jihad in Kashmir”, DGP Dilbagh Singh said on Saturday, “Zakir Musa had created a new concept and cult of radical jihad and militancy in Kashmir. He was the last of such radicalized ideology. With his killing, security forces have eliminated the last ISIS-inspired terrorist in Kashmir.”
