Pulwama Attack: Pakistan Is Ensuring Modi’s Victory By Using JeM, Its ‘Sword Arm’

In 2014, my interlocutors in Pakistan told me that they were observing a mustering of Jaish forces along the line of control. When Jaish-e-Mohammad launched the audacious attack on the airbase in Pathankot in January 2016: the only thing that surprised me was that the attack had come earlier than I had expected.

Since then, Jaish-e-Mohammad has become the sword arm of the ISI’s proxy war. With Lashkar-e-Taiba (operating under the name of Jamaat-ud-Dawa) engaged in efforts to battle Deobandi militants as well as the Islamic State and the ever pressing need to siphon off these Deobandi miliants into ghar vapasi programs in Afghanistan and India, Jaish has become an invaluable strategic asset to the deep state once again. These developments once again attest to the simple fact that much of what Pakistan does outside of its territory is driven by its own compulsions.
