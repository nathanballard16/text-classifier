Colonialism and Violence

The greatest violence in human history has happened because of the colonisation drive that several of the resurgent European powers, devoid of any ethical considerations, initiated to grab whatever they could in the rest of the world. It began with the coming of the Age of Discovery. Initially in the closing decade of the 15th century it was marked by Portuguese and Spanish exploration of the New World (Americas), the coasts of Africa, the Middle East, India and East Asia making them global empires in turns. Subsequently during 16th, 17th and 18th centuries England, France, the Dutch Republic and Tsarist Russia also joined this race of exploration and expansion leading them to establish their own empires. Therefore, the European quest to secure colonies led to colonial wars among the aspiring colonial powers like Spain, Portuguese, Britain, France, Dutch and Russia in different parts of the world. Within India itself a number of such wars were fought among French, Portuguese, Dutch and British till Britain finally neutralised the rest and established almost a complete control over the sub-continent and its peripheries. In a way World War 1 & 2 were culmination of colonial wars among the established and aspiring colonial powers (like Italy, Germany and Japan) that brought so much of destruction (mainly) in Europe that considerably weakened all these thereby contributing, as a vital factor, in the decolonisation process.
