Srinagar

As Kashmir has become the first choice of filmmakers from across India for the shooting, a new Telugu action movie is the new flick to be shot in the scenic beauty of Kashmir.

Tollywood star Mahesh Babu has teamed up with director Anil Ravipudi for Sarileru Neekevvaru and Rashmika Mandanna has been roped in to play the leading lady opposite Mahesh in the film. According to news reports, the first schedule of Sarileru Neekevvaru will be shot in Kashmir and the lead pair will be part of the schedule.

The makers of the film recently made an announcement about the film’s title in a grand style at Annapurna Studios, Hyderabad and declared that the first schedule of the film will kick-start in Kashmir. The makers are going to shoot from the third week of this month and the major portion of Mahesh Babu’s role will be shot in Kashmir.

The flick is slated to release next year on Sankranthi. Observed each year in January, Makara Sankranti is a festival day in the Hindu calendar, dedicated to the deity Surya.

Pertinently, despite conflict, the Jammu Kashmir is the only state in India with zero per cent crime against tourists.
