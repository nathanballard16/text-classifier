Instructions to kill during 1984 anti-Sikh riots came directly from Rajiv Gandhiâ€™s office: BJP

New Delhi:

The BJP on Thursday once again targeted former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to attack the Congress, saying that during the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the “instructions to kill” came directly from the former’s office.

“It’s on record of Nanavati Commission that probed the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, the biggest genocide of India in which the government killed its own citizens, that instructions to kill came directly from the then PM Rajiv Gandhi’s office. The country awaits justice for this karma,” the BJP tweeted.

The latest attack on the late PM comes amid Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s continued attack on the former over the 1987 Bofors scam.

Last week addressing a poll rally in Uttar Pradesh’s Pratapgarh, Modi said that the life of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi's father and former PM Rajiv Gandhi had ended as "bhrashtachari number 1".

Reminding the people about the 1984 anti-Sikh riots which saw killings on the streets of Delhi following the assassination of Indira Gandhi, Modi, during his rally in Delhi, said the Congress is talking about ‘Nyay’ these days, but who will deliver justice to victims of 1984 anti-Sikh riots.

“These days Congress is talking about nyay (justice). Congress will have to answer for the anyay (injustices) suffered by the victims of the anti-Sikh riots of 1984. Congress will also have to answer how is it justified to appoint a riot accused as the chief minister of a state,” PM Modi said.

On Wednesday, PM Modi accused the Gandhi family of using warship INS Viraat as its "personal taxi" for a holiday when Rajiv Gandhi was at the helm.

Addressing his first poll rally in Delhi ahead of the May 12 elections for all its seven seats, Modi launched a scathing counter-attack on the Congress, asking why it fumes when he exposes the "misdeeds" of its leaders in whose name it often seeks votes.

Congress leaders, including its president Rahul Gandhi and general secretary Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, have hit out at Modi for his barb at their father, who was India's prime minister between 1984-89.

"Ever imagined that a premier warship of the Indian armed forces could be used as a taxi for a personal holiday? One dynasty did it," Modi asked.

The Navy was made to host the Gandhi family and Rajiv Gandhi's in-laws, and a helicopter was also deployed in their service, Modi claimed, adding that when a family becomes supreme, the country's security is at stake.

"INS Viraat was insulted by using it as a personal taxi. This happened when Rajiv Gandhi and his family was out for a 10-day vacation. INS Viraat was deployed for securing our maritime boundary. But it was diverted to take the Gandhi family which was out for a vacation," Modi said.

He also claimed that after picking up the Gandhi family, INS Viraat halted at an island for 10 days.

"Rajiv Gandhi was accompanied by his in-laws who had come from Italy. Question is whether the security of the country was not compromised by taking foreigners onboard a warship," he asked.
