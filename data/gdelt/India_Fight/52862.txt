Big B joins Ranbir Kapoor-Alia Bhatt for Brahmastra shoot in Manali

MUMBAI: Brahmastra is one of the much-awaited films. Directed by Ayan Mukerji, the film will see real life couple Alia Bhatt and Ranbir Kapoor coming together for the first time on screen.

The shooting of the film is in full swing. A few days back we spotted, Alia and Ranbir at the Mumbai airport where the lovebirds were heading to Manali to shoot their film. Now, latest reports stated that Amitabh Bachchan, who plays Ranbir’s guru in the action fantasy adventure, has also joined them.

According to the Mumbai Mirror report, the couple is going to shoot for a larger-than-life climax with Big B who is said to be strong support for Ranbir who can emit fire from his palms. A source close to the development was quoted by the portal, saying, “Amitji is in Manali, for the next few days before he moves to another shoot in a foreign location in early December. The film’s antagonists, Mouni Roy and Saurav Gurjar, too, will be a part of this schedule that requires some amount of prep before the camera rolls.”

The film is scheduled to release in 2020.
