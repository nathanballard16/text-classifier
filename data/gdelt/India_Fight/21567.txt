Bollywood actor Prateik Babbar is all set to share screen space with Thalaivar. After his role as an antagonist in Tiger Shroff and Disha Patani's Baaghi 2, Prateik is set to return as a baddie in Darbar. Speaking to Mirror on April 17, Prateik said, "It has been my aspiration to share screen space with a legend like Rajinikanth sir. I can’t wait to meet him and observe him on set. I have been appreciated for characters with grey shades and I am investing my 200 per cent in this role because it’s an opportunity of a lifetime." The film stars Nayanthara as the female lead.
