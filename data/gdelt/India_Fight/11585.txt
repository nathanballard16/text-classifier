Downed Indian Air Force pilot returns home

Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman who was captured by Pakistan, crossed over into India to a hero's welcome yesterday.

His release came amid signs of de-escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan.

Mr Varthaman, whose videos in captivity released by Pakistan went viral on social media, crossed into Indian soil via the Attari Wagah border checkpoint between Pakistan and India.

Crowds had started gathering at Wagah on the Indian side early yesterday, and Indian TV channels had been doing live reports in anticipation of his release.

Sources said the procedures for the handover had delayed his release for a while.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan said on Thursday that his country would release the pilot as a gesture of peace to reduce tensions with its neighbour.
