A cop with the Special Task Force (STF) was shot dead by drug peddlers during an operation in Jandiala village of Amritsar district even as three gangsters carrying arms and ammunition were nabbed in the same village in a second operation in 24 hours. Sources claimed STF Additional DGP Harpreet Sidhu had a narrow escape as a gangster opened fire at him.

Gurdeep Singh of the Jalandhar STF team, posing as a customer, contacted peddlers while in Jandiala with a team. AIG Rashpal Singh said the peddlers asked Gurdeep Singh to meet them at Beas but later changed the meeting place to Jandiala.

Numbering three, they arrived in a car and on a bike. They opened fire at the STF team. A bullet went through Gurdeep Singh’s neck.

Abandoning the bike, the three fled in the car. In the second operation, the STF arrested three gangsters and recovered two pistols, three magazines and 64 live cartridges. AIG Snehdeep Sharma said on September 24, the STF in a joint operation with the BSF, had seized five Kalashnikov (AK series) rifles, 10 magazines, 200 live 7.62 mm cartridges, an Australia-made pistol and 20 cartridges from the Mamdot sector of Ferozepur. The arms and ammo were wrapped in Urdu papers published in Pakistan.

Sharma said they received information that the gangsters were meeting at a dhaba near Jandiala. As a team led by Harpreet Sidhu raided the eatery, one of the gangsters opened fire. Sidhu retaliated. The three gangsters, Sukhraj singh, Bhupinder Singh and Rajpal Singh were arrested. The AIG said they confessed that the arms seized in Mamdot belonged to them.

While Sukhraj and Bhupinder are history-sheeters, Rajpal has no criminal record. The STF officials suspect two of their accomplices may have escaped.
