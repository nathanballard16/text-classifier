Saradha case: Kolkata police chief Rajeev Kumar in Shillong, CBI to question him today

The officials, who are from Lucknow, New Delhi and Bhopal, were briefed about the cases in a detailed discussion with senior CBI officials. CBI officials have claimed Kumar has committed offences under the Prevention of Corruption Act and the Indian Penal Code. The developments come days after Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee ended her three-day dharna in Kolkata against a recent attempt by CBI officials to raid Kumar’s residence. Meanwhile, Trinamool leaders and supporters staged a protest outside the CBI headquarters at CGO Complex, shouting slogans against the Centre. A ten-member team constituted by the CBI to probe the chit fund scams reached Kolkata the same day.
