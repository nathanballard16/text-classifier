Kamal Haasan lauds IAF's air strikes, Twitter calls him out for 'double-speak'

After reports of Indian Air Force's fighter jets attacking Pakistani terror camps across the Line of Control emerged, actor-turned-politican Kamal Haasan lauded the valour of our heroes.

In a tweet on Tuesday morning, Kamal Haasan wrote: “Our 12 return safely home after wreaking havoc on terrorist camps in Pakistan. India is proud of its heroes. I salute their valour.”

While there were comments supporting his stand, many were quick to point out his earlier statements where he called for non-violence. Calling it 'double-speak', many users questioned his political stands and called him a half-baked politician.

Last week, Kamal Haasan had kicked up a row with his statements in the wake of the Pulwama suicide bomb attack that killed over 40 CRPF jawans. He had referred to Pakistan-occupied-Kashmir as 'azad Kashmir' and asked why India was afraid to hold a plebiscite in Kashmir.

He also said that photographs of jihadis were put up on trains across the border. “That much of attraction even the film stars here in India won’t get. That’s also a foolish thing. But India is also committing the same. It’s not fair, if we want to prove we are a far better country, we should not behave like them,” he said. Haasan said that this where a new political culture should come in.

After the backlash, Haasan's party Makkal Needhi Maiam issued a statement on Monday, clarifying his statement. The party condemned the media report and said Haasan's statements were taken out of context.
