IPL 2019: All-round Delhi seal play-off berth

New Delhi: Delhi Capitals (DC) qualified for the IPL play-offs for the first time since 2012 after they defeated Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) convincingly by 16 runs here Sunday.

Entertaining knocks from captain Shreyas Iyer (52, 37b, 2×4, 3×6) and Shikhar Dhawan (50, 37b, 5×4, 2×6) helped DC put up a daunting 187/5 before the bowlers delivered once again to stop the RCB at 171/7.

It was DC’s eighth win in 12 games, giving them the 16 points needed to seal a top-four berth. Chennai Super Kings were the first team to quality for the play-offs.

On the other hand, it is all but over for the Virat Kohli-led RCB, following their eighth loss in 12 games. With 62 needed off the last five overs, the DC bowling attack, led by spinners Amit Mishra (2/29) and Axar Patel (1/26) produced another commendable performance to restrict RCB after a promising start.

RCB opener Parthiv Patel (39) initially resisted the DC attack while Kohli (23) seemed happy to play spectator at the non-striker’s end.

The Delhi bowlers replied strongly to the onslaught by the openers by dismissing the duo in quick succession, Kagiso Rabada (2/31) scalped the wicket off Parthiv while Axar accounted for Kohli who was caught by Sharefane Rutherford (1/6) in the deep.

Wickets continued to fall at regular intervals for RCB as their batsmen failed to make an impact. Axar took a stunning catch at the boundary to dismiss AB de Villiers (17) in the 12th over before another South African Heinrich Klaasen (three) followed soon.

RCB seemed to be leading towards victory when Marcus Stoinis (32 n o) and Gurkeerat Singh (27) were in the middle of a blistering stand but the total proved to be too much in the end.

Earlier, half centuries by Dhawan and Iyer coupled with late cameos from Rutherford and Axar had powered DC to a strong total. The openers began the Delhi innings on a steady note but couldn’t capitalise on it with Umesh Yadav (1/39) providing the first breakthrough for the visitors.

However, Dhawan continued hitting boundaries at regular intervals to the packed crowd’s delight. Meanwhile, there was a shift in momentum as Yuzvendra Chahal (2/41) dismissed Dhawan and dangerman Rishabh Pant (seven) of successive overs.

Struggling at 141/5, Rutherford (28) and Axar (16) shared some late blows with a 46-run partnership to take their team past 180-run mark.

Brief scores: Delhi Capitals 187/5 (Shreyas Iyer 52, Shikhar Dhawan 50; Yuzvendra Chahal 2/41) beat Royal Challengers Bangalore 171/7 (Marcus Stoinis 32 n o; Amit Mishra 2/29, Kagiso Rabada 2/31) by 16 runs.
