Body of Pakistani Spy Stoned to Death by Indian Inmates Returned Home – Report

The man had been serving a life sentence since 2001 for espionage, but was killed in February 2019 by several Indian inmates, who beat him to death with large stones. The quarrel that preceded the murder was reportedly caused by news of the Pulwama terror attack that left some 40 people dead. Security in Indian prisons for inmates of Pakistani origin has been enhanced following news of the killing.

Tensions between India and Pakistan grew stronger after the Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist group claimed responsibility for the recent attack on Indian troops in Pulwama on 14 February. The Indian government has imposed a 200 percent tariff on all Pakistani imports, in addition to other retaliatory measures.
