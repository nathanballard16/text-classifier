Indian court acquits 4 Hindu activists in train bombing that killed over 40 Pakistani nationals

Last week, a Pakistani national — the daughter of one of the victims — had asked the court to allow witnesses from Pakistan to depose before it. Her application said that no proper summons had been sent to the witnesses. The investigating agency opposed the request saying they had sent summons through diplomatic channels on three occasions but had received no response. On Wednesday, the court dismissed her request before pronouncing the verdict.
