Satellite Imagery Shows India Missed Target in Pakistan Airstrike - Reports

New Delhi said the move came as a pre-emptive measure and was based on intelligence data about upcoming terrorist activities against India.

Pakistan insisted that the raid was a failure that saw Indian jets strike a largely empty hillside without hurting anyone. Pakistani Prime Minister Khan claimed the attack was carried out to garner more public support for the Indian government ahead of the forthcoming elections. India later refuted these claims.

The airstrike followed a suicide bombing in the India-controlled part of Kashmir, which killed 40 paramilitary police on 14 February.

It led to an escalation of tensions in Kashmir, with the two nuclear-armed arch-foes engaging in an aerial dogfight over the Line of Control, which divides the former princely state.

Pakistan opted to scale down the conflict by releasing the captured Indian pilot, but tensions still persist in Kashmir, with the two sides reportedly exchanging fire across the border.
