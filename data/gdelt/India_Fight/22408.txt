IAF Report Calls for Boosting Jets' 'Tech Assymetry' After Dogfight With Pak

“We felt we could not punish the adversaries appropriately. So we need to bolster technological asymmetry so that the enemy does not even dare to come close to the border”, the sources pointed out.

This followed Pakistan Army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor’s statement earlier this month that India had failed to provide any evidence that one of its PAF F-16 fighter jets had been shot down during the February air battle over Jammu and Kashmir.

“Repetitions don't make truth of a lie. Despite claiming possession of evidence it shot down the F-16, the IAF are still short of presenting it”, Ghafoor tweeted.

The Indian Air Force earlier showed radar images of the air battle between the IAF and a Pakistani F-16 jet, calling it "irrefutable proof" that an F-16 was downed.
