MUMBAI: A MiG-21 Bison fighter jet belonging to the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed in Bikaner's Shobhasar Ki Dhani area in Rajastan today, a defence spokesperson told NDTV. The pilot managed to eject successfully, it added.

According to sources, the MiG-21 took off from Nal on a routine mission this afternoon when its engine developed technical issues. Initial inputs suggest that the aircraft malfunctioned due to a bird hit, the defence spokesperson said.
