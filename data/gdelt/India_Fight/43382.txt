Chennai, Sep 13: In a tragic incident, a 23-year-old software engineer was killed in Chennai on Thursday after an illegal hoarding fell on her, following which she was hit by a water tanker.

The incident happened around 2:30 pm at Pallikaranai in South Chennai when Subashree was returning home after her exam. The All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) banners were erected by a former party councillor.

Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief M K Stalin slammed the government and alleged woman's death was caused by the negligence of state government and 'inefficient' officers.
