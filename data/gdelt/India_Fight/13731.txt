India's envoy to Pakistan Bisaria to return to Islamabad on Saturday: MEA

Indian High Commissioner to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria will be returning to Islamabad on Saturday after having completed his consultations with India in connection with Pulwama terror attack.

Ministry of External Affairs Official Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar on Friday said, "High Commissioner of India to Pakistan, Ajay Bisaria, is returning to Islamabad after having completed his consultations in India. He will reach Islamabad on 9 March 2019 and resume his duties."

India had called Bisaria to New Delhi for consultations - a move which was mirrored by Pakistan, who called back their High Commissioner to India, Sohail Mahmood on February 18, "for consultations".

The tensions between the two nations escalated after a CRPF convoy moving from Jammu to Srinagar, was attacked by a suicide bomber in Lethpora area on the national highway at around 3.15 pm on Thursday.

Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack.
