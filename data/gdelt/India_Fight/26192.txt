Success in West Bengal, Odisha will propel BJP to 300-seat mark: Vijaywargiya

Indore: BJP general secretary Kailash Vijaywargiya claimed Sunday that his party, on the basis of its ‘big electoral success’ in West Bengal and Odisha, would win around 300 Lok Sabha seats. It would pave the way for Narendra Modi to become Prime Minister again. Vijaywargiya also debunked Chief Minister Kamal Nath’s claim that the Congress would win 22 out of the 29 Lok Sabha seats in Madhya Pradesh.

“I feel the BJP would win around 300 Lok Sabha seats. We are going to touch this figure as we are going to get big electoral success in West Bengal and Odisha,” Vijaywargiya, the party’s West Bengal in charge, told reporters here.

“The government machinery, police and goons in West Bengal were on the same page and people are fed up of this as well as Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s dictatorial attitude and the goondaism of Trinamool Congress workers,” alleged Vijaywargiya.

He further claimed that after the results May 23, Banerjee and TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu, who are currently trying to bring about an anti-BJP coalition, would ‘go into hiding’ and the media would have to look for them for comments and quotes.

Vijaywargiya said Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had said the CM would be changed if farm loan waiver was not implemented within 10 days of his party coming to power. He informed that the Kamal Nath-led government had not been able to write off farmers’ loans even after 150 days of assuming office.

“Due to this, farmers are not allowing Congress legislators to enter their villages. So there is a possibility the Congress chief might change the state Chief Minister,” claimed Vijaywargiya.
