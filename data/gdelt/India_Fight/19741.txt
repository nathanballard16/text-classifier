Naxalites extended support to Pakistan backed J&K Liberation Front

According to sources from New Delhi a day before the ghastly attack that killed a BJP MLA in Chhattisgarh and four others, the naxalites had extended support to the Pakistan backed Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front. Meanwhile posters extending support to the JKLF had been put up by the Odisha Balangir Committee of the banned Communist Part of India (Maoist). Further it also called for a boycott of the elections both in Jammu and Kashmir and Chhattisgarh as well.





Earlier on Tuesday, the naxalites triggered an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) in which BJP MLA, Bhima Mandavi's convoy was targeted and the MLA and four others were killed in the incident. Furthermore the naxalites had even prepared a hit-list of politicians to target during the elections. Following this a similar alert was issued ahead of the Lok Sabha elections. Apparently it was stated that under their new commander Basavaraj, they would look to get more aggressive during the elections.









Moreover the alert further read that the naxalites would use IED and even attempt to kidnap of kill political leaders. Reportedly the naxalites were moving more of their cadres into Chhattisgarh ahead of the elections. Perhaps it was stated that the naxalites had been trying to re-group and had even called in their cadres from Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Odisha and Andhra Pradesh.
