Gang of monkeys attacks a man in an alley in India

This is the moment a hapless shopkeeper was attacked by a troop of monkeys as he returned home in northern India.

Nikunj Goyal, an incense-seller in the town of Vrindavan, Uttar Pradesh, was running home from work around 10.30am Saturday when the attack happened.

CCTV captured the macaque monkeys following him down the street before once pounces, knocking him to the floor.

Nikunj Goyal, an incense-seller from northern India, popped home from work around 10.30am Saturday where he was attacked by a troop of macaque monkeys (pictured, one jumps at him)

Two other monkeys then jump on him and bite him before he throws one off and manages to get to his feet.

He then runs off down the road as a neighbour comes outside with a broom in an attempt to help him fend off the primates.

Goyal suffered bites and scratches in the attack, and had to be treated for rabies afterwards.

On Facebook, Goyal commented in Hindi that the monkey problem had become so great it was difficult for people to leave their homes.

He also said the authorities were turning a blind eye.

In the video, a protective box is seen around the CCTV camera - to help protect from being damaged by monkeys.

The rapid expansion of India's cities has led to the macaque's natural habitat being destroyed and often forcing them to live alongside humans in cities.

Attacks are not uncommon, with local media report that - in the city of Mathura, which is close to Vrindavan - 386 monkey attacks were reported the year to April.
