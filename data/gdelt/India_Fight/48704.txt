Anti-dengue steps woefully inadequate, says Stalin

Chennai: With more than 2,000 persons affected by dengue fever and being treated in various hospitals, the opposition leader and DMK president M K Stalin said on Tuesday it showed the ineffectiveness of the preventive measures claimed to be taken by the Tamil Nadu government.

The State should take more intensive steps to prevent dengue and other deadly fevers, Stalin urged speaking after a health camp the DMK organised at its party headquarters in Chennai. A large number of children in particular have been affected and the Health department should do something about it, he said.

The Health minister C Vijayabhaskar should show the same sense of urgency and commitment to combat dengue, Stalin said, taking a dig at him.

In a bid to make a point to the AIADMK government, Stalin personally distributed the herbal drink 'Nilavembu Kashayam' to scores of people on the occasion, as a preventive measure against such fevers. Stalin also called upon DMK party cadres to distribute the herbal drink in their respective places.

Mr. Stalin, who also visited the Anna Centenary Library in the city, regretted that the prestigious library was not being maintained properly. Government should go beyond political prejudices to preserve and maintain the Library in a proper manner, he added. Stalin also enrolled himself as a member of the Library today.
