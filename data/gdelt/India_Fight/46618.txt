SURAT: Three minor boys got caught trying to steal bicycles from Madhuram Apartment in Bhatar on Monday. Locals who caught the trio handed them over to Khatodara police.

Investigation revealed some shocking details when cops came to know that the accused were part of a gang which had two adult handlers, Jagga and Vada, both residents of Navagam-Dindoli, who thrashed the boys with chains and iron rods if they failed to steal. The boys confessed of stealing five bicycles in the past, two of which, worth Rs 27,000, were stolen from the same apartment on October 1. They had returned there again to steal more when they were caught.

Police arrested the three minors, all residents of Navagam – Dindoli area, based on a complaint lodged by Amit Bothra, a textile businessman.

Two of the accused informed police that their handlers first conducted a recce of different areas and after they identify possible posh locations, they send the teenagers for the job which they were asked to accomplish during night.

Police are trying to identify the handlers of the gang of around six members.

When the police called up the parents of the minors, they were shocked to know about their wards’ criminal activities. They said that their boys would leave home saying they are going to school.

The teenagers started roaming around with these handlers who befriended them with ulterior motives. They gradually trained the teens to steal and initially paid good money for their job. But when the minors realized the risks involved and refused to comply, they were often thrashed.

“The handlers are yet to get arrested,” said a police officer.
