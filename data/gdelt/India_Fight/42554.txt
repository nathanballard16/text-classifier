According to reports, the Indian Army arrested two Pakistani nationals, Khalil Ahmad and Mozam Khokar, associated with Laskhar-e-Taiba who were trying to infiltrate into India through Jammu and Kashmir. They were arrested near the LoC in Boniyar sector of Baramulla district on the intervening night of August 22 and 23, said the Army.
