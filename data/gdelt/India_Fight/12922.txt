#Ashanka: What happens in Balakot, stays in Balakot

That the presence of 300 mobile phones means 300 terrorists in a Jaish camp is also in the realm of ' ashanka '.

The big question that has repeatedly landed at the Narendra Modi government's door is this: What is the Balakot terrorist death count?

From February 26 till today, defence officers and ministers have been deployed. Some ministers skirted the question, others gave widely varying figures - 250 from Amit Shah, 400 from Yogi Adityanath. Minister V.K. Singh left it in the realm of 'ashanka (speculation)'. The government's position is that the airstrike was a pre-emptive attempt. The objective was to snuff out a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp.

Indian foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale, in the government's first official statement after the airstrike, said: “Large number of JeM terrorists, trainers, senior commanders were eliminated”. This was at a news conference in New Delhi. Gokhale did not take questions.

The same day, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said in Etah that 400 were killed to avenge the death of the 40 CRPF personnel who died in the Pulwama fidayeen attack.
