Aegon Life takes Aviva Life to court; claims it has been using it for online life term policies since 2009.Two private insurance majors are locked in an intellectual property rights battle over the use of word ‘iTerm’, withdraggingtoAccording to the commercial suit filed by Aegon, the insurer says it coined the term in 2009, when they first started selling online term life insurance policies. The firm contends that the ‘i’ in the term stands for ‘internet’ and ‘Term’ for term life insurance.“In order to differentiate and distinguish its product offerings from others, and after significant deliberations, the plaintiff (Aegon) coined and adopted a new, unique, distinctive and innovative trademark, ‘iTerm’. The plaintiff also conceived and adopted a stylised manner of representing the trademark by using lowercase ‘i’ and uppercase ‘T’,” Aegon has claimed before the HC.As per the suit, the firm went on to add two other products as a variant of the same trademark – ‘’ and ‘’ – and registered specific domain names. Aegon contends that the mark is “inherently distinctive of its products and by virtue of its open, continuous and extensive use, it has acquired secondary significance, thereby connoting and denoting to the members of the trade and public that the policies are theirs and of no one else”.According to Aegon, the company noticed in May 2018 that their competitor Aviva Life Insurance was selling policies using the same term attached with policy names – ‘Aviva i-Term Smart’ and ‘Aviva i-Life’. Aegon first sent a notice to Aviva asking them to stop the practice, and later took it up with theof India (), which said it was not in its jurisdiction to adjudicate a controversy related to intellectual property rights.Before the HC, Aviva has contended that though Aegon claims to be using the term since a decade, the firm had not applied for a “trademark” when Aviva started using it. Aviva has also disputed the “distinctiveness” of the term. It says there are enough examples of usage of the letter ‘i’ in various sectors as a prefix, like ‘i-growth, i-force, i-map, i-direct, i-plus, i-wealth’ etc.Taking into account that Aegon had made an application to register the term as a trademark just a few days before sending a notice to Aviva, Justice SJ Kathawalla, in an order passed on Monday, rejected Aegon’s plea for urgent relief by stopping Aviva from using the term.
