UP: Teenage girls found hanging by their stoles on electric pole

Lucknow: Two teenage girls in Buduan were reportedly found hanging by their stoles from an electric pole in Jeera Bojhi village of Lakhimpur Kheri yesterday evening.

The girls aged around 14 and 15 years were spotted by the locals in a sugarcane field which is only 500 meters away from the deceased girls home, TOI reports.

According to reports, no signs of sexual assault were spotted on the bodies and the victims clothes were intact. The Police suspect the girls were first murdered and later hanged on the electric pole.

The first body was brought down by the locals while the other teen’s body was brought down by the police.

According to SP Kheri Poonam, the two teens were friends and used to go to the fields daily around 2pm with the 14-year-old girl’s younger brother. They would usually return before dusk but on Friday the victim’s brother did not accompany them as he was unwell.

“The bodies have been sent for postmortem examination. If any foul play or sexual assault comes to fore then their swabs would be sent for further tests,” SP Kheri added.

A source involved in the probe told though there were no signs of sexual assault there were signs of dragging in the field and girls’ slippers were found in different directions.
