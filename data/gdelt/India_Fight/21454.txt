Actors give their best when it comes to the perfect shot or dwelling into the skin of the character. Many a time, an injury comes as a part of the shooting process. Recently, Vicky Kaushal got injured while shooting for his upcoming horror film. Reportedly, the actor has severely injured his cheekbone. While shooting in Gujarat, Vicky hurt his cheekbone and had to be rushed to the hospital where the doctor announced that his cheekbone had been fractured and thus the actor needed 13 stitches.

On returning to Mumbai, the actor made a point to consult an injury specialist and he has been suggested to stay away from shooting till the time he heals. The injury reportedly took place when they were shooting for a night action sequence in Alang, Gujarat, where the world’s largest shipping yard is located. Vicky had to run to a door on a ship and break it down but, before he could do that, the door fell on him and he fractured his cheekbone.
