New Delhi: Indian Air Force fighter jets on Tuesday launched a major offensive against terrorist organisations using Pakistani soil to carry out terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir and annihilated training camps of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, the terror group responsible for the dastardly terror attack in Pulwama less than two weeks ago.

Pakistani media went into a frenzy following the attack that was carried out by 12 Mirage 2000 fighter jets, ably aided by Indian Sukhoi jets that provided cover throughout the operation, around 3:30 am this morning. The payload dropped by the Indian Air Force weighed as much as 1000 kilogrammes.

Even as Pakistani defence officials acknowledged the massive offensive by India, and the Indian government issued a statement on the successful completion of the operation, media from across the border amusingly claim that the Pakistani Air Force (PAF) “chased away Indian jets”.

Addressing the media, Foreign Secretary Vijay K Gokhale said that the “non-military pre-emptive action was specifically targeted at the terrorist camp” located at Balakot, around 195 km from Islamabad.

Notably, at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed in the worst attack on the security forces in Pulwama on February 14. The Pakistan-based JeM had claimed responsibility for the gruesome attack.
