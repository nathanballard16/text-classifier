Dreaded gangster held in 2005 case of hotelier's murder

A dreaded gangster was Thursday arrested in connection with a 14-year-old case, in which a hotelier from Ulhasnagar in the district was shot dead, police said.

The anti extortion cell (AEC) of Thane crime branch arrested the accused, Fazal Ur Rehman alias Ali Bashir Ali Shaikh (55), who was lodged in Sabarmati jail in a different case, and brought him to Thane, an official said.

He was arrested for the murder of Rakesh Raman Rai alias Rakesh Shetty (39), inspector of the AEC, Rajkumar Kothmire, said.

The incident had taken place late night on May 10, 2005 near Regency Park at Kalyan. The shooters had allegedly shot the victim from point blank range, he added.

A few days after the incident, the police had arrested Harish Vazirani (50) and Sunil Shetty (36) in connection with the murder.

"The deceased and Vazirani had a dispute over a bar, which the deceased was operating. The bar belonged to Vazirani's brother," Kothmire said.

Harish Vazirani and others hatched a conspiracy to eliminate Rakesh Raman Rai. Accordingly, two sharp-shooters were hired and they shot the victim dead by firing him from point blank range, he added.

Some other accused in the case are still absconding, the officer said.

The offence had been registered under IPC sections 302 (murder) and others at Mahatma Phule Police station at Kalyan.

Further investigation into the case is on.
