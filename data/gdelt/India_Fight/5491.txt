NEW DELHI: Seventeen people died in a fire early Tuesday at a hotel in western New Delhi, police said.

At least four others were injured in the fire at the Arpit Palace Hotel, Deputy Police Commissioner Mandeep Singh Randhawa said.

The medical conditions of the injured were not immediately known.

The hotel is located in Karol Bagh, an area in India's capital city full of shops and budget hotels that is popular with tourists.

Twenty-five fire engines responded to the blaze, which had engulfed all but the ground floor of the five-story hotel, fire officer Vijay Paul said.

The fire has been extinguished, but authorities are letting the building cool in order to investigate what sparked it.

About three dozen people were rescued from the hotel, Paul said.
