‘Understanding the people’s demands is our strength’

NTK candidate Kaliyammal says people are looking for change

She has been championing the cause of the fishing community for years. Her passion to improve the livelihood of the community has brought P. Kaliyammal to the electoral field in the Chennai North constituency.

Preceded by a drum band, Ms. Kaliyammal, fielded by the Naam Tamilar Katchi (NTK), walks around the familiar streets of North Chennai, seeking people’s support in the election. Though she belonged to a different district, issues affecting people living along the coastline were the same, said Ms. Kaliyammal, who is from a fishing community in Nagapattinam.

Her position as the State secretary in the National Fishworkers’ Forum has helped her understand the roots of the issues faced by the fisherfolk.

A change

“People are looking for a change. The fishing community here has been battling for basic facilities for several decades. Most of them don’t own land or have patta. Several youngsters suffer as there are not enough job opportunities,” said Ms. Kaliyammal, who was busy campaigning in Otteri on Monday. Solutions to the drinking water crisis, water resources management and better education facilities top the list of her electoral promises.

It was high time water-intensive industries in North Chennai were made to contribute to groundwater recharge and desilting of waterways, she said. Improving facilities at the Kasimedu harbour is also in the cards.

Asked about stiff competition in the constituency, she said: “Others may be strong in symbol, political background and party. But understanding the people’s demands and their problems is our strength.”
