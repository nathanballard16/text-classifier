Mumbai suburban trains resume after Pulwama attack protesters clear tracks

The protest had stopped movement of all trains to and from areas north of Nalasopara

A group of protesters blocked railway tracks on Saturday morning at Nalasopara, a suburb north of Mumbai, to protest against the terrorist attack in Pulwama that killed over 40 CRPF jawans. However by noon, the tracks were cleared along the western line to allow the trains to function in both directions.

According to officials of the Railway Protection Force (RPF), around hundred commuters gathered on the tracks at Nalasopara station at around 8.30 a.m. There has been no indication of whether the protesters belonged to any party or organisation.

The protest had stopped movement of all trains to and from areas north of Nalasopara, leading to several cancellations. Both RPF and officials of Government Railway Police (GRP) were trying to clear the tracks.

However, suburban trains were running between Churchgate and Vasai Road.
