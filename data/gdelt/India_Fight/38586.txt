Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’s Madhavi Bhide Aka Sonalika Joshi Turns VAMP For Her Photo-shoot

TV actress Sonalika Joshi is fondly known for playing the role of Madhavi Bhide in Sony SAB’s ‘Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah’. The show starring co-starring Dilip Joshi and Shailesh Lodha completed 11 successful years last month. Despite completing so many years, the popular sitcom is still a hit with the viewers. ‘TMKOC’ is doing quite well in terms of TRPs and the show even secured the slot leadership at 8:30pm slot in week 31. Sonalika, who plays the role of simple saree-clad house maker in the show, turned ‘vamp’ for her new photo-shoot. She shared a collage picture in which she can be seen in a black and gold outfit. ‘’VAMPISH Looks !!!(my photo shoot) .....something very different from simple sophisticated MADHAVI.????(which i m playing since 11 years)..&nw i m looking forward to it (something again challenging ).....Actors are always Hungry to play different roles...& has to b ..&so i m,’’ the caption for the post read.
