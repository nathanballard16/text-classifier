Sunday’s tug-of-war between the CBI and West Bengal Police reverberated in the Lok Sabha on Monday, with BJP and Trinamool Congress (TMC) MPs exchanging words.

A united opposition condemned the CBI move to raid the house of Rajiv Kumar, the commissioner of the Kolkata police.

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh termed the situation as “unprecedented”, adding that the tussle between the CBI and state police agencies indicated a “constitutional breach”, which many saw as a hint at the possible imposition of President’s rule in the state.

The TMC accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of “damaging the constitutional structure”.

TMC MPs termed the CBI as ‘chor’ (thief) and raised slogans against Modi. Senior TMC leader Saugata Roy said there was no specific instruction from the Supreme Court to raid the Commissioner.

Rajnath countered this saying the CBI had to go to the house as the officer was not responding to the summons and not cooperating in the probe in the Saradha chit fund scam. He said the CBI was probing the case at the Supreme Court’s behest.

Roy claimed the CBI was being used to put pressure on the opposition.

Matters reached such a pass that Saumitra Khan, a TMC MP who had joined the BJP in January, was not allowed to speak by TMC MPs from the opposition benches. The MP walked across to the ruling benches and was allowed to speak, and he launched a tirade against the West Bengal Chief Minister.

The TMC was supported by the Congress, BJD (which often backs the BJP), NCP, Samajwadi Party and the TDP. Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress said, “Whoever raises his voice is suppressed.”

Bhartruhari Mahtab of the BJD blamed the government saying, “We are not a banana republic; institutions are being derided to suit particular people”.
