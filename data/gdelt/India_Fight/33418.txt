Justice after a long struggle, says slain RTI activist Amit Jethva's father

The father of slain Right to Information (RTI) activist Amit Jethva welcomed a special CBI court's verdict on Saturday, which held seven people, including former MP Dinu Solanki guilty of murdering him in 2010.

Jethva's father Bhikhabhai Jethwa said that his son can now rest in peace as he has got justice after a long struggle.

"I had to struggle all these years. Today, we have got justice. My son will rest in peace now. Illegal mining is still being done in (Gir) Somnath district. It needs to stop," Bhikhabhai said after the special CBI court of Ahmedabad found the seven guilty of killing Jethva.

In July 2010, Jethva was shot dead outside Gujarat High Court for reportedly exposing illegal mining activities in Gir Forest by former BJP MP Dinu Bogha Solanki. Besides Solanki, the six others accused are -- Shailesh Pandya, Shiva Pachan, Shiva Solanki, Bahadursinh Vadher and Sanjay Chauhan.

In September 2012, the Gujarat High Court had severely criticized investigations by the Gujarat police as Solanki was given a clean chit in the case.

The high court had ordered a CBI probe in the matter, following which the police had arrested Solanki on November 5, 2013, and charge-sheeted him under Section 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and Section 320 (murder) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, his regular bail was approved by the court.

The quantum of punishment of the seven accused will be pronounced on July 11.
