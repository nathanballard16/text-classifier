Pakistan slaps terror financing cases against Hafiz Saeed, front entities

NEW DELHI: With the sword of the Financial Action Task Force hanging over it and IMF bailout negotiations at a crucial point, Pakistan on Wednesday slapped terror financing cases against Lashkar-e-Taiba chief Hafiz Saeed and several of his aides.A spokesperson of Pakistan’s Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) said cases have been registered against them in Lahore , Gujranwala and Multan for collecting funds for terrorism through assets/properties held as trusts and non-profit organizations (NPOs).“On July 1 and 2, Punjab CTD registered 23 cases against the leadership of Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF) for making assets from terrorism financing through trusts/NPOs, including Dawat-ul-Irshad Trust, Muaz-Bin-Jabal Trust, Al-Anfaal Trust, Al-Hamd Trust and Al-Madina Foundation Trust,” the spokesperson said in a statement.Large scale investigations into the assets and properties owned by JuD, LeT and FIF, according to CTD, revealed that they had made these assets from funds of terrorism financing and later used these assets to raise more funds for further terrorism financing.“Hence, they committed multiple offences of terrorism financing and money laundering under the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. They will be prosecuted in anti-terrorism courts for the commission of these offences. These assets/NPOs have already been taken over by the government in compliance with the UN’s sanctions,” the CTD spokesperson said.The JuD and LeT leaders who have been booked, include Hafiz Saeed, Abdul Rehman Makki , Malik Zafar Iqbal, Ameer Hamza, Muhammad Yahya Aziz, Muhammad Naeem, Mohsin Bilal, Abdul Raqeeb, Dr Ahmad Daud, Dr Muhammad Ayub, Abdullah Ubaid, Muhammad Ali, Abdul Ghaffar and others.The cases came as a consequence of the most recent crackdown against terror outfits. The crackdown itself happened after the unusually tough language used by FATF against Pakistan at the recent Orlando plenary. The global body asked Pakistan to implement all 27 points of its action plan by October, failing which it would take further action, even blacklisting Pakistan.The FATF had flagged four key areas where Pakistan had taken no action. Pakistan was criticised for not starting terror financing investigations against UN-designated terrorist leaders. The current action is being seen in that light. FATF also asked Pakistan to immediately freeze weapons stores, ammunition dumps etc; implement sanctions against UN listed terror entities and not give exemptions to terrorist leaders.Earlier this year, Pakistan had banned the JuD and its welfare wing, FIF, the two organisations headed by Saeed. Since then, the government has clamped down on JuD’s facilities and sealed its seminaries, besides taking administrative control of its pharmacies, health units, schools and ambulances across the country.
