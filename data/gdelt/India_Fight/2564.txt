Super blood wolf moon: Curb your eclipse enthusiasm, New Zealand

Unless you own a private jet, it may pay for Kiwis to scroll right past any headlines on your feed promising to tell you how to see "the best lunar eclipse in years".

Because while Monday night's eclipse has an impressive title - 'super blood wolf moon' - there will quite simply be nothing to see in New Zealand.

The show will begin at 8:43pm, when the sun is still in the sky and the moon is literally on the horizon, out of sight for most people not on top of a building, hill or a mountain.

All that will be visible from New Zealand is a slight dimming in the moon's upper-left corner, and less than five minutes later it'll all be over, astronomers say.

"It is not worth camping up for unless they just want to see a normal full moon," Stardome's Josh Kirkley told Newshub.

But even that might be worth seeing. A 'supermoon' occurs when the moon is at its closest to Earth, and appears a little bit bigger and brighter than usual. Good news early risers - that can be seen anytime between moonrise Monday night and dawn on Tuesday.

Newshub reader Tanita Panton got in early, snapping a stunning shot of the almost-supermoon on Sunday night from Hawera.

"As good as it will get I think for this blood moon," she correctly said.
