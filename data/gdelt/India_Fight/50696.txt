On Tis Hazari Clashes, Supreme Court Rebukes Lawyers: 'Nobody Claps With One Hand'

New Delhi:

The Supreme Court pulled up the agitating lawyers over Delhi’s Tis Hazari clashes on Friday. Rebuking the lawyers, the top court said that, ‘Nobody claps with one hand. Problems were created by both Police and lawyers.’ Making a sharp observation, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said that, “it would be correct on our part to remain quiet.” The apex court also rejected the lawyers’ claims of atrocities by the Delhi Police. A tiff over parking had snowballed into massive violent clashes between the lawyers and the police personnel on November 2nd last week. The clash between lawyers and police left at least 20 police personnel and several lawyers injured on Saturday last week.

Meanwhile, the National Commission for Women (NCW) on Friday sought an immediate probe into the alleged attack on a senior woman police officer during the Tis Hazari Court complex clashes last week. Taking cognisance of media reports on the alleged attack on the officer, the NCW, in a letter to Delhi Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik, said an audio of the woman's personal security officer (PSO) and a 1.40 minute long video corroborates the case. The panel in another letter to the Bar Council of India (BCI) said action should be taken against the lawyers involved in the incident.

The Delhi High Court on Sunday ordered a judicial inquiry by one of its retired judges into clashes between lawyers and the Delhi Police at Tis Hazari court on Saturday. A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, which sat on Sunday after taking suo motu (on its own) cognisance of media reports of the incident, said that former high court judge Justice (retd) SP Garg would hold a judicial inquiry into the matter. The bench directed the Delhi Police commissioner to transfer Special Commissioner Sanjay Singh and Additional DCP Harinder Singh during pendency of the investigation.
