Watch: Huge Tiger Chases Motorcyclist After Leaping Out Of The Woods In India

Earlier this week, a clip went viral on social media that showed a driver being chased by a huge tiger that jumped out of the woods.

Luckily, the driver of the motorcyclist did not get harmed and managed to escape death, even with the fact that tigers can reach the speeds of 40 miles per hour.

The bizarre incident happened in the Nagarhole National Park in India. The national park is home of 72 healthy Bengal tigers.

After a couple of seconds into the chase, the biker reaches safety as the tiger gives up and decides to let the driver go.

The Nagarhole National park is home to rich forests, hills, valleys, and waterfalls. The forest is home to a number of elephants, deer, leopards, and Bengal tigers.

Earlier this year a 28-year-old man and a 60-year-old man were killed by a tiger that is about 5 to 6 years old.

KM Narayanaswamy, the conservator of the National Park, said, “The animal seems to be about five to six years old and is injured in its right hind leg. This is probably the reason why it was preying on humans. We had spotted the animal in one of our camera traps and successfully tranquilized it. Even though there was a commotion in the region, we managed to move the tiger and it is on its way to Mysuru zoo.”

Before that accident, two farmers were killed by a male tiger in 2015. The farmers were in the edge of the park when they were attacked by the tiger.

In 2013, 4 people were killed in the Nagarhole National Park by a tiger.
