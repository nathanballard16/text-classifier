Sonia Gandhi slams govt on 'dilution' of historic RTI Act

NEW DELHI: Congress President Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said the Modi government 's amendments to the RTI Act to "dilute the powers of the information commissioners " were a "final assault" on the historic legislation that has empowered the common man.Referring to the amendments, Sonia said they would ensure that no information commissioner was free from interference and from signals from the government. "We have opposed these amendments in Parliament and will continue to oppose them in practice. We condemn this piecemeal destruction of our democratic institutions and will continue to fight the Modi government in these self-serving actions which are the very opposite of national interest," she said in a statement released on Thursday morning.While slamming the BJP regime, Sonia said the RTI law is a historic legislation which has created an institution that has in 13 years become a "sentinel of democracy, transparency and accountability to the common man".She said RTI activists across the country have used the law to tackle corruption , to measure the effectiveness of government policies and to illuminate the deficiencies in processes such as demonetisation and elections. In contrast, she said the Modi government has seen this remarkable institution as an obstacle to enforcing its majoritarian agenda without being held accountable to people."The BJP government has now launched its final assault to decimate RTI. To further erode and dilute its effectiveness, the Modi government has passed amendments which diminish the office of the information commissioner in a manner that it leaves them at the mercy of the very government it is required to hold accountable," she said.
