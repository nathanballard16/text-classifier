The team had initiated its investigations into the matter and had sought documents related to the alleged scam from the university authorities.It is learned that the university authorities have submitted the required documents to the CAG team members. The CAG officials declined to comment on the matter and also did not reveal the names stating that it was restricted to disclose anything regarding the probe until the report was submitted.The members claimed that they were not even authorised to speak to the media, however, they confirmed the development and claimed that the university administration had been extending cooperation.Registrar M S Nijjar said they were extending cooperation to the team members and were providing all the required documents. He said he was unaware about the proceedings of the team.It is learnt that CAG officials had reached here on Monday evening to conduct inquiry after orders from the Prime Minister office, where a complaint was filed by a whistleblower around six months ago regarding the fire extinguisher scam.Last year, the state vigilance bureau (VB) started a probe into the scam after receiving required documents from Punjabi University.The university had allegedly purchased fire extinguishers and smoke detecting alarm system at inflated rates.The university appointed a two-member committee, comprising senior professors Sukhwinder Singh and Amita Kaushal and conducted a probe in the matter.The committee reported that fire-fighting equipment and smoke alarm systems were purchased at prices that were three times higher than the government-approved rates. The firms from whom the equipment purchased were also allegedly found to be non-existing. The university authorities had allegedly purchased fire extinguishers worth Rs 58.4 lakh and smoke detector alarm system for Rs 21.4 lakh between April 2014 and October 2016.Vice-chancellor B S Ghuman later ordered a fresh probe into the matter and constituted a two-member committee, including retired IPS officer V K Kapoor and IAS officer Jagjit Puri, last year. The reports were opened in March this year, but the vice-chancellor again ordered to constitute a three-member committee to study the reports submitted by committee.However, the university professors have been blaming the authorities of dilly-dallying the matter in order to save the skin of the accused.The scams had rocked the Punjabi University in 2017 after the inquiries in which 16 such complaints were marked during the tenure of officiating VC Anurag Verma , who was given the charge last year after former VC Jaspal Singh resigned when the Congress came to power in Punjab.Prof Jaspal had served as VC during the 10-year rule of the SAD-BJP in Punjab.
