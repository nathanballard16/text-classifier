Immediately cut down stay, return as soon as possible: J&K govt to tourists, Amarnath Yatris

NEW DELHI: The Jammu and Kashmir government on Friday asked Amarnath Yatris and tourists to immediately make necessary arrangements to cut short their stay in the Valley and return as soon as possible in the wake of intelligence inputs of "specific terror threats" to the pilgrimage.The principal secretary (Home) issued a security advisory, saying pilgrims and tourists "may curtail their stay" and "return as soon as possible".The state government advisory came as Army warned that Pakistan-based terrorists are planning to target the Amarnath Yatra in the Valley.Here are the top developments and reactions:The Army said that security forces had recovered a Pakistan-made mine and a huge cache of arms from along the Amarnath Yatra route. Searches were launched along the pilgrimage route after specific intelligence input that Pakistan-based terrorists might target the Yatra using improvised explosive devices and attack pilgrims, Lt Gen KJS Dhillon said in a joint briefing by security forces.The forces launched a massive operation along the Amarnath Yatra route, during which a huge a cache of arms was recovered and it included a mine with a Pakistan Ordnance Factory stamp and an American sniper rifle M-24, he said.Pilgrims who were on Amarnath pilgrimage expressed their disappointment over the government advisory asking them to curtail their trip but agreed that the step may have been taken because of security concerns. Sonu Verma, one of the pilgrims, told ANI: "We have heard the announcement on the news. No official announcement has been done at the base camp. This is a matter of grave sadness that we are living in our country but we cannot go on our Yatra. However, we also don't want to go without security. The government has taken the decision for the best."Yashwant Sharma, another pilgrim, said: "We have been waiting here for the past four days. We will make the move as soon as the government announces about our safety. We came here with the hope to go for darshan. However, how can we go if the government feels there is a security threat."The aviation regulatory body told airlines to be prepared to fly Amarnath Yatris and tourists out of Srinagar at short notice. Several airlines have announced waiver of cancellation and rescheduling charges for flights to and from Srinagar.Left parties hit out at the government and said Parliament should have been taken into confidence before sending out the advisory. In a tweet, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury also alleged that rumours were being allowed to fester in Jammu and Kashmir.Congress demanded a reply from the government in Lok Sabha on the security advisory asking Amarnath pilgrims and tourists to leave Kashmir as soon as possible. As the House was debating the Dam Safety Bill, leader of Congress party in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury raised the issue of the security advisory "As we sit here, news from outside says a security advisory has been issued ... the government should make a statement," he said.The order led to panic in Kashmir which has remained tense for the past few days after the Centre ordered deployment of 100 companies of additional troops in the valley. The deployment of the troops and various orders gave rise to the speculations about some major decision in the offing regarding the Jammu and Kashmir's special status.Apprehending deterioration in the law and order situation, people were seen lining up at departmental stores in the city and elsewhere to stock up dry ration and essentials. Petrol pumps also witnessed a huge rush of customers.Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Mehbooba Mufti said the " gloves are finally off and India has chosen territory over people " as speculations grew in the valley about some possible major decisions regarding the state's special status."You failed to win over the love of a single Muslim majority state which rejected division on religious grounds & chose secular India. The gloves are finally off & India has chosen territory over people," Mehbooba, the PDP president, wrote on Twitter.She said New Delhi seemed to be preparing "to rob" the people of Jammu and Kashmir of "whatever little is left to protect their unique identity".National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said the directive would do nothing to dampen the sense of fear that is prevailing in the Valley."Although this unprecedented order would seem to suggest a genuine fear of a massive terror strike directed at Amarnath ji yatris or/and tourists this will do nothing to dampen the sense of fear & foreboding that prevails in the valley at the moment," Abdullah said in a series of tweets.The advisory to Amarnath Yatra pilgrims and tourists to exit Jammu & Kashmir due to terror threats is extremely angering, Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray said.In a series of tweets, Aaditya said he has "full faith" that the Modi-led government and India's armed forces will "purge" these terrorists who threaten our pilgrims and tourists and make J&K safe again."I'm sure we have the strength to purge out terrorists from J&K at the will of our Govt and not give into these threats, while ensuring safety of every pilgrim," he tweeted.The Jammu & Kashmir policy planning group of the Congress party expressed concern over "reports" emerging from Union home ministry and state government of Jammu and Kashmir which was creating an atmosphere of "panic and apprehension" and asked the Centre not to take any decision that would precipitate a deep crisis in the state.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh directed the Pathankot district administration to ensure the safe return of the Amarnath pilgrims after they were asked to leave Kashmir immediately following intelligence inputs of terror threats to the pilgrimage.Singh asked various departments to facilitate the smooth movement of the pilgrims and tourists shifting out the the Kashmir Valley, an official spokesperson said.The chief minister directed the Pathankot deputy commissioner to coordinate the operations for the safety of the pilgrims once they cross the border into Punjab. He has also asked all the departments concerned to cooperate with the district administration, the spokesperson said.
