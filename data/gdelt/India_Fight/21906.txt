Shah Rukh Khan to return as the villain with Vijay's 'Thalapathy 63'

DNA Afters Hrs was the one one to confirm that Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan is in talks with director Atlee Kumar for a special role in Tamil film 'Thalapathy 63' starring Vijay and Nayanthara. The rumours about SRK working with Atlee began when they were spotted together at an IPL match, recently.

Intially it was being said that Khan would just have a guest appearance in the film however latest reports suggest that it wouldn't be a regular cameo.

A source close to the project informed Pinkvilla, "SRK has a prominent character that he's playing in Thalapathy 63. It's not like his other cameos. In fact, he is the main villain who comes in the picture only towards the climax. He has a good 15 minutes odd role, fighting Vijay. The makers wanted a leading face from the Hindi film industry to shoot for the role and when Atlee approached Shah Rukh for it, he agreed on principle to do it."

If everything goes as planned, the 'Zero' actor will soon be on 'Thalapathy 63' sets. "It's a four-five day shoot and the team is figuring whether to film the scenes in Chennai or in Mumbai itself," the source added.

Besides this project, Atlee also wants to remake his successful Tamil movie 'Mersal' with Shah Rukh Khan.

A source had earlier exclusively told DNA After Hrs, “While meeting SRK for Thalapathy 63, Atlee also bounced off the idea of a possible Hindi remake of Mersal. Incidentally, that film, too, featured Vijay. Shah Rukh has shown an interest in the project. He has asked the director to develop it further, keeping the pan-India audience in mind. But he is yet to take a call on the same.”
