US Approves $2.6 Bln Multi-Mission Chopper Sale to India Amid Tensions With Pak

The Indian government had requisitioned these helicopters last August equipped with multi-mode radars, airborne low-frequency system, multi-spectral targeting system, hellfire missiles, captive air training missiles, advanced precision kill weapons system rockets, MK 54 torpedoes, and naval strike missile emulators.

The sale has been approved by the US at a time when the nuclear-armed South Asian neighbours India, Pakistan have been involved in escalated cross-border conflicts since 14 February when a terrorist attack took down military convoy in Pulwama district of Kashmir killing over 40 Indian military personnel. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group claimed responsibility for the attack. The Indian government blamed Pakistan for supporting the attack. On 26 February, the Indian Air Force jets crossed into Pakistan and dropped a Spice-2000 bomb in Balakot on purported terror infrastructure operated by Jaish. The following day, the air forces of the two countries locked horns with one other.
