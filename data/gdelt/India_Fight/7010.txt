Kashmiri students held, charged with sedition for 'celebrating' Pulwama Attack, making anti-national comments

After 40 CRPF jawans lost their lives in a dastardly attack by terrorists in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday, India has been mourning the death of its Bravehearts.

After the attacks, while on one hand there are reports of Kashmiris based out of Jammu and Kashmir being harassed in several parts of the countries, on the other hand, some Kashmiri students are allegedly making anti-national remarks on social media and celebrating the Pulwama terror attack.

Four female paramedical students of Kashmiri-origin have been slapped with sedition charges after being suspended from a private institute here for allegedly celebrating the Pulwama terror attack by posting "anti-national" messages on an instant messaging app, officials said Sunday. The Aligarh Muslim University has also suspended an undergraduate Kashmiri student for his alleged objectionable tweet in connection with the Pulwama attack. Silimar incidents have also taken place elsewhere in the country.

Here are a few instances where students and youngsters at large from Kashmir have allegedly made anti-national comments after the cruel attacks.
