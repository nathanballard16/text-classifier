ISLAMABAD, Pakistan: India has handed over the dead body of Shakir Ullah, who was killed by inmates in Jaipur Jail, to Pakistan on Saturday, the Dispatch News Desk (DND) News Agency reported.

The family members of the deceased received the body at the Wagah Border.

Shakir Ullah was killed by inmates at Jaipur Central Jail in India last month in retaliation of the Pulwama incident. The government of Pakistan condemned the incident and requested India to immediately provide the details of inquiry of the murder and post-mortem report, which have not been provided so far.

“Pakistan reiterates its demand that the culprits must be taken to task, findings of the inquiry and post mortem report may be shared urgently and to ensure safety of all Pakistanis, especially Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails to prevent recurrence of such tragic and reprehensible incidents,” said the Foreign Office Spokesman Dr Mohammad Faisal.
