It's been 5 months since Shah Rukh Khan's last film, Zero hit the screens and still the actor hasn't announced his next film as yet. While initially he was supposed to begin work on Rakesh Sharma biopic, Saare Jahan Se Accha; soon that plan was dropped and talks around his other possible films started doing the rounds be it a Sanjay Leela Bhansali film with Salman Khan or Don 3. However, Shah Rukh in his clarification has been only maintaining in all his interviews that he's just not in the mood to take up any film at this point in time and that he wants to utilise this time in spending time with his family and unwind a little.

Well, but here's a surprise for all you Shah Rukh Khan fans! So what if he's not doing a film as of now; the superstar has begun shooting for the second season of TED Talks India. Yes, a picture has just leaked from the sets of the show where you can see SRK taking the center stage and doing what he's best at. Just how exciting is it to know that there's finally something coming up from Shah Rukh's side!

DNA quoted a source confirming, "SRK will shoot for it continuously for the next 12 days at Filmistan. It will be telecast on Sundays only, but either in the morning at 11 am, the same slot which had Aamir Khan’s Satyamev Jayate or in the evening at 8 pm. That’s because at 7 pm, they already have another property, the supernatural show Divya Drishti" The report also suggests names like Bani J as one of the speakers approached for this upcoming season.

With that, guess SRK fans finally have something to look forward to. Do share your thoughts by tweeting to us @zoomtv and keep watching this space for more updates.
