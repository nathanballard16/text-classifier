Army jawan killed in Pakistan firing at LoC along Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch

A soldier was killed and four others were injured in firing by Pakistan in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district on Tuesday.

“Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation along the Line of Control (LoC) in Mendhar and Krishna Ghati sectors of Poonch district on Tuesday,” Defence spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said.

Naik Ravi Ranjan Kumar Singh, 36, was killed in the firing. Singh belonged to Rotasa district of Bihar. The injured have been shifted to the Command Hospital in Udhampur.

The Indian Army responded to the firing. “Posts of Pakistan army have been damaged seriously and their soldiers have also been killed in retaliation by our troops,” Col Anand added.

Pakistan had last week accused the Indian forces of killing three of its soldiers in an alleged ceasefire violation, and had summoned India’s deputy high commissioner, Gaurav Ahluwalia, to protest against it.

Director general (South Asia and SAARC) Mohammad Faisal, who is also the Pakistan foreign ministry spokesperson, summoned Ahluwalia and “condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations by the Indian forces on August 15 in Lipa and Battal Sectors”, the Foreign Office said in a statement.

Faisal claimed the Indian forces along the LoC and working boundary have “continuously been violating the 2003 ceasefire arrangement, which needs to be respected”. “The ceasefire violations by India are a threat to regional peace and security and may lead to a strategic miscalculation,” he said.
