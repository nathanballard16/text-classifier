‘Fake news has to be stopped jointly’

NEW DELHI: I&B minister Prakash Javadekar on Thursday said fake news was more dangerous than paid news and the government and the media should combat it jointly.“Fake news has to be stopped and that is our joint work. It is not just the government’s job, it is everybody’s job. Those who are in the business of genuine news, they all must strive hard (to combat it),” the minister said.However, he said the government would not take any step to curb media freedom and suggested there should be self-regulation of over-the-top platforms (OTT), like there was for print, electronic media and films. OTT platforms include news portals and also ‘streamers’ such as Hotstar Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which are accessible over the internet.Javadekar said several mainstream media outlets had conveyed to the government that there was no level-playing field with OTT platforms being completely unregulated“I have sought suggestions on how to deal with this because there are regular feature films coming on OTT — good, bad and ugly. So how to deal with this, who should monitor, who should regulate. There is no certification body for OTT platforms and likewise news portals also,” the minister said.
