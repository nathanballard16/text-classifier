Gujarat: Short circuit triggers fire at Thaltej hospital

Only four days after a residential building in Gota caught fire and one woman died while other residents sustained burn injuries, another fire incident took place on Tuesday morning. This time inside a hospital in Thaltej area. The patients and hospital staff managed to evacuate the building before the fire could spread and no casualty was reported.

The incident took place at Samarpan hospital around 1.55pm. As per fire officials, the fire broke out in an electric meter due to short circuit. The box was located on the first floor next to the stairs.

The hospital staff noticed the smoke in time and informed the Ahmedabad Fire and Emergency Service (AFES) department. Seven fire trucks were rushed to the spot with more than 50 firefighters to bring the situation under control.

"When smoke started coming out of the meter, the hospital staff, without wasting any time, evacuated the everyone from the building and took them to a safe place before we arrived," said chief fire officer MF Dastoor.

"The situation was brought under control by our team within half an hour. We suspect that lack of maintenance of the electric meter led to the incident. Electric wires caught fire and smoke started coming out of it. The fire didn't spread, it was the smoke which created the panic."
