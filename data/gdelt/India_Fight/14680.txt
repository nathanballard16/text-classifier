There has been increased activity on the LOC since Indian jets crossed into Pakistan and targeted Jaish terror camps in Balakot.

The development comes days after Pakistan Air Force’s fighter jets had violated Indian air space but were prevented from damaging targets by IAF jets. In the resulting air combat, IAF says it shot down a Pakistan Air Force F-16 fighter jet. However, IAF’s own MiG-21 Bison was also hit and the pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan landed across LoC. Amidst international pressure, Pakistan handed back the IAF pilot in two days. Pakistan’s drones have regularly been trying to enter Indian territory and have been shot down each time in the last few days.

On February 14, a JeM terrorist carried out a deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, killing 40 CRPF personnel. India on its part carried out non-military preemptive airstrikes in Pakistan’s Balakot in the early hours of February 26. IAF’s Mirage 2000 fighter jets destroyed the biggest JeM terror training camp by dropped Israeli SPICE-2000 laser guided bombs.
