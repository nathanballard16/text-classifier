Filmmaker AR Murugadoss is known for his interesting casting choices, especially when it comes to roping in actors to play antagonists in his film. From Neil Nithin Mukesh in Kaththi to Anurag Kashyap in Akira and SJ Suryah in Spyder, he’s always defied the norm when it comes to picking his antagonists.

The latest update is that actor Prateik Babbar has been signed to play the antagonist in superstar Rajinikanth’s Darbar, which is currently being shot in Mumbai. The film, which also stars Nayanthara as the leading lady, marks Rajinikanth’s return to playing a cop after two decades.

Prateik will join the sets from Sunday. Apparently, Murugadoss was impressed by Prateik in Baaghi 2 and decided to cast him. Interestingly, Prateik won’t play the main antagonist will be seen playing the son of the actor who plays the primary villain.

On being signed for the project, Prateik told Mumbai Mirror: “It has been my aspiration to share screen space with a legend like Rajinikanth sir. I can’t wait to meet him and observe him on set. I have been appreciated for my characters with grey shades and I am investing my 200 percent in this role because it’s an opportunity of a lifetime.”

Anirudh Ravichander has been confirmed to compose music. While Santosh Sivan will crank the camera, Sreekar Prasad will take care of editing. The film was originally supposed to be bankrolled by Sun Pictures, who backed out after the recent Sarkar controversy. Lyca Productions, the makers of 2.0, took over the reins of the project and are going all out to make this a lavish project. This would be the third outing for Lyca Productions with Rajinikanth after Kaala and 2.0.
