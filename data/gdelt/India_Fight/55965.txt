The 1971 war started on December 3 and lasted for 13 days. The war officially ended on December 16, post which Pakistan surrendered to the Indian Armed forces. On December 16, 1971, General AA Khan Niazi, chief of the Pakistan Army, had surrendered along with 93,000 troops to the allied forces of the Indian Army and Bangladesh’s Mukti Bahini. This day is celebrated as Vijay Diwas or victory day.

India pays tribute to soldiers, who sacrificed their lives, on this day.

“I salute the bravery, courage and valour of Indian soldiers on Vijay Diwas. The history that was made by our armed forces on this day in 1971 will always be engraved in the golden letters,” PM Modi tweeted in Hindi.
