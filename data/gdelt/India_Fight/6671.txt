Family members, government officials, politicians and the general public joined the procession, which began at 9 am in Karhai village.

Rawat's daughter Apoorva, who works for a private airline company in Delhi, and his other family members hoped his sacrifice would not go waste. They hoped Pakistan would get a fitting reply from India following the attack.

Members of the family have offered land in the village for a memorial for Rawat.
