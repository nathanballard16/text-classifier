Both names on screen when channel aired debate

NOIDA: Video grabs of the TV debate deemed defamatory to the UP CM, which was aired on June 6 and has led to the arrest of three staffers of a Noida-based Hindi news channel, show the broadcast happened with the ‘Network 10’ logo, for which the channel had permission from the information and broadcasting ministry. However, there was also a line on one corner of the screen that directed viewers to the website of Nation Live, the channel’s new name for which it said it had sought permission.The I&B ministry notice to the channel has said it was using dual logos, which was illegal.The logo is important because one of the two FIRs in which four employees of the channel have been booked pertains to lack of permits and invokes sections of cheating and forgery. Police had said they had taken action because they found no permissions for Nation Live, the name emblazoned on the front door of the channel’s now-sealed office.The FIR contends Nation Live was being run illegally on the licence of Network 10 and that Ishika Singh, one of the arrested trio, and her associates had no relation with the company owning Network 10. Documents in possession of TOI include a content-sharing agreement between the directors of Network 10 and Ishika, director of BR Media Services Private Limited, which the channel appointed as its agency.An investor in the channel told TOI they had recently signed the content-sharing agreement and applied for a name change of the channel on February 14, 2019.Ishika’s lawyer KK Singh told TOI the documents in their possession showed the channel had all requisite permissions and charges in the FIR pertaining to lack of permissions do not hold.
