Bhupesh Baghel, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister on Wednesday paid tributes to Bhima Mandavi, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA, along with his driver and three personal security officers, who were killed in Naxal attack on Tuesday.

The mortal remains of Mr Mandavi were brought to the BJP’s office in Dantewada.

On Tuesday, Naxals attacked the BJP convoy in which Bhima Mandavi was travelling and killed all five including his driver and three PSOs.

Mr Baghel had condemned the attack but had also denied any security failure.
