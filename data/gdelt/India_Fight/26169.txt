Stray incidents of violence disrupt West Bengal polls

Kolkata: An estimated 32.06 per cent of over 1.49 crore electorate exercised Sunday their franchise till 11.00am in nine Lok Sabha seats of West Bengal, amid reports of EVM glitches and stray incidents of violence.

Sporadic clashes were reported in Kolkata and its surrounding areas, with TMC workers claiming that voters were being intimidated by the central forces outside booths.

BJP candidate Nilanjan Roy in Diamond Harbour constituency alleged that his car was vandalized in Budge Budge area. Similar reports also arrived from Jadavpur constituency, where BJP candidate Anupam Hazra’s car came under the attack of unidentified men.

Of the nine constituencies, Barasat recorded the highest turnout at 36.94 per cent while Kolkata (South) the lowest at 27.69 per cent.

“There were also reports of EVM glitches in several polling stations. We have sent reserve EVMs to the booths, where the voting process was temporarily hampered due to technical problems,” the official added.
