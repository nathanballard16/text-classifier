Hours after Congress attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the government hit back alleging that the party speaks on the same lines as Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and was trying to weaken the morale of the country.

"Intentions might be different but the tone of Imran Khan and the Congress spokespersons was same. Today, there would have been celebrations in Pakistan as our leading opposition party has said the same things as their Prime Minister," said Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad while addressing the media on Thursday.

Sharpening his attack at the Congress party, Prasad added, "When the whole country is one, when country after country is passing resolutions condemning the Pulwama attack and standing firmly with India, at such a critical moment, the true face of Congress party appears, seeking to weaken the morale of the country."
