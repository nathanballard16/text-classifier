Tirupur victims of Delhi hotel blaze had gone to meet buyer

Tirupur: Two employees of a knitwear export company in the city were among the 17 people killed in a fire at a private hotel in New Delhi on Tuesday. Some of family members of the deceased have reached the national capital to receive the mortal remains.

The deceased were identified as S Aravind, 45, of Rakkiyampalayam near Thirumuruganpoondi and K Nanda Kumar, 32, of Somanur in Coimbatore district. Both were working as merchandisers with a knitwear manufacturing unit of a leading export company near the new bus stand here.

“The two had gone to Delhi on Monday to meet a buyer,” said manager of the unit, requesting anonymity.

After the meeting, the two stayed in a private hotel at Karol Bagh. They were to catch a return flight on Tuesday morning. But as ill luck would have it, a fire broke out at the hotel on the early hours of Tuesday, killing them both.

Tamil Nadu House in Delhi has confirmed their deaths. “The bodies are kept in a government hospital after postmortem,” a source said.

The knitwear company, meanwhile, has coordinated with the family members of the deceased and helped a few of them fly to Delhi, where police would hand them over the bodies.

“It’s unfortunate that they died while on duty. Nanda Kumar often used to travel to meet buyers on behalf of the knitwear company. Though a native of Somanur, he has been living with his wife and a three-year-old son on Kongu main road. Before leaving for Delhi, he had dropped his wife and the child at his father’s house in Somanur,” said a relative of Nanda Kumar. “The state government and the company should come forward to provide reasonable monetary as well as other supports to his family.”

Meanwhile, the district administration has submitted a preliminary report to the state government regarding the deaths.
