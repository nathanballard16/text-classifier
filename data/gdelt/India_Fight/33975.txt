A 16-year-old girl, who went missing from Chennai, has approached the police stating that she was held hostage and raped. The police have arrested three women – Sabeena (31), Mubeena Begum (37) and Nisha (36) – in connection with the crime.

According to reports, the teenager who was living with her mother and grandmother in Pulianthope area in Chennai allegedly fought with her grandmother and moved out of her house to a friend Sabeena’s house on July 3.

The girl was searching for a job in the city to support herself and befriended Mubeena Begum, Sabeena’s friend, who promised to help her get a job. The two women allegedly took the girl to Nisha’s house and locked her up on July 3.

When she was confined to Nisha’s house, five men entered the room and gangraped her for three days, according to reports. The girl, who escaped from the place after three days, called her mother and narrated her ordeal. Meanwhile her mother had also filed a ‘missing person’ complaint with the local police. The police suspect Sabeena and the other two women to be a part of a prostitution racket and are questioning them. Though an FIR has been registered, charges of rape has not been included in it. According to the police, Sabeena and Mubeena Begum cheated the girl with promise of employment while Nisha confined her in her house and hence rape charges can be added to the FIR only after questioning. The police are also inquiring the women about the five men who had allegedly raped the teen.

Speaking to TNM about the case, a police officer from Pulianthope All Women’s Police Station said that police officials are still questioning the women and refused to disclose any details about the FIR.
