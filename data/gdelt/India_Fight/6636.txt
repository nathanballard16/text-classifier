YAVATMAL (Maharashtra): Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday continued his attack on Pakistan for his complicity on the issue of terror and said the western neighbour is on the verge of bankruptcy and is now known all over as an ‘alternative name for terrorism’.

“The other name of terrorism is Pakistan today,” Prime Minister said assuring the nation that a befitting reply will be given to the perpetrators of the February 14 dastardly act at Pulwama.”How those responsible for Pulwama attack and the hands behind will be punished, the strategy, scale, time and location of the punishment will be decided our brave Jawans,” he said adding the country feels proud of them and also rests immense faith on them.

“The sacrifices made by our forces and CRPF personnel will not go waste. Perpetrators will be punished definitely,” he said.

Maintaining that the anguish of the country and CRPF force in particular is understandable and hence the armed forces have been given free hand.
