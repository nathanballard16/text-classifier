"We have been receiving complaints regarding sex trade going on in these locations. There were several complaints lodged, following which we carried out the raid," he said.

Six women were rescued from a building's first floor on Rashbehari Avenue, from where the anti-human trafficking unit of the Kolkata Police also arrested four people, who were identified as customers, a brothel owner, and a manager.

A beauty parlour on Mirza Galib Street in the New Market area was also raided and six women were rescued. Six people were arrested from there, he said.
