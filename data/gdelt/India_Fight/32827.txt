Multiple walls collapse in India monsoon rains, killing 31

MUMBAI, India (AP) — Heavy monsoon rains in western India caused at least four walls to collapse onto huts and city shanties, killing at least 31 people and injuring dozens of others, officials said Tuesday, as forecasters warned of more rain.

At least 21 people were killed and more than 60 others injured when a 10-meter (35-foot) wall demarcating an urban forest collapsed during the night in Mumbai, police officer Ravinder Howle said.

Rescue teams with sniffer dogs were searching the area afterward, and rescuers from the Indian navy also fanned out to help and rescue residents of the waterlogged city, India's financial and entertainment capital.

Ten deaths were caused by three wall collapses elsewhere in Maharashtra state.
