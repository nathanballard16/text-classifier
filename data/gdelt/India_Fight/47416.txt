'Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah': Disha Vakani aka Dayaben finally shoots after 2 years; details inside

It has been a confirmed report that Disha Vakani who became a household name with her stint as Dayaben on Taarak Mehta Ka Ooltah Chashmah will be returning on the show after two long years. For the uninitiated, the actor took a sabbatical and has been on maternity leave since the birth of her daughter. Though she has been mentioned in every other episode, Disha did not return due to remuneration issues and other problems with the producers of the show.

Now as per reports in Bombay Times, Disha has shot for the Navratri special episode on TMKOC as hinted earlier on the show. Although Disha did not confirm the report, her husband Mayur Padia spoke about it. He said, "She has shot for a portion of the episode, but our talks with the makers still remain unresolved. So, she will not return to the show for good. We are hoping that we reach an amicable solution."

When producer Asit Modi was asked about it, he told the daily, "Disha has finally shot for a small segment, and hopefully, she will resume shooting for the show full-time. However, I must confess that talks are still on between us, and we hope to reach a solution soon. We have been in talks with Disha for months now. Like I said before, nobody is bigger than the show."

Earlier Asit had also shared that he's open to all kinds of possibilities. He suggested that while the makers are in talks with other popular actors for the part, but also hinted that they're open to having Disha back on the show as well.
