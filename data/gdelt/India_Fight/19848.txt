Sinha, seeking a second term as MP, was accompanied by his wife Punita, Union minister for commerce and industry Suresh Kumar Prabhu and chief minister Raghubar Das In a road show before he filed his papers, Sinha spoke about the achievements of Prime Minister Narendra Modi . “Everyone is impressed by him, which in turn bolstered my morale to take up development works in Hazaribag,” he said.Prabhu, who was here to whip up support for his cabinet colleague, said no one can stop Modi from returning to power. “The works of the NDA government has led to significant development in the country in five years, something the previous governments failed to do,” Prabhu said at the rally at Gandhi Maidan. Describing Sinha as a dynamic minister, Prabhu urged voters to ensure his return to Parliament.Das whipped up nationalistic sentiments by referring to the surgical strikes of 2016 and the recent air-strikes in Balakot after the Pulwama terror attack in February. “India became the third country after the US and Israel to hit terror camps in another country. After the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai in 2008, the UPA government lacked the courage to strike Pakistan,” Das said.Das also said that his government will electrify 32,000 villages once the elections are over. “We are working to make Jharkhand a power-surplus state. The UPA government only got involved in coal scam. Had they not indulged in corruption, the state would already have achieved a power-surplus status,” he added.
