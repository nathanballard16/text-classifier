We have asked deputation of central forces at all polling booths so that free and fair elections can be held in the state," he said.Lat week, due to cases of violence reported from several corners of the poll-bound districts in West Bengal, central force deployment was increased to 100 per cent for the fourth phase.Asansol is one of the two seats won by BJP in 2014. Here TMC candidate and actor Moon Moon Sen is challenging the sitting MP Supriyo.Polling is underway on eight of the 42 seats in the state, including Asansol.
