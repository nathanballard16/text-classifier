While most of B-town is busy attending Diwali bashes one after the other and are in high spirits, Katrina Kaif returned home just in time on Sunday to make the most of the festivities. The actress took a break from her hectic schedule as she was spotted at the Mumbai airport in an all black attire. Donning a pair of oversized sunglasses and her usual poker straight hair, Katrina was all smiles for the camera as she waved to the paparazzi. The 'Bharat' actress made her way through the airport terminal and was thronged by fans who lined up for a selfie with her.

Katrina's airport look included a black turtleneck sweater, black pants and a pair of solid black boots. The actress' look was comfy as she exited the airport without a handbag. Just a few days ago, Katrina shared a picture from the snow-capped mountains of Colorado wearing a similar turtleneck sweater in a bright red colour. Now, that the holiday mode has come to an end, Katrina will be kicking in Diwali with full gusto.
