In a horrific case in Trichy, an engineering college student was murdered in the forest and his girlfriend was sexually assaulted by four men. The girl was admitted to a hospital with severe injuries. Police are searching the four accused men in connection with the incident.

The victim Tamilvanan, son of Kannan, belonged to Dinnakulam in Trichy district near Chirakunnur and was a final year student of private engineering college near Samayapuram. Rani (name changed to protect the identity of the survivor) was studying in the same college. Both the victims were neighbours and studied in the same class.

Both of them had gone visiting the Konalai Malai Matha Temple near Sangapuram on the Chennai-Tiruchi National Highway on a bike on the day of Pongal. They left the temple at 7.30 pm and while returning to their home were stopped by four men in the reserve forest area between Khannarkudi-Pinjay Sunghiandi. The men blocked their bike and took the girl inside the forest area. While Tamilvanan fought with the accused men who strangled him and Tamilvanan succumbed to his wounds. The men then sexually assaulted the girl and left her alone in the forest area.

The girl then informed the ambulance and her parents using her cell phone. Subsequently, the police were reported about the incident. At about 1 pm, the police went to the spot and found the girl with severe injuries. She was then sent to the hospital. Further, the police seized the body of Tamilvanan and sent it to Lalgudi Government Hospital for post mortem. The police are in search of the four accused in connection with this incident.
