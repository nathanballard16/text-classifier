Fugitive celebrity billionaire jeweller wanted over $2.8b fraud arrested after he went to open a bank account

Fugitive billionaire jeweller Nirav Modi, wanted by Indian authorities over a $US2 billion ($2.8 billion) loan fraud at state-run Punjab National Bank (PNB) was remanded in custody after appearing before a British court.

Nirav Modi was arrested after he went into a London bank to open an account.

India asked Britain last August to extradite Modi, 48, whose diamonds have sparkled on famous Hollywood stars, after he was accused of massive bank fraud, charges he denies.

The diamond magnate was arrested in the Holborn area of central London on Tuesday after he went into a bank to open an account and a member of staff contacted police.

On Wednesday, he appeared at London's Westminster Magistrates Court accused by India of two charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and conspiracy to conceal criminal property.
