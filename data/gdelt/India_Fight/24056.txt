Bharat: Katrina reveals how she almost fainted while shooting for the Chashni song

The Bharat fever is on and Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif are coating everyone with love and some “Chashni”. The trailer of the film got a great response and the two recently released a song which also became an instant hit amongst the audience. The second song, titled Chashni, features Salman and Katrina in a romantic setting and the fans are drooling over how perfect the song looks. But shooting for the same wasn’t a cakewalk. Katrina Kaif revealed what went down on the sets of Bharat during the shoot of this particular number.

During a LIVE chat, when Kat was asked about her experience of shooting for Chashni, she said, “For the first time in my life I actually almost fainted. We were shooting in Abu Dhabi and it was extremely hot. It was like 50 degrees out there and you could hardly breathe. The clothes were very heavy! The ghaghra that I am wearing in the song was really heavy.” But she was determined to not faint come what may and finished the shoot like a pro! Well, we can see that on the screen, Kat! Right folks?

Katrina also revealed that even though shooting in Abu Dhabi was really tough the city has always been lucky for the team and the films that they have shot there (Tiger Zinda Hai). As for Bharat, it will arrive in theatres on June 5. Stay tuned to CineBlitz for more updates on this much-awaited film.
