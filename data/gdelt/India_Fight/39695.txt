Arjun Kapoor trolls Katrina Kaif for wearing sunglasses at night; Says, ‘Don’t want you tripping girl’

Arjun Kapoor is the master of trolling because whenever Ranveer Singh, Katrina Kaif, Shraddha Kapoor or even girlfriend Malaika Arora posts a picture on Instagram, Ki & Ka actor is one of the first people to troll the actors by leaving cheeky comments. From asking Malaika Arora to give picture credits to telling his Half Girlfriend co-star Shraddha Kapoor to have caused a sneeze reaction with her photo shoot, there is no one quite like Arjun whose trolling game is always on point.

And today, Arjun Kapoor trolled Katrina Kaif because the moment she posted a photo from her performance in IIFA in which Kat is wearing sunglasses as she dances to Kaala Chashma song on stage, Arjun wrote, “Wear it during the day not at night... Don't want you tripping, girl!” Alongside the photo, Katrina wrote, “IIFA is coming home. Celebrating 20 years of IIFA in Mumbai this year. Performing on the IIFA stage always has most incredible energy. Can't wait. Donning the kala chashma at IIFA Awards, New York. My IIFA moment.” A few days back, on Katrina's birthday, she had posted a photo of herself while crossing the road in Mexico and Arjun commented, “Watch where you going girl! Hope you didn't walk into the pillar while posing.”

Arjun and Katrina’s friendship goes a long way back because when Katrina was shooting for Maine Pyaar Kyu Kiya with Salman Khan, Katrina revealed that Arjun and Varun Dhawan, who were assisting Salman Khan on the film had formed a hate club for Katrina because Salman Khan used to give more attention to Katrina on the sets of the film. On the work front, Arjun Kapoor is busy with the shooting of Ashutosh Gowariker’s Panipat opposite Kriti Sanon and Katrina Kaif is shooting for Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi opposite Akshay Kumar.
