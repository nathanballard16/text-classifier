ISIS Has Claimed That They Control A Province In India, War Is On With Indian Forces

In a development which could worry the government, the Islamic State (IS) claimed that the terror group have established a new “province” in India. The announcement was made after the clashes were reported between terrorists and security forces on May 10 in Kashmir.

“Wilayah of Hind” or India province, is the new branch with an Arabic name and the declaration was made through Amaq News Agency, which is said to be the mouthpiece of the group. The senior police official in J&K, however, rejected the claim.

The director of the SITE Intel Group that tracks Islamic extremists, Rita Katz told PTI: "ISIS declares its new "Hind Province" while claiming clashes with Indian forces in Amshipora". "Of course, the establishment of a 'province' in a region where it has nothing resembling actual governance is absurd, but it should not be written off," she said on Twitter.

ISIS however, didn’t elaborate geographical remits of the branch it mentioned and the announcement is seen as the ISIS’ strategy to give an impression that despite losing almost all territories it held, the terror outfit is strengthening its global affiliation.
