Plastic Se Raksha – Swachhata Hi Suraksha – with this as our motto, we wanted to raise awareness in the society to collect plastic waste and make the surroundings clean and better.

Explaining the disposal process of the waste being collected at Siachen, an official said,

Everytime, we collect the garbage here, the first step is to segregate the waste properly, then the waste is incinerated in a fuel-less incinerator, which is used in the greenhouse here and is maintained by Siachen brigade. The incinerator is used to convert non-metallic waste into manure.
