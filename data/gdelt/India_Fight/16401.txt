New Delhi: A Delhi court Friday sent alleged Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist Sajjad Khan, a close aide of Pulwama attack mastermind Muddasir Khan, to NIA custody till 29 March.

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) had sought his custody for 10 days from Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Syal.

Advocate MS Khan, appearing for Sajjad Khan, opposed the agency's demand.

Sajjad Khan (27), a resident of Pulwama was arrested near the Lajpat Rai market late Thursday night. Mudassir had tasked him with establishing a sleeper cell in Delhi, police said.

Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14 after a JeM suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into their bus.
