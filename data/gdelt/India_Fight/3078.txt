Elephant found dead

Coimbatore: A 12-year-old female elephant was found dead near Maniyarsaiamman temple at Gopanari reserve forest under the Periyanaickenpalayam forest range here on Thursday morning.

The animal, seen in a seven-member herd, used to visit the area for the last 12 years, members of local tribes said. “It slipped from a seven feet high elevation and fell on the ground. It had suffered multiple organ failure, which led to its death,” a forest department official said.

After people from the tribes alerted them, forest department field staff from the range visited the place. Tholampalayam veterinary hospital veterinarian Sulochana conducted postmortem. The carcass was later buried in the same place.

This was the first elephant death reported in the Coimbatore forest range this year, an official said.TNN
