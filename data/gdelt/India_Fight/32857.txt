'Can I fry an egg on your belly in the song?' asked a producer to Mallika Sherawat, here's what she did next

Former Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat is currently in India. She is busy promoting her upcoming web show Boo. Sherawat appeared on Kapil Sharma's Television show, only to reveal an absolutely bizzare incident while she was still working in Hindi films.

Mallika Sherawat went on to reveal that once a producer asked her to fry egg on her belly. She called the producer 'novice' as she went on to say,"Once I was shooting a song for a film. And the producer seemed to be a novice. So he was trying to figure out a way to portray 'Mallika is very hot.' So, he sent an idea through the choreographer - 'Can I fry an egg on your belly in the song?' It's true! The producer's actually asked me this."

Archana Puran Singh then exclaimed, "Oh God", and asked her, "But did you go ahead with it?" Mallika couldn't help but laugh and answer, "No, I didn't."

For the uninitiated, a Hollywood movie named Hot Shots featured one such scene between the lead actor and actress. The actor not only fries eggs, but also sausages on her belly.

Interestingly enough, Mallika has faced such incidents quite often. In a recent interview to Bollywood Hungama she said, "I want to do something different. So in this dance step, aapke kamar pe nah.. main garam garam roti sekunga."

Revealing that she never opted to get intimate with a co-star for a movie, Mallika told PTI, "I was thrown out of projects because heroes would say 'why can't you be intimate with me? You can do it on screen, what's the problem in doing that with me in private?' I've lost so many projects. It's very reflective of the society, what women deal with in our country."
