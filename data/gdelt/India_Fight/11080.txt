PM Modi Urges Citizens to ‘Stand as Rock’ as Indian-Pakistani Standoff Escalates

“The entire country is one today and standing with our soldiers. The world is looking at our collective will and we have faith in our forces’ capacity," Modi said, pledging that India will “fight and win as one”.

The statement comes after UN Spokesperson Stephane Dujarric urged New Delhi and Islamabad on Wednesday to “urgently take steps to lower tensions through meaningful, mutual engagement and meet their responsibilities to maintain peace and security in the region”.

Earlier on Wednesday, India and Pakistan engaged in an air battle, just a day after the IAF carried out an airstrike against a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist camp located in the Pakistani-controlled part of the Kashmir region.
