Karnataka to withdraw around 130 cases related to violence during Tipu Jayanti?

Bengaluru, Dec 16: The BJP government of Karnataka has reportedly planned to withdraw around 130 cases related to violence and attempt to disturb peace during Tipu Jayanti celebrations across Karnataka in past few years.

The cases were filed between 2015 and 2018 when Sangh Parivar activists had unleashed violence to disrupt ipu’s birth anniversary events organised by the then state government.

The Yediyurappa government has already cancelled the celebrations — introduced by the Siddaramaiah government in 2015. Now final discussions are on to complete the process of withdrawing the cases.

According to documents available, the Department of Prosecution and Government Litigations had written to the state government with a list of 14 cases after the government sought its opinion.

About 120 other cases registered in districts such as Kodagu, Dakshina Kannada, Mandya, Shivamogga and Davangere are also expected to be withdrawn by the government.

Highly placed sources said the issue was recently discussed during a meeting chaired by the chief minister with the secretaries of various departments. “A decision will be taken soon,” the source said.

BJP legislator K G Bopaiah had written to Yediyurappa in August, urging him to withdraw cases filed against Hindus during Tipu functions. Soon after, the government had shot off several letters to the department.

The epicentre of protests was Kodagu where demonstrations were held every year against the celebrations. Two persons were killed in violent protests in 2016.
