Mumbai: A close aide to Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Smriti Irani was shot dead in India's northern state of Uttar Pradesh, police said on Sunday.

Srendra Sing, a 50-year-old BJP worker and former village head, was killed in the village of Barauliya in the district of Amethi, around 107 kilometres southeast of Uttar Pradesh's capital Lucknow.

According to police, Singh was shot by unknown gunmen while he was sleeping in his house at night.

"He was sleeping inside his premises when at around 3:00 a.m. (local time) today someone fired upon him. We've taken a few suspects into custody and the probe is on." Amethi Superintendent of Police Rajesh Kumar said. "His body is in Lucknow and after the post-mortem, it would be handed over to his family."

Locals said initially he was taken to the nearest hospital but was later referred to Lucknow where he succumbed to his wounds.

Police said they were looking into the motive behind the killing.

Reports said Singh left his position as village head to campaign for the BJP this year. He had actively participated in Smriti Irani's election campaign.

"Singh was close to Smriti Irani and had earned a lot of praise from the BJP leader in her speeches at public meetings during her campaign," a local resident said.

Smriti Irani defeated Congress party President Rahul Gandhi by over 55,000 votes in Amethi constituency in the recently held country's general elections.
