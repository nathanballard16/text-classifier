A truck driver from Rajasthan was shot dead on Monday by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Shopian, police said. One of the two terrorists involved in the incident is a Pakistani national, police said, adding an operation was launched to track them.

"One terrorist involved in the attack is a Pakistani. An operation has been launched in the area to track down the terrorists," Jammu and Kashmir police chief Dilbagh Singh told NDTV.

The two terrorists attacked the truck and shot dead its driver, identified as Shrief Khan. An orchard owner was also beaten up by them.

The attack was carried out in desperation as the transportation of fruits has picked up in the Valley, police said.

The incident took place on a day the state administration restored postpaid mobile communication that was blocked since August 5, when the centre announced its two massive decisions -- the scrapping of special status to Jammu and Kashmir and the state's bifurcation into two union territories.

Before announcing its move, the centre had taken a slew of precautionary measures - including detention of politicians, extra security and evacuation of tourists -- to prevent backlash. Telephone communication was also suspended.

The state administration is easing restrictions in a phased manner.

State government spokesperson Rohit Kansal on Saturday said restrictions on movement of people have been lifted in "over 99 per cent" areas of the state.

Last week, at least seven people were injured in Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar after a grenade attack by terrorists in a market area. The attack had come days after terrorists had thrown a grenade in south Kashmir's Anantnag, injuring 14.
