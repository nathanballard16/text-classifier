Lucknow: In a recent development in the Uttar Pradesh Bar Council president - Darvesh Yadav's murder case, the deceased's kin have raised questions over the allegedly dodgy probe into the case. The family has written a letter to the Prime Minister, claiming that the direction of the investigation is deliberately being changed by the police.

The family members of the victim have reportedly also claimed that their other relatives are being harassed and unfairly implicated in the case. Meanwhile, no action has been taken against the prime accused in the case, which further strengthens the family's doubts about the investigation. The relatives are demanding a probe by the High Court's sitting judge or by the Central Bureau of Investigation.

On June 12, Darvesh Yadav, president of the Bar Council was shot dead in the Agra's Civil Court. The family have been raising questions on the investigation by Inspector Satish Yadav. According to a report by the Amar Ujala, an official complaint sent to the Prime Minister by the Darvesh Yadav's brother, Punjab Singh claimed that the murder was a pre-planned conspiracy and in order to save the accused, the authorities are harassing Darvesh's relatives.

Meanwhile, Darvesh's family has also mentioned concerns about their own safety as the police have not made any security arrangements to protect them. The family has expressed disappointment with the way the police and government are proceeding in the case. The deceased's nephew Sunny Yadav told Amar Ujala that the police have been constantly interrogating the Yadav family's relatives but the husband and wife duo who are the prime suspects in the case - Vandana and Vineet Gulecha - have still not been arrested.

The police probe is still underway.
