Saudi crown prince arrives in Pakistan with billions at stake

Islamabad: Saudi Arabia's powerful Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has begun a four-day regional visit, arriving in Pakistan on Sunday where Saudi officials signed agreements worth $US20 billion ($28 billion) to help the Islamic nation overcome its financial crisis.

Prime Minister Imran Khan and top government and military officials greeted him at Islamabad's airport, where he received a 21-gun salute. Earlier, Pakistan Air Force jets escorted bin Salman's flight when he entered the country's airspace.

At the airport, a young boy and girl in traditional Pakistani dress handed the prince flowers. He was greeted by a host of Pakistani Cabinet ministers and the country's powerful army chief, General Qamar Javed Bajwa.

Khan himself drove the prince to the prime minister's residence, where he was met by an honour guard.
