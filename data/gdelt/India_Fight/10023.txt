The message was loud and clear when India struck a terrorist camp deep inside Pakistani territory in the wee hours of Tuesday, that India will not allow a repeat of Pulwama.

On Tuesday, India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale along with Ministry of External Affairs' officials met with and engaged envoys and Heads of Mission of all major countries and regional blocs to brief them of the action carried out by India.

Parallel briefings were held for various envoys by FS and divisional Secretaries where the thrust was upon a few areas. Diplomatic sources say that the FS said, "India did not have an option".

France has come out in support of India’s need to have conducted airstrikes and asked Pakistan to end terror activities.

Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale held a media briefing on India's military action where he said, "Credible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country, and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose. In the face of imminent danger, a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary."

This is "unprecedented", said a source.

Comparing it to the Osama operation , an official explained, "It is a paradigm shift in the way India deals with terrorism. Not in Kargil, or even during the 1971 war that India crossed into Pakistani territory. This is comparable only to US' operation to take out Osama Bin Laden."

India also made it clear that the attack was a preemptive, non-military strike targeting militants and not the people or the State of Pakistan.

"This is not against the people of Pakistan but against terrorism", Gokhale told the diplomatic corps.
