From Our Correspondent

GUWAHATI: Sleuths of the Director General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) conducted raids in 28 wood based industries in Arunachal Pradesh.

The DGGI informed that wood-based industries were located at Pasighat, Mebo, Chowkham, Medo, Ruksin and Likabali. Documents regarding mis-declaration and non-payment of GST were seized from these industries.

A majority of products of wood based industries are classified in chapter 44 of the erstwhile Central Excise Tariff act, 1985 and GST Tariff Act, 2017 and these items are taxed in both Central excise and GST.

During central excise regime wood products were charged at 12.5 percent. In the GST regime all goods along with sawn timber attract GST at rates of 5-18 percent.

The Guwahati Zonal Unit of DGGI conducted joint searches at 28 business premises in Arunachal Pradesh.

Many of these wood based industries are not registered under GST and are not paying GST collected on sale of their finished goods. Other units which were registered were grossly mis-declaring and under-valuing their sales.

The DGGI is a premier Pan-India Intelligence Organisation which investigates cases of evasion of Central Excise, Service Tax, GST and commercial and economic frauds.
