Man lynched in India over suspicions of selling beef

New Delhi: A man suspected of selling beef has been beaten to death by a mob in India’s eastern state of Jharkhand, police and news reports said on Monday. Two other men were critically injured.

India’s Hindu majority regards cows as holy and their slaughter is banned in most states, including Jharkhand.

There has been a string of attacks by right-wing Hindus over cattle slaughter and beef consumption in the country in recent years. (DPA)
