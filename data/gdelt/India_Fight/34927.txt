Hafiz Saeed, a UN-designated terrorist whom the US has placed a $10 million bounty on, was arrested for terror finance charges, officials in Pakistan said.

He was arrested by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of Punjab Province in Pakistan.

Saeed, a UN-designated terrorist on whom the US has placed a $10 million bounty, was travelling to Gujranwala from Lahore to get pre-arrest bail in terror financing cases registered against him there when he was arrested, said a CTD official.

The arrest came days before Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's visit to Washington, where he will hold talks with Donald Trump.

Hafiz Saeed, the founder of the terror outfit Lashkar-e-Toiba, has been blamed for the terror attack on Mumbai on November 26, 2008, in which 166 people were killed.
