Has Vicky Kaushal been roped in for the Rakesh Sharma biopic? Here’s what the actor says

Has Vicky Kaushal been roped in for Rakesh Sharma biopic?

Saare Jahan Se Achcha, the biopic of Rakesh Sharma, India’s first space traveller, has been making headlines for a very long time now, courtesy the casting of its lead that has apparently gone through several changes.

The film, to be directed by Mahesh Mathai, was initially supposed to take off with Aamir Khan in the lead. Once the superstar opted out of the project due to unknown reasons, Shah Rukh Khan came on board to play the titular character.

Aamir, however, maintained that he had liked the script and that he felt “sad” for failing to do the film. He also revealed that it was him who had referred it to Shah Rukh. But post the big debacle of Zero (2018), SRK, too, decided to pull back from the big-budgeted venture, a confirmation of which came from the film’s writer Anjum Rajabali.

In the past couple of days, reports in media have speculated on a host of Bollywood A-listers including Kartik Aaryan, Rajkummar Rao and Vicky Kaushal to have been signed for the main role. While Kartik and Rajkummar denied being approached for the project, Vicky, in a recent conversation with Bollywood Hungama, reacted to the news.

Vicky neither accepted nor rejected that he had been offered the film. In a few words, he said that an official announcement would be soon made and that one needed to wait for it. Did he just confirm that he had been roped in? Well, it does seem so!

Vicky was last seen in Uri: The Surgical Strike that became a massive success at the box-office. The film, in its nearly two-month run at the box-office, managed to score over Rs 240 crore. The actor will soon start shooting for Shoojit Sircar’s Udham Singh, a film based on the life of the Indian freedom fighter.
