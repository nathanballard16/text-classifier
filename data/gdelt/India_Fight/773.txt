In the meantime, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan criticized New Delhi for not being ready for a dialogue with Islamabad.

Speaking during his two-day visit to Turkey, Khan called the situation "bizarre."

"We are trying to have a dialogue. Trying to move towards a friendly relationship with India. We had a stand-off with India and India refuses to talk to Pakistan under the pretext that until Pakistan stops terrorism, India will not talk to us," Khan said, adding that, "it's a bizarre situation where we feel how you can move forward if there is no dialogue."
