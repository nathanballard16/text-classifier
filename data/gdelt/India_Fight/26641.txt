India’s poll results a debating point for Pakistanis

AMRITSAR: The outcome of the 2019 Lok Sabha polls’ results on May 23 is being watched with great keenness even in neighbouring Pakistan. The interest in Pakistan is not surprising given the cross-border tension between the two countries and many people in that country having familial links in India.Presumably panicked over Indian Air Force ’s surgical strikes and Balakot air strikes on terror camps inside Pakistan, most of the Pakistani nationals in interviews on social media are voicing their reservations about the return of an NDA government led by Narendra Modi in India . “He shouldn’t come to power, he carried out surgical attacks in Pakistan ...Shahi Alam, a Lahorite, told a Pakistan TV channel.One Aizaz added, “I doubt Modi will come back with majority, I am sure he will get fractured mandate, and that is good for Pakistan.”Some months back, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had said that there may be a better chance of peace talks with India if Prime Minister Narendra Modi wins the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.Riaz, a London based Pakistan businessmen told TOI over phone “People living in Pakistan have different views from that of Pakistanis living abroad. We are of view that Modi should come back to power in India, at least it will act as a deterrent for terrorist organizations operating from Pakistan soil and pressurize the Pakistan government to eradicate terrorism from our motherland.”He said not Indians and Pakistanis living abroad were keenly watching the political developments in India .
