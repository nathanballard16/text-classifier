Police officers were in Kalladka Bhat’s house a day before they killed two Muslim men: HDK

Mangaluru, Dec 22: In a startling revelation, former Karnataka chief minister H D Kumaraswamy today said that a few senior police officers from Mangaluru had been to the house of RSS leader Prabhakar Bhat in Kalladla a day before cops opened fire on people killing two of them and injuring many others.

The revelation comes amidst sharp criticism from leaders and people alike, with commentators saying that police mishandled the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act on December 19.

49-year-old Abdul Jaleel, a resident of Kanduka in Bundar area and 23-year-old Mohammad Nausheen, a resident of Kudroli were ruthlessly gunned down by the police while a few youths were protesting against CAA. Both the victims were not part of protests.

While the police manual clearly says that in such a situation, cops should fire at people below their knees, seven out of eight police bullets hit victims above their waists.

Former Mayor K Ashraf, who was asked to visit the spot by police to control the crowd of a few dozen people, was among those who were injured in police firing.
