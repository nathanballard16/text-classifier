In a fresh twist to the infamous honey trap scandal that rocked Madhya Pradesh after five women were arrested from Bhopal and Indore on September 18 for allegedly blackmailing politicians, bureaucrats and government officials in lieu of concealing their discreetly shot sex tapes, the state police in a post midnight action on Saturday conducted raids at a hotel, dance bar and pub in Indore.

The hotel, dance bar and pub raided belong to Jeetu Soni who also runs an evening tabloid named Sanjha Lokswami. The printing press and office of Sanjha Lokswami have also been sealed.

The action comes after Lokswami published names and pictures in a compromising position of former minister Laxmi Kant Sharma and SK Mishra, the principal secretary and long time confidant of former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Lokswami also simultaneously released portions of their escapades on Youtube.

The state government is concerned over how Lokswami managed to access the videos and fears it could adversely affect its image as many from the present ruling dispensation were also allegedly trapped by the honey trap gang.

The case could have connections to the very top including the chief minister's office as a private hacker who was closely working with the Kamal Nath government was deeply associated with the honey trap gang. The hacker has since been relieved from all responsibilities that he was tasked with.

The police action comes after a principal secretary-rank officer allegedly attempted suicide inside the state secretariat, fearing his video would soon find way into the public domain.

The state police have not commented yet on why the raids were conducted and what has been recovered or sealed.
