The local administration has told Sputnik that villagers were protesting outside of Vedanta's Lanjigarh factory used for aluminium processing. They were seeking jobs in the factory. The situation spiralled out of control and the factory's security personnel had to resort to violent measures to control protesters. The people involved in the protests had earlier lost their land to the mining firm.
