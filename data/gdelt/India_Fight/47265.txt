“The accident occurred around 9 p.m. and we were intimated about it by a passer-by Deore suffered head injuries despite wearing a helmet. We are looking for CCTV footage to find the vehicle. He is survived by two daughters, a son and a wife,” senior police inspector Kashinath Chavan from Taloja police station said.

In another accident on Thane-Belapur road around 3 p.m. on Sunday, Shamiul Wahab (55), a resident of Taloja, was hit while crossing the road in Turbhe.
