A recent blast in Lahore's Township neighbourhood is being reported as an attempt on the life of Talha Saeed, son of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, the mastermind of the 26/11 Mumbai attacks.

But that hasn't been confirmed by the counter-terrorism department of Punjab (the Pakistani province), or by Hafiz Saeed's banned Jamaat-ud-Dawa group.

The blast took place on December 7. At least one person was killed, and six others were injured.

The police said the explosion occurred at about 7.50 pm in front of a refridgerator workshop in Township.

Talha Saeed was to attend a religious conference being held near the site of the blast as chief guest.

"According to the initial investigation, it seems that a compressor blew up. Pieces of compressor have been found," reads a statement from the Punjab Counter Terrorism Department.

"No traces of explosives have been found."
