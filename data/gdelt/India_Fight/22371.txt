Three held for killing man over extramarital affair

RAJKOT: Three accused who had allegedly murdered a 25-year-old man over an extramarital affair in Kansumara village on the outskirts of Jamnagar on Sunday were arrested on Thursday. The accused were identified as Sagraj Hajani, Viha Hajani and Hemsur Hajani. They had allegedly clubbed and stabbed Jalan Hajani to death for continuing his relationship with his former wife who was married off to Sagraj Hajani.According to police, Hajani had earlier married a woman named Pali who had eloped with the victim’s elder brother Beejkaran. However, both families reached a truce, and the victim’s wife, Kuwar, had been married off to Sagraj as part of the appeasement process. “However, Jalan and Kuwar continued their relationship as husband and wife which angered Sagraj and he decided to kill Jalan,” said R J Pandor, inspector with Jamnagar C division police station. tnn
