SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Four people were wounded Sunday after the armies of India and Pakistan exchanged heavy shelling along the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir, officials said.

The two sides exchanged fire in Kamalkote of Uri in Baramulla district, about 102 km west of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Four civilians were wounded today here in firing from Pakistani side," an official said. "The wounded persons were removed to hospital for treatment."

Officials said intermittent exchange of fire was going on between the two sides.

So far there were no reports of damage on the Pakistani side.

Earlier the troops on two sides exchanged heavy shelling and targeted each other's positions in frontier Poonch district, about 180 km southwest of Srinagar.

For the past over a week, there has been a flare-up on LoC in Kashmir. Both Indian as well as Pakistan controlled parts have suffered civilian as well as troop casualties during the skirmishes.

The daily shellings have forced population on both sides of the divide to migrate to safer locations.

The latest tensions between New Delhi and Islamabad grew after India carried out an air strike inside Pakistan, triggering a retaliation. The situation has de-escalated to some extent following calls for restraint from several countries.
