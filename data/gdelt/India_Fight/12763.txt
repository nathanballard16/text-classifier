Balakot airstrike: VK Singh backs Amit Shah claim of 250 casualties

Union minister VK Singh has backed Bharatiya Janata Party chief Amit Shah for the number of casualties in the airstrike on Balakot.

The former Chief of Army Staff said that the actual figure of the attack on Balakot is 250 casualties.

On being asked about the casualty figure in IAF air strikes, Singh said, "The figure is of the attack on Balakot (250 casualty), attack was only at one place, nowhere else. The target was selected carefully, away from residential areas to avoid civilian casualty."

At an event in Ahmedabad on Sunday, Shah had said the Indian Air Force (IAF) air strikes on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot last Tuesday "killed more than 250 terrorists".

Senior Congress leader, Digvijaya Singh, also questioned the Indian airstrike and demanded proof. He tweeted, "Prime minister ji, some of your ministers say 300 terrorists were killed, BJP chief says 250 were killed, Yogi Adityanath says 400 killed, and your minister SS Alhuwalia says not even one died. And you are silent on this topic. The country wants to know who is the liar here. [sic]"

The Minister of State for External Affairs also called on Digvijaya Singh for calling Pulwama attack an accident. He said, "Calling a terrorist attack an 'accident' should NOT be the political discourse in our country. @digvijaya_28 ji, would you call Rajiv Gandhi's assassination an accident? Don't weaken the nation & the morale of our armed forces with these senseless jibes."
