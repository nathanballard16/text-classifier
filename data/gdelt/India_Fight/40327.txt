Bangladesh HC in Delhi pays tributes to Aug 21 attack martyrs

Dhaka, Aug 21 : The Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Wednesday paid homage to the martyrs of the heinous grenade attack at an Awami League rally in 2004 at Bangabandhu Avenue, leaving at least 24 people killed, including Ivy Rahman, and hundreds others injured.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, then the opposition leader, survived the attack targeted against her, but it left her with hearing impairment.

Ivy Rahman, the leader of Mahila Awami League and wife of ex-President Zillur Rahman, was fatally injured as grenades rained into the rally called to protest terrorism that plagued the country under the patronage of the then BNP-Jamaat government.

The New Delhi mission held a discussion meeting to mark the Black Day with acting High Commissioner ATM Rokebul Haque in the chair.

Conducted by minister (Political) AFM Zahid-ul-Islam, it was addressed by Minister (Press) Farid Hossain and Minister (Consular) Selim Md Jahangir.

First Secretary Zakir Ahmed read out a message from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.

The meeting called for early execution of the 2018 verdict in the trial of the attack in which 19 people were sentenced to death and 19 others, including fugitive BNP leader Tariq Rahman, were given life sentence.

A special prayer was held seeking divine blessings for long and healthy life for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and other survivors of the mayhem.
