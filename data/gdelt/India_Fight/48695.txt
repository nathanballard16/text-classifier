Delhi: Police ready to battle Diwali gridlocks in city

Delhi Traffic Police have yet again clarified that festive season cannot be an excuse to violate traffic norms. They warned that violators will receive e-challans with heavy fines at their doorstep, as per the new Motor Vehicle Act.

According to sources, police are keeping an eye on vehicle owners who often park their cars at roadside, and they will be prosecuted. Mail Today has learnt that the traffic police will now issue echallans to the violators digitally.

"Instead of stopping the vehicles and penalising them, photos will be clicked in a manner that the exact violation will be visible to us and e-challans will be sent to the violators via texts," a senior traffic official was quoted as saying.

Taj Hassan, Special Commissioner of Police (Traffic) said it has been analysed that during festive season, be it Dhanteras or Diwali, most of the markets and the nearby areas become standstill due to heavy traffic.

"Apart from a large number of vehicles on roads, parking at the roadside or obstructive or improper parking is the main reason behind heavy traffic across the Capital and suburban roads. This festive season, our focus is to resolve this issue at one go," Hassan said. According to official sources, the main reason behind the heavy traffic is improper parking, a DCP rank officer said. Another senior traffic official said that they have asked the district police to help them in penalising the violators.
