At least five members of one of India’s central armed police forces were killed and three others injured in the state of Chhattisgarh on Wednesday. Police describe such incidents, when a soldier or police officer kills someone he serves with, as 'fratricide'.

“As per preliminary information, an ITBP jawan allegedly fired at his colleagues with his service weapon, killing four of them and injuring three others. Later, the jawan who opened fire was also gunned down,” the official said, adding that the injured were rushed to a nearby hospital and are undergoing treatment.
