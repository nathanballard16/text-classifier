Show unity in times of stress, BJP tells opposition

NEW DELHI: Taking strong offence to the joint statement of 21 opposition parties, BJP on Wednesday urged them to restrain from making statements that create an impression of disunity and could be exploited by Pakistan “My appeal to India’s opposition, let the country speak in one voice. Please introspect, your ill advised statement is being used by Pakistan to bolster its case,” Union minister Arun Jaitley said in response to the allegation by 21 opposition parties that BJP had politicised the killing of 40 CRPF personnel in the Pulwama.At a press conference, Union minister Prakash Javadekar showed clips of debates on Pakistani media to say the hostile neighbour wasted no time to latch on the opposition party’s charge. “As one can see in Pakistani media, the opposition statement has ended up making people of Pakistan, its media and forces happy,” he said.In a tweet, Jaitley rejected the opposition’s accusation, saying, “The cross-border attack in Pulwama was a reality. Balakot operation was India’s anti-terror pre-emptive strike to defend its sovereignty.”BJP has decided to continue with its political events although the focus of its pitch is expected to be on the successful attack on the JeM camp in mainland Pakistan on Tuesday.
