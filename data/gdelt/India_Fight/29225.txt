Gujarat: Major fire breaks out in a closed factory in Vadodara

VADODARA: A major fire broke out at Diamond Power Infrastructure Ltd ’s closed factory at Jarod-Samlaya Road in Savli taluka of Vadodara district late on Sunday evening. Scrap materials and oil drums dumped in the company’s premises caught fire which soon took a major form as dry grass and bushes nearby were also engulfed in flames. According to Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services (VFES) the fire broke out due to unknown reasons sometime after 7.30 pm on Sunday evening.Fire department sources said that since the facility is lying abandoned for over a year, a lot of scrap items had accumulated and its upkeep was also not been done. “There were many drums some of which may contain oil or probably empty and there was waste material as well. Before we could reach and contain the fire, it had spread to the dry grass and bushes,” said a fire official. Around eight to nine fire tenders and vehicles from Makarpura GIDC fire station, Dandiya Bazaar fire station, emergency response centre in Darjipura, Halol municipality and local industries were dispatched to control the fire.Local sources said that two security guards are keeping a watch on the premises and they had sighted the smoke on the backside of the facility. A water bowser from Halol municipality was first to reach there, but as the fire had spread over a large area, they sought help from Vadodara fire department.By late night the flames were so huge that thick smoke bellowing from the fire could be seen from several kilometers away. “We will have to continue our operation for the entire night as it is unlikely that the fire will be brought under control anytime soon,” a fire official said.The company is lying in abandoned condition as its promoters have been declared willful defaulters by banks as they had defaulted on loans of crores of rupees. The enforcement directorate and central bureau of investigation had also investigated into the company.
