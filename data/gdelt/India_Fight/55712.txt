Balakot Was to Tell Pak Terror Attacks Come at Cost: Ex-IAF Chief

The Balakot air strike was meant to warn the Pakistani establishment and terrorist organisations that terror attacks against India would not go unanswered, said former Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa.

He was speaking during a discussion on ‘Understanding The Message of Balakot’ on the second day of the Military Literature Festival organised here by the Punjab government and the Chandigarh administration.

“The message of Balakot, therefore, was to tell Pakistani establishments and terror organisations that there will be a cost to pay for terror attacks in India which was effectively conveyed,” said Dhanoa.

However, he said, “on our side... (there were) stupid mistakes for which remedial measures have been taken and people responsible will be punished.”
