21-year-old student identified as victim of murder-suicide in Surrey

After two people were found dead inside a Surrey home on November 21, the Integrated Homicide Investigation Team (IHIT) has now confirmed that the victims were a 21-year-old woman from India, and an 18-year-old man who was a resident of the Lower Mainland.

In response to media enquiries about last Friday’s #IHIT investigation in #SurreyBC, we can share with you that the homicide victim was a 21yo female from India and the 2nd deceased was a 18yo male resident of the Lower Mainland. We are not looking for further suspects. — IHIT (@HomicideTeam) November 25, 2019

Police said they are not officially releasing the names of the victims, citing privacy laws, but according to Darpan Magazine, the 21-year-old is Indian exchange student Prabhleen Kaur Matharu.

Darpan said she was identified as the victim after her father in India received a call from BC police informing him of her murder.
