Varun Dhawan to shoot a dance sequence at the Wagah Border on Republic Day

Recently, we got to know that Varun Dhawan starrer ABCD 3 will see Shraddha Kapoor in the lead role as Katrina Kaif has opted out of the project. For the unversed, Katrina left it due to her other commitments and her film Bharat. Now, latest Mumbai Mirror report suggests that Varun is all set to shoot a major dance sequence at the Wagah Border on Republic Day and he has already started rehearsals for it. He will perform in front of the live audience at the border. As per the report, the permissions to perform at the border are still being worked out. The report also suggested that one of the participants of Dance 4 (which Remo judges) The V Unbeatable Dance Crew will also perform with Varun and the crew is super excited for the same.

The actor will shoot another song during his stay in Punjab and rehearsals of this song have already started. Punjabi actress Sonam Bajwa who earlier featured in many famous songs such as Super Singh and Sardaarji 2 has been roped in for the special song. The Amritsar schedule will get wrapped up by January 28 and the crew will head to London for the second schedule.

Talking about the movie, Shraddha will be seen playing the role of a professional dancer, representing the Indian contingent. The movie will feature many dance-offs similar to that of the Hollywood franchise Step Up. The movie is produced by Bhushan Kumar and Lizelle D'souze and it will go on floors on January 22 in Amritsar. Reportedly, Shraddha will join the team in London during the second schedule.
