New Delhi, October 3

Fake news is more dangerous than paid news and there is a need for the government and the media to combat it jointly, Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar said today.

The government would, however, not take any step curbing the media freedom, he said.

But there should be some kind of regulation on over-the-top (OTT) platforms, as was the case for films, print and electronic media, he said.

OTT platforms include news portals and “streamers” such as Hotstar, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video, which are accessible over the Internet.

He said several mainstream media outlets had conveyed to the government that there was no level-playing field with OTT platforms being unregulated.

The Press Council of India takes care of the print media, the News Broadcasters Association (NBA) monitors news channels, the Advertising Standards Council of India is for advertising, while the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) takes care of films, he said. “However, there is nothing to regulate OTT platforms,” he said. — PTI
