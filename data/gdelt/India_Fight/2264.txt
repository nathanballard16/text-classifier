Haryana dominates Kabaddi, qualifies for three out of four finals at KIYG

The Haryana girls continued their performance in the U-21 category as well as they beat Uttar Pradesh by a handy margin of 32-26. While the first half was in Haryana's pocket as they managed to ‘dismiss’ UP and pull off an all-out, the second half was a different story as UP made a comeback and managed to effect an all-out on Haryana. But Haryana saved the fort in the nick of time and won the match.
