Samjhauta incident may be raised in ICJ: minister

LAHORE: The Samjhauta Express incident may be taken to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) so the victims’ families could get justice, Railways Minister Sheikh Rashid has said.

“Indian courts have failed to provide justice to the victims,” Rashid said during a news conference at the Railways headquarters on Wednesday. His remarks come a week after an Indian court acquitted the four main accused in the case.

The victims of the February 2007 blast at the Samjhauta Express included over 40 Pakistani citizens. Rashid was the railways minister at the time. “I was minister railways at that time when the Lahore-bound train was targeted by Hindu terrorists in India in which several Pakistani and Indian citizens were killed,” he said.
