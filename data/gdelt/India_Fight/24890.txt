‘THIS’ is what Mreenal Deshraj has to say about Pearl V Puri and Anita Hassanandani’s CHEMISTRY!

MUMBAI: The cast of Naagin 3 share a great bond, and we have often spotted them having a gala time on the sets of the show. As a part of the finale, the actors of all three seasons will be seen coming together to shoot the episode, and from what we hear, it seems to be a grand one!

Arjun Bijlani, Karanvir Bohra, Mouni Roy, Surbhi Jyoti, Pearl V Puri, Anita Hassanandani, and other actors have come on board to shoot the last episode of season 3. As the actors are extremely active on social media, they have posted pictures of how happy they are to meet each other and mentioned that they are loving the time on the sets.

Actress Mreenal Deshraj, who was also a part of the Naagin series, is also shooting for the finale. She took to social media to share Pearl and Anita’s sequence from Naagin and captioned the post saying that two of her favourite people are doing what they do best!

Take a look.

Way to go, Pearl and Anita!
