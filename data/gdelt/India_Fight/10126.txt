On Feb 14, 40 Indian Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) soldiers were killed in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama area.

Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists were behind the attack.

The incident triggered massive protests and condemnation across the nation.

India blamed Pakistan for the incident.
