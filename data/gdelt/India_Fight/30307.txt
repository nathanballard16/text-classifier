A day after fire, fears remain as residents worry about their houses

Ludhiana: A day after the major fire incident in two industrial units at Noorwala Road, residents of the locality are still in shock. Since the buildings where gutted, people are now worried that if the buildings collapse, it will be a major problem because most of the houses share the common walls.

On Saturday morning, two to three fire tenders reached the area after people reported them of smoke coming out of A K Sanon Knitwears.

The fire officials claimed that since it was a major fire, the smoke kept coming out of the burnt material.

The sub fire officer at the Sunder Nagar fire station, Aatish Rai, said people were calling again and again for complaining about smoke and flames in the building.

He said they had sent three fire tenders in the morning.

“The structure of the building is weak and we cannot allow anybody to enter the area to check. Therefore, firemen spilled water from the outside,” he said.

Meanwhile, Satinder Singh, a resident of the area, said people were panic because the building of the Vinayak Fabrics was completely damaged and may collapse anytime.

“Similar is the condition of the other unit, therefore, people have not been able to sleep,” he said.

He said owners of the factories situated near the two units shifted their material to some other place in the morning in order to avoid any untoward incident.

Amandeep Kaur, another resident, said nobody was entering the buildings because of the condition and even the firemen refused to go inside.

She said people were told to cross the street carefully as the parapet of A K Sanon Knitwears had gone weak.

It was a tough time for people living in a few houses constructed adjoining the Vinayak Fabrics because one portion of the roof of the unit had collapsed. They are afraid of their houses being damaged. They have kept their belongings outside their houses to avoid any loss.
