New Delhi: On the eve of the swearing-in ceremony, Prime Minister-designate Narendra Modi met Arun Jaitley at latter's residence in New Delhi. He reportedly requested him to 'reconsider' his decision to not be a part of the new government. According to reports, Modi reached Jaitley's residence at 8.30 pm and left at about 9.20 pm. Earlier today, Jaitley wrote to Modi requesting that he be not made a minister under the new government.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi will drive down to Arun Jaitley's residence around 8.30 pm today. Modi is likely to ask Arun Jaitley to reconsider his earlier decision and remain in the government," news agency ANI earlier cited sources as saying. "Prime Minister Narendra Modi leaves from the residence of Arun Jaitley," ANI reported at 9.17 pm.

Earlier today, Jaitley wrote to Modi requesting that he be kept out of the new Cabinet. Citing health reasons, Jaitley said, "During the last 18 months, I have had some serious health challenges. My doctors have enabled me to emerge out of most of them. After the campaign had concluded and you were leaving for Kedarnath, I had orally informed you that even though I was able to discharge the responsibilities assigned to me during the campaign, I would in future, for some time, like to keep away from any responsibility."

Meanwhile, citing sources, Times Now channel further reported that the names of Piyush Goyal and BJP chief Amit Shah were doing the rounds to replace Jaitley in the Ministry of Finanace. While Goyal has handled the Ministry of Finance in absence of Jaitley, Shah may have to move out of his organisational roles within the BJP to be inducted into the Cabinet.
