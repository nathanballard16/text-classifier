Large crowd attends services for 4 West Chester homicide victims

A candlelight vigil that included a march from the location of the homicides to the temple on Tylersville Road was held Friday evening. A poster carried by those who participated reading “Forever in Our Hearts” was still in the window of the temple on Saturday.

According to a Butler County Coroner’s Office preliminary autopsy report, Hakiakat Singh Pannag was found in bed with his head on a pillow on his left side. He had been shot in the head eight times, but the autopsy report details just six of those shots.

His wife, Parmjit Kaur, was shot four times in the head and once in the arm. She was found laying on the living room floor.

The other two victims also were found in the living room and appeared to be dressed in night clothes. Shalinderjit Kaur was shot three times in the head. Amarjit Kaur, who was visiting from India, was shot twice in the head.

In the weeks since the deaths, which are classified as homicides by the coroner’s office, police have searched the residence as will as another nearby. A pond behind the apartment building was searched with boats and divers.
