German fire safety show moves from winter to summer

German fire safety tradeshow, FeuerTrutz 2020, will move from winter to a summer date, 24-25 June, for its 2020 edition at at Exhibition Centre Nuremberg.

A relocation to Halls 4 and 4A gives more room for anticipated growth, organisers say.

The exhibition has been taking place since 2011 in Nuremberg and the 2019 edition brought together 315 exhibitors from 21 countries and 9,000 trade visitors.

For 2020 FeuerTrutz will run concurrently with the popular Fire Protection Congress in the adjacent Nuremberg Convention Center Ost. Organisers anticipated the congress will be the biggest for fire safety experts in the German-speaking regions.

“Holding the event in June offers us a lot of opportunities to improve the content. We will be better able to address current industry trends and integrate them into the event programme. The relocation into Halls 4 and 4A will also enable us to meet requests by many exhibitors for larger stands,” said Stefan Dittrich, Director FeuerTrutz at NürnbergMesse.

With the new 2020 June date, organisers reason that FeuerTrutz will not be so close in the calendar to other construction industry events, making tradefair planning and preparation easier for many exhibitors.

NürnbergMesse has established and proven expertise in the safety and security field. With events such as Enforce Tac – Tradefair for Law Enforcement, it-sa, and it-sa India – Tradefairs for IT Security, FeuerTRUTZ – Tradefair for Preventive Fire Protection as well as Perimeter Protection – Tradefair for Perimeter Protection, FIRE & SECURITY INDIA EXPO and also U.T.SEC – Summit for Drones, Unmanned Technologies & Security.
