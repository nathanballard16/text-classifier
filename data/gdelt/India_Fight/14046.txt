Mumbai: A humongous art piece has been installed in Mumbai to remind the people of the after-effects of using plastic. The art piece resembles a monster and intends to create awareness about the dangers of using and disposing plastic.

The art piece is entirely made out of discarded plastic and can be spotted on the Bandra-Worli sea link. The monster is 27-feet tall and intends to inform people about the ill-effects of discarding plastic. The installation will stay on the shore till March 15.

The thought behind the black beast is that it is the personification of all the dangers that plastic imposes on the environment and the people. Meant to grab attention, the art installation has been named 'It never goes away', it intends to lay emphasis on how plastic never decomposes and eventually returns in the form of garbage washed on the shore and micro-plastics in the food chain.

The art piece has been conceptualised by the Floating canvas company. While talking to Mirror Now, the founder of the Floating Canvas Company, Sage, revealed the thought process behind the art piece. He said that he decided to give it a human demeanor to emphasize on the fact that humans are the real monsters.

Though the Maharashtra government had banned plastic in April 2018, the capital is still fighting its battle against it. Almost 50,000 kg plastic waste was cleared from various well known beached in Mumbai in a single day. Despite continuous efforts made to reduce the usage of plastic and its disposal, there seems to be no significant change in the same.
