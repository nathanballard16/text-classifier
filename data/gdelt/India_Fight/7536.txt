Chennai: In an incident causing sensation in the Koyambedu wholesale flower market, a young girl was murdered in cold blood over a petty fight due to the absence of chicken in the biryani served to her.

There are many shops in Chennai’s Koyambedu wholesale flower market complex. Flowers brought from different places are sold to the traders here in bulk. Those dealing in flowers come every day from the different satellite colonies to make their bulk purchases. Since there are shops selling garlands as well, this market is abuzz with activity from early morning till night.

On Monday night, a girl, about 25-years-old and a boy purchased a packet of biryani from one of the roadside shops and were consuming it sitting inside the market area.

At that time, the girl had complained to the boy that the biryani being consumed by them does not have any chicken piece in it. This led to a heated argument between the two. Enraged, the boy attacked her fiercely and then pulled out a knife he had kept hidden and slashed the girl’s neck. Profusely bleeding, the girl shrieked and died on the spot.
