IAF pilots like Abhinandan flying outdated jets because of you: Rahul hits out at PM

New Delhi [India], Mar 2 (ANI): Congress president Rahul Gandhi hit out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday over the 'delay' in the delivery of Rafale jets, claiming that Indian Air Force pilots like Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman were "risking their lives by flying outdated jets."

Rahul also claimed that Prime Minister Modi was "solely responsible" for the "delay" in the arrival of the Rafale jets.

Dear PM,



Have you no shame at all?



YOU stole 30,000 Cr and gave it to your friend Anil.



YOU are solely responsible for the delay in the arrival of the RAFALE jets.



YOU are WHY brave IAF pilots like Wing Cdr. Abhinandan, are risking their lives flying outdated jets. https://t.co/BrzAuFTlFu — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) March 2, 2019





Earlier, the Prime Minister, while addressing an event in the national capital, opined that things would have panned out differently in the last few days if India had acquired Rafale jets.

His remark came after a MiG 21 being piloted by Wing Commander Abhinandan was shot down after it crossed over to the Pakistani side while chasing Pakistani F-16 fighters, which had transgressed into the Indian airspace on Wednesday.

Prime Minister Modi, while speaking at the India Today Conclave here, said: “Today, the entire nation has felt the absence of Rafale. Had we got Rafale, the result today could have been different. Initially, people were doing ‘Swaarthneeti’ on it. Today they are doing politics on the same. The country has suffered a lot because of this.”

Varthaman returned home from Pakistan on Friday, two days after he was taken into custody by Pakistan Army when his MiG 21 fell in PoK. Earlier today, Abhinandan met Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Air Chief Marshal Birender Singh Dhanoa. (ANI)
