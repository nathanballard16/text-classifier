CBI to conclude investigation against Jagdish Tytler in two months

New Delhi (India) Mar 8 (ANI): The Central Bureau of Investigation on Friday informed a Delhi Court that the probe against Congress leader Jagdish Tytler in connection with the 1984 anti-Sikh riots would be completed in the next two months.

The premier investigators also filed a report before a single judge bench of the Karkardooma court, presided by Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (ACMM) Amit Arora, with regard to the lie detector test conducted on Abhishek Verma, an eyewitness in the case.

Both the reports were filed before ACMM Arora in a sealed cover.

The matter has been posted for further hearing on May 22.

Verma, a witness in the 1984 Anti-Sikh riots case, had filed a writ complaint with Delhi Police in 2017, requesting them to enhance his police protection following a death threat e-mail.

He is a witness in the case pertaining to the killing of three Sikhs- Badal Singh, Thakur Singh and, Gurcharan Singh - at Gurudwara Pulbangash in North Delhi on November 1, 1984, a day after the assassination of then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi.

Earlier in February, noting the sensitive nature of the matter, the court had directed the CBI to expedite investigations into the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case in which Tytler was given clean chit for his alleged role.

The case against Tytler was one of the three cases the Nanavati Commission had ordered to be reopened by the CBI in 2005. Tytler is accused of leading a mob in the 1984 Pul Bangash case in which three Sikhs were killed.

According to official records, about 2,800 Sikhs were killed across India, including 2,100 in Delhi, during the pogrom that broke out after Indira Gandhi was assassinated by her Sikh bodyguards. (ANI)
