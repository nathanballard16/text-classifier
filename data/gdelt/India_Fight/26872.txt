NEW DELHI: It's a landslide victory for the NDA which is on course to win around 345 seats in the 542/543-member Lok Sabha (election was cancelled in Vellore), while the UPA was at 83, Mahagathbandan 17 and Others at 97. The BJP on its own is close to the 300 mark, while the Congress is hovering at just over 50 seats.With the Modi wave intact for the second election in a row, the saffron party thus looked all set to better its 2014 record across the country. The party had won 282 seats in 2014, with the Congress at 44 seats.Specifically, in the 6 states where the BJP and the Congress are involved in a head-to-head battle in 2019, the election has been more a clash of personalities -- PM Narendra Modi vs Rahul Gandhi -- rather than contest between parties, with the PM coming out on tops. Only a few months ago, the Congress had performed well in state elections in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, but those victories have not translated into any gains for the party in 2019. At the national level, the voter continues to choose Modi over Rahul.The BJP swept the entire state in 2014, winning all 26 Lok Sabha seats, and is set to repeat its performance - leading in all 26 states in the state.BJP president Amit Shah even surpassed the victory margin of senior party leader L K Advani. Shah was ahead of his rival by more than 5.10 lakh votes over Congress's C J Chavda. With this, Shah has left BJP patriarch Advani's 2014 lead of 4.83 lakh votes from the Gandhinagar constituency far behind. As many as 15 BJP candidates were well ahead of their nearest rivals by more than one lakh votes.As many as 64.7% voters exercised their franchise while this time the polling percentage was 64.11.In Rajasthan all 25 seats are headed the BJP+ way in 2019. The BJP is on course to win 24 seats , its ally Rashtriya Loktantrik Party is leading in the other. In 2014 too, the saffron party had swept the state, winning all 25 seats.It's 9 out of 11 for the BJP in Chhattisgarh in 2019 , a loss of 1 seat from 2014. The Congress has managed to secure 2 seats in 2019 -- Korba where Jyotsna Charandas Mahant is the candidate and Bastar where Deepak Baij is contesting - overall failing to capitalise on its assembly poll victory.The 1 seat loss in Chhattisgarh is made up for in Madhya Pradesh where the saffron party is ahead in 28 out of 29 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state, bettering its 2014 tally of 27.The Congress that had hoped to better its Lok Sabha performance after wresting power from the BJP in the assembly polls last year, failed to breach the BJP fortress of Bikaner, Churu, Jhalawar and Jalore where the saffron party has performed well in the last three parliamentary elections. The only seat where the Congress it on top is Chhindwara where Nakul Kamal Nath is the Congress candidate. In 2014, his father had won from the same seat, the other seat in 2014 was won by Congress's Jyotiraditya Scindia; he is however losing in 2019.It's a repeat of the clean sweep in Uttarakhand with the lotus blooming once again in the state. The BJP is set to win all 5 seats here - equaling its 2014 performance. Polling was held in Uttarakhand in the first phase on April 11.Himachal is another state that goes entirely to the BJP, which is winning all 4 seats in the state -- a repeat of its 2014 performance.Overall, the Modi factor has once against come into play in these 6 states -- 97 for the BJP in 2019 vis-a-vis 97 for the BJP in 2014.
