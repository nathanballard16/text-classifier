Monitoring Desk

Tamil actor-filmmaker Raghava Lawrence is all set to enter the Hindi film industry with the remake of Kanchana. According to the latest reports, the actor has already started shooting for the film at a Mumbai resort with Akshay Kumar. For the unversed, Kanchana Hindi remake is about a ghost possessing the hero to avenge those who do wrong. Titled Laaxmi Bomb, the Hindi remake also stars Amitabh Bachchan and Kiara Advani.

Talking about the project, Lawrence said, “Akshay Kumar and I have been in talks for a year and a half toying with the idea of remaking Kanchana in Hindi. And after several discussions, it has come to shape finally. I am improvising the script to suit the present times, Akshay’s image and also Bollywood audience tastes.”

In addition to this, a report in a leading portal suggests that Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan will be seen playing the role of a transgender in the film. In the original Tamil version, Sarathkumar played this part named Kanchana, who gets murdered by the villains.

We hear that the film’s director has been making various changes in the script which may suit the Bollywood audience. It’s for the first time that Big B will be seen in such a role and we cannot wait to see him in one.
