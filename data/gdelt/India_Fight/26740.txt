Top Officer at Indian Air Base That Downed Own Mi-17 Chopper Reassigned – Report

The sources didn't specify where the officer was transferred to or whether his reassignment was related to the reported downing of a friendly helicopter in the Budgam area. The newspaper's sources stressed, however, that the move took place "a couple of weeks ago".

India is currently investigating the cause of the Mi-17's downing and whether it was the result of an error by military personnel at the air base or in the helicopter. The investigative committee declined to specify the date when the probe will be concluded, but media reports claim that preliminary findings indicate that the Mi-17 was flying with the Identify Friend or Foe (IFF) system in standby mode and that air traffic control had failed to direct the aircraft through a blind spot in the air defences as it was supposed to.
