Wanted criminal injured in encounter in Khurda

Nirakarpur: A notorious criminal Jamshed Khan suffered a bullet injury in an encounter at Rameshwar square under Nirakarpur police limits in Khurda district late in Wednesday night.

Khan, who received a bullet on his left leg below the knee, was admitted at Khurda district headquarters hospital (DHH) and later shifted to a Bhubaneswar based hospital as his condition deteriorated.

Four cops also sustained injuries in the gunfight.

According to reports, Khan had been a source of headache for cops. Wednesday Nirakarpur police were tipped off about Khan and his accomplices preparing a blueprint for road robbery.

Acting on a tip off, Nirakarpur and Tangi police conducted a joint raid at Rameswar square. Seeing the cops, Khan in a bid to escape arrest opened fire at the police forcing the latter to retaliate. However, his other accomplices managed to give the cops a slip.

Khan has many cases pending against him at Jinkia, Nirakarpur and Tangi police stations. He is mainly notorious for road robbery, targeting commuters on Kolkata-Chennai National Highway No-16.
