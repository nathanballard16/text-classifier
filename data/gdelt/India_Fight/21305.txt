Bombay HC upholds life sentence for foster brother who murdered sister to pay personal loans

The Bombay High Court has upheld a life sentence imposed on a foster brother for murdering his sister and stealing from her house in order to pay off personal loans.

A division bench of Justice B P Dharmadhikari and Justice Prakash Naik upheld the conviction imposed on Kamal Sharma, who had in the year 2009, murdered his sister Sharda Sharma in Mira road. The bench while confirming the sentence said, "Circumstances clearly show the complete chain of events that single out appellant as accused beyond a reasonable doubt."

As per the prosecution's case, the husband of the deceased tried to contact her before returning home, but she did not answer calls. She did not even open the door. He then called a key maker to open the same. On entering the house, he saw Sharda lying in a pool of blood with injuries on her neck and hands. He immediately called the police, who rushed to the spot and registered a case of murder.

After forensic analysis and testimony of several witnesses, the police arrested Sharma. It was argued by him that the prosecution had failed in examining any eye witness to prove his guilt. However, the prosecution opposed the same citing the chain of events, testimonies and showing fingerprint reports of the accused. The CDR data showed his presence in the vicinity and his ring was found at the crime scene. The recovery of stolen valuables and the fact that he had immediately paid off his loans, proved his involvement, the police said.

The bench after examining the evidence in detail concluded, "Prosecution has succeeded in establishing a chain of circumstances which rules out involvement of any other person as the offender in the matter. We, therefore, uphold the judgment of conviction."
