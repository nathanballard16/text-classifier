‘Will rename LoC as Ceasefire Line’

ISLAMABAD, Aug 14(Agencies): The leader of Pakistan-Administered Kashmir (PAK) on Wednesday said that his government would no longer recognise the Line of Control (LoC) and instead rename it as "Ceasefire Line" after India recently revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.

“We will bring a resolution in the assembly to declare the Line of Control (LoC) as void and instead proclaim it the Ceasefire Line,” Raja Farooq Haider told a special session of Pakistan-Administered Kashmir's (PAK) Legislative Assembly in Muzaffarabad.

The LoC was brokered to end the 1971 war between India and Pakistan. Haider said that the PAK is a buffer between Pakistan and India. “We are fighting Pakistan's war," he said in the presence of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.
