Indian Air Force (IAF) jets crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and destroyed terror camps in Pakistan, sources said. The air strike was carried out in Balakot sector at 3.30 am.

Sources said ten Mirage 2000 aircraft dropped 1,000 kg bombs on terrorist camps across the LoC. As per sources, three control rooms of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) were destroyed in Balakot, Chakoti and Muzzafarabad.

Sources have also said that the Indian intelligence agencies were monitoring as many as 13 launch pads for the last few days. These caps include the one destroyed by the Indian Air Force (IAF) in Balakot.

The strike by the Indian forces comes in less than two weeks after the Pulwama terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir by the Pakistan-based terror outfit JeM where 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said on Twitter: “Wow, if this is true this was not a small strike by any stretch of imagination but will wait for official word, should any be forthcoming.”

On Tuesday, Pakistan Major General Asif Ghafoor alleged that the Indian Air Force (IAF) had violated the Line of Control (LoC).

“Indian aircrafts intruded from Muzafarabad sector. Facing timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force released payload in haste while escaping which fell near Balakot. No casualties or damage,” Ghafoor tweeted.
