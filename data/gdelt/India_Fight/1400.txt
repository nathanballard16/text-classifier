A major fire broke out in a Navi Mumbai highrise late on Thursday. Firefighting operations were still underway at the time of going to press.

According to officials, the fire was reported at around 11.30 p.m. on Thursday on the 14th floor of the Meridien society in Sector Six, Nerul.

Fire Brigade officials said that some scaffolding erected around the building for maintenance work caught fire and started falling to the ground. Residents who had gathered around the building after rushing out were cleared away as they were at risk, officials said.
