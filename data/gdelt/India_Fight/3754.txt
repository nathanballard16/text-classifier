Three men were killed and another was injured when their car fell into a roadside ditch in Chhattigarh’s upcoming capital city of Atal Nagar, police said on Wednesday.

The mishap took place on Tuesday night near Sendh dam after the car driver lost control over the wheel, a local police official told PTI.
