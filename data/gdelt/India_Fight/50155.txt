Woman asks man to give way on road. He punches, abuses her in Delhi's posh Sainik Farms

A woman was allegedly thrashed by an unidentified man in Delhi's posh Sainik Farms area after she asked him to stop blocking the road on Sunday evening.

When the man did not give her way, she pulled down the window glasses and yelled at him, following which, he started abusing her. He then put his hand inside the car and hit the woman on her face. The woman screamed for help but in vain. She also dialled emergency numbers 100 and 112 but even that did not work.

To save herself, the woman then speeded up her car and called her the guard to help her. When the guard arrived the accused had fled the spot. The woman then visited a local police station and lodged a complaint.

The incident happened when the woman, an architect, was returning home from office in the evening.

The woman had also submitted a complaint with the Neb Sarai police station 15 days prior to the attack regarding security in the area.
