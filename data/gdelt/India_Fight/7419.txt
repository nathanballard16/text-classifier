Pulwama attack: Times for talks over, PM Narendra Modi warns Pakistan

Time for talks is over, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan on Monday as he exhorted the world community to take strong measures against terrorism and its supporters. He cautioned that hesitating from taking action against terrorists and its anti-human supporters is "akin to supporting terrorism".

To ensure that the message travels loud and clear across the international community and helps Pakistan's isolation, PM delivered a statement in the presence of visiting Argentine President Mauricio Macri.

Addressing a joint press conference with Macri, Modi said, "I and President Macri are in agreement that terrorism is a very serious threat to global peace and stability. The ghastly terror attack in Pulwama shows that time for talks is over now and the whole world needs to take strong measures against terrorism and its supporters."

A fidayeen attack orchestrated by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed killed 40 soldiers in Pulwama of Kashmir on February 14, prompting New Delhi to step up efforts to corner Islamabad.

"Being a part of G20 countries, it's also important that we implement 11-point agenda of Hamburg Leaders Statement. India and Argentina will issue a special declaration on terrorism today," the PM added.

Fully supporting India's position, President Macri condemned the Pulwama terror attack in the strongest terms and expressed solidarity with the families of CRPF personnel who lost their lives.
