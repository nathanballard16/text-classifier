Yogi Adityanath calls Indian Army 'Modi Sena', Congress demands his apology

New Delhi:

Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath referring to the Indian Army as ‘Modi Sena’ (the army of Prime Minister Narendra Modi) has invited sharp condemnation from the Congress, which said that it was an insult to the armed forces.

Addressing a rally in Ghaziabad on Sunday, Adityanath had said: “Congress ke log aatankvadiyon ko biryani khilate the aur Modi ji ki sena aatankvadiyon ko goli aur gola deti hai (Congress fed terrorists biryani while Modi’s army feeds them bullets and bombs). Congress people use "ji" for terrorists like Masood Azhar but under the leadership of PM Modi, the BJP government is breaking the backs of terrorists by striking their camps.”

Congress leader Priyanka Chaturvedi attacked Yogi Adityanath for "christening" the Indian army as "Modi's army" and demanded his apology.

“Now CM Adityanath has renamed Indian Army as ‘Moid ki Sena’ This is an insult to our armed forces. They are India’s Armed Forces not the private army of Prachaar Mantri. Adityanath must apologise,” she tweeted.

Reacting to the incident, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said “such blatant personalisation and usurping of our beloved Indian Army is an insult and a humiliation”.

"It is shocking to hear the UP CM saying that the Indian Army is the 'Modi Sena'. Such blatant personalisation and usurping of our beloved Indian Army is an insult and a humiliation," the Trinamool Congress supremo tweeted.

"We are proud of our Army. They belong to all. They are a great asset of our nation, and not a cassette of the BJP. People of this country must stand up and reject this statement," she said.

The Congress-led opposition has been trying to corner the Modi government for allegedly trying to gain political mileage from the recent airstrike carried out by the Indian Air Force in Pakistan’s Balakot.
