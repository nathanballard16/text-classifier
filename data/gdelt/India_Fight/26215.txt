New Delhi: The Times Now-VMR Exit Poll has predicted that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led alliance is possibly set to sweep the state of Karnataka, and is expected to win 21 out of the total 28 seats in the state in 2019 Lok Sabha elections. The BJP is expected to win 20 seats, projects the exit poll. As per the exit poll, the Congress-led alliance's victory is likely to be restricted to only eight seats in the state.

Notably, in 2014, BJP had won 17 seats in the state, while the Congress-led alliance had posted a victory in 11 seats (with Congress winning nine seats and the Janata Dal (Secular) winning two). Both BJP and the Congress+ are expected to face a swing of three seats in this year's election, with the saffron party gaining three seats and its opposition Congress losing three.

On the other hand, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) is likely to fail to open its account in the state, much like in 2014 when it had failed to win a single seat in Karnataka.

Meanwhile, the vote share of the BJP is also likely to see an upward swing of 5.5%, predicted the Times Now-VMR Exit Poll. The BJP is expected to gain vote share of 48.5% in the 2019 elections in Karnataka, as opposed to 43% vote share won in 2014.

However, the Congress would probably register nearly 5.2% lower vote share in the Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka, according to the exit poll. Congress' vote share for 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Karnataka is likely to be at 46.6%. The alliance led by the Congress had recorded 51.8% vote share.

The exit poll forecasts that other parties are likely to get 4.1% vote share in Karnataka in the 2019 general elections, as opposed to 4.3 in 2014.

Karnataka has witnessed a two way battle in this general election between the BJP and the Congress-Janata Dal (Secular) alliance, which is currently in power in the state. All 28 seats in Karnataka had gone to polls in two phases – April 18 and 23. Counting of votes will take place on May 23.

The Times Now-VMR Exit Poll 2019 was carried out between April 11 and May 19, 2019. The cumulative sample of the exit poll was 40,000 spread across the country.
