Uri The Surgical Strike Mid Movie Review: Vicky Kaushal’s performance is the highlight so far

On 29th September, 2016 the Indian army conducted surgical strike on "launch-pads" used by militants in Pakistan occupied Kashmir. This was to avenge the 18th September terrorist attack on the headquarters of the Indian Army Brigade in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir. Based on this historical event is Uri The Surgical Strike which stars Vicky Kaushal, Mohit Raina, Yami Gautam in pivotal roles. You definitely expect a lot of nail biting action and ofcourse want to know the details of the surgical strike that happened but one hour into the movie and except for one or two scenes, nothing really moved me. The entire execution of the operation, the military attack and counter attack portions have been very well shot and though the director could have spent a little more energies in the body language of the army personnel’s well.

Coming to performances, Vicky Kaushal as Major Vivaan Singh Shergill is good but not enough to evoke patriotism. On the other hand, Mohit Raina as Colonel Karan makes an impressive debut. Though this is the first half and I am itching to see the climax of the surgical strike which till date in reality has been buried under the classified files by the Indian Army and the Government of India.

Stay tuned for the full movie review and to read if the film leaves me impressed or no!
