'Get Akali MLAs arrested during monsoon session'

JALANDHAR: Four activists have written to Punjab assembly speaker urging him to get Shiromani Akali Dal MLAs , who were booked in cases of blocking national and state highways in December 2017, arrested when they turn up to attend the assembly on August 2.In the letter, activists Balwant Singh Khera, P S Kitna, Kuldeep Singh Khaira and Amarjeet Singh Mann have mentioned that these MLAs were facing cognizable offences as per the FIRs registered against them.The activists told the speaker that police had been keeping an eye on the accused in these cases. "These MLAs did manage to stay away from police net and have been attending the assembly sessions," they wrote in the letter. It was pointed out in the letter that none of the accused MLAs had secured bails.While urging the speaker to inform the police if these MLAs come to attend the session, the activists also requested to issue necessary instructions to the assembly staff in this regard.The letter has also mentioned names of SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who resigned from the assembly after getting elected as MP, apart from other MLAs, including Bikram Singh Majithia, Lakhbir Singh Lodhinangal, Pawan Teenu , Gurpartap Singh Wadala, Baldev Singh Khaira and Dr Sukhwinder Kumar Sukhi.All these SAD MLAs and other Akali leaders were booked when they had blocked some parts of the state protesting against alleged high-handedness of the Congress government in Punjab during municipal polls. SAD president Badal had started a blockade at Harike Pattan bridge on December 7, 2017, after which Akali leaders blocked the roads across the state the next day. This had led to great inconvenience to people in the state and thousands of commuters were left stranded on various national highways.
