A rape victim was set ablaze while traveling to court in India. Five men were arrested; 2 are her alleged rapists.

The district of Unnao is located in Uttar Pradesh, India’s most populous state, which is known for its violence and deteriorating law and order. Earlier this year, a teenager accused a prominent Unnao politician of raping her in 2017, when she approached him for a job. A month later, in July, she was severely injured in a near-fatal car accident, which left two dead. Police investigated whether the lawmaker was connected to the crash, but he wasn’t charged.
