Builder sold same flats to many, arrested

New Delhi, April 3 : A builder who cheated home buyers of about Rs 1.2 crore in Delhi by selling the same flats to many people has been arrested, police said on Wednesday.

Yogesh Kumar Bhati, 37, a resident of Sultanpur village, was taken into custody on Tuesday when the police raided his residence.

"During interrogation, Bhati admitted he sold the same property through sales deed to different persons and received Rs 30 lakh per flat from the buyers. He also took help of some accomplices who are at large," Deputy Commissioner of Police Vijay Kumar said.

"Bhati had been duping buyers for couple of years by using the same modus operandi. He took Rs 1.2 crore from people and sold them flats which had already been sold to others," he said.

Sanjeet Kumar, one such buyer, on March 8 filed a FIR of cheating and fraud against Bhati after he brought a flat which was later found to be sold to another person, the officer said.
