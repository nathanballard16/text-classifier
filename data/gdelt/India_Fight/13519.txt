As the Opposition battles pro-BJP wave post the air strikes in Pakistan's Balakot, formerpresident and UPA chairperson, who was close to hanging her boots, has decided to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha polls from her current seat. Owing to Sonia Gandhi’s poor health that led to frequent cancellation of party meetings and visits to her own constituency, it was speculated that the former Congress chief would quit electoral politics and was likely to be succeeded by her daughter Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who recently entered active politics.The Congress party announced names for 15 candidates – four inand 11 in Uttar Pradesh – late on Thursday evening.Apart from Sonia Gandhi, the candidates from UP features Congress president, who will contest from his home turf, Jharkhand state incharge RPN Singh, who has been fielded from Kushi Nagar, Jitin Prasad from Dhaurahra, Salman Khurshid from Farukhabad, Annu Tandon from Unnao, Imran Masood from Saharanpur, Saleem Iqbal Shervani from Badaun, Rajaram Pal from Akbarpur, Brij Lal Khabri from Jalaun (SC reserved seat) and Nirmal Khatri from Faizabad.In Gujarat, former state cabinet minister Bharatsinh Solanki is set to contest from Anand, Raju Parmar from Ahmedabad (West), Prashant Patel from Vadodara and Ranjit Mohansinh Rathwa from Chhota Udaipur (Scheduled Tribe reserved seat).Top sources in the Congress told Mirror that ‘the party was not in a position to take chances,’ especially in ‘current circumstances’ when Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to have regained much of lost ground over the past three weeks. "Before Pulwama and Balakot things were different. Rafale deal scam had caught on with the people but national security has shot back as the main poll plank. In these circumstances, every seat matters and hence it was decided that Sonia Gandhi will contest the elections," said a senior Congress party functionary.Party leaders said that a final call is yet to be taken whether Priyanka Gandhi will contest the upcoming polls. "For most states the candidate selection process is almost in the last stage and several rounds of deliberations have already been held. The candidate lists for other states too will be announced in the next week or so. There are a few surprises and it is likely some prominent leaders will join the party in the next few days," a senior party leader said requesting anonymity.It is being speculated that Patidar youth leader Hardik Patel is likely to join the Congress during the upcoming Congress Working Committee meeting in Gujarat on March 12, and that he is likely to get a party ticket.
