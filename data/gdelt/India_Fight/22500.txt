India sets off terror alarm in 8 southern states

(MENAFN) Local media revealed that Intelligence and security agencies in India have set off a terror alarm in eight southern states, called Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Puducherry, Kerala, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Goa.



The terror alarm took place in the wake of last Sunday's multiple bomb attacks in Sri Lanka which claimed about 253 people and wounded hundreds of others.



The terror alarm was reportedly launched by the Karnataka police after a local driver tipped them off about the presence of as up to 19 terrorists in southern India who were plotting to conduct terror attacks in those states.



Further information is yet to be released.
