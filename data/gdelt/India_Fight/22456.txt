Malegaon blast accused files papers from Ballia

VARANASI: A 2008 Malegaon blast accused, Major (retired) Ramesh Chandra Upadhyay, filed his nomination papers from Ballia Lok Sabha seat on Friday.He is contesting on Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha’s ticket against BJP candidate Virendra Singh.Supporting BJP candidate from Bhopal Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, he said then ATS chief Hemant Karkare was killed (not martyred) by terrorists due to his own inefficiency.Talking to reporters after filing nomination, Upadhyay said that the term Hindu atankwad (terrorism) was coined by Congress and NCP, and its hollowness could be understood from people’s support to Sadhvi Pragya in Bhopal.“Karkare had tortured Sadhvi Pragya and others due to which 11 out of 12 accused could not walk properly,” he alleged. “If Karkare was called deshdrohi (traitor) in the heat of emotion, it is our right. It is upon government and judiciary to decide whether he (Karkare) was a traitor or not. No policeman is entitled to get the status of martyr, only freedom fighters and soldiers could be given such status.”When asked about the objection raised by retired policemen over Sadhvi’s remarks on Karkare, he said “what Sadhvi is saying today was already told to the court during hearing, and it is in the record of the court. Those who have come in favour of Karkare do not know about the torture given to us.”Upadhyay was charged for his involvement in the 2008 Malegaon blasts by the Maharashtra ATS. Earlier, he had also contested in 2012 UP assembly polls from Bairia constituency, but lost.
