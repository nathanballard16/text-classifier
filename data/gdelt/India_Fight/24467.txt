Chennai: In a horrific case of medical apathy being reported from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, three patients on life support died at the Madurai Government Hospital during a night-long power cut on Tuesday.

Relatives of the patients who had died alleged that the deaths were due to the ventilators not functioning as there was no electricity. However, the hospital has completely denied this.

As per reports, three patients, identified as Mallika, Ravichandran and Palaniammal, were in critical condition and died at a time when there was power cut in the hospital on Tuesday night. The Rajaji Government Hospital faced a complete black out on Tuesday night as thunder and lightning accompanied with heavy rainfall curtailed power supply in the locality.

Hospital officials did admit that there was a power shutdown but then clarified that the ventilators were working with battery backup. Moreover, the hospital’s Dean has denied the allegations that three people lost their lives due to lack of ventilator support.

K Vanitha, Dean, Govt Rajaji Hospital, Madurai, said “There were 3 ICU patients who were on life support system, two of them died due to cardiac arrest & one died due to other ailment, yesterday. The allegation that the patients died due to interrupted power supply in the ICU is wrong.”

This is another case of alleged medical apathy in Tamil Nadu and raises serious questions about the treatment administered to patients who are battling with their lives.
