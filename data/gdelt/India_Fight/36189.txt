Supreme sacrifice ensured safety, sanctity of our borders: Rajnath on Kargil Vijay Diwas

Commemorating 20th anniversary of the Kargil Vijay Diwas on Friday, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh paid tribute to the heroes who fought tough battles during the conflict, saying their unwavering courage and supreme sacrifice ensured the safety and sanctity of the country's borders.

The Union minister, along with the Vice Chiefs of Army, Navy and Air Force paid homage to the martyrs at the National War Memorial.

"Paid homage to martyred soldiers at the National War Memorial in New Delhi on the occasion of 20th anniversary of Kargil Vijay Diwas. Their unwavering courage and supreme sacrifice ensured the safety and sanctity of our borders," Singh tweeted.

It was on July 26, 1999, dubbed 'Kargil Vijay Diwas', that Indian armed forces had declared a win in the Kargil conflict against Pakistan after the neighbouring country's infiltration.

The India Army responded to the intrusion with Operation Vijay -- the name given to India's limited war against Pakistan in 1999, fighting battles on icy heights of Kargil.

In Lok Sabha, the Defence minister said Pakistan can neither fight a full-fledged nor a limited war with India and is waging a proxy war.

He was speaking in Parliament on the 20th anniversary of Kargil conflict as it paid tributes to Indian soldiers who drove out enemy forces and reclaimed Kargil heights.

Army chief Gen Bipin Rawat, Air Chief Marshal B S Dhanoa and Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh also paid tributes by laying wreaths at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass.
