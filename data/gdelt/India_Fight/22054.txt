Who is Apoorva Tiwari -- From Supreme Court lawyer to murder accused of Rohit Shekhar

New Delhi:

Apoorva Shukla Tiwari, the wife of Rohit Shekhar Tiwari who was found dead on April 16, was arrested by the Delhi Police Crime Branch on Wednesday for allegedly hatching a conspiracy to murder him. Police sources said Apoorva herself smothered Rohit to death when he was inebriated. She didn't take anybody's help to commit the crime. Rohit was found dead under mysterious circumstances in his New Delhi residence.

The family's domestic help, Bhola, Rohit's cousin Pappu and Apoorva were in the house when Rohit was found dead. His mother Ujjwala Tiwari, who was admitted to Max hospital, received a call from her house about her son being "unwell and bleeding from the nose". Bhola said that Rohit often slept late into the day and there was nothing uncommon about that.Â

Who is Apoorva Tiwari?

Apoorva Tiwari, a Supreme Court lawyer, reportedly hails from Indore. She met Shekhar in 2017 in Lucknow through a matrimonial website, his mother Ujjwala Sharma said.

Ujjwala said her son, 40, and Apoorva did not share a cordial relationship and "they had issues since day one of their marriage".

On Sunday, Ujjwala hit out at Apoorva and her parents alleging they had their eyes on his property.

"Apoorva's family wanted to take control of the properties of my both sons -- Siddharth and Rohit -- because this house is nearer to the Supreme Court where Apoorva was practising law," she said.

They were seeing each other for a year and later took a break in between.

Shekhar maintained distance from her and said he did not want to marry her, she said.

They were not in touch from January to March, 2018. But on April 2 they came to me and expressed their wish to get married, Ujjwala said.

They also discussed mutual divorce several times and later decided to end their marriage in June, she said.

Ujjwala said Apoorva was also against giving a share of property to son of Rajiv Kumar, a relative and aide of Tiwari.

"We have arrested Apoorva with the help of scientific evidence and FSL (Forensic Science Laboratory) report. She confessed that she has murdered her husband and said their marriage was unhappy. She said her hopes and dreams were all dashed," Additional Commissioner of Police Rajiv Ranjan said.
