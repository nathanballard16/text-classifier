The publication, The Christian Science Monitor, has placed the premier’s name on its list for de-escalating the tensions between India and Pakistan.

It has also listed South Korean President Moon Jae-in for his efforts to improve ties with North Korea and seeking a peaceful engagement aimed at the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.

Another name that made the list was of Ethiopian Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, for striking a peace pact with Eritrea and liberating political prisoners.

Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaido, also appeared on the list for bringing about peaceful change in the country.

Discussing Imran Khan’s inclusion in the list, the publication states, “Perhaps the biggest surprise in peaceful leadership – and most critical to the world – is Imran Khan.”

“After a February 14 attack that killed at least 40 Indian soldiers in occupied Kashmir, India launched its first airstrike inside Pakistan since a 1971 war. The two nuclear-capable states were primed for all-out conflict.”

“In a goodwill gesture, Prime Minister Imran Khan returned the Indian pilot who was shot down inside Pakistan. He also offered talks with India. “Nobody wins in a war. Especially countries that have the sort of weapons that India and Pakistan possess should not even think of war…,” he said,” the paper added.
