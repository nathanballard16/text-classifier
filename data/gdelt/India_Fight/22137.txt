1/5

Salman Khan is currently working on his next, Dabangg 3, even as his Bharat gears up for its date with cinemas this Eid. Recently, Sonakshi Sinha joined him on location in Maheshwar, Madhya Pradesh, to reprise her role as Rajjo, Chulbul Pandey’s wife. We’ve also told you that Mouni Roy is being roped in for a special song.

While speculation is rife about another young actress being signed up for a pivotal role opposite Salman, we hear that the superstar will be giving a break to his friend filmmaker Mahesh Manjrekar’s daughter Ashwami in Dabangg 3.

“Contrary to reports, Ashwami plays a girl who is rescued by Chulbul Pandey,” says our source, adding, that this marks the protagonist’s entry sequence. “Like the first two instalments, which showcased a heroic entry for Chulbul, this time, too, it will be heroic, but it’s being treated differently by Salman and director Prabhudheva. Nonetheless, Ashwami plays a pivotal part that sets the tone of the narrative,” concludes our informer.
