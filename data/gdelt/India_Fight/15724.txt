1984 Sikh killings was like genocide of Jews by Nazis: CBI

Amritsar : One of India's premier investigating agency, CBI has equated the killings of Sikhs in 1984 with the genocide of Jews by Nazis.Senior advocate HS Phoolka in a release issued here on Monday, informed that CBI had equated the killings of Sikhs in 1984 with the genocide of Jews by Nazis, genocide of Armenians by Kurds and Turks and the genocide of Bangladeshi by Pakistan army.CBI filed its reply in response to the bail application filed by Sajjan Kumar in the Supreme Court. Kumar has been awarded life imprisonment by Delhi High Court on December 17, 2018 and was presently lodged in jail. He had filed his appeal in the SC against the judgement of the Delhi court.Phoolka also released Para 3 of the CBI’s reply which reads:“That the present Appeal arises in reference to a ghastly incident that occurred on the morning of 31st October 1984 in Delhi, subsequent to which thousands of Sikhs were brutally murdered and their houses vandalized. The killings had taken place in pursuance to the provocative speeches made by the applicant/convict against the Sikh community. The killing of 5 innocent Sikhs in this case was not revengeful act but had taken place due to the hatred disseminated ,spread by the Applicant ,convict against the Sikhs. The brutal murder of innocent Sikhs during the 1984 riots fall under the category of crimes against the humanity on parity with well known genocides worldwide like large scale killing of Armenians by Kurds and Turks, mass extermination of Jews by Nazis, mass killing of Bangladeshi citizens by the sympathizers of Pakistani army and mass killing during various ethnic riots within India also. In this case, the minority community was targeted by the spearheaded attacks of the dominant political actors like the Applicant/convict and duly facilitated by the law enforcement agencies. As such, this case has to be viewed in the larger context of mass crimes and requires a different approach than a case of normal murder/ rioting.”Phoolka informed that the bail application of Sajjan Kumar was now listed before SC for March 25.
