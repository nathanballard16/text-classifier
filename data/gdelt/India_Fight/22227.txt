Irrfan Khan is all set to make his big appearance in the second instalment of Hindi Medium. The actor was diagnosed with a rare neuroendocrine tumour last year, is back to shooting the upcoming film which also stars Kareena Kapoor Khan and Radhika Madan. While Kareena shared how her role is not of a romantic interest, producer Dinesh Vijan said she will play a crucial role with a comic undertone.

On the other hand, Radhika Madan who was last seen in Patakhaa achieved critical acclaim for her role in the movie where she was paired opposite Sanya Malhotra, two troublesome sisters who hated each other. Currently, Angrezi Medium team is shooting in Udaipur and the makers have shared photographs of the cast and crew.

In the first look of the movie, Irrfan Khan was seen in front of a sweet shop and his on-screen name was given Champak ji. Directed by Homi Adajania, the movie has also been shot in Mumbai and is now being rolled in Udaipur. Check out these photos of Irrfan and Radhika with the team…

While Kareena hasn’t yet begun shooting for Angrezi Medium, the actress talked about her role with Rajeev Masand recently and said, “It's going to be quite a surreal experience. It's not a romantic pairing. It's a small but interesting part and also I think that I just wanted to get out of my comfort zone and do a movie that would throw me into a different milieu and I'd see how it goes. Whether it's Homi or it's Irrfan and Deepak, I think it's all a different world for me to be a part of so that's going to be interesting.”

The film is slated to release in 2020 and will see a whole new story. Hindi Medium had hit theatres in 2017 and was a huge hit both domestically and internationally. It was due to its massive success that the makers decided to make it a franchise.
