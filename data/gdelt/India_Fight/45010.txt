Naga Chaitanya is Now Out of Bangarraju?:- Youngster Naga Chaitanya is rushed with a bunch of projects and he is working without breaks to complete them. There are talks that Nagarjuna and Naga Chaitanya will team up for a village based romantic drama titled Bangarraju and the film is said to be the sequel for Soggade Chinni Nayana. The film's director Kalyan Krishna has been working on the script from the past one year and he narrated the entire script to Nag and Naga Chaitanya recently.

Chaitu was not impressed with the draft and walked out of the project. Instead of putting the project on hold, Nag asked Kalyan Krishna to rework on the script. If everything falls in place, Nag will start shooting for Bangarraju from December. Naga Chaitanya will move on to his next project that will be bankrolled by Dil Raju. Naga Chaitanya recently completed shooting for Venky Mama and he is busy with the shoot of Sekhar Kammula's romantic drama.
