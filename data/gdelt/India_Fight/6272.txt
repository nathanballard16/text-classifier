Immediately End 'Support', 'Safe Haven' to Terror Groups: US to Pak

Washington: The White House asked Pakistan to immediately end ‘support’ and ‘safe haven’ to all terror groups as it strongly condemned the Pulwama terrorist attack.

Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for the attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Thursday that left at least 37 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel dead and many critically wounded.

“The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region,” White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said in a late night statement on Thursday.

“This attack only strengthens our resolve to bolster counterterrorism cooperation and coordination between the United States and India,” she said in a strongly-worded statement issued by the White House.

Sanders said the US condemns, in the strongest terms, the heinous terrorist attack in Pulwama by a Pakistan-based terrorist group.

“We express our deep condolences to the victims’ families, the Indian government, and the Indian people for the loss of life in this brutal attack,” said the White House Press Secretary.

At least 37 CRPF personnel were killed and five injured in one of the deadliest terror attacks in J&K when a Jaish suicide bomber rammed a vehicle carrying over 100 kg of explosives into their bus in Pulwama district.

India slammed Pakistan over the attack carried out by JeM and asked the neighbouring country to stop supporting terrorists and dismantle terror infrastructure operating from its soil.

Meanwhile, Pakistan said the terrorist attack in Pulwama district is ‘a matter of grave concern’ even as it strongly rejected Indian media and government’s allegations of the country’s link to the strike ‘without’ probe.
