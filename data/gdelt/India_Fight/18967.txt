Amazon to launch satellites for broadband internet

MUMBAI: An attempt by the e-commerce giant, Amazon to provide internet access is being made through its new initiative ‘Project Kuiper’ to build a network of over 3000 satellites, according to multiple filings made with the International Telecommunication Union last month.

Amazon said in a statement that the long-term project will cater to people globally who lack basic access to broadband internet, the report mentioned.

The company added that Project Kuiper will launch a constellation of low earth orbit satellites that will provide low-latency, high-speed broadband connectivity.

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is racing to pull his private space company Blue Origin out of start-up mode and move into production. Blue Origin is seeking to disrupt the legacy launch services market with reusable rocket technology.
