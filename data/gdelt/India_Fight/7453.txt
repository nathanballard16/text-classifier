Gurugram, February 18

The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the plea of murder accused Mahipal Singh for the transfer of his case to Delhi, a request made on the apprehension that the complainant in the case being a judge in Haryana could influence the judicial process.

Mahipal Singh, who was attached to judge Krishan Kant as a security guard, had allegedly shot at and seriously injured latter’s wife and son near the Arcadia Market in Sector 49 here on October 13 last year. Mahipal’s counsel Prem Shankar Sharma had filed the petition in the Supreme Court for the transfer of the case to Delhi for “fair and natural justice”

“The case should be transferred to Delhi as my client is innocent. Since the complainant is himself posted in the courts here, there is a possibility that he may try to influence the case,” Mahipal’s counsel had pleaded in the Supreme Court.

“The plea has been dismissed as it had no grounds. My client has already been transferred to Ambala and there is no question of the case proceedings being influenced. We will be presenting the next batch of our witnesses in the hearing scheduled for March 1,” said Vishal Gupta, counsel for Kant.

The Gurugram police in its charge-sheet had listed 81 witnesses, including doctors from Paras Hospital where the injured were first taken, doctors from Medanta Hospital where the victims died, forensic experts and police personnel associated with the investigation. The case is being heard in the court of District and Sessions Judge RK Sondhi. The statements of four police officials and two employees of a private hospital had been recorded. The police had also produced five spent cartridges and the .38 bore revolver that Mahipal had allegedly used.
