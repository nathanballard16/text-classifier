A man injured as many as 14 people, including a woman, and broke the windowpanes of two cars in Shivalik Bihar locality at Zirakpur on Sunday. Police officials said that the man seemed to be mentally unstable. Police were yet to register a case.

According to the police, the man, identified as Shubjeet, first attacked a local resident, Pawan Kumar, with a sharp-edged weapon in Shivalik Bihar. He then broke the windowpanes of two cars. Pawan Kumar received ten stitches in his head. He was discharged from hospital later.

Gagan, one of the car owners, said that his car was parked in the locality when a man hit the windscreen with a sharp-edged weapon and broke it. Gagan said that he tried to stop the man but the latter threatened to attack him as well.

Roshni Devi, 58, was passing from the locality with her husband and she too was attacked by Shubjeet. She fractured her hand. She was admitted to a private hospital at Zirakpur.

Shubjeet also attacked another person identified as Kishan Kumar who was working outside his house. Kishan Kumar’s neighbour Rajpal tried to stop the man but he too was injured.

Shubjeet also attacked a minor boy who was admitted to Sector 6 civil hospital in Panchkula after suffering injuries to his legs.

The Zirakpur Station House Officer (SHO), Inspector Gurcharan Singh, said that the man was mentally upset and he was not in his senses when he attacked the people. The SHO added that Shubhjeet told them that he is a native of Kolkata, following which they contacted the Kolkata police.

“Shubhjeet came to Mohali last week and had some problem. He is a mental patient,” the SHO said.
