New Delhi, Jan 1, 2019 (ANI) The Indian Army has dismissed the claims of the Pakistan Army that it had shot down an Indian quadcopter in the Bagh sector along the Line of Control.

"They keep lying on these issues. No such incident has taken place," Army sources said here.

The claim was made by Pakistan Army's Inter Services Public Relations in-charge Major General Asif Ghafoor from his official Twitter handle.

"Pakistan army troops shot down Indian spy quadcopter in Bagh sector area along line of control. Not even a quadcopter will be allowed to cross LOC, in Sha Allah," he tweeted on Tuesday.

Interestingly, the Pakistan side has been stressing that it did not even allow a quadcopter to cross over the LoC on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi, for the first time, discussed in detail about the surgical strike operations of September 2016 when Indian troops launched multiple attacks on terror launch pads in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Pakistan has been denying that surgical strikes ever took place but it is believed that around 50 terrorists along with Pakistan Army regular troops were killed in these operations.
