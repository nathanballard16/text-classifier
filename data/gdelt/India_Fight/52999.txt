Endemol Shine catches Sane Psychopath

The Indian arm of prodco Endemol Shine Group has picked up the screen rights to author Salil Desai’s psychological novel The Sane Psychopath.

Inspired by a real incident, The Sane Psychopath follows a young lawyer who is tasked with defending a man who killed 10 people and seriously injured many more in an hour-long killing spree.

“What attracted us to the book is the insight the plot gives into the legal system, the state of mental health and the impact the news and headlines have on the general public,” said Abhishek Rege, CEO of Endemol Shine India.

Author Desai added: “The Sane Psychopath is my darkest novel yet and was the hardest to write. I always thought it was ‘made-for-screen.'”

Another Desai publication, the Inspector Saralkar Mystery series, was picked up by Times Studio Originals for adaptation into a web series earlier this year.

This deal reinforces Endemol Shine India’s move into scripted following recent Netflix commission Bombay Begums, written and directed by Alankrita Shrivastava. The show features five generations of women who confront and redefine ambition and empowerment within the cutthroat world of Mumbai banking.

Endemol Shine India is also part of the partnership developing The Ibis Trilogy, directed by Shekhar Kapur with Artists Studio and TV packaging consultancy Dove Tale.
