Delhi: St Stephen's Lecturer Found Dead On Railway Track, Mother's Body Found At Home

New Delhi:

In a potential case of murder-suicide, a ad-hoc faculty in Delhi University's St Stephen's college was found dead in suspicious conditions in near railway track in Sarai Rohilla a day after his mother's body was found hanging in similar conditions in Ranibagh in Pitampura. Police have sent both the bodies for post-mortem and have initiated probe into the case.

Alan Stanley, was a guest lecturer of Philosophy in Delhi's prestigious St Stephen's College. He was also pursuing his PhD from IIT Delhi. Both the victims belonged to Kottayam in Kerala. Stanley had been living in Delhi since the past one-and-a-half years and was joined by his mother only seven months ago.

According to some of the witnesses, Alan was suicidal and had tried to commit suicide earlier also. The witness told that Alan tried to force his mother to commit suicide five days back but she was not ready for it then.

The sources further added that Alan's mother Lissy had been married twice. She had Alan and another son from her first marriage. After the death of her first husband, she remarried in 2018 but her second husband also died some time ago.

The police have registered a case of murder in Lissy's death and a case of suicide in Alan's death. Police are suspicious that Alan first killed his mother and then committed suicide.
