Six murders in 12 hours rock Allahabad, SSP booted out

ALLAHABAD: Six murders in 12 hours, including a sensational triple murder, rocked Allahabad. Jolted by the climbing crime graph, the state government suspended Allahabad SSP Atul Sharma and replaced him with Satyarth Anirudh Pankaj. And Opposition leaders found ammo to attack the BJP government on the deteriorating law and order.While a young couple was found brutally murdered in Hasanpur Korari village in trans-Ganga area early Monday, three persons were shot by unidentified assailants near Chaufatka area in Dhoomanganj late Sunday.A 27-year-old man was also shot by a history-sheeter near Allahapur area in Georgetown late Sunday night. Initial reports from Dhoomanganj and Georgetown suggest police laxity. Role of cops in both cases is under scanner and senior officials have been asked to initiate investigation and submit reports. Two policemen, senior sub-inspector Dhoomanganj and Rajruppur police outpost in-charge, were suspended after the murders.Talking about the triple murder, suspended SSP Atul Sharma admitted the Dhoomanganj police did not initiate preventive action as both parties had earlier approached them. Similarly, the role of Georgetown police is under scanner as they did not act against the accused, a local history-sheeter, who went trigger-happy a few days ago.
