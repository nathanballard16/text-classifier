They have also met Maharashtra home secretary, Sanjay Kumar, and written to the chief minister seeking his intervention in the matter. The family also claims that after registering a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the police have changed the sections to ‘causing death by negligence’ to protect the accused. Even theof the accused, they allege, was carried out at 6 am the following day when the accident took place at 9.30 pm the previous night.In response to the allegations, an official from NRI Sagari police station said, “Our officer had initially registered a wrong FIR.
