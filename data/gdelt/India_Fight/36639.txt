Police chase across Tacoma Narrows Bridge ends with driver's capture

GIG HARBOR, Wash. -- A suspected impaired driver determined to escape from police led troopers on a wild chase in Tacoma and across the Narrows Bridge before finally being captured in Gig Harbor.

The ordeal began around 5:30 a.m. when Tacoma Police spotted a car believed to have been involved in a hit-and-run, but the driver wouldn't pull over and sped off, according to Trooper Johnna Batiste.

A Washington State Patrol trooper found the suspected car a short time later along state Route 16 and also tried to pull it over, but the car sped off a second time to the west.

Troopers managed to deploy tire spikes near Jackson Street and popped the tires. Eventually the driver even lost a rear tire, but continued his escape attempt on rims across the Tacoma Narrows Bridge, Batiste said.

Finally, the car gave out around Olympic Drive NW in Gig Harbor, but the driver would not listen to trooper commands to surrender and remained in the car, Batiste said.

Troopers fired a non-lethal round which shattered the driver's side window, at which point the driver got out of the car and tried to run away. He didn't get far and was captured by a trooper.

He's being treated for some cuts to the face from broken glass and then will likely be booked into jail for charges including suspicion of DUI, Batiste said.

Police haven't given any additional details yet on the original hit-and-run crash that started the entire chase.
