RAJKOT: A man was shot dead by two unidentified bike-borne assailants in Maska village of Mandvi taluka in Kutch district on Friday evening.The deceased was identified as Ashish Joshi (25). “Though the identities of the accused are yet to be ascertained, we suspect an old enmity as the reason behind the crime,” said an official from Mandvi police station.Joshi was sitting near his house when the two assailants arrived on a bike, and one of them fired two bullets at him, which hit him in his chest.Firing incidences have been on the rise in Kutch district since January this year. First, ex-BJP MLA Jayanti Bhanushali was shot dead aboard a train near Bhachau in January.In February, three assailants had opened fire at the house of Hamid Bhatti, ex-Congress corporator of Bhuj.Last week, Ismaeel Juma Hingroja, who had allegedly fired at Bhatti’s house, was shot in his leg when the car he was travelling in was fired upon by three assailants near Chaki Jamatkhana in Bheednaka locality of Bhuj.
