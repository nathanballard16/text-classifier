Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Ashwini Upadhyay has moved the Supreme Court seeking an SIT probe into the violence in connection with the amended Citizenship Act.

In his plea, Ashwini Upadhyay demanded CBI, NIA or a Court-monitored inquiry into the protests or violence that took place in Jamia Milia University, Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) and in West Bengal.

He also said that the Supreme Court should supervise the investigation.

Ashwini Upadhyay also mentioned that several trains were set ablaze in West Bengal while protesting against the CAA, but the chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, instead of taking action against the accused, took to the streets to lead a rally against the act.

He also accused Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal and his deputy, Manish Sisodia, for pointing to the police as the main culprits.
