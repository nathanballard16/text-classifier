Food vendors, shops occupy Tadiwala Road

Some encroachments are illegal and have caused inconvenience to pedestrians; they are forced to walk on stree t



The presence of illegal vendors and shops on the footpath along Tadiwala Road has created an inconvenience for pedestrians. They have claimed that multiple complaints made to the civic body have gone unanswered in this regard, affecting thousands of locals and even commuters who take the route. The pedestrians have now demanded a concrete solution to the problem, which is escalating by the day as new juice vendors are making inroads into the area.



“The chowk near the Our Lady of Perpetual Church on Tadiwala Road has turned into a chowpatty, leaving no space for pedestrians to walk. The ward office has taken no action despite getting this problem to their notice,” said Abhijeet Mankar, a regular commuter.



These snack shops, juice vendors, paan and tea stalls are present on the stretch between Sorabh Hall’s gate No. 1 and Panchratan Hotel. The issue is aggravated by visitors, who park vehicles at the location, crowding it and leaving no space for people to walk.



“Some vendors have been using the pavement to stash their material. It is strewn with filth every day, also posing a health hazard. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) must take stringent action against these illegal encroachments before the condition goes out of control,” he added.



Arun Khilare, the assistant commissioner of Dhole Patil Road ward office, said he was aware of this problem that has persisted besides multiple crackdowns.



“Some of the hawkers have licences, whereas others are illegal. Even as we take action regularly, they simply crop up again. Now, I will look into the issue and take concrete action after discussing it with higher authorities,” he added.
