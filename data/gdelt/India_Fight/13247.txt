HC stays trial in Gokulraj death case

The Madras High Court on Thursday stayed the trial proceedings pending before the Principal District and Sessions Court in Namakkal in connection with the death of Dalit youth V. Gokulraj, who was allegedly murdered by a gang in June 2015 over his love affair with a caste Hindu girl.

Justice G.K. Ilanthiraiyan granted the interim stay on a petition filed by the victim’s mother V. Chitra seeking a direction to transfer the trial from Namakkal to Salem or any other district. The judge ordered notices to the prosecution as well as the accused, returnable in two weeks.
