IAF claims Su-30 ‘spoofed’ US missiles fired from F-16

The Pakistani Air Force carried out an unsuccessful aerial combat on February 27 as a retaliation to India’s air strike at a terrorist training camp.

IAF said that in the morning of February 27, Indian Air Defence system was on full alert.

New Delhi: In a big achievement, the Indian Air Force (IAF) on Tuesday revealed that Sukhoi Su-30 aircraft had spoofed a number of most advanced US long-range radar-guided air-to-air AMRAAM missiles fired at it by Pakistan’s F-16 on February 27. IAF said that Pakistan was falsely claiming that it had shot down India's Sukhoi Su-30 on February 27 which was involved in repelling Pakistan Air Force (PAF) attack on the country.

“False claim by Pakistan of shooting down a Su-30, appears to be a cover up for loss of its own aircraft (F-16),” said a statement by Indian Air Force (IAF). “All the Su-30 aircraft engaged in combat landed back safely,” said the statement.

The Pakistani Air Force carried out an unsuccessful aerial combat on February 27 as a retaliation to India’s air strike at a terrorist training camp.

IAF said that in the morning of February 27, Indian Air Defence system was on full alert. “Build up of PAF aircraft on their side of LoC was noticed in time and additional aircraft were scrambled to tackle the adversary,” said the statement.

From IAF side, Mirage-2000, Su-30 and MiG-21 Bison aircraft were involved in the engagement.

“PAF aircraft were forced to withdraw in a hurry, which is also evident from large missed distances of the weapons dropped by them,” it said. “During combat, use of F-16 by PAF and multiple launches of AMRAAM were conclusively observed. Prompt and correct tactical action by Su-30 aircraft, in response to AMRAAM launch, defeated the missile,” it said. Parts of the missile fell in East of Rajouri, it added.
