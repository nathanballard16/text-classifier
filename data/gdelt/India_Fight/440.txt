Partiotism-infused films like Uri are rare in Bollywood: Yami Gautam

Yami Gautam and Vicky Kaushal started promoting their film Uri: The Surgical Strike. Yami says audiences will see a patriotic film like this after a long time.

Actress Yami Gautam, gearing up for the release of her forthcoming film Uri: The Surgical Strike, said the Indian film industry makes less patriotism-infused films.

Yami interacted with the media when she visited a radio station to promote Uri - The Surgical Strike along with her co-actor Vicky Kaushal here on Thursday.

The film is based on the Indian Army's 2016 surgical strikes inside Pakistan-administered Kashmir, in retaliation for the Uri attack.

"We anyway make less patriotism-infused films, so after a long time the audience will see something like this which is based on a very important true event. We really hope the audience loves the film," Yami said.

On the audience response to the film's trailer, Yami said: "There is happy nervousness and excitement about the release of the film within our team. The kind of response we have been receiving for the trailer of the film is really amazing.

"Wherever we are going to promote the film, people are saying they are really looking forward for the release of the film because it is for the first time we have made a film on surgical strikes in India."

Uri, produced by RSVP Movies, is releasing on January 11.
