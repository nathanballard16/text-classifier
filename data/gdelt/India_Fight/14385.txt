2 Muslims killed in police custody, 8 policemen involved absconding

By Muslim Mirror Staff Patna : In yet another case of custodial killings of Muslims in India, Mohammad Taslim, 35 and Mohammad Gufran, 30, residents of Ramdiha village under Chakia police station in East Champaran district were picked up by a police team from Sitamarhi on Tuesday night, where they were allegedly tortured and mercilessly beaten by the police to accept their involvement in the loot and murder case, finally leading to their death.

Taslim and Gufran died within 20 hours after being detained by the police, raising serious questions on the police and embarrassing the state government.

Eight policemen have fled after their alleged involvement in the custodial death.

After the incident came to the limelight and protests by different social outfits and political parties, an FIR was lodged against the suspended policemen including Dumra police station SHO Chandrabhusan Kumar Singh on the basis of Munawar Ali’s statement.

The case has come as a major embarrassment to the Nitish Kumar government, which has been accused of failing to alleviate the law-and-order situation in the state by the opposition. A few days ago, the Chief Minister had warned Director General of Police Gupteshwar Pandey – who has been widely covered by the local media – that he should be ready to face the heat if he fails to discharge his duties efficiently.
