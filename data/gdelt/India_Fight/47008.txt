Srinagar: Ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir have touched a five-year high this year. Army sources said on Friday that the Pakistan Army has violated ceasefire more than 2000 times so far this year.

Till yesterday, 2,317 ceasefire violations had taken place, sources said. They also added that a total of 147 terrorists have been killed in various operations by the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir so far this year.

For comparison, it is pertinent to note that the ceasefire along the LoC was violated by Pakistan 1,629 times during the entire of 2018.

"Pakistan increased ceasefire violations this year following the Balakot air strikes in February and subsequently after special status was withdrawn to Jammu and Kashmir in August," a defence officer said.

According to the officer, ceasefire violations by Pakistan are linked to attempts to help terrorists infiltrate into the Indian territory in Jammu and Kashmir. Such violations provide cover fire to the terrorists.

There are intelligence inputs that Pakistan has activated terror training camps as well as launch pads along the LoC and Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorists are waiting to cross over into India.

Army sources said they have been giving a befitting reply to Pakistan as far as ceasefire violations are concerned.

Sources said Pakistan has also attempted attacks by its Border Action Team (BAT) on Indian Army positions along the LoC. Pakistani BAT teams normally comprise Army commandos and terrorists.

It may be recalled that the Indian Army soldiers had neutralised five BAT attackers close to a forward post in J&K’s Keran sector in July. Pakistan had denied that they were its troops.
