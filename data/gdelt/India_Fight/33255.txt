SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, July 5 (Xinhua) -- A militant was killed on Friday in a gunfight with troops in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.

The gunfight broke out at village Narwani in Shopian district, about 57 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

According to police, the identity of slain militant was being ascertained. Police also claimed the recovery of arms and ammunition from the spot.

"The firing has stopped but search operation in the area is still underway," the police said.

Authorities have suspended mobile internet service in the district and closed roads leading to the gunfight site.
