Why is Modi silent on Amit Shah's Balakot count, Mayawati asks

At an event in Ahmedabad on Sunday, Shah said the IAF's Balakot airstrike last Tuesday "killed more than 250 terrorists"

BSP chief Mayawati on Tuesday tried to put BJP president Amit Shah on the dock over his claim that 250 terrorists were killed in the Indian airstrike in Pakistan, asking him why Prime Minister Narendra Modi was 'silent' over it.

'BJP chief Amit Shah is arduously making claim that the IAF strike killed over 250 terrorists in Pakistan, but why is his guru, PM Modi who is always keen to take credit for everything, silent over it? Terrorists killed is good news, but what is the secret behind deep silence of the PM?' Mayawati posted on Twitter.
