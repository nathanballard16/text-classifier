RAJKOT: In a major seizure , a ganja (marijuana) cultivation racket was busted and two persons arrested from Kuvadava village of Rajkot taluka and Kheradi village of Chotila taluka in Surendranagar district on Thursday night.First, Jila Chauhan (50), a resident of Chiroda village of Chotila, was arrested with 1.3 kg ganja.“We arrested Chauhan following a tip-off about him coming to sell ganja on his bike in Kuvadava village. During his interrogation, Chauhan said that he had procured the contraband from a ganja farm owned by Muni Bapu in Kheradi village of Chotila,” said O P Sisodia, sub-inspector of Rajkot special operation group (SOG).On the basis of Chauhan’s revelation, Rajkot SOG alerted Surendranagar SOG and local crime branch (LCB) and the officials of both the SOGs and Surendranagar LCB raided Kheradi village.“We found that there were 200 plants of the contraband on one acre of land. We have seized 708 kg ganja, worth Rs 28.32 lakh,” said D V Basia, Limbdi deputy superintendent of police.Police ascertained the real identity of Muni Bapu as Valji Bavalia (45). During his interrogation, Bavalia said that he had kind of renounced the world and become a hermit after the death of his wife, seven years ago. He used to smoke ganja. He had planted a few plants in his farm initially.However, the greed of minting money got the better of him and he decided to enter into drug business. The harvest of ganja that he had sown eight months ago was about to be reaped when the raid was conducted. “He had given ganja to Chauhan to look for customers and check the market for the contraband,” added Basia.
