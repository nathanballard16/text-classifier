Here’s to the Women of Gen X

Born in 1980, I am the oldest millennial... or the youngest Gen Xer. (Today is my birthday, in fact.) I was too young to understand what happened with Anita Hill, but understood acutely what happened with Monica Lewinsky. Nonetheless, with two older sisters firmly in Gen X, it is undoubtedly a generation that claimed me, and a generation that I claim.

When my family moved from Beirut, Lebanon, to the United States in 1984, I quickly became a glutton for all the American angst and ephemera I could stomach. And with few restrictions on the media I consumed, I was swept away on a wave of laugh tracks and Capri Sun.

By the time I became a teen in the mid-1990s, I had one goal: to look like Gwen Stefani and Kurt Cobain’s Arab baby. I succeeded.

This week, several of my colleagues came together to gripe about and celebrate the “gloomy, goofy club of forgotten middle children” — that is, the 65 million people who came of age in the 1980s and ’90s — in a project dedicated to Gen X.
