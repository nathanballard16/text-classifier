De Bono named Condor Gaming COO

Online casino operation specialist Condor Gaming has appointed Oliver de Bono as its new chief operating officer.

The move comes as part of a growth and expansion strategy, with De Bono bolstering the company’s international offices to assist in the push into emerging and newly regulated markets.

Recent expansions have seen Condor Gaming move into territories such as Sweden, India and LatAm.

De Bono boasts over a decade of experience within the igaming market, with a focus on team expansion, affiliation and emerging markets. Known for his instrumental role in expanding the SiGMA brand into Asia, De Bono now eyes expanding Condor’s presence in Asia and other up and coming geographies.

He said: “I am super excited to be joining a company with so many ideas and plans for expansion. My last two years working with SiGMA has been a privilege.

“SiGMA is at the forefront of the gaming industry, trailblazing both geographies and technology. By shining a light on what’s to come, I hope to be able to transfer that information over to an operator and put such knowledge to the test.”
