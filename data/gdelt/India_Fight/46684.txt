Was Gnanavel Raja's Mufti dropped because Simbu didn't turn up on sets? Details inside

Tamil actor Simbu is known for creating controversies one after another. After spending quite a lot of time overseas, he came back to Chennai and made headlines. While it was reported that he will kickstart his upcoming films in Tamil, Simbu seems to have other plans.

Once he is back, Simbu was supposed to begin his untitled film, which is a remake of Kannada hit venture Mufti. Director Narathan, who helmed the original has been roped in to do the Tamil remake which also features Gautham Karthik as one of the leads.

However, Simbu has invited trouble yet again by not turning up for the shooting of the film. Though he is back in Chennai, the actor seems to be in no mood to shoot for the film. This has angered producer KE Gnanavel Raja, who is said to have filed a complaint against him with Tamil Nadu Film Producers Council.

Reportedly, Gnanavel Raja had resumed the film's shoot in Karnataka. Since Simbu didn't attend the shooting, the producer incurred huge losses. It is now reported that the film has been dropped. However, an official announcement is still yet to be made.

Also, we will have to wait and see if the Producer Council will act on the complaint and get back KE Gnanavel's investment in the project so far.

Early this year, the producer announced the film and shot for a schedule which Simbu and Gautham Karthik attended.

Recently, Venkat Prabhu's Maanadu, starring Simbu, was dropped because of continuous delay. Producer Suresh Kamatchi revealed that the actor was not co-operative because of which the project had to be dropped.
