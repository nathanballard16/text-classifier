Wg Cdr Abhinandan Varthaman (VrC) Is Back In The Cockpit Flying His MiG-21 Fighter

On March 1, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman returned to India after Pakistan released after extreme diplomatic pressure. The whole country was teary-eyed after his return and he became the nation's hero. The only man to ever shoot down a F-16 fighter.

He was also bestowed with the country's top military honour, Vir Chakra, on Independence Day (August 15) for his tremendous courage and valour. Now, he is back in action or rather we'll say back in his cockpit and started flying MiG-21 jet again. Vir Chakra is the third highest gallantry award after the Paramvir Chakra and the Mahavir Chakra.

After he was captured, he showed utmost grace and courage while placed in Pakistan’s captivity for 60 hours. He was praised for it by everyone in the country including the politicians, celebrities and the people.

Wing Commander Varthaman returned to work six months after he sustained injuries while ejecting from the fighter jet during the aerial combat between India and Pakistan in February. A top military official said that he has started flying again. At present, he is posted at an IAF base in Rajasthan.

The 36-year-old IAF pilot was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG 21 Bison jet was shot down in an aerial dogfight with Pakistani jets (F-16). But before his jet was hit, he downed an F-16 fighter jet and because of his injuries while ejecting from the jet, he was taken off flying duties because of it.

IAF’s Bengaluru-based Institute of Aerospace Medicine has given the go-ahead to Varthaman to fly again following a medical examination around three weeks back.

Nearly two weeks after the Pulwama attack, India retaliated by bombing a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot.
