Missing Indians after New Zealand mosque attack: 2 injured, 7 still missing

Two of the nine people of Indian nationality or origin, reported missing after the New Zealand mosque attacks on Friday, have been located, according to sources in the external affairs ministry. Seven of them are Indian nationals.

The sources said two Indian nationals are injured but out of danger. Five other Indian nationals and two New Zealand citizens of Indian origin are still missing, the sources said.

At least 49 people were killed when a gunman, identified as an Australian citizen, opened indiscriminate firings at the Al Noor Mosque and the Linwood Mosque in Christchurch on Friday. Following the attacks, Indian envoy to New Zealand Sanjiv Kohli tweeted about nine people of Indian nationality or Indian origin missing.

Meanwhile, news agency PTI has reported that Indian national from Hyderabad Ahmed Iqbal Jahangir, who was shot at one of the mosques in New Zealand, is recovering at a hospital. Iqbal was shot in chest during the mass shooting incident.

“I thank the government for helping me get a visa to New Zealand. I am leaving today to see my brother. He is out of danger and recovering,” PTI quoted his brother Khursheed Jahangir as saying.

However, the news agency reported that the parents of another Indian from Hyderabad Farhaj Ahsan, whose missing case AIMIM MP Asaduddin Owaisi raised with External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj in a tweet on Thursday, were still clueless about his whereabouts.

The attacks on mosques during Friday prayers were condemned by the international community. Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed “deep shock and sadness” over the death of scores of people in the heinous terrorist attack in a letter to his New Zealand counterpart Jacinda Ardern.
