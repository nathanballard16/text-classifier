Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water, is on a mission to create a democratic demand for clean air. He feels that citizens must take back control over the air they breathe. According to him, air pollution is the great leveller as it affects everyone, rich and poor, city dwellers and village folk, alike. He also believes that 80% of our country will be able to breathe clean air if the nation adopts stronger pollution controls and pursues sustainable development actively. Shah Rukh Khan, too, was impressed with the thoughts presented by Arunabha Ghosh on TED Talks India Nayi Baat platform. The superstar also hails from Delhi, a city that has been bogged by air pollution problems for a long time.
