Varun Dhawan says no VT station in London

Reports have suggested that the iconic VT station in Mumbai (now known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus — CSMT) was being recreated in London for the Coolie No 1 redux starring Varun Dhawan. It was also being said that just like the original film, the remake was being shot in London because David loves to shoot there.

As it turns out, it is not true. According to a source, “Varun has a ‘billa’, which says that he is a Western Railway Porter. So, there is no way that the said railway station can be a Central railway station like VT or CSMT. There are too many stories circulating about whether the film is being shot in London or Thailand. There will be foreign locations, but the film will predominantly be shot in India” Meanwhile, Varun also took to Twitter to clarify. “Not true. But this actually made me laugh. Thank you for the humour (sic).”
