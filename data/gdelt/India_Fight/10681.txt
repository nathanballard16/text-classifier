Replying to the members, Jain said, the Licensing Department of the Delhi Police and the Health Department and the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have been asked to shut them forthwith.

“The places, after cancellation of certificate are not operational,” he said, adding people can file a complaint if any of those found functioning.

Jain said the fire department will intensify drives across the city to locate illegal constructions and hotels violating fire safety norms to prevent recurrence of any more incident.

“The raids, being conducted in Karol Bagh at present, will be extended to other parts of the city as well,” he said.
