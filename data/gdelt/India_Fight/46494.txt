150 illegal migrants held by Mathura cops

The Mathura Police has arrested and sent about 150 illegal immigrants to jail since April 2018, including 129 Bangladeshi nationals who did not have any official documents of their stay in India. This information was shared by Mathura SSP Shalabh Mathur.

Most of the Bangladeshis, who have been living in ashrams and rented houses in Mathura, Vrindavan, Govardhan and other religious places for many years, neither posses a visa, passport nor any documents, yet they illegally cross the border into India. These migrants opened bank accounts here and used to send money from to relatives back in their country.

Many such migrants live here by changing their identity and name, which makes it very difficult to get an idea of their background. A Bangladeshi intruder said that he had come to India from Bangladesh via a river and his fake documents were seized by the police.

Not only this, but the police also recovered Aadhar card, bank passbook, ration and voter ID cards, all made in India.

Due to religious activities in Mathura, most people consider it safe to take refuge in here. Mathura borders Delhi, Haryana and Rajasthan, due to which the number of devotees for religious tourism in the whole is in thousands. And as security, Local Intelligence Unit (LIU), state police and other intelligence agencies are also kept on watch here.
