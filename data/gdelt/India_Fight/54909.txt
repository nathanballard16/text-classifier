GQ India's tribute to the Turban

This GQ India editorial initiative celebrates the Turban’s strength, dignity and versatility. Worn by men across this country, Turbans are visually striking and poetic. For the first phase of the project, we travelled to Punjab where they’re powerful signifiers of community, identity and religious faith. This series showcases the deep spiritual significance of the Sikh dastaar and how it’s worn with pride and honour in daily life. For the next phase, we crossed the border into the desert state of Rajasthan, which abounds with a diversity of Turban patterns and forms – reflecting different groups, regions and occasions. The following images, documented on an iPhone 11 Pro Max by Bikramjit Bose, along with his creative collaborator Nikhil D, are just the starting point in our tribute to the Turban.
