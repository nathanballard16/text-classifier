Christchurch, March 17

Five Indians have been killed in the terror attack on two mosques in Christchurch in which 50 persons lost their lives, the Indian High Commission said today, as New Zealand grapples with the emotional fallout of its worst attack on Muslims.

The attacker, identified by authorities as Australia-born Brenton Tarrant, 28, reportedly targeted immigrants during Friday prayers. Witnesses said victims were shot at close range.

The High Commission confirmed on Sunday that five Indians were killed in the attack. “With a very heavy heart we share the news of loss of precious lives of our 5 nationals in ghastly terror attack in #Christchurch,” it tweeted.

It identified them as: Maheboob Khokhar; Ramiz Vora; Asif Vora; Ansi Alibava; and Ozair Kadir.

In another tweet later, the High Commission said the Immigration NZ had set up a dedicated webpage to expedite visa for family members of Christchurch victims. The Indian mission also said that a support group had been established in Christchurch to assist the families.

In another tweet, the commission urged people to donate blood. “Blood donors reqd: there may be a need for blood donation for #Christchurch victims. If you are A+ or O+ please contact your nearest New Zealand blood bank branch. Thank you,” it said.

The body of the 50th victim was discovered at the Al Noor mosque on Saturday. Several of the victims are foreign nationals. — PTI
