Howrah: Lawyers and municipal employees clash over parking issue, dozens injured

Howrah (West Bengal) [India] Apr 24, (ANI): Violent clashes erupted between the employees of Howrah Corporation and the lawyers of the Howrah HC injuring more than two dozen people on Wednesday.

“The row over bike-parking issue converted into stone-throwing between the two parties forcing police to baton charge and use tear gas to control the situation,” said VSR Anantanag, DCP.

Clashes erupted when a lawyer was allegedly beaten by the employees of the Municipal Corporation while he was parking his bike, Anantanag said.

Proceedings in the court were stalled due to the incident. Angry with the police action, lawyers jammed the route to Howrah Municipal Corporation.

More than four media personnel are also reported to be injured in the incident. They were allegedly manhandled while covering the incident. (ANI)
