Surat cop intercepts overcrowded rickshaw ferrying 20 school children

SURAT: An assistant sub-inspector of city traffic police used his android phone and social media to smart use by making a video of how parents and school management are putting lives of young schoolchildren at risk.In a very uncommon manner for a traffic personnel to create awareness, ASI Allauddin Sandhi, formerly a school teacher, shot a video of an auto rickshaw on Bhagal Main Road in city in which 20 students were being taken to their homes on Thursday morning.While on patrolling duty, Sandhi noticed the overcrowded rickshaw and suspecting that many more kids may have been crammed inside it, he stopped the rickshaw for checking and found his suspicion to be true.“When I brought out three students I realised that there are many more inside it and so, to count just how many kids had been stuffed in it, we brought them down. Meanwhile, I started making a video of the checking with the intention of creating awareness among the parents, school authorities and also other commuters,” Sandhi told TOI.He fined rickshaw driver Farooq Rs 500 for violating public notification issued by police commissioner on overcrowding. “As part of an awareness drive, police fined the rickshaw driver for only one offence this time. In current phase police are creating awareness about traffic rules and not penalising commuters heavily,” said a police officer.The students from Memon Primary School at Chowk Bazaar were being ferried home. The police later took the students to their school.“We met the school officials and trustees to inform them about the risk involved and violation of traffic rules. Police will hold an awareness meeting of parents and the school administration at the school on Friday,” said Sandhi.“The ASI did an exemplary work by checking the rickshaw and making a video showing the callousness of the driver in risking lives of 20 students in one rickshaw. Parents and schools need to act responsibly in such cases and ensure that their child is safe,” said Sudhir Desai, deputy commissioner of police, traffic.
