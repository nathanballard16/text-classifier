Gilani condoles demise of Dr Ghulam Mohammad Butt’s uncle

Srinagar, February 02, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the Chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), Syed Ali Gilani has condoled the demise of maternal uncle of illegally detained Dr Ghulam Mohammad Butt, who is languishing in Tihar Jail for the past nine years. Syed Ali Gilani in a statement in Srinagar said the families of prisoners particularly those who are being kept thousands of miles away from their homes have a very tough and painful life and if some dear one departs in between, the pain and agony gets multifold for such families.

It is to mention here that Dr Ghulam Mohammad Butt has been languishing in Tihar Jail, New Delhi, and of the list of fake witnesses (240) only 33 have surfaced in these nine years and if the judicial pace remains the same it may need another 50 years for judicial pears to testify his charges.

The APHC Chairman deplored that despite being political prisoners, the Kashmiri detainees were denied every right guaranteed in the jail manual. “Revengeful attitude of the rulers in Delhi has crossed every limit of heartlessness and in sensitivity by prolonging their stay in jails through their judicial victimization,” he added.

Syed Ali Gilani shared the grief with Dr Ghulam Mohammad Butt and the bereaved family and prayed for eternal peace of deceased and courage for the family to bear the irreparable loss. He also paid glorious tributes to late Advocate Ghulam Mohideen Regu on his 21st martyrdom anniversary and said that the case file was shelved, enquiry closed and those involved in his murder are roaming free. He said that Col Bawa, Major Poniya of 17 Jat and a police officer, Mushtaq Sadiq were involved in his brutal murder, however, the assassins were provided a safe exit by the authorities.
