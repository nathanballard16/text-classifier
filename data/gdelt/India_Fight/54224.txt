Yediyurappa backs police action in Hyderabad encounter

Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Friday backed the Telangana police action killing four accused in the rape and murder of a woman veterinarian near Hyderabad, saying they acted in self- defence.

"They (accused) tried to attack and escape when they were taken to spot (of crime), so the encounter was inevitable to save their (police) lives," he told reporters here.

According to Cyberabad police, the four, arrested in connection with the brutal incident, were shot dead after they 'attacked' the personnel and attempted to escape when taken to the spot for crime reconstruction early Friday.
