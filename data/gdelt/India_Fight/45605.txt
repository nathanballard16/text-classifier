Children spread Gandhi’s ideals through skit

Kathiyindri, rathamindri yutham ondru varugudhu … (A swordless and bloodless war is approaching), sang students of Dr. T. Thirugnanam Primary School, a government aided institution, at Gandhi Memorial Museum here on Monday, as they performed a skit depicting Tamil Nadu’s support to Mahatma Gandhi’s famous Dandi March.

When the students enacted a scene where the Indian freedom fighters from Vedaranyam in Nagapattinam district remained patient even after being attacked by the British, the Headmaster said, “We must all be patient and choose the path of non-violence like Mahatma Gandhi.”

At the end of the play, over 40 students, including those from other schools, cheered them.

Guided by the Headmaster, K. Saravanan, the students have been performing skits at various parts of the city for the past 10 days to create awareness of values cherished by Gandhi.

For the past two years, teachers led by Mr. Saravanan have been travelling to many areas in the city to read out stories to school students in the evenings. “We want to encourage reading habit among students and we enrol them at libraries near their area,” he said. This student circle, formed over the years, has performed at Anuppanadi, Panaiyur, Melamadai, Karumbalai, Vandiyur and other areas during this season.

As Class 5 students, Keerthika and Manikandan, delivered the dialogues in an impeccable manner, the spectators were totally engrossed in the play. “What did you infer from this?” asked the Headmaster. “Honesty, non-violence and simplicity,” said the audience.

Through the skit, the teachers also enlightened how distant the draft National Education Policy 2019 is from the education system that Mahatma Gandhi proposed, said P. Premalatha, a teacher.

Exuding confidence, Mr. Saravanan said India envisioned by Mahatma Gandhi where every citizen was united irrespective of differences, would be achieved through these students.
