Father kills 19-year-old daughter for wanting to marry out of caste

A 19-year-old girl was allegedly killed by her father after refusing to marry someone of his choice. The girl wanted to marry a boy from a different cast, with whom she was supposedly in love.

Her family was not in favour of her marrying a youth from the locality.

As per the investigation, it was found that her parents introduced her to a prospective match last week, but she refused to marry the guy. As per a Times of India report, this led to a massive argument with her family.

Girl's mother said that after she refused to give in and marry as per their choice, her father strangulated her while she was asleep. Police found out about the girl's murder after her mother informed them after cremating the body.

The incident occurred at a village near Singhu border. Family members of the girl have been detained for questioning and a case of murder has been registered.
