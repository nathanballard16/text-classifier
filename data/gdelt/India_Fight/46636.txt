Al-Qaeda leader Asim Umar who claimed credit for Avijit death killed in Afghan operation

South Asia region Al Qaeda chief Asim Omar, who reportedly claimed credit for a Bangladeshi writer Avijit Roy death, is believed to have been killed in a joint military operation in Afghanistan.

After writer-blogger Avijit Roy was murdered on Feb 26, 2015 in a brutal attack, a Tweeter handle named ‘Ansar Bangla 7’ had claimed responsibility for the attack.

Asim Umar, the head of al-Qaeda in the Indian Subcontinent (AQIS), died in a raid on a Taliban compound in Helmand province on 23 September, the National Directorate of Security (NDS) said on Tuesday.

At least 40 civilians were reported to have been killed in the same operation on a Taliban compound in Helmand province, the BBC reported.

Six other AQIS members were also killed, "most" of whom were Pakistani, the report said citing the NDS statement.

Abu Raihan, said to be Umar's "courier" to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri, was named as one of those killed, according to the report.

The NDS shared pictures purportedly showing Umar both alive and dead alongside the statement.

But the Taliban denied the news. A spokesman dismissed it as "enemy-fabricated propaganda", instead alleging that the raid "only caused heavy civilian losses".

In a statement shared on Twitter on Tuesday, the NDS said the joint US-Afghan raid took place at a compound in the "Taliban stronghold of Musa Qala" district, where Umar and other AQIS members "had been embedded".

Asim is said to be originally from India, and spent years in the town of Miranshah, a former militant stronghold in Pakistani tribal areas near the Afghan border, according to the BBC.

Al-Qaeda top leader Ayman al-Zawahiri announced in 2013 that they would form branches in South Asian countries, including Bangladesh, but their activities were not evident.
