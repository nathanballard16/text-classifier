With these experiences, anyone associated would certainly want the film to work from the bottom of their hearts. And, when you know that you have a good project in hand, the excitement which goes into your whole system is something which I can’t explain and you are eagerly waiting for that audience reaction. There are a lot of things happening and it’s an amazing feeling.”
