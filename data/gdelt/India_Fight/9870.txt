Forget 'Surgical Strike', take a look at all the crashes of Indian jets in recent past

LAHORE – While India claims to have conducted a surgical strike across the Line of Control (LoC), it needs to have a look at the bad situation of its Air Force whose aircrafts have a long list of crashes.

In a fresh act of violating the Line of Control (LoC), an Indian aircraft on Tuesday intruded into the disputed Jammu and Kashmir region but soon returned back to India after a response from the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).

After they hurriedly tried to escape and released the payload behind in this bid, India claimed that they took the revenge of Pulwama attack for its face saving.

Pakistan will respond to Indian aggression at ... 03:34 PM | 26 Feb, 2019 ISLAMABAD – A meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) with top civil and military leadership in attendance ...

However, the recent history of Indian aircraft crashes presents a grim picture of Indian misadventures. Out of all these crashes, two happened only in February this year, what to talk of a self-claimed ‘surgical strike’.

Here’s a list of all the crashes of Indian Air Force (IAF) aircrafts since 2010 that reveals the poor capacity of India to claim attacks on Pakistani soil.
