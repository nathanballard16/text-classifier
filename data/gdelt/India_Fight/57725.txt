Give Rs 50 Lakh Compensation Each to Families of Victims’- Women India Movement

Mangaluru: Addressing the media persons during a press meet held at Mangaluru Press Club, Shahida Tasnim-the State President of Women India Movement DK said, “Our organization totally opposes the Citizenship Amendment act (CAA) and also the proposed National Register of Citizens (NRC), as it is based on religion. And regarding the violence and two deaths that took place in Mangaluru could have been prevented if the police authorities had handled the situation systematically and sensibly. What was the need to open fire when the protesters were not too harmful? They even killed two innocent persons who were not involved in the protest, which we strongly condemn the police act”.

“The claim by the police authorities that a crowd of three to four thousand people entering the North Police Station and the mob trying to burn down the police station in Bunder on 19 December is all false. There were only a few hundred protesters and not thousands as described by the cops. We urge that disciplinary action be taken against the police commissioner and other police force, including the DCP. When a small group of people were protesting peacefully near State Bank, what was the need for the police to lathi charge and hurt them badly, which led to the anger of the protesters. So the blame should fall on the police for creating violence” added Ms Tasnim.

She further said, “A judicial probe should be initiated into the case, and we urge the government to provide a compensation of Rs 50 lakh each to the families of the two victims of police firing. We will continue our fight until justice is served”. Office bearers of National Women Front DK (NWF) and Women India Movement DK (WIM) -Ms Zeenath, Ms Ayesha Bajpe, Ms Ramlath, and MCC Corporator Ms Shamshad Aboobakar were present on the dais during the press meet.
