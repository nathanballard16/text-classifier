Maharashtra drama now gets a central act

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI: President’s rule was imposed in Maharashtra for six months with a proclamation issued under Article 356(1) of the Constitution. Now, it will need to be approved by both Houses of Parliament in the winter session beginning on November 18.The proclamation will have to be revoked if the contenders for the chief minister’s office in Mantralaya approach the governor with proof of majority support.President’s rule had loomed like an imminent prospect following the failure of political parties to resolve the stalemate resulting from the refusal of Shiv Sena to support Devendra Fadnavis of BJP for another five-year term as chief minister. The NCP letter to the governor in the morning seeking more time to submit documentary evidence of support precipitated the process of imposing President’s rule.The governor had on Monday asked NCP legislative party leader Ajit Pawar if he was willing to stake claim to government formation and, if so, asked him to submit evidence of support to Raj Bhavan within 24 hours, or by 8.30pm on Tuesday.Koshyari’s move attracted flak from Shiv Sena, which has moved the Supreme Court against it. Congress, too, slammed the governor.Shiv Sena moved the Supreme Court against the refusal of the governor to grant it more time for submission of documentary evidence on Monday. “We, too, will join Shiv Sena’s legal battle, since our plea for more time has also been rejected,” NCP spokesperson Nawab Malik said.Koshyari had first invited BJP, the single-largest party to indicate its willingness to form the government. BJP had been given two days, and its legislature party leader, Fadnavis, had gone on to call on the governor to express his inability to form the government.The next party the governor invited was Shiv Sena, and MLA-elect Aditya Thackeray submitted a letter on Monday saying the party had the support of the required number of legislators but needed more time to submit documents. The request was declined by the governor, who then invited NCP.
