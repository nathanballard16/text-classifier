BJP pledges to scrap special status for Jammu & Kashmir

In India, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi said it will scrap a decades-old law providing special rights to residents of Jammu & Kashmir state.

According to the party’s election manifesto released today, Article 35A is an obstacle in the development of the state that prevents non-residents from buying property in the state.

Meanwhile, Political leaders in Muslim-majority Kashmir, where India is fighting an armed insurgency against its rule, have warned repealing the law would lead to widespread unrest.
