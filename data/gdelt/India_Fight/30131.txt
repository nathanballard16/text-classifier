NEW DELHI, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Armed rebels "Maoists" reportedly killed five policemen in India's eastern state of Jharkhand on Friday.

The attack took place on Friday evening when the policemen were patrolling a local market in Saraikela district of the state.

The "Maoists" also looted the weapons of the policemen.

Following the attack, senior police officials of the district reached the spot, and further investigation is underway.

Jharkhand Chief Minister Raghubar Das condemned the attack, saying the "sacrifice of the policemen will not go in vain." He also promised strict action against the "Maoists".

Several Indian states, including Bihar, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, have been affected by "Maoists", who mainly attack security personnel and other government installations.

Their main demand is that the local people should have a share in resources available in their areas, and there should be better standards of living and infrastructure.
