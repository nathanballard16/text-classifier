VILLAGE OF MENOMONEE FALLS - No one was injured in a fire that damaged a home on Ridgeline Trail on Wednesday, Jan. 30.

A 10:53 a.m. call sent firefighters to the home at N53 W17868 Ridgeline Trail. Protective Services Capt. Jeff Knop said the home's occupants were able to get out safely on their own and sought shelter with neighbors.

"The home received extensive damage to the interior first and second floors, as well as the roof," he said in a prepared statement. "The size of the fire forced firefighters to address it from the exterior of the home."

According to online property tax documents, the single-family home is owned by Kalyan Amar Kothapalli and Barbara Kothapalli. Knop said the home's occupants have arranged to temporarily live with relatives.

The fire grew to a two-alarm status at about 11:45 a.m., which brought in additional fire departments for help. Knop said 16 departments provided assistance, including ones from Germantown, Butler, Sussex and Lisbon.

Because of subzero temperatures, crews of firefighters rotated working on the house. The weather provided challenges in fighting the fire.

"In these conditions, water turns to ice in a short period of time, making the fire ground hazardous on which to walk," Knop said in the statement. "Hoses freeze, and ice forms on clothing and other equipment."

Renee Shafer is the mother of Butler volunteer firefighter who worked at the scene. She told him to take extra gloves and take breaks from the cold.

"If they have wet hoods or gloves and get close to the fire ... they can get steam burns," she said.

The fire's cause remains under investigation, Knop said. He noted that reports indicate the fire might have started in the laundry room.
