JNU Protest: Students Take Aim at Ministry of Human Resource Development (MHRD)

Recounting his horror, Pandey said on Tuesday (November 19) during a press conference at the university’s administration block, “I was taken away from the human chain. I thought since I told them that I am visually impaired, they would spare me a beating, but no… One of them hit me from the front and when I tried to flee, I was beaten on my leg. The boy who helped me and took me to the hospital was also attacked by the Delhi Police. When I told the policemen that I am blind, they said ‘andha hai to protest karne kyon aata hai (If you are blind, then why have you come for the protest),” said Pandey, who is also a students’ union councillor.
