Flight operations resume at Lahore, Faisalabad airports

LAHORE: The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has now reopened Faislabad airport with restrictions after resumption of flight operations at Lahore's Allama Iqbal Airport earlier today.

As per the latest NOTAM A0217/19, the CAA notified that in addition to existing NOTAM(S) A0210/19 and A0215/19 regarding availability of airspace, flight operations (domestic/international) from Faisalabad International Airport are being resumed with restricted entry/exit.

Earlier today, the aviation authority had announced to partially resume operations from Lahore.

Pakistan had closed its airspace following tensions with India on February 27 after shooting down two Indian aircraft. Later on March 01, the CAA allowed flight operations from Karachi, Quetta, Peshawar and Islamabad airports.

As per the previous directives, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sialkot and Multan airports were earlier scheduled to resume operations from March 04, 01:00 pm.
