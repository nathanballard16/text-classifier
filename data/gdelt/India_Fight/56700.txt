Translocation project fails: Sundari to head back to MP

Bhubaneswar: In a big blow to the country’s first interstate tiger translocation project, the National Tiger Conservation Authority ( NTCA ) has decided to send tigress Sundari, who arrived here from Madhya Pradesh and is currently lodged in a small enclosure in Satkosia Tiger Reserve, back to her home state.In what is as good as an official declaration of the failure of the translocation project, the NCTA attributed its decision to the state wildlife wing’s failure to ensure proper management of the animals.The NTCA deputy inspector-general Surender Mehra has conveyed its decision to chief secretary Asit Tripathy and asked him to make arrangements for Sundari’s immediate return. The tigress will be taken to the Gholera centre at Kanha Tiger Reserve in the central Indian state.“The tigress can’t be kept in a small enclosure any longer. In the interests of tiger conservation, Sundari shall be withdrawn with immediate effect. The tiger translocation project at Satkosia shall remain suspended,” the NTCA said.Sundari had been brought from the Bandhavgarh reserve in Madhya Pradesh on June 29, 2018. After around 40 days of acclimatisation, the tigress was released in the wild on August 17. Three months later, Sundari was alleged to have killed two persons. She was then darted and brought back to the enclosure.The NTCA’s move to send her back to Madhya Pradesh is based on assessment by a committee appointed by it and headed by former field director of Kanha Tiger Reserve, Khageswar Naik.Citing the committee’s report, the NTCA informed the chief secretary that both the tigers brought to Odisha as part of the project were not monitored and managed as per its Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for translocation. The male tiger (MB2) was killed by poachers.“Communications from the NTCA were not taken seriously. Sundari has been kept in a small enclosure for over a year without any efforts being made to re-wild it,” the NTCA letter said.Wildlife campaigner Biswajit Mohanty said the government should identify forest officers whose negligence and lack of foresight led to the failure of the ambitious project.
