Mumbai: MIDC warns 24 entities over fire NOC

The recent spate of fire incidents in Mumbai made Dombivli activist file an RTI query about fire compliance by various institutions in MIDC area of Dombivli. The query not only revealed that there are 24 companies, schools, colleges, malls and shops which do not have a fire NOC. But also made the Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) issue notices to them to get the no objection certificate (NOC) in seven days or else face water and electricity disconnection.

Mumbai saw many fire incidents in the year 2018 and there were five such cases reported in the last 10 days. The latest being the fire in Sargam building in Tilaknagar, Chembur on December 27 which killed five senior citizens. Alarmed by increase in such cases activist Raju Nalavade, secretary of Dombivli welfare association shot an RTI (right to information) query to MIDC, Dombivli.

"MIDC Dombivli being an industrial cum residential area we have three to four fire incidents every year. But Mumbai incidents made me think about the institutions and buildings in this area and whether they are equipped to deal with such instances," says Nalavade.

Hence, on December 21 he wrote to MIDC Dombivli asking them the list of fire non-compliant places in Dombivli MIDC Phase II. "They listed some 24 institutions which includes BSNL office, Astitva school, Model college, some chemical and dyeing companies and shops," says he.

After the query the MIDC immediately started sending notices to some of the listed institutions to get the fire NOC (no objection certificate). "Yes we have sent notices to the above mentioned places some of which do not have fire NOC and also occupancy certificate," says Sanjay Narnavare, executive engineer, Dombivli MIDC. "If they fail to comply within seven days, we will disconnect their power and water supply. This is for the first time we are going to disconnect these services so as to make them compliant," he said.
