Pakistan's Foreign Office Recalls Ambassador to India in Wake of Terror Attack

"We have called back our High Commissioner in India for consultations. He left New Delhi this morning," Foreign Office spokesman Mohammad Faisal said on Twitter, Sputnik reported.

Earlier in the day, four Indian servicemen, including one major, died during clashes with militants in the state of Jammu and Kashmir, according to The Hindustan Times.

After a short firefight in one of the villages of Pulvam County, the police and armed forces cordoned off the area and began to conduct searches. Shooting was heard on the scene and locals were asked to stay in their homes.

Last week, India recalled its ambassador to Pakistan in the wake of a suicide bombing on an Indian military convoy in the disputed Kashmir region that left over 40 troops dead.

The Indian Ministry of External Affairs has accused Pakistan of having a role in the terrorist attack and demanded that it "ceases forthwith all support and financing to terror groups operating from areas under their control".

The Pakistani Foreign Ministry, in turn, urged India to restrain from hasty conclusions and expressed readiness to cooperate in the investigation.

Jammu and Kashmir is a region that has been disputed by India and Pakistan since 1947 when both countries gained independence from the British Empire. The two countries have gone through three wars over the region, but the conflict has not been resolved. The unstable situation in the region has led to the emergence of extremist groups.
