Sushma was dearest to Kerala too

New Delhi: Popular former foreign minister Sushma Swaraj who tailored close ties with other countries was dearest to Kerala with her administrative skills and friendship.

Sushma’s interference brought the 46 Kerala nurses stranded in Iraq after a civil war between the ISIS forces and the Iraqi army intensified. Nurses were trapped in a hospital in Tikrit. On August 13, 2014 terrorists took over the control of hospital and detained the nurses and doctors on its upper stories of the hospital building.

On knowing the situation, then chief minister Oommen Chandy contacted foreign minister Shushma Swaraj. Camping in Delhi for three days, everyday Oomman Chandy visited her for this purpose. Eventually, with her constant interference and diplomatic talks with Gulf countries and Iraq government, nurses were safely brought back home. After 24 days of fear and tension, nurses were flown to Kerala in a special flight.

Later, when nearly 350 Indian labourers were stranded in Yemen, her interference saved them. It was Sushma’s initiative that brought back the Kerala priest Fr. Tom Uzhunnal from IS terrorists.
