Enforcement action by govt agencies must be neutral: EC

NEW DELHI: Hours after early morning raids by the income tax department on the residences and offices of Madhya Pradesh CM Kamal Nath ’s close aides, the EC wrote to the revenue secretary with the “strong advice” that all enforcement action by agencies under its jurisdiction be “absolutely neutral, impartial and non-discriminatory”.TOI has learnt that the MP chief electoral officer (CEO) had no inkling of the raids until 8 am, though they are said to have started around 3 am. The income tax nodal officer later informed the CEO that even the local office of the I-T department had no prior information of the raids and the entire team for the raids, including CRPF personnel, had come from Delhi. In fact, the MP CEO is said to have conveyed to the EC that he had not received a report from the I-T nodal officer till 7 pm on Sunday evening.This is probably why the EC wrote to the revenue secretary on Sunday evening saying that where use of illicit money was suspected for electoral purposes, “the chief electoral officer of the state concerned be kept suitably informed during the period of the model code of conduct”.The EC said use of money power with the intention of influencing voter behaviour had emerged as one of the biggest challenges for the conduct of free, fair, ethical and credible elections, in the process undermining the very fabric of Indian democracy
