Meerut: Woman murdered by cousin for refusing to continue affair

A 22-year-old man allegedly murdered his 18-year-old cousin in Shamli, Meerut for refusing to continue with their affair.

The man, identified as Monu, killed his cousin by allegedly strangulating her in a sugarcane farm and fled the spot, reported the Times of India.

Police said that the duo worked as labourers in Punjab, and when the woman moved to Shamli, she wanted to end the affair.

Police have registered a case and a team has been formed to nab the accused.

Sandeep Baliyan, station house officer, Thana Bhawan police station, told Times of India, "The incident came to fore on Monday morning when some villagers spotted the dead body of an 18-year-old woman at a sugarcane field in Goshgarh village here. Prima facie it seems she was strangulated to death. But we have sent her body for postmortem to have a clear picture."
