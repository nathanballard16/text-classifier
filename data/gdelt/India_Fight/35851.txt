BJP session on Trinamul ‘misrule’

The session will be held at the Parliament Library on Wednesday and Thursday. The eight Bengal BJP MPs are Dilip Ghosh, Khagen Murmu, Babul Supriyo, Swapan Dasgupta, Locket Chatterjee, Subhas Sarkar, Debasreee Chaudhuri and Jyotirmoy Mahato.

Four teams of two Bengal BJP MPs each will address a two-day session for the party’s parliamentarians in New Delhi on alleged atrocities by the Mamata Banerjee government.

“As per the instruction of Prime Minister Narendra Modiji, we will meet groups of MPs and tell them about the misrule of chief minister Mamata Banerjee in Bengal,” said Murmu.

BJP insiders said the idea behind the initiative was to launch a nation-wide campaign against the state government and highlight how workers of the Opposition party and commoners were becoming the victims of alleged atrocities inflicted by Trinamul.

“The proposed meeting is part of a strategy to embarrass Mamata and show how Trinamul has been throttling democracy in the state,” said a BJP source.

In another development, the BJP has taken to Delhi relatives of 24 “victims” of Trinamul “misrule”, including the parents of two youths who were shot dead at Daribhit in North Dinajpur.

Sources said the families would address a convention at the Constitution Club in Delhi on July 24 in the presence of former external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj.

“There are possibilities of the victims’ relatives meeting Union home minister and BJP chief Amit Shahji,” said a state BJP functionary. However, a meeting with Modi is not yet confirmed, said a source.

The team also includes the kin of three BJP workers murdered in Purulia, and families of the victims of clashes at Sandeshkhali and Bhatpara.
