New Delhi, March 14

Central drug inspectors have cracked down on unlicensed orthopaedic implant units across India and sealed 29 found violating safety standards.

Five traders are also being proceeded against for producing orthopaedic implants with non-medical grade quality raw material and in unhygienic conditions.

The Intelligence Cell at the Central Drug Standards Control Authority, constituted in March 2018, cleared the raids after information with respect to violations under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.

“The cell received information that several unlicensed manufacturing activities are being carried out. Our officers physically verified the activities. In all, 45 manufacturers were identified for raids — eight in Maharashtra, six each in Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh and 25 in Delhi. We formed 37 inspection teams with 125 officers and conducted inspections across all 45 locations in four states on March 11. Of these, 29 firms and five traders were found manufacturing or selling orthopaedic implants without licences,” Drug Controller General of India S Eswara Reddy told The Tribune. — TNS
