US says abrogation of Article 370 India's internal matter, asks Pakistan to rein in terror groups

Ahead of the one on one between US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday on the sidelines of the G7 summit in France, Washington has made it clear that removing the special status for the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir is India's internal matter even as it called Pakistan to rein in terror groups.

During a press briefing as Trump heads to France for G7, a senior Trump administration official said, "India’s decision to rescind Article 370 in Kashmir is an internal decision, but certainly with regional implications."

The official said, while "President is likely to stress the need for dialogue among all sides of the conflict", he has also been "calling on Pakistan to prevent the infiltration of militants across the line of control that divides Kashmir and to crack down on groups on its territory that have attacked India in the past."

The February 14 terror attack in Pulwama, the worst terror attack on Indian soil, was perpetrated by Pakistan based United Nations listed terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Trump is also expected to urge from PM how he plans to "uphold respect for human rights for Kashmir"

The one on one at the 45th G7 Summit in Biarritz, France comes almost two months after both leaders met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Osaka, Japan.

On Trump's offer to mediate between India and Pakistan, the White House official said no formal request has come from India.

He said, "he has indicated -- that he is ready to assist if both sides are interested in helping to reduce their tensions. But we just note that India has not requested any formal mediation."

Since the meet in Osaka, both leaders had a telephone conversation earlier this week during which along with Pakistan and Afghanistan, trade was also a key issue.

The official said, "US is looking to India to reduce tariffs and open its markets."
