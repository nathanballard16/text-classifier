Actor Shah Rukh Khan’s daughter Suhana Khan is currently pursuing higher education in London and making the best use of the opportunity by enjoying her college life. Now, new pictures of Suhana attending a theme party with her friends has surfaced online.

Last month, pictures of Suhana at friend Athena’s birthday party in London went viral. She was dressed in a white full-sleeve dress and posed for selfies with her hair left open.

She was recently in India during her college break and spent quality time with her family, including her elder brother Aryan Khan. He is currently pursuing a film course at a college in the US. The siblings were also spotted on a fun outing with their friends Ananya Panday and Shanaya Kapoor.
