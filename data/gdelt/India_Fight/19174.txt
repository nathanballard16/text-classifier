Where did Amraam Missile come from? Nirmala Sitharaman shoots down US media report on F-16

The Pentagon poured cold water on the allegations saying it ‘wasn’t aware of any investigation into the matter’.

Contradicting the news report which claimed that officials had taken stock and come to the conclusion that no F-16 was downed, the US state department said it wasn't aware of any investigation into the matter and that US had suspended security assistance to Pakistan since Jan 2018.

The state department meanwhile distanced itself and told a newspaper: “As a matter of policy, the Department does not publicly comment on details of government-to-government agreements on end-use monitoring of US-origin defence articles.”

The statement from the US State Department also added, “It is important to note that since January 2018, the United States government has suspended security assistance to Pakistan.”

The Indian Air Force on February 28 displayed pieces of the AMRAAM missile, fired by a Pakistani F-16, as evidence to "conclusively" prove that Pakistan deployed US-manufactured F-16 fighter jets during an aerial raid targeting Indian military installations in Kashmir.

This was in direct contradiction to India's claim that IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman shot down a Pakistani F-16 with his MiG-21 Bison before his plane was downed.

Varthaman was captured by the Pakistani forces and later released as a peace gesture.
