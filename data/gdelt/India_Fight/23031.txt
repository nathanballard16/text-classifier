'Burning files is not going to save you': Rahul Gandhi's jibe at PM Modi after fire at Shastri Bhawan

A fire broke out at Delhi's Shastri Bhawan on Tuesday afternoon. While the fire was immediately doused, it did not stop Congress president Rahul Gandhi from launching a diatribe on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

"Modi ji burning files is not going to save you. Your day of judgement is coming," the Congress chief said while commenting on the news of fire at the building which houses several Central government ministries.

The fire was reported in the afternoon but was quickly brought under control as the fire fighting department swung into the action.

At least seven fire tenders were deployed at the spot to put the blaze out. There were no casualties reported.

It was not yet clear if any documents were lost in the blaze.

The reason for the fire is yet to be ascertained. "The fire broke out at the top floor in the waste material of cooler and electrical wires. The reason behind the fire has not been ascertained. At least 5-6 fire tenders were at the spot," R Meena, a senior official of the fire department, said.

Shastri Bhavan, named after India's second Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, is located at Dr Rajendra Prasad Road in Central Delhi.

The building houses Ministries of Human Resources Development, Law & Justice, Information & Broadcasting, Corporate Affairs, Chemicals and Petrochemicals, Culture, Women & Child Development among other offices of various government departments.
