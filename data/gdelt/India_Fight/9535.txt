Facing timely and effective response from Pakistan Air Force released payload in haste while escaping which fell near Balakot . No casualties or damage," Major General Asif Ghafoor, Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the media wing of the Pakistan Army, said in a tweet."Indian Air Force violated Line of Control Pakistan. Pakistan Air Force immediately scrambled. Indian aircraft gone back," he tweeted.Senator Sherry Rehman, a leading opposition leader of the Pakistan Peoples Party, said that "Indian incursion" across the LOC is strategically "ill-advised and tactically pointless"."Such moves only ratchet up tensions in a region bristling with anger."Obvious that (Prime Minister Narendra) Modi's election wardrums make prospects for talks collateral damage.
