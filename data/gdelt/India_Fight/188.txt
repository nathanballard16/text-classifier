Delhi: Bihar ex-MLA, driver held for shooting woman at New Year party

Police said the former two-time MLA, Raju Kumar Singh, is “absconding” along with his driver. Singh, who switched to the BJP in 2015, is an influential real-estate businessman hailing from Muzaffarpur.

Delhi Police Tuesday arrested former Bihar MLA Raju Singh and his driver for allegedly shooting at and critically injuring a 45-year-old woman at a New Year party in his south Delhi farmhouse a day ago. They were arrested in Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh and are being brought to Delhi.

“The MLA was arrested from Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh. We have recovered two rifles, one pistol and 800 live cartridges from his farmhouse. He was the one who fired celebratory shots. One of the bullets hit the woman, Archana Gupta, in the head,” said Special Commissioner of Police, R P Upadhyay.

Gupta was shot at around midnight on Monday and doctors said she is in “critical condition” at a private hospital in Vasant Kunj.

Singh, police said, absconded soon after the incident. A former member of JD (U) who switched to BJP in 2015, Singh is an influential real-estate businessman from Muzaffarpur. He faces five cases in Bihar, including two under the Arms Act and another of an attempt to murder. In Monday’s incident, an FIR was registered against him for an attempt to murder and destruction of evidence, based on the Archana’s husband, Vikas Gupta’s complaint. Vikas is a realtor.

The Police were informed of the incident by officials at Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, where she was taken to after being shot at.
