New Delhi: Congress leader in Lok Sabha Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury has said that President's rule should be imposed in West Bengal if situation warrants. He, however, questioned BJP's seriousness in the matter. Chowdhury's remarks came a day after a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) worker and his family members were brutally murdered in Murshidabad district of West Bengal following which the RSS asked the Centre to consider imposing President's rule in the state.

"The state BJP leaders are pleading for imposing the President's Rule in West Bengal. If the situation warrants so, then certainly the President's Rule should be imposed there. But our question is if the BJP leaders are as serious about the issue as they appear to be from outside," Chowdhury told news agency ANI.

"After Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the investigation into the Ponzi scam has slowed down. Has there been an agreement between West Bengal Chief Minister and the Prime Minister? There is a sense of doubt about the seriousness of BJP leaders against the state government," he further said.

An RSS worker, his wife and a child were mercilessly murdered at his residence on Wednesday. According to local RSS leaders, the worker was associated with the weekly meeting of the organisation.

"I wonder if it is time for the Central government to consider whether the governance in West Bengal can run according to the Indian Constitution or time has come to consider the imposition of President's rule," Alok Kumar, a senior RSS leader had earlier told ANI.
