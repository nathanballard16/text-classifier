Better to fight war with Pakistan than suffer daily: Ramdev - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

RAIPUR: Yoga guru Baba Ramdev said

Tuesday that in the wake of the Pulwama terror attack, India

should “fight a war” against Pakistan to teach it a lesson.

He also said India should extend all kind of help to

the separatist movement in Balochistan, a southwestern

province of Pakistan.

“A befitting reply has to be given to Pakistan and

terrorists. First of all, we have to break Pakistan into three

pieces,” he said.

As many as 40 CRPF jawans were killed in Pulwama in

South Kashmir on February 14 in a suicide bombing attack,

owned up by Pak-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

India has lost “over 50,000 soldiers and civilians” so

far due to the nefarious activities of Pakistan, Ramdev said,

adding, “Now we have to teach a lesson to Pakistan. We must

fight a war. Instead of suffering every day, it’s better to

fight a war and teach Pakistan such a lesson that it can not

dare to stand for the next fifty years.”

The Yoga guru was speaking to reporters after the

launch of a Patanjali apparel store, a venture of his

Patanjali group, here.
