Killed: J&K terrorist who shot 5-year-old girl in the leg

SRINAGAR: Security forces on Wednesday gunned down a "top" Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist who they said had led the attack last week in which a five-year-old girl was shot in the leg because her trader grandfather had disobeyed the outfit's diktat to keep his fruit business shut.Asif Maqbool Bhat of Baramulla district was killed in a hideout in Sopore town, which security forces had cordoned off on the basis of intelligence reports, officials said. Two policemen were injured when Asif hurled hand grenades on the advancing team.Jammu and Kashmir DGP Dilbagh Singh said the slain terrorist had been intimidating traders in north Kashmir to keep their shops shut as part of his outfit's strategy to prevent the return of normalcy.The attack on the defiant fruit trader's family at Dangerpora in Sopore, around 45km from Srinagar , was meant to scare others into submission, Singh said. Besides the little girl, two other members of her family were injured in the attack.Eight Lashkar operatives arrested a few days ago told police that they had been assigned the task of printing and distributing posters that warn people against resuming normal life. The arrested men also revealed that they were reporting to Asif and two of his associates, Sajjad alias Hyder and Mudasir Pandit, the DGP said.Terrorists from the Hizbul Mujahideen have also been going around asking traders and shoppers not to step out beyond the timings mentioned in the posters. "I was driving down Srinagar this afternoon when a masked youth appeared in the middle of the road near Bhagat Chowk and tried to disrupt traffic. I somehow managed to dodge him," said Mukhtar Ahmad Dar, a resident of the Channapora area.Abdul Ghaffar Khan of Pulwama said he had "heard" about militants now stopping private cars and asking the motorists to return home. "Farmers have been asked not to collect fruit from the orchards," he added.
