CRPF man kills 3 colleagues, shoots self in Udhampur

UDHAMPUR, Mar 22: CRPF soldier opened fire on his three colleagues in Udhampur. The soldier, who opened fire is critically injured in the incident that happened on Wednesday night after an argument, said officials.

Senior CRPF and police officials immediately went to the camp. "Three jawans have died and the one who shot them is critically injured," Harinder Kumar, CRPF Commandant of the 187th Battalion said.

The three dead are head constables, Pokarmal R of Jhunjhunu in Rajasthan and Yogendra Sharma of Delhi. The third personnel, Umed Singh, was a resident of Rewari in Haryana.

The incident happened at around 10.00 PM when Constable Ajit Kumar fired at his colleagues with his service rifle over a disagreement, said senior officials at the camp.

Ajit Kumar, who comes from Kanpur, is being treated at a military hospital nearby, the officers said.

The alleged case of fratricide comes just two months after a CRPF personnel fired at his two colleagues before killing himself at a camp in Pantha Chowk in Srinagar on January 7. Senior officials said that he was disturbed due to "personal issues".

Earlier in September 2018, a Border Security Force (BSF) personnel shot his colleague at a camp in Ghaziabad. Constable Ajit killed his batch mate Jagpreet with his INSAS rifle. Both jawans were guarding forces based in Gurgaon and were deployed as part of a unit to help the Ghaziabad Police in law and order duties.
