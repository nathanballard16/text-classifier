Youth held for trying to shoot criminal in Delhi hospital

New Delhi, April 12 : A 23-year-old youth was arrested on Friday for allegedly trying to kill a murder accused who was taken to a hospital in west Delhi for medical examination, a police officer said.

The incident occurred at 1 p.m. when the accused, who has been identified as Prasanjit, entered the BSA Hospital in Rohini with a pistol.

"Prasanjit, a resident of Sagarpur in west Delhi, was arrested with a loaded pistol having six live rounds when he came to the BSA Hospital with an intention to shoot a criminal identified as Karanvir," said Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) S.D. Mishra.

Karanvir, who is accused in a murder case, was taken to the hospital for medical examination under police custody, Mishra said.

"Prima facie it appears to be a case of personal animosity, but we are interrogating Prasanjit to know why he was trying to kill Karanvir," the DCP added.
