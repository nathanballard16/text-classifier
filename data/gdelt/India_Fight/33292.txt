A wanted criminal was arrested here after a brief exchange of fire with police, officials said Friday.

The arrested accused, Gyanendra Pauwa, also carries a reward of Rs 25,000 on his head, police said.

He is wanted in three cases of dacoity and booked under the Gangster Act. His accomplice fled the spot and will be nabbed soon, Kumar said.
