Chandigarh: Indian Air Force inducts Chinook multi-mission helicopters

The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Monday inducted advanced multi-mission helicopters ‘Chinook’ at Chandigarh. Chinook helicopters will provide IAF with unmatched strategic airlift capability across the full spectrum of combat and humanitarian missions.

“IAF received its first CH-47F (I) Chinook heavy-lift helicopter on 10 Feb 19 at the Mundra port in Gujarat. On 25 Mar 19, it will be formally inducted into the Helicopter fleet of IAF at Chandigarh,” Indian Air Force tweeted.

Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa attended the induction ceremony and said, “Country faces multiple security challenges. We require vertical lift capability across a diversified terrain. Chinook has been procured with India specific enhancements. It is a national asset.”

“Chinook can deliver heavy payloads to high altitudes and is eminently suited for operations in the high Himalayas. It will greatly enhance India’s capabilities across a range of military & HADR missions,” IAF said.

“Chinook is a heavy lift, tandem rotor helicopter which serves armed forces of 19 countries. It is a multi-role platform and is used for the transport of troops and material among other roles. It will greatly enhance IAF’s HADR capability,” it added.
