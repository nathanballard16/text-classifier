Rashtrapati Bhavan forecourt all set to host 8,000 for Modi swearing-in today

NEW DELHI: Dal Raisina, the centre piece of the private dinner President Ram Nath Kovind will host for the newly inducted Prime Minister, Vice President of India, foreign dignitaries and envoys from eight countries on May 30, is already bubbling away quietly under the watchful eyes of Chef Montu Saini.In its new avatar, the concoction of black lentils infused with Lucknawi spices, has to simmer on slow flame for 48 hours before it is laid out before its VIP connoisseurs, it’s mild aroma wafting across the room where about 35 of them will be gathered. But before the succulent dal arrives, there’s lemon coriander soup for starters, a variety of chicken and fish preparations for the meat eaters, and palak and vegetable concoctions for the vegetarian dignitaries.Outside, preparations are nearly complete for the solemn and minimally ostentatious ceremony in Rashtrapati Bhawan’s forecourt, where nearly 8,000 people will gather to watch Narendra Modi take oath as Prime Minister for a second term. Lessons have been drawn from the 2014 oath-taking ceremony and the programme has been moved forward to 7 pm instead of 6 pm in 2014, to beat the peak summer heat. The hour-and-a half-long swearing-in will culminate in high tea, where guests can partake of a variety of fruit and lemon tarts, sandwiches, samosas, ‘rajbhog’ for those with a sweet tooth, and to drink tea, coffee and lemonade.This time, Rashtrapati Bhawan has also set up elevated seating to ensure that guests seated in the rear rows are able to get a clear view of the swearing-in ceremony. Officials said adequate arrangements have also been put in place for drinking water, as well as rest rooms for the guests in attendance.This is only the fourth time that the Prime Minister’s swearing-in has been moved into the open instead of inside the Durbar Hall, where it is traditionally held. With nearly 4,000 people in attendance in 2014, PM Modi’s swearing-in was moved to the Rashtrapati Bhawan forecourt. Before him, only two other Prime Ministers — Chandra Shekhar and Atal Bihari Vajpayee — were sworn-in outside the Durbar Hall.Officials said apart from foreign dignitaries, the guest list at the swearing-in ceremony includes the Chief Justice of India, Members of Parliament, bureaucrats and a large number of BJP party leaders, their families and party workers who have invited to attend.
