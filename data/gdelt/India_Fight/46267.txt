Six Elephants Fell To Their Deaths From Haew Narok Waterfall While Trying To Save Each Other

Elephants have a very strong sense of family bonding. Hence you will find that a herd of elephants never leaves a family member behind, or that a mother elephant would go to any length to protect her baby.

In a very tragic incident, six elephants fell to their deaths while trying to protect each other from a waterfall. The incident occurred in central Thailand's Khao Yai National Park, where reportedly a baby elephant slipped over the waterfall.

The waterfall is known as Haew Narok (Hell's Fall) and this incident is not the first of its kind to have occurred there. Authorities were called to the scene when a group of eight elephants were found blocking a road that led to the waterfall.

After sometime a body of a three-year-old elephant was found near the base of Haew Narok. Five other bodies were also discovered nearby.

Two other elephants were found struggling on the edge of a cliff nearby, fortunately they were rescued by Thai authorities.

The two elephants who were rescued are being monitored, but the founder of Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand Edwin Wiek said that the duo might have difficulty in surviving as 'elephants rely on their large herds for protection and finding food'. The whole incident could also take an emotional toll on the two because of the deep sense of family bonding elephants have. They are also known to express grief.
