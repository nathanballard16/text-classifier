Hyderabad: Police hunts for scientist murderer

Police suspect a person, who used to visit Suresh Kumar, behind the murder and a manhunt has been launched. Police suspect him going by the apartment’s watchman.

Hyderabad: SR Nagar police formed four special teams to crack the murder mystery of S. Suresh Kumar, the 56-year-old Scientist of the National remote sensing agency (NRSA) Balanagar. Police suspect a person, who used to visit Suresh Kumar, behind the murder and a manhunt has been launched. Police suspect him going by the apartment’s watchman.

According to the Panja-gutta ACP M. Thiru-pathanna, on Monday evening at around 5.30 pm when it was raining, Suresh Kumar came to his residence and since then, he was neither seen by the watchman nor neighbours. When the maid came the next morning, she found the door locked from outside and went back. Since calls from family members and others went unanswered, one of the colleagues was asked to visit the apartment and even he found a locked door and informed the family.

Indira Suresh Kumar, 52-year-old wife of the scientist, who was working as a bank manager in Chennai rushed to Hyderabad along with her daughter and son-in-law and when she unlocked the door, in the presence of the police, Suresh Kumar was found in a pool of blood with three injuries to his head. Prima facie it looks like blunt force trauma might be the reason for his death, police said.

Indira came to know that a certain Srinivas used to visit her husband’s flat and moved closely with him. She then lodged a police complaint with SR Nagar police suspecting the role of Srinivas in the murder.

SR nagar police booked a case of murder and formed four special teams.

Meanwhile, they have questioned many others. Police ruled out the role of any family members as there was no motive including financial issues.

Meanwhile police handed over the victim to the family members after the post-mortem at Gandhi Hospital morgue.
