Srinagar: In a worrying development, the Islamic State terror group has announced that it has set up a new "province" in India. The Islamic State, which is also known by the acronym ISIS or ISIL, made the announcement on Saturday through its Amaq News Agency.

The ISIS has named the new branch as "Wilayah of Hind" (India Province) in Arabic.

Director of the SITE Intel Group that tracks Islamic extremists, Rita Katz posted on Twitter: "ISIS declares its new ‘Hind Province’ while claiming clashes with Indian forces in Amshipora. Of course, the establishment of a 'province' in a region where it has nothing resembling actual governance is absurd, but it should not be written off."

News agency PTI reported a senior police official in Jammu and Kashmir as saying that they do not believe in the claim.

While the ISIS announced the move in a low-key manner and did not reveal many details, it is seen as part of its overall strategy of establishing affiliate bases in other parts of the world following territorial losses in the Middle East.

The terror group’s leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had talked about such moves in the past.

In a statement issued on Friday, the ISIS claimed that its members had engaged in clashes with the Indian security forces in Amshipora village in South Kashmir's Shopian district. The ISIS terrorists were carrying machine guns during the encounter, the statement added, without elaborating when the incident actually took place.

ISIS had announced its presence in Kashmir first in November 2017 when it claimed attacks on Indian security forces in Kashmir.
