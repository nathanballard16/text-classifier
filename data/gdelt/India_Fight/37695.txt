India revokes special status of Kashmir, putting tense region on edge

Monday’s move comes after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s hard-line Hindu nationalist party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP, won a big victory in Indian elections in May. The decision and its stealthy implementation are likely to further damage New Delhi’s relationship with its most restive state and ignite unrest there. There are also worries that the move may ratchet up tensions between the majority Hindus and the minority Muslims in the rest of the country.
