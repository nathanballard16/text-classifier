Chidambaram inx Media case: SC setback for Chidambaram, no protection from arrest by ED in INX Media case

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court Thursday refused to protect P Chidambaram from arrest by the Enforcement Directorarte in the INX Media money laundering case, following which the former finance minister withdrew another petition challenging his arrest and remand by CBI.An apex court bench of Justices R Banumathi and A S Bopanna dismissed Chidambaram's plea challenging the Delhi High Court verdict denying him anticipatory bail in the case, saying economic offence has to be dealt with differently as it affects economy of the country."It is not a fit case to grant anticipatory bail", the court ruled, adding that economic offences involved deep-rooted conspiracies which cannot be successfully probed if the accused knew he would be protected.Justice Banumathi said the investigating agency should be given sufficient freedom to conduct probe into the case, and that anticipatory bail was not a matter of right. She asked him to move the trial court for regular bail.The top court also rejected Chidambaram's application for direction to the ED to produce transcripts of his questioning done by the agency on three dates.Shortly afterward, Chidambaram's lawyer Abhishek Manu Singhvi - possibly prompted by the adverse comments - unconditionally withdrew Chidambaram's petition challenging his arrest and remand in CBI custody. That petition was to come up for hearing before the same bench a short while later.With no relief from the SC, the focus shifts to the Rouse Avenue trial court where Chidambaram's plea for bail comes for hearing in the afternoon at the end of his 15 days in CBI custody. If he is refused bail, the former finance minister would be sent to judicial custody - in this instance , Tihar Jail - a prospect he seems keen to avoid.Even if he does get bail, he faces arrest by the ED and a prospect of further custodial interrogation before he can apply for regular bail.The INX media case is about alleged irregularities in FIPB clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram's tenure as finance minister. The CBI lodged an FIR in May 2017, following which the ED lodged a money laundering case.Chidambaram was arrested on August 21, a day after the Delhi High Court struck down his anticipatory bail plea, and has since been in CBI custody. The high court held that he was "prima facie the kingpin" in the INX Media corruption and money laundering cases and "simply because he is a Member of Parliament would not justify grant of pre arrest bail to him".
