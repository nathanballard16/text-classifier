EC plans to use sat phones, drones in parts of Bengal

Kolkata, May 8 : The Election Commission plans to use satellite phones and drones to ensure security in the Junglemahal area, a Maoist stronghold, which is slated to hold the Lok Sabha polls on May 12, sources said on Monday.

Election Commission sources said all booths in Jhargram Lok Sabha seat will be manned by Central forces. "Also, we plan to use satellite phones and even drones for security purposes," a source said.

Additional Chief Electoral Officer Sanjay Basu said all required measures were being taken in the Junglemahal region (vast forested stretches in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura districts where Maoist rebels were once very active).

"All required measures will be taken to ensure successful voting in Junglemahal region. Sufficient Central forces will be deployed," Basu said.

About faults in EVMs and VVPATs due to rising summer temperatures, Basu said: "We have decided to increase the number of VVPATs in the sixth and seventh phase".

The convoys of two prominent BJP leaders - Assam Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma and party's West Bengal President Dilip Ghosh - were allegedly attacked by Trinamool activists in East Midnapore district on Tuesday, but both were unhurt.

Basu said he has sought a report from the District Election Officer but he is yet to get any update.
