His tweet came after a leading US journal rejected the Indian claim of downing a Pakistani F-16 during a brief battle in February 2019.

Two senior US defense officials with direct knowledge of the situation told the US Magazine Foreign Policy that the US personnel recently counted F-16s in Pakistan and found none missing.

The Magazine said that India has once again misled the world through baseless and false claims.
