MLCU organises workshop on documentary filmmaking

SHILLONG: Martin Luther Christian University (MLCU) organised a workshop on Documentary Filmmaking from the February 26 which concluded here on Friday.

The Resource Person of this Workshop was Professor Rakesh Katarey, Dean, College of Journalism and Mass Communication, Dayanda Sagar University, Bangalore. The Inauguration of the Workshop was attended by Dr. Glenn Kharkongor, Chancellor, Martin Luther Christian University accompanied by the Vice-Chancellor of the University

The Workshop was attended by students of the University and members of the faculty. Throughout the workshop, Professor Katarey dealt extensively with the various characteristics of film like scenes, shots, sequences and also with a wide array of basic filmmaking technicalities like the basic principles of the usage of the camera, the utilisation of sound, the techniques of editing and various other aspects.

Professor Katarey also emphasised on the importance of a documentary as a powerful medium of faithfully representing truth and reality as it is a medium where minimal human intervention is carried out during the documentation process.

He also briefed the participants on the various types of documentaries and the ones they can choose to best suit their intended purposes. The participants were given practical examples of whatever they were taught with the aid of footage from various mainstream movies and music videos where the techniques employed in them were analysed. Further, they were also given a hands-on experience where they were made to click photographs and shoot videos. These photos and videos were examined by Professor Katarey who then pointed out on the various areas where improvement can be made.

The participants expressed their delight at having been part of this workshop and stated that the workshop had indeed helped them understand the technicalities more deeply.
