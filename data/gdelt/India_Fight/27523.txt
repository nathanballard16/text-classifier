Chennai’s breakdancers ready to battle it out

Chennai is seeing the rise of its first generation of breakdancers: B-boys and B-girls, most of whom have grown up practising in streets, parks, and now, in rented studios.

Chennai currently has almost 80 breakdancers, who either go solo or are part of the six major crews. Some of them have gone on to perform in national and international competitions in countries such as Korea and Malaysia.
