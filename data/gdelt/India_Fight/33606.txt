Nine surrender in Prince Santhakumar murder case

Saravana Bhavan hotel owner, another person seek more time on health grounds

Nine convicts in the Prince Santhakumar murder case were lodged in Central Prison after they surrendered before a sessions court on the Madras High Court premises on Monday. The main offender, P. Rajagopal, owner of the Saravana Bhavan chain of restaurants, and another person did not appear on health grounds.

Prince Santhakumar’s wife Jeevajothi is the daughter of Ramaswamy, who was an employee of Saravana Bhavan. Rajagopal wanted to marry her but as she did not oblige, Rajagopal plotted the murder of her husband Santhakumar, according to prosecution. An unidentified body was found by forest officials at Perumalmalai in the Kodaikanal range in October 2001. It was buried in the Kodaikanal municipal burial ground. Later, the body was identified as that of Santhakumar. The prosecution appealed before the Madras High Court against the order of trial court in Poonamallee which sentenced Rajagopal to 10 years imprisonment.

In 2009, the Madras High Court sentenced Rajagopal and five others — his manager Daniel,55, Karmegam, 55, Jahir Hussain, 51, Kasi alias Kasi Viswanathan, 63, and Patturajan, 50, to life imprisonment. Tamilselvan, 53, Sethu, 55, and Muruganandham, 49, were sentenced to three years’ imprisonment and two others, Balu, 56, and Janarthanan, 54, to two years’ imprisonment. In March, the Supreme Court upheld the order of the Madras High Court and gave the convicts time till July 7 for surrendering before the trial court. As per the orders of the Supreme Court, nine of them surrendered before IV Additional City Sessions Court with their advocates. Judge Thanendran ordered them to be jailed.

Counsel for prosecution maintained that Rajagopal and Janardhanan moved the Supreme Court seeking more time to surrender on health grounds.
