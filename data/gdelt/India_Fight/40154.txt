Chhota Rajan, 5 others get 8 years in prison for attempted murder, extortion

Underworld don Chhota Rajan and five others have been sentenced to prison for eight years by a special court in Mumbai in a 2012 attempt-to-murder and extortion case lodged against them by a Mumbai hotelier.

Earlier today, the court had convicted Chhota Rajan and five others under the Arms Act. The court delivered the quantum of sentence in the afternoon.

Apart from a prison sentence, the court has also asked the underworld don to pay a fine of Rs 5 lakh.

Earlier, Special court judge AT Wankhede convicted the six under various sections of the stringent Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (MCOCA) in the case of hotelier BR Shetty, who was shot at in suburban Andheri when he was going to meet his friend.

Rajan is currently lodged in Tihar jail in Delhi after his deportation to India following his arrest in Indonesia in October 2015.
