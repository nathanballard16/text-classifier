We had earlier reported that Rashmika Mandanna, who rose to fame through Vijay Deverakonda's sensational blockbuster Geetha Govindam last year, had signed her first film in Tamil. Now, it's officially confirmed by the team as a formal pooja ceremony was held for the yet-untitled project in which Rashmika will be paired opposite Karthi.

Produced by SR Prakash Babu and SR Prabhu of Dream Warrior Pictures, the film, which is fondly called by fans as Karthi 19 on social media platforms, will be directed by Bakkiyaraj Kannan, who made his feature film debut through the superhit romance drama Remo.

Meanwhile, Karthi has already wrapped up the shooting of Kaithi, directed by Maanagaram fame Lokesh Kanagaraj in Chennai. Kaithi is also bankrolled by Dream Warrior Pictures, and the project is one of the eagerly awaited films of Karthi since it features no heroine, is full of action and is majorly during the night.

"The process of erecting a grand set work for this film is happening in full swing in Chennai. Apart from Tamil Nadu, the team has planned to shoot some crucial scenes in Hyderabad as well," read a statement from Bakkiyaraj Kannan earlier. Dream Warrior Pictures assures that the film will be loved by family audiences just as they received Karthi's entertaining movies like Siruthai and Kadaikutty Singam.

Vivek-Mervin duo has been signed to compose music for this film, which will have cinematography handled by Sathyan Sooryan. Jai (Art), Dhilip Subbarayan (Stunts), Rajeevan (Production Designer) and Ruben (Editing) and Aravind Raj Bhaskaran (Executive Producer) are the other technicians onboard
