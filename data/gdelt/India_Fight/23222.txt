Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions godown catches fire; causes huge destruction of books and artefacts

In what can be called as a shocking incident, Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions godown in Mumbai caught fire which took place at 2:30 in the morning. Reportedly, the fire destroyed many properties including several books, costumes and artefacts. The fire started early around 2:30 in the morning and soon 12 fire engines were called to extinguish the fire before it could cause any further destruction. The Hindu quoted a police inspector Jyotsna Rasam who revealed, “Investigation is underway to identify the source of the fire.” Chief fire officer PS Rahangdale further added, “We have disconnected their electric and water supply. Action will be taken if lapses are found.”

Dharma Productions had reportedly leased the godown from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation(BMC) and it was primarily used to store all the important equipments used for shooting like the costumes, books and various other artefacts. In their arrival, the fire brigade soon pressed six water tankers and around eight fire engines into service and then doused the Level 111 medium.

There has been no official statement from Karan Johar since the fateful incident. Reportedly, the materials which got tremendously damaged in the incident were properties belonging to Dharma Productions which were supposed to be used in the upcoming films presented by the production house like Student Of The Year 2, Brahmastra and Karan Johar’s magnum opus Takht.
