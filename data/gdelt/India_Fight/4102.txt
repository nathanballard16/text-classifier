Sanya Malhotra’s upcoming film, the Ritesh Batra-directed Photograph, was recently screened at theand now will be showcased at the Berlin Film Festival which kicks off on February 7. And after terrific performances in Dangal, Pataakha and Badhaai Ho, the 26-year-old actress has caught the eye again, and not just of critics back home. The Hollywood Reporter has listed her as one of the five talents to look out for at Berlinale and Sanya is naturally elated.“A friend forwarded me the article, it feels great to be appreciated for a film as special as Photograph. Berlin is a prestigious film festival and a great platform to showcase my talent.” Talking about how she bagged the film she revealed that a couple of days after Dangal’s release, casting director Mukesh Chhabra patched her on a call with Ritesh.“But since he was busy with Hollywood films, this one took off only seven months after Dangal even though Photograph was actually the second film I signed. I hope the response in India is as overwhelming as that at Sundance. It was memorable working with an accomplished actor like.”Talking about her diverse film choices, the actress says, “I am blessed to explore different genres, but it isn’t a conscious effort. It’s just that I am being offered great scripts by different directors,” she beams, gearing up to shoot’s yet-untitled next oppositelater this month.“I have already worked with Anurag on an ad film, he has his own style of working. Fatima (Sana Shaikh, Dangal co-star) who’s been shooting with him recently told me that he is a fun director to work with,” she concludes with a smile.
