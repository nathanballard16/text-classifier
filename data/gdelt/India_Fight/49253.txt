In Occupied Kashmir, in negation of New Delhi’s own claim about normalcy in occupied territory, authorities did not allow people to participate in the night-long prayers at Chrar-e- Sharief in Budgam district.

Talking to media, a group of devotees from different areas of Srinagar said police had sealed the area day before the celebrations commenced.

People from various areas of Kashmir valley said that they were not allowed by the Indian police to enter the premises of the shrine.
