EXCLUSIVE: Bharat: Katrina Kaif comes to her co stars' rescue in the scorching heat during Abu Dhabi shoot

Anyone who knows Katrina Kaif, has described her as a kind, caring and supportive friend. As an actor and a co-star, she is always encouraging and helpful. During the shooting of Bharat in Abu Dhabi, the actress made sure her co-stars are not troubled by the scorching heat and tried to help them.

When Katrina Kaif and Salman Khan were shooting for Bharat in Abu Dhabi last year, the temperature there was 48 degree Celsius. Kat made sure to not let the strong sun rays and heat distract her co-stars from the shoot. She offered them her sunscreen, so their skin didn't get any rashes and wasn't tanned. One of her co-stars, Sumeet Samnani was all praises for Kat's friendly gesture.

Sumeet plays Salman Khan's co-worker in the film. About Kat helping her co-star, Sumeet Samnani shared, "We were shooting literally in boiling heat and it was an outdoor sequence. All actors were sitting together that time and that is when Katrina was applying her sunscreen to avoid tanning offered us her cream asking us to use it else we all will get tanned which we will complied to. She is extremely sweet, fun loving and a great human being." He is also looking forward to working with her again.

Meanwhile, Bharat also stars Sunil Grover, Disha Patani, Jackie Shroff and Tabu in pivotal roles.
