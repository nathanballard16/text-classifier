Pakistani PM Slams India Over 'Whipping up War Hysteria' Amid F-16 Tensions

The incident involving the Indian (IAF) and Pakistan (PAF) Air Forces took place on 27 February, but some of the details remain unclear, as the two sides have brought up conflicting info on the matter. Pakistan said that it had downed two IAF MiG-21 planes in response to an earlier Indian air raid on its territory and arrested their pilots. One of them was released as a "peace gesture" several days later.

India said that it had conducted an airstrike on Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist group's camp, killing multiple militants. According to the Indian government, the country lost only one plane and that its forces had managed to down a PAF F-16 — an aircraft that had been provided to Islamabad by the US. The American jets were supposed to be used in the fight against terrorism and so Delhi urged Washington to respond to the "wrong" use of the combat aircraft.

The incident has led to an escalation of tensions between the two countries that have resulted in multiple cross-border exchanges of fire and several instances of Pakistani drones allegedly violating Indian airspace, subsequently being downed by Indian forces.
