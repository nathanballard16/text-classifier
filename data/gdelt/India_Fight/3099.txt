MLA draws flak for calling Maya ‘transgender’

Chandauli (UP): An MLA from the ruling BJP in Uttar Pradesh Sunday came under attack from allies and Opposition leaders for calling Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati a “blot on womankind” and “worse than a transgender”.

The Mughalsarai MLA made the controversial remarks at a rally Saturday while referring to the infamous incident when Mayawati was assaulted by Samajwadi Party workers in a Lucknow guest house in 1995.

“Former Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayawati sold her dignity for power and joined hands with those who disrespected her… She is a blot on womankind. Cannot say if she can be counted among men or women, she is worse than a transgender person,” Singh alleged.

Condemning her remarks, Union minister and Republican Party of India president Ramdas Athawale told a presser in Lucknow Sunday that such personal comments should not be made.

Bahunjan Samaj Party (BSP) leader SC Misra said on Twitter BJP leaders have “lost their mental balance after the BSP-SP tie-up” which, he said, threatened to rock the ruling party’s boat.

SP chief Akhilesh Yadav also denounced the BJP MLA for using derogatory remarks against Mayawati.

“The remark smacks of desperation and nervousness among BJP leaders and is an affront to all women,” he tweeted.

Earlier in the day, the National Commission for Women said it would formally issue a notice to Singh seeking an explanation from her.
