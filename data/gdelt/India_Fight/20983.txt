Hyundai Venue vs Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza: Prices, specifications comparison

Hyundai Venue was finally unveiled on April 17 in India as well as at the 2019 New York International Auto Show. The new compact SUV is expected to be placed just below Creta in Hyundai's India line-up. The carmaker is claiming that Venue would be India's first connected SUV.

The launch of Hyundai Venue will take place in India on May 21, 2019. The company might start the bookings of Venue from May 2. In the Indian car market, Hyundai's major rival is Maruti Suzuki and both the companies have options in various segments. You have Hyundai Santro taking on Maruti Suzuki WagonR, Hyundai Grand i10 going against Maruti Suzuki Swift, Hyundai Elite i20 competing with Maruti Suzuki Baleno, Hyundai Xcent challenging Maruti Suzuki Swift Dzire and Hyundai Verna battling Maruti Suzuki Ciaz. Now, Hyundai Venue will compete against Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza.

The compact SUV segment in India is loaded with players like Tata Nexon, Ford EcoSport and Mahindra XUV300. Making a mark in this segment is an arduous task, let alone challenge the segment leader Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza. The numbers tell us about the kind of hold Maruti Suzuki India enjoys here with its offering. Over four lakh units of Vitara Brezza have been sold by the country's largest carmaker since the compact SUV's launch in 2016.
