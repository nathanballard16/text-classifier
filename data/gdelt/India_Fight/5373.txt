MUMBAI: The family members of a man killed in an alleged encounter with the Solapur Police on Sunday claim that he was killed for money.

Vinayak Kale was shot dead during an operation of the police against an inter-state diesel smuggling gang in the south Maharashtra district. According to the police, Kale and associates were intercepted by the authorities while they were travelling in a car laden with weapons at Ulegaon, some 400 km from Mumbai. Three policemen including Solapur taluka police station in-charge Vijay Patil were hurt during the encounter, said an officer.

However, Kale’s family members demanded a thorough inquiry into the incident. According to them, Kale had finished his schooling and was preparing to appear for police recruitment tests. They said the police was demanding money from him and killed him for failing to pony up.

There are marks of being severely thrashed on Vinayak’s body. Hence, the case needs to be thoroughly investigated, the relatives have said.

The police, however, said Vinayak had three registered cases against him. However, the case will be investigated as per the National Human Rights Commission guidelines, SP Manoj Patil said.
