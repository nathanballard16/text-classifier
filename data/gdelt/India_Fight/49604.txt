Hyderabad: Around 1,000 farmers staged a protest at the Bowenpally market yard here on Wednesday. Nearly 72 of the protestors were taken into preventive custody from the venue.

They were demanding protection from commission agents and hamalis who, they alleged, were constantly harassing them. They belonged to Chevella and Vikarabad.

“The hamalis are refusing to handle bags that are above 50 kg. It is unfortunate that despite several representations to officials, including the district collector, the issue had not been addressed,” Anjenayulu Goud, a farmer from Chevella, said.

The farmers also allege that the market officials were weighing for 50 kgs only, whereas they sought for 80 kgs.

“If we shift it into two bags, we will have to pay for two bags for transport and weight. But, they refuse to weigh bags for 80 kgs. The rents for collecting and transporting bags of vegetables will result in loss for us,” said Prabhakar Reddy, a farmer from Chevella.

Some farmers recall that the market yard used to weigh bags for one quintal, which was now getting reduced. We will have to pay for two bags, which will take extra space,” he said

Following the protests, market yard officials called Trimulgherry police, who arrested 72 farmers and released them in the evening.
