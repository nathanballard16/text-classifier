Pakistan responded befittingly to the misadventure of its neighbor that happens to have the second largest army in the world. Along with that, it managed to inflict a loss of around $47 million or Rs.6.539 billion within a few minutes to its adversary.

The price of a Mi-17 V5 helicopter roughly stands at about $25 million (PKR 3.478 billion). The price estimate can be extracted through the India media reports regarding the Indian acquisition of 21 used MiG-29 combat planes from Russia.

Also, Mi-17 V5 helicopter’s per unit price, as quoted by Russia to India in 2015, was around $22 million or PKR 3.061 billion.

As for the current per unit cost of a MiG 21 fighter jet, it is difficult to assess. Originating from the “Mikoyan-Gurevich Design Bureau” of the then Soviet Union, Russia had stopped manufacturing this aircraft in 1985. However, India continues to operate the upgraded variants of this aircraft.
