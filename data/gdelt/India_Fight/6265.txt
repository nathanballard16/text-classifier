Security beefed up at Pak High Commission

Security around the Pakistan High Commission in the capital has been tightened as a safety measure following the Pulwama terror attack.

Earlier today, Pakistan High Commissioner Sohail Mahmood evaded questions when quizzed on the deadly terror attack in which nearly 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives.

Anti-Pakistan protests are being held across the nation to condemn the dastardly terror attack.

While key leaders across the globe stood in support of India in the wake of the ghastly attack, anti-Pakistan slogans were raised in Uttar Pradesh.

Effigies of Masood Azhar, the chief of Jaish-e-Mohammed (which claimed responsibility for the attack), were burnt in Varanasi as a sign of protests against the killing of the security personnel on Thursday.

Protesters thronged the streets with placards that read ''Aakhir Shahadat kab tak?" (How long will this martyrdom continue?) and festoons displaying various demands and needs of the Indian soldiers.

In the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir, around 40 CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday when their convoy was targeted by a suspected suicide bomber of Pakistan-backed JeM in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.

The convoy of 78 buses, in which around 2500 CRPF personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar, came under attack at around 3.15 pm at Ladhu Modi Lethpora.

Indian Air Force C-17 will soon fly to Jammu and Kashmir's Srinagar from Hindon to carry the mortal remains of CRPF personnel.

This is the deadliest attack on security forces in Jammu and Kashmir.
