AAI inks pact with Boeing to modernise air traffic management

State-owned airport operator Airports Authority of India, has signed a technical assistance agreement with Boeing to develop a 10-year Communication, Navigation and Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) modernisation roadmap for India.

The objective of the agreement is to develop a roadmap for AAI to use as a guide in the modernisation of the Indian National Airspace System (NAS) based on global and local best practices to optimally utilise airspace capacity, enhance communications and invest in navigation, surveillance and air traffic management.

“The implementation of modern technologies and global practices will allow India to increase its airspace capacity significantly by improving communications, enabling flexible use of airspace and allowing the safe processing of additional flights using air navigation infrastructure for smoother and more efficient skies in India,” said Guruprasad Mohapatra, Chairman, Airports Authority of India .

Boeing will analyse current technologies and processes to identify areas where efficiency improvements can be implemented while maintaining a practical and safe airspace system. As part of the project, Boeing will also work closely with the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, airlines operating in India, airport operators and other airspace stakeholders like the US-India Aviation Cooperation Program .
