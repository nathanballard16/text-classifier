India lost at least 40 jawans on February 14 when a suicide bomber attacked a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama. The nation is mourning the loss of the soldiers in what was the deadliest attack on the armed forces in Jammu and Kashmir.

While many chief ministers have announced ex-gratia and jobs to martyrs' kin, the scars from Pulwama's afternoon of terror that left 40 CRPF jawans dead are too deep to be healed.

As the country stands united in protests against Pakistan's dastardly act and candle-light marches in memory of martyrs, the bereaved families are left with a huge void.

The surprise attack by a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) suicide bomber left the nation in shock and anger while Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave security forces a freehand to strike back with equal force.

The heinous incident has united all political parties across the country while leaders from all over the world have condemned the dastardly attack; the United States even went on to the extent of warning Pakistan to not harbour terrorism.

On February 14, a CRPF convoy comprising 78 buses were carrying 2,500 personnel from Jammu to Srinagar when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden SUV into one of the buses. Each bus was carrying at least 35-40 personnel.

Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed has claimed responsibility for the attack and have released a video of the suicide bomber, Adil Ahmed Dar.
