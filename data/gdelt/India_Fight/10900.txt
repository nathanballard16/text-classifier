Declare JeM Chief Masood Azhar As Global Terrorist, US, UK And France Ask UNSC As India Unites International Community

Amid the escalations over the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 which killed over 40 CRPF personnel, India's efforts to bring the perpetrator of the attack, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar to justice is getting global support.

The US, UK and France, three permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) have moved a fresh proposal to designate Azhar as a global terrorist.

If passed it will be a huge success to India's efforts for many years to reign in the dreaded terrorists, who is a darling of the Pakistani Army and government and enjoys a free run in the country, despite global pressure.

Getting Azhar designated as a global terrorist will effectively lead to a crackdown on his activities as it will be followed by the freezing of his assets and an arms embargo him and a global travel ban.

While the global community has been marching with India when it come to JeM and Masood Azhar, Pakistan has been backed by its 'all weather friend' and only ally in the region - China which also has a veto power in the UNSC. Time and again Beijing has twatted various attempts by India and other countries to get Azhar sanctioned by the UNSC.

Even after the Pulwama terror attack China has refused to acknowledge the role of JeM.

The UNSC had last week condemned the Pulwama terror attack in "strongest terms" and named the Pakistan-based terror group.

China was quick to defend JeM claiming that it was named only in "general terms" and "does not represent a judgment".

Given the recent escalations and China urging both India and Pakistan to follow restrain it will be interesting to see if Beijing has changed its previous position on supporting the Pakistani terrorist.
