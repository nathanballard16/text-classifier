I Am Happy With Kabir Singh, Looks wise Says Shahid Kapoor

Shahid Kapoor says that his forthcoming remake Kabir Singh is slated for 21st June release and he is happy with the way his character looks, on the sidelines of a collection launch here in Mumbai.

Shahid Kapoor along with Vaani Kapoor walked the ramp for Mark and Spencer summer collection launch here in Mumbai.

During his media interaction, when asked about his worst and best character, fashion-wise, Shahid said, “Worst would be a long list because I don’t think I had any idea about fashion, especially in first ten years of career that is the reason Mark and Spencer never asked me to walk for them before”

“Honestly my looks in my films are not defined by what I like or don’t like, it is defined by the requirement of the character, story and the filmmaker’s vision of the character, so I don’t have any personal likes or dislikes. Whenever I feel I got the character right or the silhouette right, I’ve felt happy. I think I am happy with Padmaavat, Rangoon and now Kabir Singh”

Further adding Shahid Kapoor confirmed the release date of the film with Kiara Advani, which is still shooting. He said, “Kabir Singh is releasing on 21st June”

Shahid Kapoor also added that he has made all possible mistakes regarding fashion but now he is getting it right.

He said, “I hope I have evolved in my fashion sense because when I look back, it’s not a very happy feeling, I think I have made many fashion mistakes and I think once you make all mistake possible mistake when it comes to fashion, you eventually get it right. So I guess I am getting it right more often now then I used to”

Kabir Singh is written and directed by Sandeep Vanga. It is a remake of the Telugu film Arjun Reddy (2017). It focuses on the title character, an alcoholic surgeon who goes on a self-destructive path after his ex-lover marries someone else.
