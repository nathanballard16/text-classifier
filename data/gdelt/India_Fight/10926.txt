In response to the Pulwama Terror Attacks, the Indian Air Force carried out an air strike on Terrorist Base camps in Pakistan on 26 February which aimed at the JeM training camp in Balakot. Post the IAF strike, it was reported that the strike led to 200-300 casualties. Post that a Pakistani Air Force plane was detected in Jammu and Kashmir and while shooting the fighter plane, India lost its own jet and Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was arrested by Pakistan.As soon as Pakistan announced that they had Wing Commander Varthaman Abhinandan in their custody, several Bollywood celebrities took to their respective social handles to pray for a safe return of an IAF pilot.Amidst all this chaos Veena Malik took to Twitter to mock the IAF Pilot by writing "Abhi abhi tu ayo ho...achi mehmaan nawazi ho gi aap ki."Not only that but she even mocked Akshay Kumar by writing "Hey @akshaykumar these Machines of #indianAirForce destroyed the terror camps of trees Yesterday... Check them out Now @akshaykumar." Swara Bhasker took to her Twitter handle to slam Veena as she wrote "Veena ji.. Shame on you & ur sick mindset. Your glee is just gross! Our officer is a hero- brave, gracious & dignified in the face of capture. At least some decency from that major in you army who was questioning #WingCommanderAbhinandan or the many Pakistanis suing 4 peace #sick."Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale had released an official statement a few minutes after the strike which read as, “Credible intelligence was received that Jaish-e-Mohammed was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country & fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose.”
