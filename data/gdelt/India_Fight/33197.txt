`Decline in local youth joining militancy’

NEW DELHI, Jul 3: A total of 119 militants were killed so far this year in Jammu and Kashmir by security forces, which also lost 24 personnel, Rajya Sabha was informed on Wednesday.

Earlier in the Lok Sabha, the Centre informed that the security forces killed 800 militants since 2014, of which 249 were in 2018.

Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy in Rajya Sabha said that 252 militants were killed in Jammu and Kashmir in 2018 when 44 security personnel lost their lives.

Till June 26 this year, 119 terrorists were killed in the state, he said in written reply to a question. Twenty-four security personnel lost their lives during the period.

Replying to another question, Reddy said the number of misguided local youths joining militancy has shown a declining trend during the current year.

In 2017 and 2018, the numbers of foreign militants neutralised were more than local militants, he said.

In a written response to a question in the Lok Sabha, Minister of State in the Defence Ministry Shripad Naik said the security forces killed 800 militants since 2014, of which 249 were in 2018.

He said 104 militants were killed in 2014, 97 in 2015, 140 in 2016 and 210 in 2017.

“The security forces are combating the terrorists’ activities, both along the Line of Control by eliminating the infiltration bids and in hinterland by carrying out counter-terrorist operations and responding to terrorist-initiated incidents,” Naik said.

The minister said sustained operations conducted by the security forces “have resulted in (the) elimination of (a) large number of terrorists.”

Replying to a separate question, Naik said firm and decisive response was given by the army to the ceasefire violations on the India-Pakistan border.

In March, April and May, he said 267, 234, 221 cases of ceasefire violations were reported, respectively.

In a response to another question on whether the United States had approved the sale of armed drones to India, Naik said, “This is a continuous process undertaken through procurement from various indigenous as well as foreign sources. Highest priority is accorded to optimally equip the armed forces and keep them in a state of readiness.”

Based on threat assessment and security imperatives, the minister said, “The government constantly reviews the national security scenario and takes steps to induct appropriate defence equipment to meet the security challenges and operational requirements.”
