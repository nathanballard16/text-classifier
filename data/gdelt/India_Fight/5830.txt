Talasani spits fire at Chandrababu Naidu

Vijayawada: Former Telangana Minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav wondered whether he was in India or elsewhere. Addressing the media here on Thursday, the TRS leader said that when he wanted to hold a press meet at Hailand, Intelligence officials started harassing its management.

So he shifted the venue to the city. Coming down heavily on the TDP government, he said the chief minister is lavishly spending on Dharma Porata Deeksha in the state which he claims to be Rs 16,000 crore deficit. Presently, he is spreading distributing peanuts to people, he said.

At a time the dairy farmers are incurring heavy losses, CM’s Heritage is paying income tax, he said. Referring to five percent quota for Kapus, he wondered as to how could he implement it.
