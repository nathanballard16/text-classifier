Tamil Nadu: NIA Tarnishing Image Of Muslims Through Its Raids, Claims Thowheed Jamath

On Sunday (21 July), Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath (TNTJ) accused the national anti-terror agency of tarnishing the image of Muslims through its raids, reports New Indian Express.

The Islamic group claimed that the National Investigation Agency was tarnishing the image of Muslims by conducting raids in their houses in the name of anti-terror operations.

The Jamath leadership addressed the media on the sidelines of a medical camp organised in Tiruchy. NIA is acting against Muslim community through their raids, said Ghulam Dastdagir, president of Tiruchy unit of Thowheed Jamath.

“To conduct raids at residences and offices of our members of in the name of anti-terror operation is uncalled for,” said S Abdullah, member, Wahadat-e-Islami.

Tamil Nadu Thowheed Jamath shot into limelight after the ghastly Easter bombing were carried out by National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) in Sri Lanka. The former has denied any links to the latter, a claim that has been questioned.

NTJ had splintered from another group based in the island nation, Sri Lanka Towheed Jamath (SLTJ). The SLTJ was allegedly "influenced by the Tamil Nadu Thawheed Jamaath an extremist organisation based in India". Tamil Nadu based organisation’s purported goal is to spread Islam in its true form. The organisation has been accused of taking Saudi funding to spread Wahhabi ideology.

In the past days NIA has conducted several raids in the state in Ansarullah terror case. The raids come less than a week after arresting two terror suspects from Nagapattinam and gaining custody of 14 more deported from UAE based on terror charges.
