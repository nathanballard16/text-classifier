Gujarat: Unemployed diamond polisher stabs wife to death

SURAT: An unemployed diamond polisher was booked at Rander police station for murdering his wife in their house in the city in the early morning hours of Thursday. The accused killed his wife because major differences had cropped up between them over the issue of money ever since he became jobless six months ago.Police booked Sanjay Dabde, a resident of Ever Green Society on Palanpur Road, for allegedly murdering Alpa at around 12.15am. The accused stabbed her in neck and a leg with a knife in the presence of their two children aged 12 and 5.The accused escaped from the spot after murdering his wife. Alpa’s brother Ravi Parmar lodged the complaint against him. Dabde used to ask money from Alpa for his personal expenses, who was finding it tough to run the household, the complainant alleged.Police investigation revealed that the family was facing severe financial crisis after Dabde lost his job six months ago and this led to frequent fights between the couple. Alpa went to stay with her parents a month ago. Two days ago she came back to stay with Dabde, but used to go to her parents’ house with children in the night. The children went off to sleep early on Wednesday and hence she informed her parents that she will not come in the night.Meanwhile, the couple began to argue in the night and the children woke up hearing the noise. Dabde picked up a knife and attacked his wife, killing her on the spot. “Financial crisis led to frequent fights between the couple. The woman was killed by Dabde, who is on the run,” a police officer said.
