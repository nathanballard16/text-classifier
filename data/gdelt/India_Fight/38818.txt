Shiv Sena’s Uddhav Thackeray hits back at MNS over poll remark

Uddhav targetted Raj for thinking about elections while the state continues to reel under floods.

Mumbai: Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray launched a veiled attack against MNS chief Raj Thackeray, over his demand postponing the forthcoming Assembly polls due to the floods.

“I don’t understand how can one think of elections in such a critical situation. We should set aside our political differences while dealing with a calamity,” said Uddhav, while flagging-off his party’s vehicles carrying relief material to flood-affected areas on Sunday.

Raj on Saturday had demanded that the election commission should postpone the Assembly election, which is expected to take place in October, arguing that it would take time to restore normalcy in flood-hit districts. The Sena chief, however, refused to comment on any controversy relating to the flood situation, claiming that he was solely focused on providing support to the flood-affected.

“I am not going to dwell over whatever has happened so far. I am focusing on arranging aid for the flood victims,” he said in reference to two recent fiascos involving the government.

Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Cabinet minister Girish Mahajan had found himself in controversy after videos surfaced purportedly showing him smiling and waving hands as he inspected parts of the flood-hit Kolhapur district.

In another controversy, the government came under fire after food packets that were distributed had the photos of chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and local BJP MLA Suresh Halwankar on them.
