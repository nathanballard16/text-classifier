16 hurt as Indian troops stop Kashmiris from attending funeral of two fighters

SRINAGAR: Massive protests and clashes erupted in India-held Kashmir on Sunday, leading to injuries to at least 16 people after two fighters were martyred in a gun battle with security personnel overnight, police and residents said.

The clashes erupted after government forces in the southern Shopian area tried to stop mourners from attending the funeral of one of India’s most wanted fighters in the disputed Himalayan region, police said.

‘Commander’ Zeenatul Islam was martyred along with his associate late on Saturday in a gun battle with Indian troops.

Massive protests force authorities to withdraw contingents from flashpoints

Government forces fired bullets, shotgun pellets and tear gas to stop the mourners, leading to street clashes as groups of youths pelted stones at the troops, police and residents said.

Later, authorities withdrew security deployments amid massive anti-India protests and clashes at several places in the area. At least 16 people were injured in the clashes.

Armed groups have been fighting Indian control over the disputed region since 1989.

Most Kashmiris support the armed groups’ cause that the territory be united either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country while also participating in street protests against Indian control.

Nearly 70,000 people have been killed in the uprising and the ensuing Indian crackdown over the past three decades.
