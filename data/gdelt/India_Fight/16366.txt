‘It Happens All The Time’: Senior Congress Leader Sam Pitroda On Pulwama Attack; Also Criticises Air Strikes

Pitroda, formerly an engineer and an Advisor to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on telecom policy, was answering an interview question regarding his views on the Balakot strikes.

He went on to question the truthfulness of Indian Air Force (IAF) assertion that Indian jets had destroyed Jaish-e-Mohammad’s terrorist camps in Pakistan. "I would like to know more as I have read in New York Times & other newspapers: what did we really attack, we really killed 300 people?" an ANI tweet had quoted Pitroda as saying.

In response to such allegations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted, "Opposition insults our forces time and again. I appeal to my fellow Indians- question Opposition leaders on their statements. Tell them- 130 crore Indians will not forgive or forget the Opposition for their antics. India stands firmly with our forces."
