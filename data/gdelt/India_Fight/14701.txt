Declare all WB booths as sensitive, demands Cong

The Congress Wednesday called on the state's Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) demanding that all polling booths in the state be declared as sensitive.

"Since fear psychosis prevails among the voters, all booths in the state should be declared as sensitive. Central forces should be deployed in these booths," state Congress president Somen Mitra said.

Congress'Rajya Sabha MP Pradip Bhattacharya also alleged that the state administration was still working on the instruction of some ministers and ruling party leaders.

"The EC should look into it and take total control of the administration in the state," Bhattacharya said.

Earlier on Wednesday, the BJP also urged the EC in New Delhi to declare West Bengal as a "super sensitive state" to ensure fair Lok Sabha polls there and demanded that central forces be deployed at all polling stations in the state.

West Bengal would go for a seven-phase Lok Sabha polling from April 11.

The Election Commission will hold an all-party meeting here on Saturday.

Deputy Election Commissioner Sudeep Jain will meet representatives of all recognised political parties of the state on Saturday, Additional Chief Electoral Officer Sanjay Basu told reporters here.

Jain will also hold a meeting with District Election Officers and Superintendents of Police on that date.

To a question, Basu said the number of vulnerable areas in different Lok Sabha constituencies was still being assessed.

He said the EC's 'cVIGIL' app, through which voters can forward any poll-related complaint, has registered 183 complaints of model code of conduct violation and they were being looked into.
