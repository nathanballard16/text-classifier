ED to probe money laundering angle in Chhattisgarh’s PDS scam

RAIPUR: In a significant development, Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a case under Prevention of Money Laundering Act in connection with Chhattisgarh ’s multi-crore PDS scam that had surfaced in 2015 during the previous BJP regime.ED sources confirmed that a case has been registered under Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The state Economic offences wing (EOW) had earlier probed the PDS scam and is now conducting a fresh probe into all aspects of the state through a special investigation team (SIT) set up following directives of the new Congress government.The PDS scam had surfaced in 2015, during the previous BJP regime itself after the EOW raided office of the state civil supplies corporation and seized Rs four crore cash from the drawers of its babus. Subsequently, the EOW had filed chargesheets against 16 people, including two IAS officers, in connection with the scam. However, the Congress, after coming to power, set up an SIT headed by Inspector general of police (EOW) S R P Kalluri after it felt that the EOW during previous regime did not probe the case thoroughly and did not take the whole case into its logical conclusion.The BJP, which is now in opposition, has been accusing the Bhupesh Baghel government of instituting probes and setting up SITs due to political vendetta. However, the Congress government has been maintaining that the EOW during previous BJP regime took only partial actions and did not probe the scam completely as many politically influential people, including bureaucrats, were the beneficiaries of ill-gotten money earned through corruption by supplying low quality rice and in transportation.Political circles are abuzz with speculations over enforcement directorate swinging into action now, particularly after the new Congress government ordered a fresh investigation and state SIT has stepped up its investigations. Indications are that the ED officials could initially question all the 16 accused against whom the state EOW had already filed charge-sheets in the court.
