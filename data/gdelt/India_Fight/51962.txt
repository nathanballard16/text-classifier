Indore (Madhya Pradesh) [India], Nov 20 (ANI): A 33-year-old student of Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College was found dead near the gate of Daly College in the Azad Nagar area on Tuesday morning, police said.

While his family has claimed Waskel was murdered, the police have ruled it out.

According to Azad Nagar Assistant Sub Inspector Vikram Singh, "The police are not considering it as a murder since no sign of struggle and no suicide note has been recovered. However, the postmortem report will clear the cause of the student's death."

The family of the deceased has alleged that Bhurelal had been killed as his body bore injury marks on his face, shoulder and neck.

Karan Waskel, a nephew of the deceased, said that Bhurelal did not have any reason to commit suicide as he had a good life and he was supposed to complete his MBBS next year.
