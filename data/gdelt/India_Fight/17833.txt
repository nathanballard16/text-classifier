SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen shot dead a 35-year-old civilian Saturday in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.

The victim was fired upon in Baramulla town, about 70 km west of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Unidentified gunmen this evening shot dead a youth namely Arjumand Majid Bhat in the main town," a police official posted in Baramulla said. "He was shot at his shop. Though he was removed to hospital but doctors there declared him brought dead."

Soon after the incident a joint contingent of army and police launched a cordon-and-search operation in the area to nab the attackers.

Police suspect involvement of militants in the killing.

Militants in the region usually target families and individuals for their possible links with police and defense agencies. Even people having associations with pro-India political parties and police are targeted at times.

A guerilla war is going on between militants and Indian troops stationed in the region since 1989.
