In a tragic incident, a woman in Vijayawada killed her elder child and was found dead with her younger child and father-in-law.

One Jayanthi from Chittoor district in Andhra Pradesh married Dhanasekar, a taxi driver in Vellore district, Tamil Nadu and had two girls - Mahalakshmi (6) and Srilakshmi (3).

Jayanthi's father-in-law Gopalakrishnan also lived in the same village as them. Jayanthi allegedly had an extramarital affair with her father-in-law and when Dhanasekar found out about the illicit relationship, he tried to warned Jayanthi against it.

On 22 December, Jayanthi along with Gopalkrishnan and her two children left her house. After that, they travelled to and stayed in Trichy, Thiruvannamalai, Villupuram and finally to Velanganni, Nagapattinam district and stayed in a lodge there from 27 December.

On Thursday, police identified three bodies at the Vijayawada railway station as that of Jayanthi, Gopalakrishnan, and Srilakshmi - who had apparently jumped on the railway track and committed suicide. Upon investigation, the Police found the body of the elder child in the lodge in a decomposing state. Jayanthi and Gopalkrishnan apparently killed the child by suffocating her with a pillow. They later told the lodge's manager that they need the room for two more days. The police confirmed the murder with the help of CCTV cameras.

Vijayawada Police sent the bodies to the government hospital for post-mortem examination and filed the case as unnatural death. Also, Chennai police have taken Dhanasekhar into custody and further investigation is on in the case.
