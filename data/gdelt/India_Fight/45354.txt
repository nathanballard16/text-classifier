Noida: RTI activist who faked death to live with his lover gets life in jail

GREATER NOIDA: RTI activist Chandra Mohan Sharma , who in trying to fake his own death had killed a homeless man and burnt the body more than five years ago, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the district and sessions court on Saturday.Police investigation had revealed that Chandra Mohan (43) was unhappy in his marriage and committed the crime to live with his girlfriend Preeti Nagar (30). Preeti was also handed down a six-month jail term by the court under Section 202 of IPC (intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform).However, district and sessions judge Niranjan Kumar acquitted Chandra Mohan’s brother-in-law, who was accused of helping him commit the crime.Harish Shishodia, the assistant district government counsel, said the court pronounced the judgment after holding Chandra Mohan guilty of eight charges, including murder , criminal conspiracy and cheating. He was also fined Rs 1 lakh by the court.The case dates back to May 2014, when Chandra Mohan — who lived in Alpha 2 Sector of Kasna — was presumed dead after a charred body was found in his burnt car on Noida-Greater Noida Expressway. His death hogged the limelight as his wife Savita and AAP , the party he was associated with, claimed he had been killed by “political rivals”.Cops got to Chandra Mohan three months later only after they started investigating the ‘abduction’ of the woman who was living with him. That case was lodged in Greater Noida on June 7, 2014, a day after she went missing. They nabbed Chandra Mohan on August 27 after tracking down his girlfriend to Bengaluru. He was living there under an assumed identity.During interrogation, Chandra Mohan admitted to killing the homeless man whom he had picked up from Ansal plaza in Kasna. After setting his car on fire, Chandra Mohan told cops, Videsh had dropped him at Pari Chowk in his bike, from where he took a cab to New Delhi railway station to catch a train to Bengaluru.Chandra Mohan, police claimed, told them that he had convinced his brother-in-law that his wife would get Rs 36 lakh and a job at Hero Honda, where he worked, in case it could be made out that he had died. And all that he did was only to live with his girlfriend, cops said.
