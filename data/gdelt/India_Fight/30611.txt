SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, June 18 (Xinhua) -- Two troopers wounded in an improvised explosive device (IED) blast triggered by militants in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir succumbed Tuesday in hospital, officials said.

The IED blast took place Monday evening in Arihal area of Pulwama district, about 41 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

According to police, six troopers and two civilians were wounded during the attack, targeting army vehicle.

"Two soldiers have succumbed to their wounds while undergoing treatment at military hospital," Srinagar based Indian army spokesman, Col Rajesh Kalia said. "We deeply mourn the demise of our brave hearts."

Militants occasionally target government forces in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

Meanwhile, a trooper was killed in an ongoing gunfight with militants in adjacent Anantnag district. The gunfight broke out in the morning.

An army officer was killed and two troopers wounded on Monday in gunfight in the district. A militant was also killed in the stand-off.

A guerilla war is going on between militants and Indian troopers stationed in the region since 1989.

Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.
