If you are planning on buying the device, but don’t like the design of the punch-hole camera cutout, there’s a solution. Samsung has included an option on the Galaxy S10 series smartphone to hide the camera cutout with the help of virtual bezels. The option will black out the display area around the front camera for a more traditional screen appearance.
