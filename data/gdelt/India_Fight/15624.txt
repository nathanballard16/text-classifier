Unscrapped into art

Using 150 tonnes of metal scrap and industrial waste, artists have created smaller replicas of some of the world’s well-known monuments at the Rajiv Gandhi Smriti Van

Using 150 tonnes of metal scrap and industrial waste, artists have created smaller replicas of some of the world’s well-known monuments at the Rajiv Gandhi Smriti Van in Sarai Kale Khan, New Delhi. The Rs 7.5 crore project was undertaken by the South Delhi municipal corporation. After sundown, in the golden-orange light from the sodium lamps, the metal structures light up to hold visitors in thrall. Seen here is a 20-foot high Taj Mahal of scrap.

This is a 60-foot replica of the Eiffel Tower, Paris. The Colosseum of Rome, recreated in the 15-foot version pictured above, looks particularly realistic. And below is an 18-foot version of the Great Pyramid of Giza.

Like the 98-foot original in Rio de Janeiro, this 25-foot version of Christ the Redeemer (above), his face non-judgemental and benign, welcomes all of humanity into the grace of his embrace. A 30-foot version of the Statue of Liberty (below) and a 25-foot version of the Leaning Tower of Pisa complete the happy figure of seven charming sights to behold – and take selfies with – at the park.
