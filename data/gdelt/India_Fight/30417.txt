Chennai: DMK chief MK Stalin has demanded the resignation of Minister of Municipal Administration SP Velumani over worsening water crisis in Chennai's suburban area. It has come after multiple reports of clashes over water surfaced last week.

"I urge Chief Minister K Palaniswami to take constructive steps to resolve the drinking water crisis faced by the people of Chennai," Stalin said.

On Saturday, a 28-year-old woman was stabbed by her neighbour in the city's Shankar Nagar area after she tried to intervene in a fight between her husband and the neighbour over water.

Earlier on June 8, a 33-year old man was killed when he was drawing water from a public tanker in Thanjavur area. Reports suggest violence broke out after the man objected to another man drawing "large" quantities of water from the same tanker.

Several reports claim that many, IT firms and restaurants have cut down operations. The shortage of water has also hampered the operations of Southern Railways, forcing them to transport water from outside the city for its operational needs.

Intriguingly, last week an NGO exposed corruption in the city water department. In the string operation, officials were caught on camera stopping individuals from putting bids on government tenders.

Meanwhile, the AIADMK government has issued guidelines to take up water restoration scheme pegged at Rs 500 crore. The scheme aims to strengthen tank bund, desilting of supply channel, surplus course, repair and recontruction of sluices, repair and renewal of shutters.
