One killed in IHK hospital attack

NEW DELHI: At least one person was killed and one seriously injured inside a hospital in the Kishtwar area of Indian Held Kashmir (IHK) on Tuesday when an unidentified person opened fire on them, said local media reports.

The injured was said to be a leader of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, ideologue organisation of the country's main ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the dead was identified as his bodyguard, added the TV reports. The incident has led to panic in the area, even as it occurred just two days ahead of India’s general elections, beginning on Thursday. Further reports of the incident are awaited.
