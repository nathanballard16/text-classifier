Lok Sabha poll: RTMNU postpones some exams

Nagpur: In view of Lok Sabha poll dates and exam dates clashing with each other, Rashtrasant Tukdoji Maharaj Nagpur University (RTMNU) has rescheduled the exam timetable. Some exams are slated to be conducted on April 11, the polling day for Nagpur and Ramtek Lok Sabha constituency. During Lok Sabha election, several schools and colleges are acquired by the Election Commission for setting up polling stations. Although the Election Commission has so far not sent a list of polling stations to Nagpur University, the list could be sent anytime soon. The election work at these polling stations commences 3-4 days before the actual polling date.
