The former finance minister alleged that the I-T department was taking “autocratic and partial” action in Tamil Nadu in the run up to Lok Sabha elections.Congress spokesperson Surjewala tweeted: “Hounding opposition leaders through motivated IT raids is the only tool left with Modiji. People of India are seeing through this, they will give a befitting reply to BJP on May 23.”At an AICC briefing, Sibal said, “We all know that if any party is flooded with money, it is BJP. The opposition is going through a drought period.”
