New Delhi:

A day after the shocking murder of former Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwari in Lucknow, teams of the Uttar Pradesh Police arrested three men in the connection with the case from Gujarat’s Surat on Saturday. UP’s top cop has termed the murder as ‘radical killing’. Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh said that Kamlesh Tiwari was murdered for his 2015 speech. “The inciting speech that the victim had given in 2015 was a reason behind this. As per the information that we have received, it seems it was done in a planned manner,” Singh said. Here are 10 latest updates from the case:

1: The accused have reportedly confessed to the police about murdering Tiwari. CCTV footages and the note found in the mithai box helped the police to solve the crime.

2: In morning, the family had refused to cremate Tiwari’s body. They were demanding Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath to visit them.

3: After mediation from the officials, the family took the body to Tiwari’s paternal village for last rites. “The demands of relatives have been take into consideration. They'll be provided security. Their meeting with the CM is being fixed. We're recommending a govt residence for them,” said Lucknow divisional commissioner Mukesh Meshram after meeting the family.

4: Reacting on murder case, Yogi Adityanath said that, “He was the President of Hindu Samaj Party. The assailants came to his house in Lucknow yesterday, sat and had tea with him, and later killed him after sending all security guards out to buy something from market. Those involved won’t be spared.”

5: Kamlesh Tiwari’s mother has blamed the state government for the murder. She said that the police was not able to do its job.

6: In morning, the police had also detained a Maulana who had announced bounty for beheading Tiwari.

7: The arrests from Surat were made after a CCTV footage showed the very place from where the mithai box was purchased. It was the same box that was used to carry the weapons of murder on the fateful day. The Lucknow Police had found the mithai box from the site of the crime.

8: A lesser-known outfit called the Al-Hind Brigade claimed responsibility late on Friday night for Tiwari’s murder, though the authenticity of the claim could not immediately be verified.

9: Two police constables were deployed for his security, but none was present when the incident took place, according to the reports. While one was allegedly not coming to duty for the last two days, another constable was asleep when the attackers slit Tiwari’s throat and stabbed multiple times, leaving him critically injured.

10: Tiwari who used to claim to be the president of Hindu Mahasabha had formed his own Hindu Samaj Party after rift with the leader of Mahasabha's another faction Chakrapani. He had allegedly distributed pamphlets with derogatory remarks on Prophet Muhammad in Deoband, Saharanpur in 2015. Chakrapani has demanded Yogi Adityanath’s resignation.
