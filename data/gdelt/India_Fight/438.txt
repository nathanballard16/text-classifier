Advocate HS Phoolka, petitioner in 1984 anti-Sikh riots cases, resigns from AAP

Advocate HS Phoolka on Thursday resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). He handed over his resignation letter to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal who asked him to reconsider the decision. "But I insisted," he said.

Phoolka said that he would hold a press conference tomorrow (January 4) and explain the reasons for leaving the party.

The move comes amid speculation over possibility of an alliance between the Congress and the AAP for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.

Phoolka had been maintaining a distance from the party for quite some time after talks of AAP and Congress alliance surfaced.

He has been representing the victims in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots case.

The lawyer had joined AAP in 2014. He had contested the Lok Sabha polls from Ludhiana seat but lost to a Congress candidate. Phoolka had earlier resigned as a legislator from the Punjab Aassembly last year over the state government's failure to take action against Prakash Singh Badal in a sacrilege case.
