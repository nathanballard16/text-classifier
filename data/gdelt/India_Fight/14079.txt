Tell families of Pulwama bravehearts who released their murderer: Rahul to PM Modi

New Delhi [India], Mar 10 (ANI): Sharpening his attack against NarendraModi, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday asked the Prime Minister to tell the families of the CRPF personnel who were killed in the dastardly Pulwama terror attack who released their "murderer" MasoodAzhar.

“PM Modi please tell the families of our 40 CRPF Shaheeds, who released their murderer, Masood Azhar? Also tell them that your current NSA was the deal maker, who went to Kandahar to hand the murderer back to Pakistan” he tweeted.

Azhar, the chief of Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM)- who claimed responsibility for the terror attack - was released from an Indian prison on December 19, 1999, (during the BJP government's tenure) for the safe return of passengers of the hijacked Indian Airlines aircraft IC-814.

Addressing a public gathering in Karnataka's Haveri on Saturday, Gandhi had said, “A few days ago, our soldiers were martyred in Pulwama. Who was responsible for Pulwama terror attack? Who sent Masood Azhar back to Pakistan? It was the BJP.”

“Ajit Doval, who is the National Security Advisor for Prime Minister Modi led Central government, escorted head of JeM Azhar back to Pakistan. We are not like Narendra Modi. We don’t bow down to terrorists,” he added.

Just after his release, Masood, a close associate of Osama bin Laden, founded JeM, which carried out the first suicide attack in Badami Bagh cantonment in Srinagar in April 2000. It was also responsible for the attack on Indian Parliament on December 13, 2001, which claimed the lives of nine security personnel and officials.

The February 14 Pulwama attack was the deadliest terror attack in the recent past in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed. India retaliated by targeting JeM’s largest training centre at Balakot in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. (ANI)
