Rajasthan High Court Cancels Cow Smuggling Case Against Pehlu Khan And Says Khan Bought The Cows

The Rajasthan High Court has ordered to scrap the police complaint that was registered against Pehlu Khan, a Muslim dairy farmer that was killed by a group of people in 2017, in a cow-smuggling case.

Justice Pankaj Bhandari dismissed the case that was filed under the Rajasthan Bovine Animals Protection Act.

Justice Pankaj concluded that no evidence proved that Pehlu Khan transported the cows with the intention of slaughtering it.

Khan was beaten to death in April 2017 by cow vigilantes in the district of Alwar, Rajasthan.

55-year-old Khan died of his injuries inside a hospital, three days after the brutal beating, which was caught on cam.

The police filed a case of murder against the mob that killed Khan.

The mob filed a counter FIR against Pehlu Khan, his sons, and the driver of the truck and claimed they were transporting the cows without a proper permit.

The driver of the truck and the sons of Khan claimed they were the victims of the incident, and even had receipts of the cows that they bought.

The sons had receipts from the Jaipur cattle fair and proved that they made an authorized purchase of the cows.

The Congress Government, which is led by Ashok Gehlot, was criticized by many this year after the government allowed the police to file charges against Pehlu Khan and his sons, even after the victims proved that they made an authorized purchase.

Ashok Gehlot defended his government and said that the charge-sheet was the outcome of the police investigating the case.
