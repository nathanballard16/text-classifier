Srinagar

Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed to have carried out an attack on Army’s 55-RR at Sumbal in north Kashmir’s Bandipora district on Friday night, terming it as revenge for “Rajpura (Tral) martyrs”.

A JeM spokesperson Muhammad Hassan in a statement issued to GNS said the army camp was attacked with grenades and intense firing.

He paid tributes to militants killed in Rajpura, Tral, and expressed condolence and solidarity with the bereaved families.

“India must read writing on the wall that it has no place in Kashmir,” the report quoted Hassan as having said. (GNS)
