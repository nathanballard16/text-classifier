BSP leader Shabbir Hussain Zaidi shot dead in Ghaziabad

Ghaziabad: A Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) leader was shot dead in Loni town of Ghaziabad district on Monday in a suspected fallout of a property dispute, police said.

Shabbir Hussain Zaidi, who took voluntary retirement from the UP Police where he was a sub-inspector to join the party, was on a morning walk in Uttaranchal residential colony when waiting assailants opened fire at him. He was rushed to the GTB hospital in Delhi where doctors declared him dead.

Loni Border SHO Shailendra Pratap Singh said that “the incident seems to be linked with a property dispute since Zaidi was engaged in property dealing business”.
