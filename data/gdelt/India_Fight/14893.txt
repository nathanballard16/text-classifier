Sanjay Gagnani escapes a mishap on the sets of Kundali Bhagya

MUMBAI: Entertaining the audience’s week-on-week with its intriguing storyline and twists and turns in the plot, Zee TV’s Kundali Bhagya has been winning audiences’ hearts. Recently viewers have witnessed Preeta (played by Shraddha Arya) getting envious of Tanvi (played by Coral Bhamra) due to her closeness with Karan (played by Dheeraj Dhoopar). On the other hand, Sanjana (Sanjana Phase) threatens Prithvi (played by Sanjay Gagnani) to reveal his entire past with Sherlyn (played by Ruhi Chaturvedi). While he plays the self-seeking antagonist on-screen, handsome actor Sanjay Gagnani has been fondly named ‘Villainero’ by his fans and receiving immense love from the viewers.

Recently, the actor escaped an electric shock mishap while shooting for one of the sequences. He was shooting for a scene where he had to dismantle two different electric wires and guess what happened next? While he was making an attempt to find the correct wire, a huge spark ensued and left the actor terrified.



Thanks to all the safety precautions on the sets, Sanjay did not suffer any injuries and came out hale and hearty. He said, “I had to pull apart a couple of electric wires but things didn’t go as planned and there was a massive spark. It happened all of a sudden and there was no time to take any action. I am thankful that no harm was caused and the sequence turned out well.”



Kudos to Sanjay for this gutsy act!
