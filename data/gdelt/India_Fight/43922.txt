Jassi honour killing: Prosecution lines up 23 witnesses as Sangrur court frames charges against mother, uncle

PATIALA: The prosecution has lined up 23 witnesses as the Sangrur court framed charges in the infamous Jassi murder case in which her mother Malkiat Kaur Sidhu (70) and maternal uncle Surjit Singh Badesha (74) are the prime accused.The charges have been framed by the court of additional district and sessions judge Smriti Dhir under sections 302, 307 and 120-B of the Indian Penal Code against both the accused almost 19 years after the body of Canadian resident Jaswinder Kaur Sidhu was found in Narike village under Amargarh police station of Sangrur in march 1999.According to lawyer Ashwini Chaudhary, who is representing Jassi’s husband Sukhwinder Singh Mithu, who had also been attacked at Narike village and presumed dead by the assailants, the framing of charges against the two had been delayed as they had managed to elude their extradition back to India by exploiting various loopholes in the Canadian legal system. He said the prosecution witnesses comprise of police officers, health officials, local residents of Narike village and some close friends of the couple.However, both Sidhu and Badesha were sent back to India in January, this year and had been arrested by the Sangrur police from the Delhi Airport. Following this, a supplementary chargesheet was present before the court.Initially, the police had filed a case at the Malerkotla court but it was later transferred to the district court.The FIR into the ‘honour killing’ of Canada-born Jaswinder Kaur Sidhu had been registered at Amargarh police station after Jassi and her husband Sukhwinder Singh Mithu were kidnapped and tortured village Narike of Malerkotla in Sangrur on June 8, 2000.While, Mithu, an auto-rickshaw driver, was brutally beaten and left at the spot presumed to be dead, Jassi was later murdered by slitting her throat and her body was dumped in a water channel. During investigations, the Punjab Police arrested the contract killers who revealed that they had been hired by Jassi’s mother and uncle to eliminate the two. The police had also secured the call details of the killers which had established that they were in touch with Malkit Kaur Sidhu and Surjit Singh Badesha.The Indian authorities had sought their extradition in May 2002, but in 2006 it was stalled by a Canadian court over concerns that they may not get justice in the country. The Supreme Court of Canada in 2017 ordered that they be sent back to India to face murder charges. The decision was again put on hold after the two accused sought judicial review of the decision. Their plea was finally rejected in December 2018, following which they were put on a plane back to India on January 24.Jaswinder Kaur Jassi, a resident of Maple Ridge, British Columbia had fallen in love with Sukhwinder Singh Mithu, an autorickshaw driver, during her visit to India in 1994. During her revisit to India in 1999, they both secretly got married but kept their relationship hidden from Jassi’s family for over a year. When her family got to know about her marriage to the boy, who was from the same village as that of Jassi’s mother and same Sidhu clan, they hired contract killers to eliminate the two.Jassi, who was 25 at that time, and Mithu were reportedly attacked by contract killers. The Punjab Police had registered a case in this connection in July 2000 and names of Malkit and Surjit cropped up in the case for allegedly conspiring to kill Jassi on the basis of the confession made by the contract killers.They both are presently lodged at Kapurthala jail after being transferred there from Sangrur jail.
