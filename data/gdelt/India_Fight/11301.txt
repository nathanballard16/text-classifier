Ferozepur: An alleged Pakistan spy has been apprehended from Ferozepur area in Punjab. Times Now has learnt that he was trying to photograph a Border Security Force (BSF) installation in the city here. The BSF personnel recovered a phone, sim card and a camera from his possession.

The arrested individual is an Indian national who hails from Uttar Pradesh's Moradabad, reported the news agency ANI. The accused was arrested near the BSF border outpost in Maboke. A mobile phone with an active Pakistani SIM card was recovered from his possession.

It was found that the telephone number being used by him was added to eight Pakistan-based groups. Six other Pakistan-based phone numbers were also retrieved from him.

The development comes even as India-Pakistan are locked in a staredown over the claim of attacks on each other territories. India on February 26 announced that its fighter jets bombed a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in the Balakot region of Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. A day later a package of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) fighter jets tried to enter Indian airspace in Jammu & Kashmir's Nowshera sector in order to target military installations Rajouri sector. IAF successfully thwarted the attack bid downing a PAF F-16 aircraft. An Indian MIG-21 was lost in the dog fight and its pilot Abhinandan Varthaman landed in PoK and was detained by Pakistan forces.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan while speaking in the Parliament on Thursday announced the Indian pilot will be released on Friday as a gesture of peace.
