Alia Bhatt is one actress who has been shelling out fashion goals recently through her Gully Boy promotions. From pantsuits to metallic prints, Alia is all about experimentation and wearing stylish clothes that we envy. In fact, they seem affordable and easy to style. Out of all looks including red carpet and street style, airport looks are famous. And Alia’s latest white and black stripped tracksuit make it a fuss-free comfortable wear.

Accompanying her on the same boat is Anushka Sharma. While Alia got back from Germany where she presented her movie a the Berlin Film Festival, Anushka returned from a long Australian holiday. The Zero actress donned a black and white tunic and checkered pants. She looked gorgeous too. Alia had styled her look with open hair and black sunglasses with comfy shoes and then, Anushka too sported an au naturale look.

The two actresses totally aced two different kinds of outfits with the same pattern and we love it. Do we prefer Alia or Anushka’s monochrome look?

On the work front, Alia is gearing up for Gully Boy’s release on Valentine’s Day. Directed by Zoya Akhtar, it co-stars Ranveer Singh. The movie is based on the lives of rapper Divine and Naezy and showcases the underground hip hop culture in Mumbai. Alia will also be seen in Brahmastra co-starring Amitabh Bachchan, Ranbir Kapoor and Mouni Roy.

On the other hand, Anushka was last seen in Zero opposite Shah Rukh Khan and Katrina Kaif. The actress essayed the role of a scientist with cerebral palsy.
