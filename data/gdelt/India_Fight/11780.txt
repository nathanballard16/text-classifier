Three killed in Pakistani shelling on LoC

Three civilians were killed in heavy shelling by the Pakistan Army along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch district, officials said on Saturday, the clashes later spreading to Rajouri district.

Police said a woman and her two children were killed in Salotri village in Jhalas area of Krishna Ghati sector of the Line of Control (LoC) when a shell fired by Pakistan Army exploded inside their house on Friday night.

"Four others including two civilians and two soldiers have been injured in Pakistani shelling and firing," a police officer said.

Later in the day, heavy firing exchanges started between the Indian and Pakistan armies on the LoC in Rajouri district.

Defence Ministry spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said the Pakistanis resorted to unprovoked firing in Rajouri's Nowshera sector at 12.30 p.m.

"They used mortar shells and small arms. Indian positions have retaliated strongly and effectively," the spokesman said.

Indian and Pakistani soldiers have been trading heavy fire along the winding LoC, which divides Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan, in Poonch and Rajouri districts for the past eight days.

Local residents have described the hostilities as a "war-like situation".

Authorities have closed all educational institutions within 5 kilometres from the LoC in the two districts and asked people to remain indoors.
