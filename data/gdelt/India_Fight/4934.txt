Stakeholders punch holes in to Mescoms tariff filing

Mangaluru: A tariff filing by Mangalore Electricity Supply Company ( Mescom ) Ltd for financial year (FY) 2019-20 before Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC) seeking hike of Rs 1.38/unit ran into rough weather at a public hearing organised by KERC, here on Thursday. The stakeholders were equivocal in their demand that KERC pare existing power tariff and not accede to the company’s request for a hike to cover up revenue deficit. Thrashing Mescom’s tariff filing and describing it skulduggery of numbers, Sathyanarayana Udupi , former advisory committee of KERC, said the projected deficit of Rs 706 crore for FY 2019-20 can be turned around into surplus only if the company took initiatives to recover Rs1,231 crore due to it from various sources. Mescom will still be left with a surplus of nearly Rs1,000 crore if it paid the Rs 233 crore it in turn owes to Bescom, he said.Noting that this balance of payment has remained unchanged for the past decade, Udupa said the company has also thrown all known statistical principles to the wind by taking FY 2016-17 as base year for its tariff estimation, a year that saw big fluctuations both revenue and power consumption wise. Mescom at Rs 5.71/unit is paying more for power supplied by UPCL as against Rs 5.02/unit that Bescom is paying the Adani group company, he said.Even the power purchase agreements that Mescom has with 21-off power supply companies too clearly suggests that the company is paying at least Rs 2/unit more compared to other power distribution companies, which is costing its kitty an extra Rs 150 crore, he said. Mescom has also failed miserably in following up various directives given by KERC on various counts including making it mandatory to fix timer switches, he noted.Reminding the commission that barring 2005-06, when K P Pandey headed the quasi-judicial body that the tariffs were last slashed, Udupa said the company that prided itself as one of the better managed discom in India had not shown any desirable progress in addressing transmission and distribution losses. For all capital expenditure Mescom has made and sought for through the filing has not resulted in tangible results, he contended.B A Nazeer, representing Kanara Chamber of Commerce and Industry ,said high tariff sought by Mescom for LT 5 category has virtually killed off industrial growth in the region. Many industries have shut shop, he said, adding paring off a rupee from existing tariff will help in rejuvenating the industrial scene and also bring the company revenue through new users. This will also help in generating much-needed employment in the region, he added.Taking note of complaints on Mescom’s service deficiency and giving a patient hearing to the stakeholders views on the tariff filing, Shambu Dayal Meena, chairman, KERC, said the same will be considered while announcing the tariff order. Meena also directed Snehal Rayamane, MD, Mescom, to pay due attention to consumer grievances and also sensitise all rungs of the company staff in ensuring better service that the company is always capable of.
