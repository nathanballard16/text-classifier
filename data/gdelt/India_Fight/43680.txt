Subhash Kapoor heads to Lucknow

Kapoor and his crew wrapped a visit to Lucknow to plan a new film that is expected to go on the floors in the immediate future.

We had told you a while ago that a section of the industry had bet on Subhash Kapoor starting a new and different film immediately after Aamir Khan announced that he was back in the Subhash directorial Mogul, a biopic on Gulshan Kumar. Well, that seems to be true.

Kapoor and his crew wrapped a visit to Lucknow to plan a new film that is expected to go on the floors in the immediate future. While Kapoor has been planning to make a biopic on the former UP Chief Minister Mayawati, there are talks that he has already signed on his favourite actor Saurabh Shukla along with Richa Chadha and Akshay Oberoi. Lucknow is also the city which Kapoor is much acquainted with, having shot his earlier film Jolly LLB 2 there.

Aamir’s U-turn on clearing the #MeToo accused came as a bit of a shock for the film industry that swore by his ethics and values.

“The recce is over and we are in the know that these three actors have given the green signal for the film after Aamir’s volte-face, which means that ‘innocent till proven guilty’. Aamir could be right, but he could have maintained that stance long ago. However, it means that Subhash has a new lease on life until any association or Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) deems him guilty,” says the source.

Well, we now only want to wait and see if Aamir keeps his word of doing Mogul.
