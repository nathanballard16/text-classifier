Man accused of murdering RSS worker applies for bail saying Indian commodes do not agree with his knee

Parappana Agrahara Central Prison

Victoria Hospital

HC rejects petition saying jail has decent Western style water closetsIf it were not for the humble Western commodes in the washrooms ofand the jail ward at the, Waseem Ahmed (34), the alleged killer of RSS leader R Rudresh, would have become a free man for at least three months on medical grounds.The bail application of Ahmed that was recently rejected by the special NIA court cites that due to a serious ligament tear on his left knee, it was extremely difficult for him to squat in an Indian-style commode and answer nature’s call.He had also claimed in his application that his leg required immediate surgical attention and the facility was not available at Victoria Hospital; hence he wanted bail to get the procedure done at a private hospital at his own expense. Ahmed moved a petition before the High Court seeking rejection of the bail cancellation order on February 6, 2019 and the court summoned the Superintendent of Central Prison along with officials from Victoria Hospital to assess whether there were enough facilities such as a Western-style commode at the prison complex and also to ascertain medical facilities at Victoria Hospital on February 7. Justice KN Phaneendra and Justice K Natarajan also decided to uphold the order of the NIA special court and also instructed officials to ensure medical aid to the accused.“It is not a simple case but the petitioner is accused of committing an act of terror. The jail superintendent and medical authorities told the court that there were Western commode facilities available at the prison and also at the medical ward. The court also instructed the authorities to ensure that medical treatment is provided to him as per the law. The accused cannot dictate any term in these kind of cases,” said P Prasanna Kumar, special public prosecutor, NIA.According to sources at Parappana Agrahara, the jail barracks and the adjoining blocks where Ahmed is lodged have at least 10 restrooms fitted with Western-style commodes and the medical ward at the prison has another four.“It is not factually correct to claim that there are no Western-style commode facilities in Parappana Agrahara prison,” a source said.The prison department also informed the court that Ahmed had been transferred to the prison ward at Victoria Hospital for the ligament surgery which is expected to be conducted later this week.“The NIA has not objected to extending medical aid for the accused on any ground. We have only objected to his bail application in a case which could not be treated leniently under any circumstance. Also, the medical ailment listed in this case is also not life threatening under any circumstance,” Prasanna Kumar added.Ahmed’s lawyer had also presented a letter from a medical expert claiming that Victoria Hospital did not have the facilities to carry out the surgical procedure but the court said that this letter was ambiguous and did not give weightage to it. His lawyer had also stated that Ahmed had undergone a similar procedure on his right knee in 2009 at a private hospital in the city and had to take three months rest to completely recover.“The rejection of bail in the case would not amount to violation of fundamental right as the case on hand is a severe one. The fact of non-availability of any equipment of facility at Victoria could be looked into by giving suitable instructions to the concerned state authorities,” the NIA court had stated in its order.Ahmed, said to be a member of the Popular Front of India (PFI), was riding pillion with co-accused Mohammed Sadiq on October 16, 2016 and hacked Rudresh while he was dressed in his RSS uniform and speaking to his friends near Sreenivasa Medical Store in Shivajinagar. The NIA in its objections to the bail application filed before the court has claimed that Ahmed shouted a communally charged slogan while hacking Rudresh. He along with the five accused in the case had decided to kill RSS volunteers in their uniforms to instill fear in the minds of a section of the community.
