Seer to approach court against animal sacrifice

Belagavi, Jan 6: Vishwa Prani Kalyan Mandali, Bengaluru, president Swamy Dayanand said on Saturday that he would file contempt of court petition in the high court against the state government and the Belagavi district administration for allowing mass animal sacrificeon the premises of the Yallamma Devi temple in Kokatnur village of Athani taluk during the annual fair held on December 31.

Swamy said that last year, he had tried to prevent animal sacrifice at the temple but could not do so due to the non-cooperation of local authorities and police.

“I had made proper preparations this year to prevent animal sacrifice by approaching several authorities concerned including the chief secretary, DGP & ADGP Bengaluru, IGP (Northern Range) besides district authorities including DC, SP, local CPI and PSI. Despite orders from top authorities, lower officers ignored them and allowed animal sacrifice,” he said.

He added that according to the Karnataka Prevention of Animal Sacrifice Act-1959 sacrificing animals at any public religious place is prohibited. “It is illegal and attracts punishment up to six months along with a penalty. In 2015, the high court instructed government authorities to hold awareness camps to prevent animal sacrifice in religious events like jatras and congregations. Since the local administration failed to do its duty, I will file a contempt petition,” he said.

“Thousands of animals were sacrificed in front of senior police officials during the fair. Meat was sold at the spot and butchers were openly charging Rs 200 to kill and skin animals on the premises of the temple. Devotees from Maharashtra, Karnataka and Goa too were killing animals. It’s unfortunate that police officials were mute spectators,” Swamy said.
