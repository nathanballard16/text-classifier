Uproar in Parliament over Rahul Gandhi's 'rape in India' remarks

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Friday launched a blistering attack in both House of Parliament on Congress leader Rahul Gandhi for his 'rape in India' remarks and sought his apology.As soon as Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla paid tributes to the those who lost their lives in the 2001 Parliament attack, minister of state for parliamentary affairs Arjun Ram Meghwal said several BJP members had given notices of adjournment against Gandhi's remarks and they be allowed to speak.Meghwal said Gandhi's remarks in Jharkhand's Godda district on Thursday were condemnable and he should apologise in the House.Meghwal said there had been precedents where members have apologised in the Lok Sabha for remarks made outside the House.BJP MP Locket Chatterjee said Gandhi had insulted women by making remarks that 'Make in India' had become "rape in India".She said all men were not rapists.Union Minister Smriti Irani said: "This is first time in history that a leader is giving a clarion call that Indian women should be raped. Is this Rahul Gandhi's message to the people of the country?"Union minister Rajnath Singh said that equating Make in India to rape is hurtful. "People who make such remarks have no moral right to be member of this House," Singh said.Defending Rahul Gandhi, DMK MP Kanimozhi said: "PM said 'Make in India', which we respect, but what is happening in country? That is what Rahul Gandhi intended to say. Unfortunately 'Make in India' is not happening and women in the country are being raped. This is a concern".Lok Sabha was later adjourned sine die even as BJP MPs continued to raise slogans demanding an apology from Gandhi.There was commotion in the Rajya Sabha too as BJP members raised slogans seeking apology from Gandhi.Few MPs in Rajya Sabha raised slogans of 'Rahul Gandhi maafi maango'. Rajya Sabha Chairman M Venkaiah Naidu said, "You cannot take the name of a person who is not a member of this House. No body has the business to disturb the House".
