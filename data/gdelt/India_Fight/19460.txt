Ayushmann Khurrana wraps up ‘Article 15’

Mumbai: Versatile actor Ayushmann Khurrana has wrapped up shooting for Anubhav Sinha’s “Article 15”, which he is confident will be a relevant and important piece of cinema.

“Wrapped up a film which will become the most relevant and important film of Indian cinema. Thank you Anubhav Sinha sir for giving me this gem and also writing the most realistic cop role ever,” Ayushmann tweeted on Tuesday.
