Indian troops initiate unprovoked firing in Kashmir: Pakistani army--China Economic Net

The Pakistani military said on Friday that Indian troops initiated unprovoked firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir region.

"Pakistan Army troops responded effectively to those Indian posts targeting civil population," a statement from the army's media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), said.

The statement claimed that at least three Indian soldiers were killed and two others injured in retaliation by Pakistani forces, adding that an Indian post was also damaged.

The statement added that the Indian Army initiated unprovoked fire across the LoC in Khuiratta and Kotkhetera sectors, targeting innocent civil population.

Earlier on Jan. 7, a 26-year-old citizen was killed while a woman got injured in Indian forces' firing along the LoC in Kashmir region, according to ISPR.

Pakistan and India have declared ceasefire along the LoC and the working boundary in 2003. Both, however, routinely accuse each other of violating the ceasefire.
