India's Osama from Arjun Kapoor starrer 'India’s Most Wanted' Unmasked

Few days ago, teaser of Arjun Kapoor ’s next film, India’s Most Wanted, which has been directed by Raj Kumar Gupta dropped. The teaser introduced the audience to a terrorist who was the mastermind behind 52 bomb blasts in killing 433, and the film traces the journey of 5 intelligence officers who set out to nab the terrorist, who is being referred to as ‘India’s Osama’ in the film.What really piqued the interest in the film is that it is based on true events, and there was a lot of speculation around who this deadly terrorist could be. The fact that there was complete silence around this terrorist also sparked a debate between supporters of political parties and a blame game on inaction on this terrorist ensued. The trailer of the film released recently, and focused on the journey of the unsung heroes who fought against odds to capture the terrorist. The terrorist was not named in the trailer either.However, it has learnt from reliable sources, that the film is based on the story of capture of Yasin Bhatkal , co-founder of Indian Mujahideen, who was captured at Nepal border in 2013. Bhatkal was the mastermind behind many attacks including Pune’s German Bakery blast, Bangalore stadium bombing and blasts in Ahmedabad. He was recently produced in court in Pune, where he pleaded not guilty.
