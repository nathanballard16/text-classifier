Finally, Relief For Family Of Asifabad Gangrape-Murder Victim Who Accused Media And Ministers of Caste Bias

The official said the family should get the relief within this week as the administration is helping them open a bank account. “Monetary help is not a solution but a support and a small help to the family,” the official said.

The police have arrested three men – Shaik Babu (35), Shaik Shaboddin (30) and Shaik Makdum (40) – for rape and murder of Lakshmi (FIR number 49/2019 registered in Lingayat police station). Charges under SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act have also been applied.

When Swarajya visited the family on 3 December, Gopi said he feared that the police were hiding the post-mortem report from the family that might reveal disturbing details. Gopi, who recovered the body himself, said he feared that Lakshmi might have been hit badly on her face and body during the crime.

Her eyes were bulging. Her fingers were broken as if hit repeatedly by stones. Her legs were bent in an awkward position, he said.

Villagers said that a day after the crime, Gopi poured kerosene on himself and tried to set himself on fire, but neighbours managed to stop him.

Lakshmi’s brother said that with her death, the poor family suffered a major setback. “They somehow managed to make a living. It’s going to be very difficult for the family now,” he said.

In a report published on 4 December, a portal, The News Minute, quoted a local Dalit activist as saying that nobody raises voice for Dalits.

“We fight against every injustice and condole without seeing caste and religion. But when it comes to atrocities against people from our community, there is nobody to raise their voice,” Manda Krishna Madiga, president of the Madiga Reservation Porata Samiti told the website.

The samiti, along with other organisations, had staged a dharna on 4 December, alleging discrimination.
