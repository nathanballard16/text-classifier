Man killed co-worker for passing comments against wife

Ludhiana: Three days after a 50-year-old man was found murdered in a factory, the CIA-2 arresting a co-worker for the crime on Thursday.

The victim was identified as Bindu Prasad. The accused — America Rajbar, 24, originally from Uttar Pradesh — was trying to flee the city when he was nabbed from Dhandhari Bridge.

According to police, Rajbar carried out the crime as Bindu and his son used to pass comments on his wife. The accused had objected to it, but to no avail, they added.

Bindu’s son Santosh Rai was Rajbar’s brother-in-law (wife’s brother).

ACP (detective) Surinder Mohan said Rajbar and Bindu worked in a rubber factory on Tajpur Road. Six months ago, Rajbar got married and brought his wife to Ludhiana. They lived in the labour quarters of the factory.

The ACP said Rajbar was pissed off with Santosh Rai and his father Bindu who used to pass comments on his wife. He suspected Bindu of keeping evil eye on his wife. On September 23, when factory workers went out of the factory during tea break, he killed Bindu with a stone and fled.

As there was no sign of forceful entry into the factory, the police suspected involvement of a factory worker in the murder. Rajbar was missing since the day of crime which made him a prime suspect.
