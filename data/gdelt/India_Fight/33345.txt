He had been released on Rs 15,000 surety amount. The complaint was filed by an RSS worker and lawyer.There are five different cases for which Rahul has to appear in courts across the country to defend statements he made against BJP and RSS while campaigning for the Lok Sabha polls. Two of them are done with Rahul appearing in Mumbai and Patna courts.Next Rahul will appear before an Ahmedabad court on July 9 for his “murder accused” reference to BJP chief Amit Shah, while on July 12, he will appear before another Gujarat court in criminal defamation suits filed by the Ahmedabad District Cooperative Bank and its chairman. On July 24, Rahul is scheduled to appear before a Surat court, for allegedly defaming the entire Modi community by saying all “Modis are thieves”.
