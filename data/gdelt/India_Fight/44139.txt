VARANASI: Officials of the district administration intensified flood relief and rescue operations on Wednesday as the rising water of Ganga breached the danger mark of 71.26 metres in Varanasi.

Though the administration has arranged for shelters at primary schools in different localities, several flood-affected families were seen putting up their own makeshift arrangement in the open on the banks of Varuna. They claimed no official visited them and they did not receive any relief material.

"We have been living in our makeshift tent for last three days but no one has turned up to listen to our problems. We are living in darkness as there is no power supply here," said an elderly woman Manju Pandey.

ADM (finance and revenue) and nodal officer for flood Satish Pal said he would look into the matter and provide relief to flood victims who were not staying in relief camps. "A relief shelter has already been set up at a junior high school in Dhelwaria area. We will ask them to shift there as all arrangements have been made ," he said.

"At least 11 flood relief shelters out of 36 accommodating over 200 families are operational in flood-affected urban localities like Samne Ghat and trans-Varuna areas. So far, flood has not affected rural areas," the ADM added. He said 11 private and 15 NDRF boats had been pressed into service to rescue stranded people. A total of 375 people have taken shelter at relief camps in a primary school and three other camps in nearby madarsas in Saraiyya.
