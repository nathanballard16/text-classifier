India bans Jamaat-e-Islami in occupied Kashmir

SRINAGAR - Indian authorities have banned Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) in occupied Kashmir.

According to the Kashmir Media Service (KMS), Indian Ministry of Home Affairs issued a notification banning the socio-religious organization, JeI on the charges of supporting the freedom cause and pro-freedom groups.

The notification said that the organization, if not banned, would continue advocating freedom of the held valley; propagate anti-India and pro-freedom sentiments in Jammu and Kashmir.

Meanwhile, the Indian police arrested six more JeI activists during raids from Laribal, Pinglish, Dardsara, Panner, Mandoora and Lurgam villages last night and were lodged at police station Tral.

Last week, Indian police arrested more than 300 JeI leaders, including its leader, Abdul Hamid Fayaz.

On Friday, Indian troops in a fresh act of state terrorism killed another two young Kashmiris at Babagund in Handwara area of Kupwara district in the Occupied Kashmir.

Several people were injured when the troops used brute force against peaceful protesters in the area.
