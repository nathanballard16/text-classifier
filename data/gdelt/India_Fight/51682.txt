Appellate Side of Calcutta High Court: Important Judgments of October 2019

The Division Bench felt the need to refer the question even as it observed that the issue was settled by a Full Bench in Union of India v. Central Administrative Tribunal (which stated that the Tribunal had the power to condone). This was so because the Division Bench noted that an earlier Division Bench in WPCT 271/2001 disagreed with yet another Division Bench in Union of India v. Anup Chandra Sanyal wherein the latter had held that the Tribunal did not have the power to entertain a review filed beyond 30 days. The Full Bench noted that the Division Bench which had referred the matter in the present case was more agreeable with the ratio in Anup Chandra Sanyal and not with the Full Bench in Union of India v. CAT.
