Dishoom coming to Paradise Birmingham

Dishoom

Dishoom Birmingham will occupy part of the ground floor of One Chamberlain Square, the office space of which is fully let to international professional services firm PwC which will also be moving into the building early next year. The new restaurant will overlook both Chamberlain Square and Centenary Way and will help complete the first phase of the development.

Rob Groves, regional director at Argent, said: “Bringing the critically acclaimed Dishoom to Birmingham demonstrates the appeal of Paradise with its perfect mix of location, top quality buildings and revamped public realm. Joining Mediterranean Wine Bar and restaurant Vinoteca, we are quickly becoming the natural choice for innovative leisure retailers keen on reaching an audience of up to 17 million people a year.”

The Irani cafes were once part of the fabric of life in Bombay. They broke down barriers by bringing people together over food and drink.
