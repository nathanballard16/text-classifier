New Delhi: An Indian soldier was killed along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir following a ceasefire violation by Pakistan, Army sources said on Monday.

The ceasefire violation took place at 1 p.m. on Sunday in the Poonch sector.

The Army identified the deceased soldier as Grenadier Hemraj Jat (23).

An official said Pakistani troops had resorted to shelling of mortars and firing of small arms in which Jat sustained fatal injuries.

Jat belonged to Rajasthan's Alwar district and had been commissioned into the Army in 2017.

"Indian forces retaliated befittingly to the shelling by Pakistan," the official added.

Pakistan has upped the ante at the LoC through repeated ceasefire violations ever since the special category status to Jammu and Kashmir was withdrawn.

In August, there were more than 275 instances of ceasefire violations by Pakistan along the LoC. More than 220 ceasefire violations were reported from the LoC after August 5 when India abrogated Article 370 of the Constitution.
