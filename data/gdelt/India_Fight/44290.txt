CBI Raids Locations in Hunt for IPS Officer Rajeev Kumar

Kolkata: The CBI on Thursday raided various locations here, looking for the elusive senior IPS officer Rajeev Kumar, wanted by the federal agency in connection with the Saradha Ponzi scam probe. Kumar, who has not been seen in public since Friday evening after the Calcutta High Court withdrew the interim protection from arrest given to him, has failed to appear before the CBI for questioning disregarding multiple notices served by the probe agency. The CBI sleuths, including men from the special investigation team set up to find Rajeev Kumar, went to the IPS officers’ mess in Alipore, Kumar’s official residence on Park street as also a five-star hotel off the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass. Four Central Bureau of investigation officers drove to 34, Park Street and stayed there for 45 minutes trying to collect information about Kumar. A large number of policemen standing guard outside the quarters initially had no idea of the CBI officers’ presence. But once they came to know of the CBI sleuths' arrival, the cops allowed them in only after checking their identity in detail. The sleuths’ next stopover was the IPS officers’ mess where they spoke to the watchmen, staff and searched a number of rooms on the ground and first floors. Then came the most dramatic part, as the sleuths raided Hotel Vivanta near the Ruby Hospital Crossing. (IANS)
