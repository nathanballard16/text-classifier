New Delhi, April 3

The BJP today attacked the Congress saying various provisions in its manifesto posed a threat to the country as those favoured separatists and terrorists, and demoralised the armed forces.

Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the manifesto was not in national interest and indirectly helped terrorists and others working against the country.

She cited its promise to review the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and repeal Section 124A (sedition law) of the IPC to attack it. “Are you writing the manifesto to help separatists?” said Sitharaman.

Insisting that her party was not against withdrawing AFSPA if the situation allowed it, she said tweaking its provisions would allow terrorists and their friends to target the security personnel with manufactured allegation. — TNS

The Congress manifesto is a danger for the country. It would only demoralise the armed forces. — Nirmala Sitharaman, Defence minister
