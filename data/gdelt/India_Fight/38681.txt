Mumbai: Shraddha Kapoor, who shot for three films -- Saaho, Chhichhore and Street Dancer -- in 2019, said it has been a physically intense year for her. The actor, however, said she is happy to be a part three big films. "My body is paining a lot. It has been a physically intense year for me. I did shoot three films but Street Dancer is releasing next year. I feel I should get some break but now promotions of Saaho have also started.

"I am so excited and it's a big thing. Saaho is my first multi-lingual film and I am happy I got to be part of such a big film," Shraddha told reporters here at the trailer launch of Saaho on Saturday.

Saaho is slated to release on August 30 and Chhichhore will hit cinemas on September 6, while Street Dancer, also featuring Varun Dhawan, will release in January next year.

Talking about her two films releasing back-to-back, Shraddha said, "The fact is both the films are different from each other. I feel lucky that I am coming on the big screen in such a short duration."

Saaho, directed by Sujeeth, will see Shraddha trying her hands-on action. "Whatever was the demand of the script I did action accordingly. I was in good hands with this film and I was sure they will make me look good on screen," she added.

Shraddha will be sharing screen space with south star with Prabhas in Saaho for the first time and the actor said she had an amazing time working with him.

"I got lot of love from the entire team while I was shooting in Hyderabad. Prabhas is a huge superstar but he has an amazing heart. I had great time working with him."
