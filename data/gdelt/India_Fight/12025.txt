Priyanka Chopra says Jai Hind after IAF airstrike. Pak petition says remove her as UNICEF ambassador

After fighter jets of the Indian Air Force launched an airstrike on a major Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp in Pakistan in retaliation to the Pulwama attack, several Bollywood celebrities lauded the brave pilots.

Priyanka Chopra, whose parents Dr Ashok Chopra and Dr Madhu Chopra were both doctors in the Indian Army, was no different. Soon after India's Surgical Strike 2.0, she came out in support of the Indian Air Force and tweeted, "Jai Hind."

The netizens of Pakistan are not happy with Priyanka's support for the Indian armed forces. An online petition which originated in the neighbouring country has demanded the removal of the actress as a goodwill ambassador of UNICEF.

"War between two nuclear powers can only lead to destruction & death. As goodwill ambassador of UNICEF, Priyanka Chopra was supposed to stay neutral and peaceful but her tweet in favour of Indian arm forces after they invaded Pakistan airspace shows otherwise. She doesn't deserve this title anymore," the petition read.

Currently, the petition has a few thousand signatures. It has no mention of Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Pakistan-based terrorist outfit which claimed responsibility for the dastardly attack on a security convoy in Pulwama last month, which claimed the lives of 40 soldiers.

Reports in the Western media termed Jai Hind a "Hindu phrase" that means 'Long Live India'. Interestingly, Priyanka recently answered one of the most Googled questions about her - 'Is Priyanka Chopra Hindi?' She shot back with, "Hindi is a language. I'm Hindu, which is the religion. It's a slight difference. Just educate yourself."
