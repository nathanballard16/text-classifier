NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi police on Friday claimed to have arrested a man allegedly linked with proscribed terrorist organisation Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and maintained close contact with the mastermind of the Feb. 14 Pulwama attack in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

Identified as Sajjad Khan, the man is the resident of India-controlled Jammu and Kashmir, and had been hiding in the Indian capital city since the Pulwama attack on Feb.14, which killed 40 security personnel belonging to the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).

The special cell of the Delhi Police arrested Sajjad Khan from near the Red Fort in Old Delhi area on Thursday night, police sources said.

Sajjad Khan was learnt to be in contact with the mastermind of the Pulwama attack Mudassir Ahmed Khan who was believed to have been killed on March 11. It has been found that Sajjad Khan moved to Delhi before the Pulwama attack and had been living here as a shawl-seller.

He reportedly possessed the details of the Pulwama attack. His two brothers were also Jaish terrorists and killed by the Indian security forces.
