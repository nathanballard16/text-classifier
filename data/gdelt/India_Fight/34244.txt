Fruit-seller kills self after shooting at sister-in-law

NOIDA: A 24-year-old fruit seller allegedly shot at his sister-in-law in Bisrakh’s Haibatpur village, before killing himself on Thursday evening.The victim’s husband, Jai Kumar, alleged that his brother Ramesh would usually make unwelcome advances towards his wife due to which there was a conflict between them.The 36-year-old woman, who is a mother of three kids, had asked her husband to stay separately because of Ramesh’s activities in the house. Ramesh was asked to leave home in Diwali last year.However, according to Jai, Ramesh followed her home on Thursday. Police said that crime took place around 7pm, when the woman had returned home from the factory where she worked in.“We had received information that Ramesh had shot at the woman. He apparently had an argument with her,” said Manoj Pathak, SHO (Bisrakh).“Ramesh had been staying in a rented accommodation in Ghaziabad’s Jhandapur,” Jai told TOI. He added, “As she disliked his activities, Ramesh had a grudge against her and had even threatened to kill her multiple times. We had thought about lodging a complaint against him.”Police said that the accused shot at the woman’s stomach twice and left the spot. The victim had managed to call her family in Bihar and inform her son, who then informed Jai over the phone.Before Jai could reach, the neighbours had called up the police and a team had taken the woman to the nearest hospital from where she was referred to the RML hospital, Delhi. She continues to be under observation in the ICU and her situation is said to be serious, police said.Meanwhile, on Friday morning Ramesh was found dead with a bullet shot in his head. Pathak said that Ramesh killed himself with the same country-made pistol that he used to shoot the woman. “It seems that he committed suicide on Thursday night itself. His body was recovered from the rented accommodation,” he said.
