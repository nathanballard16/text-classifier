1,800 members will vote on the consent terms signed betweenand Gallops restaurant.Eighteen hundred members of the’s (RWITC) will cast their vote as an Extra Ordinary General Meeting (EOGM) is held today to decide the future of the club, Gallops Restaurant and the sport of horse-racing.The members will have to either endorse or reject the “terms of settlement” signed between RWITC and Gallops management.As per the terms of settlement filed in thelast month, the restaurant management would make an upfront payment of Rs 10 crore and another Rs 48 crore over a 12-year period as arrears and conducting fees for the restaurant. This proposal is subject to approval at the EOGM.The RWITC was involved in a long-drawn legal battle with BJR’s, a partnership firm that manages Gallops, for over a decade during which the club’s financial profligacy wiped out its cash reserves. Currently — following an unprecedented police raid on the official bookmakers in December last — India’s premier turf club is on the brink of collapse. The Mumbai-based bookmakers have discontinued their business leading to a monthly loss of nearly Rs 2.5 crore to the club.Even as RWITC’s management struggled to tide over the financial crisis, a ray of hope emerged for the revenue-starved club last month when the Bombay High Court approved its settlement proposal with BJR’s.A fortnight earlier, the HC ordered that the Gallops Restaurant be sealed for flouting various Supreme Court orders and also appointed a court receiver. In August last year, the SC had directed BJR’s to pay RWITC Rs 18 crore within six weeks failing or face eviction.Now, the RWITC’s managing committee has strongly urged the members to vote in favour of the resolution. According to, “The committee unanimously believes that the settlement is, by all means, a fair one. If there is no compromise, it’s the court receiver who gets possession of Gallops and not the club.“The most significant outcome from this settlement will be that BJR’s gives up its tenancy claim and withdraws all pending suits. Furthermore, the club receives Rs 60 crore over a 12-year period including Rs 10 crore upfront. In case BJR’s defaults on any account, the court receiver would take immediate possession of the premises and hand it over to the club.”“The committee believes it’s a no-brainer,” concluded Dhunjibhoy.
