40% of India's MPs face criminal charges, including rape and murder: Study

NEW DELHI (AFP) - More than 40 per cent of lawmakers in India's new Parliament face criminal charges - some as serious as murder and rape - and the list is growing, an electoral reform group said on Saturday (May 25).

One Member of Parliament for the opposition Congress party is battling 204 cases, including manslaughter and robbery, the Association of Democratic Reforms (ADR) said.

At least 233 of the 543 members named as winning seats on Thursday face criminal proceedings, according to the ADR, whose election chief Anil Verma said there is a "disturbing trend" in Parliament that "is bad for the democracy".

The ADR said it studied the records of 539 of the winners and found that the number facing criminal cases was the highest since it started studies in 2004.

The report said 116 of the 303 lawmakers from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) landslide win face charges, including one for terrorism.

Twenty-nine of the 52 Congress MPs face cases. Dean Kuriakose from Idukki, in Kerala state, faces 204 criminal cases.

The ADR said the number of lawmakers facing grave criminal cases had more than doubled in a decade - including 11 murder cases, 30 manslaughter charges and three accused of rape.
