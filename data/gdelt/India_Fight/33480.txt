BSF shoots Bangladeshi national dead

Indian border guards gunned down one Bangladeshi cattle trader near Sreerampur border in Lalmonirhat early yesterday.

Ershadul Haque, 35, of Burimari Islampur village under Patgram upazila was shot after being spotted by the Border Security Force (BSF) near pillar no. 845, said Patgram police OC Mansur Ali.

“Ershad and 6/7 other cattle traders intruded into India to illegally bring cattle from there. BSF members of Changrabandha camp under Mekhilganj Police Station of Koch Bihar opened fire leaving Ershad injured.

“Other cattle traders managed to bring him back home. He died on the way,” said the OC quoting Ershad’s family and locals.

Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) later sent the body to Lalmonirhat Sadar Hospital for autopsy, he said.

About the incident, Commander of Burimari BGB camp Subedar Nayek Mizanur Rahman said, “What the cattle traders did was illegal. But BSF could arrest them instead of opening fire. We have sent a protest letter to them in this regard.”
