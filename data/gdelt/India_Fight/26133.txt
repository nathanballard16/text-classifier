A three-year-old girl died and her parents were seriously injured after a Telangana legislator's car rammed their motorcycle on Saturday. The accident took place in Jeedivagu area in Mulugu district.

The car in which Congress MLA Danasari Anasuya alias Seethakka was travelling, rammed into the two-wheeler coming from opposite direction.

While K. Arun was driving the bike, his wife Vijaya and daughter Sravanthi were riding pillion. Sravanthi died of head injuries while her parents were shifted to a government-run hospital at Eturanagaram.

The couple was taking the baby to drop her at anganwadi centre in a nearby village.

The MLA later called on the parents of the girl and expressed her regret, assuring financial assitance to the family.

"This is a very disturbing accident in which a small baby became a victim. I feel sad about it. I stand by the family in this hour of grief," she was quoted as saying.

Meanwhile, the Mulugu police registered a case under Section 304A (Causing death by negligence) and 337 (Causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the IPC and seized the vehicle. They said that further investigation was ongoing.

In August last year, two people died after they were knocked down by the car of Kandukur MLA Pothula Ramarao at Keesarapalli junction in Andhra Pradesh, close to the Vijayawada airport at Gannavaram.

The legislator from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) was on his way to the airport, to catch a flight to Hyderabad, to extend his condolences to the family of actor-politician Nandamuri Hari Krishna, who died in a road accident at Narketpalli in Telangana's Nalgonda district, a day earllier.
