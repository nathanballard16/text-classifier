EC allows Modi's Balakot pitch for votes

Modi had asked voters to dedicate their vote to the brave soldiers who carried out the air strike in Balakot

“The matter has been examined in detail in accordance with the extant advisories, provisions of the model code of conduct and after examination of complete transcript of speech of 11 pages as per the certified copy sent by the returning officer… commission is of the considered view that in this matter no such violation of the extant advisories/provisions is attracted,” the poll panel said.

The Election Commission on Wednesday gave a clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his pitch for votes in the name of the Balakot air strikes.

In Latur on April 4, Modi had asked first-time voters to “dedicate your first vote to the valiant soldiers who carried out the air strike in Pakistan’s Balakot” and “the brave martyrs of Pulwama”. The CPM and the Congress had lodged complaints.

On March 19, the poll panel had issued an advisory: “Political parties/candidates are advised that their campaigners/candidates should desist, as part of their campaigning, from indulging in any political propaganda involving activities of the defence forces.”

The poll panel has barred BJP Bhopal candidate and terror accused Pragya Singh Thakur from campaigning for 72 hours from 6am on Thursday over her statements on late police officer Hemant Karkare and the Babri Masjid demolition.

On April 19, she had told BJP activists that Karkare, who had arrested her in the Malegaon blast case and “tortured” her, died during the 26/11 attacks because she had “cursed” him.

On April 20, she had told Aaj Tak channel she was proud of her participation in the Babri demolition and asserted a Ram temple would be built at the site.

The commission found the first statement “unwarranted” and the second “provocative” and a violation of the model code, which bans the “securing of votes on religious lines”. Bhopal votes on May 12.
