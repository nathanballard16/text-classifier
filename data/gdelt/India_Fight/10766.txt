Wing Commander Abhinandan was seized after his MiG-21 combat jet crashed after it was hit. An unverified video appears to show him being beaten by civilians before a Pakistani soldier intervenes. The Pakistani military later posted, then removed, a video showing Mr Abhinandan being questioned after the attack.

In the clip the Indian pilot is seen blindfolded with his hands tied behind his back.

The Indian government condemned what it described as a “vulgar display of injured personnel”.

However a later video clip shows Mr Abhinandan drinking tea without a blindfold, whilst also complementing the Pakistani military on how they treated him.

The pilot has been listed as “missing in action” by Indian officials.

The Indian and Pakistani governments have released contradictory accounts of the military action which took place yesterday.
