Trip down memory lane: When former EAM Sushma Swaraj's oratorical tour de force shook UNGA

The people's External Affairs Minister, Swaraj breathed her last in New Delhi on August 6.

It is often said that the absence of people can really be felt long after they've left for higher places. Nothing stands truer, as the next UN General Assembly session fast approaches, without the presence of one of India's most beloved leaders, Sushma Swaraj.

The people's External Affairs Minister, Swaraj breathed her last in New Delhi on August 6.

India's foreign policy under the Swaraj-Modi leadership put the country on the international map as a force which shapes global agenda. Amongst other things, the stalwart never shied from shedding light on Pakistan and its "export of terrorism" on international platforms.

Even as India preps to address another UNGA session, it is difficult to forget the role Swaraj took on to bring terrorism and climate change to the forefront of the global agenda.

There's no better partnership that comes to mind when deliberating on why India's voice is heard louder today on global platforms than of Swaraj and Modi's.

This is why it becomes important to remember the leader as we go forth on our path of becoming the superpower we're projected to be.
