CBI Raids Bulandshahar DM Abhay Singh's Residence In Connection With Illegal Sand Mining Case

CBI team arrived at the residence of Singh who is now the DM of Bulandshahar, early Wednesday morning and questioned him for about two hours.

CBI raided Bulandshahar District Magistrate Abhay Singh’s residence on Wednesday in connection with illegal sand mining case during the Akhilesh government in Uttar Pradesh. Singh has come under scanner for allegedly bypassing rules and regulations for granting licenses for sand mining during his tenure as District Magistrate of Fatehpur in 2012. The officials said cash of around Rs 47 lakh was recovered from the premises of Singh and they had to bring in a note-counting machine to count the total amount of cash.
