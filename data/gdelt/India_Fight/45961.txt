18 month old child killed in fight over open defecation

BHOPAL: Just 10 days after two Dalit children were beaten to death for open defecation in Shivpuri district , an 18-month-old baby was killed in a fight between two families over a child urinating in the open in a Sagar village.The fight began after the seven-year-old child of Umesh Singh, a resident of Bhangarh village, urinated in a common pathway of the locality. Mohar Singh, one of Umesh’s neighbours, objected and asked him to ensure that his son never defecates in the open. This enraged Umesh and his father Ram Singh, say police.Ram and Umesh returned after a while, armed with sticks, and started attacking Mohar. During the violence, Mohar’s 18-month-old baby Bhagwan was hit on the head, police said. The baby died on the spot. Both accused have been arrested.Villagers informed police and Ram and Umesh were arrested and booked for murder and causing grievous hurt (as Mohar is injured), Sagar SP Amit Sanghi said. Both families are tribals. “It’s not a case of open defecation, as mentioned by a section of the media, but a dispute between two families,” the SP added.
