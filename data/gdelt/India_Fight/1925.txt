National Security Act invoked against 7 accused in Bulandshahr violence

LUCKNOW, Jan 14 (Agencies): The Uttar Pradesh administration invoked National Security Act against the seven accused arrested in the December 3 cow slaughtering case in Bulandshahr on Monday. Two people were killed in the violence including a police inspector.

On December 3, a mob of some 400 people including some Hindu right-wing activists, had rampaged through the Chingrawathi village, apparently after cow carcasses were found strewn in a jungle nearby.

The mob set dozens of vehicles on fire, hurled stones and even fired from guns at police who had to retaliate with gunfire.
