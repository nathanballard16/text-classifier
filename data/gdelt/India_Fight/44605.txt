Chennai: Army Chief Bipin Rawat on Monday said that Balakot terrorist training camp has been reactivated by Pakistan. The Indian Air Force in February -while responding to Pulwama terror attack -had carried out airstrikes targeting the camp.

Addressing reporters in Chennai, Army Chief said that the reactivation of the terror camp highlights the fact that the action taken by the IAF was effective and now they are getting their people back there.

On the question of the clampdown in Valley since August 5 and restrictions on communications in the region, General Rawat said, "There is a communication breakdown between terrorists in the Kashmir Valley and their handlers in Pakistan but there is no communication breakdown between people to people."

Asserting that the spike in the ceasefire violations in the recent days was owing to Pakistan's bid to push terrorists into the Indian territory, the Army Chief said that troops know how to deal with ceasefire violations.

"Pakistan violates ceasefire to push terrorists into our territory. We know how to deal with ceasefire violations. Our troops know how to position themselves and take action. We are alert and will ensure that maximum infiltration bids are foiled," Rawat said.
