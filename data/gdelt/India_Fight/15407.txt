Ahmedabad: NRI loses battle for custody of love child to ex-girlfriend

AHMEDABAD: UK-based NRI Nilesh Patel suffered a big setback as he lost the battle for custody of his love child to his ex-girlfriend , who returned to India to her husband and engaged herself in a decade-long legal battle for the child’s custody.The Gujarat high court not only upheld a Valsad court’s decision that the 11-year-old girl would stay with her mother, but also cancelled the biological father’s visitation rights. Now, Patel won’t be able to spend vacations with his daughter anymore.In 2011, the Valsad court had granted Patel visitation rights while denying him permanent custody.The main reason for the high court to cancel visitation rights was that the child complained before the court that her father kept inquiring with her school authorities about whether she had attained menarche The high court said that it would not be proper for the child to spend vacations with a woman who is living with her father in Britain and who is not her mother.The high court also took into consideration the way the child’s stepfather and his family accepted her as their own. She told the court that she is happy with the family in India.The girl’s mother had matrimonial discord when she went to Britain. She fell in love with Patel and they lived together.A daughter was born to them in July 2008. A year later, differences arose between them, and the woman returned India with the child. Her husband and in-laws accepted her back with the child.On her return to India, the woman filed a suit in a Valsad court for permanent custody of the child. When Patel came to know about this, he also demanded the child’s custody, but the court granted him visitation rights only.Patel approached the high court questioning the lower court’s order and asserted his claim to custody as the biological father. The woman also filed an appeal in the high court against visitation rights granted to her ex-boyfriend.Before the HC, Patel claimed that the custody suit should be governed by international law as the child holds a British passport.The HC, however, reminded him of his and the woman’s consent agreement placed before the Royal Courts of Justice at London, the High Court of Justice, Family Division that Indian courts would have exclusive jurisdiction to determine matters relating to child’s welfare.The HC has also ordered Patel to return his daughter’s passport to her mother so that she could initiate the renewal process.
