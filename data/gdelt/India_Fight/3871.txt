Delhi air pollution today: AQI touches 'very poor' range, to deteriorate further in absence of rain

The wind speed has reduced to 3.6 kmph which is unfavourable for dispersion of prominent pollutants.

New Delhi: The overall air quality in the national capital slipped into the 'very poor' category on Thursday as expected. According to the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting And Research (SAFAR), the air quality index (AQI) was recorded at 319 on Thursday morning. The deterioration of air quality is a typical pre-shower winter impact.

The wind speed has also reduced to 3.6 kmph which is unfavourable for dispersion of prominent pollutants. SAFAR predicted that rain may occur due to westerly disturbances related to moisture saturation. Light shower may improve the AQI to 'moderate' range after which the AQI would fluctuate between 'moderate' and 'poor' categories for a couple of days. However, if there is no rain, which is more probable, the AQI would increase in magnitude to touch the upper end of the 'very poor' category.
