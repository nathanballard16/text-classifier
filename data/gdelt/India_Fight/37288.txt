Criminal hurt in gunfight, 28th Ghaziabad encounter in month

A wanted criminal was injured in an exchange of fire, the 28th such encounter in the district in the past 30 days, police said Friday.

Twenty-eight encounters with alleged criminals have taken place since a new Senior Superintendent of Police took charge of the district a month back, according to police.

"The goons will end up behind the bars or where they should be," SSP Sudhir Kumar Singh when asked about the encounters.

In the 28 encounters, one man was killed and 27 others sustained bullet injuries, according to police records.

The latest incident took place in the Niwari police station area on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday near Didouli-Firozpur intersection, police said.

Two motorcycle-borne men were signalled to stop during routine checking. But they opened fire at the policemen and sped away, they said.

The policemen retaliated and in the retaliatory firing one man received a bullet shot injury in his right leg, police said.

He was identified as Rashid, a native of Patla town, they said.

He was rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment, they added.

However, Rashid's accomplice managed to escape, police said.

Rashid was a wanted criminal and he has been booked under the Gangster Act, they said.

A country-made pistol, two live and two used cartridges were recovered from him, police said, adding the motorcycle was also seized.
