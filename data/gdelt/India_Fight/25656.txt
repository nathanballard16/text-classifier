Is Ravi Prakash Holed Up In Vijayawada?

Hyderabad: Former TV9 CEO Ravi Prakash sought ten days to appear before the Cybercrime authorities of Telangana police. Ravi Prakash, who is wanted in a forgery, diversion of funds and data theft case by the Cybercrime division of the Cyberabad police, sent an email to the police officials seeking ten more days owing to personal reasons. Curiously, co-accused in the case, Telugu actor Sivaji also sought more time to appear before the police on grounds of ill-health.

However, the police, it is learnt,are not convinced about the excuses being peddled by the duo. It may be recalled that the new management of TV9, Alanda Media Ltd., had lodged a complaint against Ravi Prakash following which the cops filed a case of forgery and cheating against former TV9 CEO.

The Cyberabad police have already served two notices on Ravi Prakash, to which he has not responded. A lunch petition motion seeking bail, filed by him was struck down by the Telangana High Court on Wednesday. The court observed that there was no urgency in the matter.

Cyberabad police reportedly suspect that both Ravi Prakash and Sivaji are hiding in Vijayawada and are planning to arrest them.
