India, Pakistan troops exchange fire on Kashmir LoC: Indian military

SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, March 16 (Xinhua) -- Troops of India and Pakistan Saturday exchanged heavy fire and targeted each other's positions on Line of Control (LoC) dividing Kashmir, Indian military said.

The two sides exchanged fire in frontier Poonch district, about 180 km southwest of Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir, a defense ministry spokesperson said.

The exchange went on for sometime but so far no loss of life was reported in the skirmishes on either side.

For the past around two weeks there has been a flare up on LoC in Kashmir. Both Indian as well as Pakistan controlled parts have suffered civilian as well as troop casualties during the skirmishes.

The daily firings have forced population on both sides of the divide to migrate to safer locations.

The latest tension between New Delhi and Islamabad grew after India carried out an air strike inside Pakistan, triggering a retaliation. Though the situation has de-escalated to some extent following calls of restraint from several countries, the situation on LoC remains yet to show desired results.
