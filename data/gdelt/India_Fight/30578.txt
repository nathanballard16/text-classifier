Srinagar, June 17

The advisers to Governor Satya Pal Malik, Vijay Kumar and Kewal Kumar Sharma, and senior state police officials paid tributes to SHO Arshad Khan during a wreath-laying ceremony organised at the Police Lines here on Monday.

Khan was critically injured in a militant attack in Anantnag district earlier this week. However, he died at AIIMS, New Delhi, on Sunday. Khan had joined the state police as a sub-inspector in 2002. He is survived by his parents, wife and two sons aged two and five.

A teary-eyed Haseeb Mughal, SSP (Srinagar), was seen carrying martyr Arshad Khan’s son while paying tributes to his colleague.

DGP Dilbag Singh, ADGPs Munir Khan and Abdul Gani Mir and Divisional Commissioner Kashmir Baseer Khan were also present.

The adviser to the Governor, Vijay Kumar, said the officer had shown exemplary bravery by rushing to the spot of the attack to rescue CRPF men who had come under firing by the militants.

“The J&K Police and all of the security forces have made enormous sacrifices. More than 1,600 SPOs (special police officers) and policemen of the J&K Police have sacrificed their lives for peace and tranquility. So, we will be at it with all resolve,” he said. — TNS
