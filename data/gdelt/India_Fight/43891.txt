Sidharth Malhotra meets with an accident while shooting for Shershaah

Sidharth Malhotra has been grabbing a lot of headlines with his much-awaited next Shershaah. It was not too long ago when the actor left for Kargil to commence the shoot of the film. Starring Kiara Advani as the female lead, the film is being helmed by Vishnu Varadhan. Meanwhile, the latest we hear a shocking incident took place on the sets of Shershaah.





According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Sidharth was riding a bike on the hilly terrain while shooting for the film on Saturday. Mirror was quoted saying, “After the shoot, Sid and Shiv (Pandit, co-star) had ventured out for a ride when Shiv lost his balance and slipped off his bike. Sid, who was right behind him, had to apply brakes due to which his bike skidded, resulting in hand and leg injuries.”

Talking about the film, Sidharth said in a statement, "It is a completely new experience because not many films have been shot here. We have explored virgin locations as we want to be extremely authentic when it comes to the war. We have shot in mountains similar to the ones where the battles were fought. The rocks were extremely sharp, and they can’t be controlled. So, there were safety concerns while we filmed action sequences and the team did everything to ensure we were comfortable."

Shershaah is based on the true story of Kargil war hero Vikram Batra.
