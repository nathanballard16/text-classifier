ALLAHABAD: A 56-year-old man, living at Preetan Nagar locality of the city, first shot his live-in relationship partner with a country-made pistol and later shot himself. The deceased was working as a principal in a private degree college in the neighbouring district of Kaushambi in UP.According to inspector, Dhoomanganj, Jay Prakash Sharma, Pramod Chaudhary was a principal at Lal Bahadur Shashtri Inter College, Chail and used to live with his family in EWS (Economically weaker section) Colony of Preetam Nagar. Members of his family included his live-in partner Rakhi (32) and three kids from his first wife. These included 18-year-old twins, Chotu and Bakku, and a 22-year-old daughter Goldy.“The younger brother of Pramod Chaudhary told us he had fixed the marriage of his daughter Goldy, but Rakhi was adamant that he should first marry her and later go for making arrangements for his daughter,” said the cop.
