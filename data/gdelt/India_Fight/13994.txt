Stop youth from going on path of militancy: Lt Gen KJS Dhillon urges Kashmiri mothers

Srinagar (Jammu and Kashmir): Indian Army Lieutenant General Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillon on Friday made an appeal to mothers residing in Jammu and Kashmir to prevent their children from entering the paths of militancy and terrorism.

He also assured them that the Indian Army will ensure the return to the mainstream of those who had gone astray by joining the militants and wanted to return

.”I appeal to the mothers of those who have taken the path of violence, to ensure they do not join militancy or terrorism. If they have joined militant ranks and want to return, we will ensure they return to the mainstream,” said Dhillon in his address to a passing out parade of Jammu and Kashmir light infantry where 152 youth of the state joined the Indian Army.

This statement from the General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the Srinagar-based 15 Corps, came after a (Central Reserve Police Force) CRPF convoy, moving from Jammu to Srinagar, was attacked by a suicide bomber in Pulwama’s Lethpora area on the national highway on February 14.

India carried out the air strike 12 days after the Jaish terror attack in Pulwama in which 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives. JeM had claimed the responsibility of the attack.
