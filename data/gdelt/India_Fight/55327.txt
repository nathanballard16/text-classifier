Bangladesh protests attack on AHC convoy in Guwahati

Bangladesh has protested an attack on the convoy of the Assistant High Commissioner in Guwahati, Assam, and vandalization of signposts, and asked extra security for its Mission.

Acting Foreign Secretary Kamrul Ahsan held a meeting with Indian High Commissioner to Bangladesh Riva Ganguly Das at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Thursday evening and requested the protection of personnel and property of the Mission by the host government.

It has come to the attention of the ministry that some people from the processions and agitations taking place throughout Thursday in Guwahati torn down two signposts of the Mission approximately 30 yards away from the chancery premise.

On Wednesday, the security vehicle escorting the Assistant High Commissioner from the airport to the city was attacked by mobs protesting adoption of the Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 by the Indian Parliament.

The appropriate Indian authorities have already taken enhanced security measures to protect the Assistant High Commission premises, its personnel and members of their families, said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs here.

The government of Bangladesh believes that the attack on the convoy of the Assistant High Commissioner and vandalization of the signposts is a one-off incident and it will not affect the excellent bilateral relations that Bangladesh and India enjoy.
