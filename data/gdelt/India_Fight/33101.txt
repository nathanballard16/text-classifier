Relatives see murder angle in man’s death

Tirupur: Relatives of a 25-year-old man, who was found dead in his house at Madheswara Nagar in Palladam on Monday, said he would have been murdered by the family members of his lover. Police had earlier concluded it as a case of suicide.

A school dropout, R Dinesh Kumar was found dead with frothing at the mouth in his house on Monday evening. According to a police officer, Dinesh was in a relationship with a minor girl, who was his neighbour. “Though the girl was in good terms with him, he was frustrated as she was not spending much time with him.”

The 17-year-old girl was studying in a college, while Dinesh was a daily wager. “On Monday evening, he threatened to commit suicide if she didn’t talk to him freely and spend more time with him. He also locked her up in a room in his house, but her family rescued her. Following this, he consumed poison and died,” the officer said.

Dinesh’s relatives, however, said he could been attacked to death by the family members of his lover. They received the body only on Wednesday after the Palladam police registered a case following their protest.
