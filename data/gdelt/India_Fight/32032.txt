Man kills wife, attempts suicide in Saiyedpura

The couple with their kids in happier times

SURAT: A 38-year-old woman, who was an active Congress worker, was found dead while her husband was lying unconscious beside her body at their house in Manohar Complex in Saiyedpura on Wednesday.

The woman Lipa Ali and her husband Saheb (42) were natives of West Bengal and were living in the city for the past few years. Lipa had severe stabbing wounds in the neck and she was lying in the pool of blood. Saheb was shifted to Surat Municipal Institute of Medical Education and Research (SMIMER).

Lalgate police started investigation in the case registering an FIR.

Saheb is suspected to have consumed pesticide after killing her. The couple has two sons Sagar, 17, and Ibrahim, 14.

On Wednesday, when Sagar returned home at around 5.30 pm with his friend, no one opened the door despite repeated knocking. He called the neighbours for help and they broke open the door only to find his parents on the floor.

When checked, the woman was already dead, while the man was unconscious. “It seems that the man attacked his wife using some sharp tool and killed her. Later he consumed some poisonous substance to end his life,” said a police officer.

Saheb sold rat killers and his wife was an active Congress worker. The couple often fought and had serious differences, preliminary police investigation revealed. Police suspect that the Saheb may have doubted his wife of having extra marital affair.

A few months ago, Lipa Ali was slapped on the public road by a constable of Lalgate police station. The incident was captured in a video which later went viral following which the cop was suspended.
