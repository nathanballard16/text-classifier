Lift curbs on scribes’ entry into finance ministry: Media bodies to govt

NEW DELHI: The Editors Guild of India, Press Club of India, Indian Women Press Corps and Press Association have asked the government to lift restrictions on the entry of journalists into the finance ministry.“The Editors Guild of India condemns the union finance ministry’s arbitrary decision to deny even government-accredited journalists’ access to its office in North Block. This order is a gag on media freedom and can result in even a further fall in India’s fall in global press freedom rankings, especially as the contagion can spread to other ministries as well,” it said in a statement issued in the wake of resentment among journalists over the decision of the finance ministry to curb the entry of even journalists accredited by Press Information Bureau (PIB).For years, journalists accredited by the PIB have been allowed access to almost all ministries, except in the 30 day period, the so-called quarantine in the finance ministry, leading up to the budget where its offices in the North Block are rendered off-limits for reporters. Unlike in the previous years, the ministry chose not to lift the quarantine after the presentation of Union Budget on Friday.Reporters who turned up on Monday at North Block were denied entry. On Tuesday, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman ’s office took to Twitter to announce that from now on, PIB-accredited journalists could not enter finance ministry’s offices if they had not taken prior appointment with officers concerned. The finance minister’s office justified the new arrangement saying it was meant for “streamlining and facilitating” the entry of media persons.However, the journalist fraternity is not convinced and participants at an impromptu meet were unanimous that the new rules would hinder news gathering. The restrictions will confine media persons to a hastily improvised waiting area near the main entrance of the finance ministry.Other journalists’ bodies also joined the protest.“The decision of the ministry is not only arbitrary but also hampers the freedom of press. News and information gathering is the fundamental duty of a journalist and the decision of the ministry to restrict journalists from accessing information totally goes against it and this means that the journalists are being prevented from doing their fundamental as well as professional duty,” the Press Club, IWPC and Press Association said in a joint statement.“Journalists do not go to government offices to enjoy the comforts and hospitality of visitors’ rooms designated for them. They go to perform their challenging job of news gathering,” the Editors Guild said.
