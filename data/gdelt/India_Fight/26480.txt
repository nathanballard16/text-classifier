New Delhi: The "terror factory," quiet since the Indian Air Force strike on the Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp in Balakot on February 26, is again reopening, top intelligence sources said. Documents accessed by TIMES NOW show groups of terrorists again beginning to concentrate on the Line of Control, infiltration on their agenda.

* Ten terrorists have been at Kel, close to the 32 Infantry Brigade of the Pakistan Army, since April 25 and may attempt to infiltrate during the Ramzan period. They are a "mixed" group, affiliated to several terrorist organisations.

* One group came close to the Line of Control on April 23 but the security forces were alert and they returned to Launch Pad (LP) Sonard. From intercepts, it is clear they may try again and enter via Naushera Nar, Chongali and Chhardji into Bandipora.

* Another "mixed" group of seven terrorists is at Lossar II, a Pakistan Army border post, and are likely to infiltrate through Jawahar Top, Govind, Hajibul Forest, Jatkuashi Nala and Viji Gali to Athwatoo.

* A group of four Lashkar-e-Toiba terrorists are at Bokhragalli launch pad. They are likely to infiltrate through Lachipura, Babagali and Nagadori into Rafiabad. They have an alternative infiltration plan. They could go through Bani Bahik, Jambur Pattan, Chhulan and Brijhama to Vijitop.

* Ten Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists are at Kharameru launch pad. They may enter through Kazinag and then, Patani Nar, Bada Nawa, Rangwar and Chaka Path into Manabal. Or, they make take another route. After Kazinag, they may go tho Kala Pahar, Ghoretal and then, Lacchipura.

* Another group of seven Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists are at Launch Pad Tejian. They are expected to enter through Gulab Nala, Kamkeri and Rangat Gali into Lolab.

"Mujahids," as the intelligence report calls them, have also been spotted not just across the Line of Control, but also across the international border in the Jaisalmer area. The report said that Pakistani troops on the border since the Pulwama terror attack on February 14, have moved back, leaving behind a large quantity of ammunition in the posts of the Pakistani Rangers where Mujahids are still present.

Similar examples of withdrawals have been seen on April 29, when a Pakistan Army artillery unit of the 14 Infantry Division was spotted at Haroonabad, with 105mm guns, moving towards Bhawalnagar. On the other hand, Pakistani Army troops are still deployed in the 'Gabbar' sector opposite Jaisalmer. But there are signs that they are thinning out.

From the reports, it is clear that the Pakistani establishment is continuing to help the terrorists, contrary to the belief that there have been some controls imposed by the Imran Khan government after Maulana Masood Azhar was declared a terrorist by the UN Security Council. And also, at a tactical level, they are working with the Pakistan Army and Rangers.
