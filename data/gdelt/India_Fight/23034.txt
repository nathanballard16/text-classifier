Twitter still hasn't calmed down about Moon Moon Sen's 'bed tea'

Violence marred the first few hours of polling in West Bengal, where the fourth phase of elections is underway in eight Lok Sabha constituencies. According to senior election official, clashes broke out between the supporters of rival parties in Nanoor, Rampurhat, Nalhati and Siuri areas of Birbhum seat, injuring several people on the two sides. In Dubrajpur area of the constituency, voters allegedly engaged in a scuffle with the central forces when they were barred from entering the booths with mobile phones. Security personnel reportedly opened fire in the air to control the mob, following which polling was stalled in the booths, the official said. The state election office has also received reports of violence from Jemua and Barabani areas of Bardhaman East constituency, he maintained.

"In Barabani, BJP candidate and central minister Babul Supriyo's vehicle was vandalised allegedly by TMC workers outside a polling station, while in Jemua, voters fled from a polling station after being threatened by miscreants," he told PTI. Reacting, TMC’s Asansol candidate Moon Moon Sen said she was unaware about any violence. She told a news channel: “They gave me my bed tea very late so I woke up very late. What can I say? I really don’t know.”

Soon bed tea became the defining leit motif of our times.
