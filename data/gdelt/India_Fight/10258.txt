“We will surprise you” Pakistan warns India, calls Nuclear authority meeting: report

Islamabad: Hours after India attacked a terrorist camp in Balakot in response to attack in Pulwama terror attack, Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan called a meeting of National Command Authority on Wednesday.

Pakistan vowed to respond “at the time and place of its choosing’ and said will raise the issue at the United Nation and other international forums, though it has denied Indian Air Force had attacked terror camp and cause heavy casualties.

“We will surprise you”, said spokesperson of Pakistan’s Army adding the response would include all areas including “diplomatic, political and military.”

Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said that Pakistan reserves the right to take appropriate action in self-defence after the IAF carried out multiple aerial strikes at terror launch pads at various places in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, destroying control rooms of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and other infrastructure.

Apart from the National Command Authority meet, Pakistan government has also called a joint session of Parliament on Wednesday.

The air strikes by the IAF on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest terror camp in Pakistan on Tuesday was in retaliation to the February 14 attack in Pulwama, Jammu and Kashmir, which had over 40 Indian CRPF troopers dead.
