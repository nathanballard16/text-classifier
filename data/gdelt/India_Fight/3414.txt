In many ways, they are the Real Heroes of the Project."The integrated refinery dedicated by Modi is a modern expansion complex and is expected to transform the Kochi Refinery as the largest PSU refinery in the country with world class standards.It is equipped with the technology to produce cleaner fuel, besides, being able to double the production of LPG and diesel.Petrochemical complex at the BPCL Kochi refinery is a 'Make in India' initiative aimed at reducing dependence on imports.The skill development institute at Ettumanoor in Kottayam district, backed by the Ministry of Petrochemical and Natural Gas, would provide vocational training and enhance employability and entrepreneurship for deserving youth both in oil & gas and other industries.This world class institute was being set up at an eight acre campus allocated by the state government and would have a capacity to skill around 1,000 youths annually in 20 different skills.
