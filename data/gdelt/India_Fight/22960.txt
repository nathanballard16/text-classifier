Mardaani 2 new look: Rani Mukerji suits up, is ready for the fight, see photos

Actor Rani Mukerji is all suited up as a cop as she shoots for Mardaani 2, a sequel to her well-received Mardaani that saw her as a no-nonsense police officer taking on a ring of child traffickers. The latest iteration of the film is being directed by Gopi Puthran – he had written the script of Mardaani -- and will release in 2019.

Gopi had said earlier, “It’s an intense one month long schedule in Rajasthan which forms the backdrop to the story of Mardaani 2. Rani’s investigation will take her to Jaipur and Kota. Given that we are shooting in peak summer of Rajasthan, it will be physically demanding because Rani will be doing action sequences too.”

In an earlier still from Mardaani 2, Rani was wearing a white shirt paired with jeans. According to sources, Rani plays a cop in Mardaani 2. “Shivani will face a cold, merciless villain who has no empathy, no fear of God and is pure evil. The character has been written superbly and I’m excited to find out who the actor will be,” Rani had said.

“Mardaani is and will always remain very close to my heart. Right since its release every has asked me time and again when I would be doing Mardaani 2 and I am sure this announcement will come as a surprise to them. Gopi has written an extraordinary script that we all love and I cannot wait to start shooting the film,” Rani had said when Mardaani 2 was announced in December last year.

Produced by Aditya Chopra, Mardaani 2 will be Rani’s next release after the hit film, Hichki. Reports claim Chunkey Panday’s nephew Ahaan Panday may feature as the antagonist in Mardaani 2.
