Pehlu Khan lynching: Rajasthan files appeal before HC

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan government and the kin of Pehlu Khan filed on Thursday two appeal petitions before the Rajasthan high court against the acquittal of all six accused in the Alwar lynching case On August 14, a trial court in Alwar had acquitted the six people accused of lynching Pehlu Khan while he and a few others were transporting cows from Jaipur. The trial court had given the benefit of the doubt to the accused citing a botched investigation by the Alwar police and the prosecution which failed to furnish key documents in court to prove the charges.Pehlu Khan (55), a dairy farmer from Nuh district of Haryana, his two sons and some others were intercepted and attacked by cow vigilantes near Behror on April 1, 2017. Pehlu succumbed to his injuries on April 4 in a private hospital in Alwar.A chargesheet against the accused — Vipin Yadav, Ravindra Yadav, Kalu Ram Yadav, Dayanand Yadav and Yogesh Kumar — was submitted before the trial court on May 31, 2017.Subsequently, the police also accused Goliya and Bheem Rathi of the crime and presented a supplementary chargesheet against them. A case relating to the same crime was filed against two minors and they are facing trial in a juvenile justice court.The acquittal two months ago had created a hue and cry following which the state government formed an SIT and decided appeal the decision. The government had designated additional advocate general R P Singh as the law officer to pursue the matter before the high court.The SIT was constituted under the supervision of the state’s ADGP (crime). It was to identify lapses in investigation and fix responsibility on individual officers who had conducted the probe. The SIT later pinpointed many serious lapses in the investigation.The 84-page SIT report pointed out loopholes by each of the four investigating officers. It said the first investigating officer visited the spot where Khan was allegedly assaulted only three days after the crime, failed to call the forensic team and didn’t order mechanical examination of the two vehicles in which Khan was transporting the cows. In all, the officer committed 29 mistakes, the report added.The SIT said the second investigating officer overlooked the “shoddy” investigation and failed to “supervise” the investigation properly.The third investigating officer went to the crime spot but did not record the statements of the eyewitnesses, the SIT said. “He made no effort to correct mistakes in investigation by previous IOs (investigating officers),” the report added.The fourth investigating officer cleared six people named by Khan in his dying declaration without “any new or solid evidence”, the SIT added.The SIT said the first charge sheet in the case was filed on June 3, 2017 against the legal opinion of assistant director (prosecution) Vijay Singh, who had allegedly pointed out holes in the investigation.The SIT report said all the six accused should also have been charged under IPC Sections 395 (dacoity), 147 (rioting) and 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), in addition to those dealing with murder, voluntarily causing hurt, wrongful restraint and damage to property.
