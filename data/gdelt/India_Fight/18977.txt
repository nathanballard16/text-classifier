Confirming the matter, Benapole port police station Officer-in-Charge (OC) Abul Bashar said: "They went to India some three years ago in search for better jobs. Delhi Police arrested four of them due to expiration of their visas while Mumbai Police arrested another who failed to produce any valid documents. All of them were sent to jail.

"Later, an NGO called Shanti Sanad freed them and took them to its own shelter centre. After negotiation between home ministries of the two neighbouring countries, they were finally sent home from India."

Earlier on Friday morning, 24 young Bangladeshis, who illegally crossed into India and were detained, were also returned to Bangladesh.
