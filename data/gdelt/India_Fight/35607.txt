We saw fire brigade personnel bringing out some people from a smoke- filled floor," a woman said.Another woman, who also managed to come out of the building, said, "When we came to know of the fire, we searched for the staircase, which had become partially invisible due to heavy smoke.""We had closed the windows and doors of our office. Fire brigade people came and rescued us," she said. There were still six to seven persons on the floor from where she was rescued, she added.A woman, who was rescued using an aerial ladder, was seen shooting the scene around with her mobile phone even as she was being lowered to the ground.Visuals on TV showed smoke billowing from the building and people on the terrace trying to signal those below.The incident comes a day after one person died and two others were injured in a four-storey residential building located behind the iconic Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in south Mumbai.This is latest in a series of fire incidents in the metropolis in the last few years.There have been over 49,000 fire incidents in Mumbai in the last one decade, killing more than 600 people, the Maharashtra government had told the assembly in November 2018.A massive fire in two pubs located in the Kamala Mills Compound here had claimed 14 lives on December 29, 2017.Besides, 12 people were killed in a blaze at a snack shop in Saki Naka-Kurla area on December 18, 2017.
