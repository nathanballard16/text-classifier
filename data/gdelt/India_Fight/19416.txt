MUMBAI: Indrani Mukerjea has written to the CBI that she has been approached by a “co-accused” in the INX media case in an attempt to influence her to not turn approver and depose as a prosecution witness. In the hand-written letter, she added that she was being nudged to retract her statement.A special court here on Monday allowed the CBI’s plea to meet her in Byculla jail, where she is lodged in the Sheena Bora murder case , to verify the allegations.The agency is likely to submit a chargesheet in the case soon.Her estranged husband Peter Mukerjea is also an accused in both the murder and media company cases. The other accused named in the INX media case include Karti Chidambaram , son of former Union minister P Chidambaram, who himself was previously questioned in the case.In February last year, Indrani gave a “confessional statement” before a magistrate in the INX case. Months later, she wanted to turn approver (to depose as a prosecution witness) and sought grant of pardon.
