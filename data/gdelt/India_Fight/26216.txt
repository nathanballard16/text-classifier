Kerala Exit Poll Results: UDF expected to lead the race with 15 seats, NDA may open its account with 1 seat

Times Now VMR poll predicts UDF to win 15 seats out of 20 seats in Kerala Lok Sabha elections

New Delhi: The Congress-led UDF is expected to register a definitive victory in Kerala Lok Sabha elections, the Times Now-VMR exit poll has predicted. The United Democratic Front (Kerala) is likely to post a victory in 15 out of the total 20 seats in Kerala, as per the exit poll. On the other hand, the CPI(M)-led LDF is expected to win four seats in the 2019 general election, four less than what it had won five years ago.

Interestingly, the Bharatiya Janata Party-led NDA is expected to finally open its account, by winning one seat in the state this year. In the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the BJP-led alliance had not been able to win a single seat in Kerala.

In 2014, the UDF had won 12 seats. The Congress-led alliance is likely to register a swing of three seats, according to the Times Now-VMR exit poll. The Left Democratic Front (LDF), meanwhile, had won eight seats in the 2014 general elections. It has registered a negative swing of four seats in this year's national election, according to the exit poll.

Interestingly, even though the UDF is likely to emerge victorious in Kerala with 15 seats, the alliance is expected to garner an upward swing of only 3.92% in the vote share this year. In 2014, the UDF had registered a vote share of 41.98% and in 2019, the alliance is likely to garner 45.9% vote share.

On the other hand, the NDA - led by the BJP - is likely to see a greater upward swing in the vote share, with 12.96%. In 2019 elections, the NDA had gained 23.53% vote share. The Times Now-VMR exit poll projects the NDA to garner 23.53% vote share in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in Kerala.

The LDF, a coalition of Left-leaning parties, could suffer a loss of 13.62% in its vote share in the 2019 elections, the exit poll forecast. The LDF is predicted to garner 26.5% vote share in 2019, as compared to 40.12% vote share that it had gained in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.

The BJP is fighting the Lok Sabha elections in Kerala in alliance with Bharat Dharma Jena Sena (BDJS) and Kerala Congress (PC Thomas). All 20 constituencies of Kerala had gone to polls on April 23, with a total voter turnout recorded at 76.82 per cent.

This election, the candidacy of Congress President Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad in Kerala has also heated the electoral battle in the state, as the seat has traditionally been considered a CPI (M) bastion. Counting of votes for the 2019 Lok Sabha election will take place on May 23.

The Times Now-VMR Exit Poll 2019 was carried out between April 11 and May 19, 2019. The cumulative sample of the exit poll was 40,000 spread across the country.
