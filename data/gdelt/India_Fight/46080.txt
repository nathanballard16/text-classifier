Crown appealing sentences for man convicted of killing two Mac’s store clerks

EDMONTON—The Crown is appealing the sentences imposed on a man found guilty of first-degree murder in the deaths of two Mac’s store clerks in Edmonton.

Colton Steinhauer was sentenced to concurrent life sentences on Sept. 6 with no chance of parole for 25 years for the December 2015 robberies and shootings that occurred at separate locations.

The prosecutor and jury had recommended he serve the terms consecutively.

In its grounds for appeal, the Crown says the sentence is demonstrably unfit.

A date for an appeal hearing has not been set.

One of two co-accused, Laylin Delorme, got two life terms for first-degree murder while a teenager was convicted on two counts of manslaughter.

In its appeal notice, the Crown says the judge failed to properly assess a particular section of the Criminal Code regarding ineligibility for parole in multiple-murder cases.

Steinhauer admitted to shooting Ricky Cenabre at one of the chain’s south-end locations.

He received eight years for the robberies, which are to be served at the same time as the life sentence. He is currently being held at the maximum security Edmonton Institution.

Cenabre and Karanpal Bhangu, both immigrants, were working alone on the night shift when they were robbed, beaten and shot about 20 minutes apart.

Bhangu, who was 35, had moved from India four months before he was killed. Cenabre, who was 41, had come to Canada five years earlier from the Philippines.

Delorme’s sentences are to be served simultaneously. He is appealing his conviction and the Crown is appealing his sentence.
