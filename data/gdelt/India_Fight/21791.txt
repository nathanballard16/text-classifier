Sunny Deol joins the ruling party BJP; Says 'I want PM Modi for the next five years'

Sunny Deol has joined hands with the BJP today after a meeting with the Party President Amit Shah. The actor will likely be the Candidate from Gurdaspur in Punjab. He revealed in his speech saying, "Like my father joined Atal Bihari Vajpayee, I have decided to go with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. I want PM Modi for the next five years." Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman also made a reference to his 1997 film Border while welcoming him to the party.

Nirmala Sitharaman said, "Sunny Deol made the film Border which showed how the feeling of nationalism and patriotism when portrayed beautifully on film can touch a chord with the people." Union Minister Piyush Goyal further added, "It cannot be acting when it comes from the heart." Interestingly the actor's last film Mohalla Assi was shot in PM Modi's Varanasi constituency. His character in the film was shown to be a volunteer for the Ram temple in Ayodhya. When rumors started doing afloat that Sunny Deol will be joining politics, he did not commit to the fact and said, "I heard about the rumours that I am joining politics. I just met him (Amit Shah) and we took a photograph, that's it."
