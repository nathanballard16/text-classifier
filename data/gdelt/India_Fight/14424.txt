SC commutes death sentence to man in rape and murder case of 5-year-old girl

New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday commuted the death sentence of a man held guilty of rape and murder of a five-year-old girl in 2015.

The convict will have to serve 25 years in jail without remission.

The case dates back to 2015 when the child was raped and murdered by the auto rickshaw driver who was a neighbour of her family.

He was convicted on the basis of eyewitness and statement by family members who said he had been asked to drop the child to school.

The Supreme Court has commuted the death sentence on the basis of the argument that proper procedure had not been followed by the High Court.
