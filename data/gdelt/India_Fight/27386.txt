Irani’s aide shot dead

Amethi (UP): In the first incident of post-poll violence in Uttar Pradesh, a close aide of newly-elected Amethi MP Smriti Irani was shot dead by two unidentified men, with police not ruling out the possibility of it being a “political murder”.

Surendra Singh (50), a former head of Baraulia village, around 25 km from the Amethi district headquarters, was shot at around 11:30 pm on Saturday.

Singh was referred to a Lucknow hospital, but succumbed during treatment, Additional Superintendent of Police Daya Ram said.

Director General of Police Om Prakash Singh said seven people had been taken into custody and they were being interrogated.

Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has directed the DGP to take effective action and report back to him, a senior official said, adding that the inspector general of Lucknow had been sent for monitoring the situation.

Irani, who was in Delhi, flew to Lucknow en route to Amethi, where she met Surendra Singh’s family and consoled them. (PTI)
