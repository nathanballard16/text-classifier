Shah says BJP won't spare '84 riots culprits; slams Amarinder, Sidhu - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

PATHANKOT: Crediting Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “ensuring justice” to the families of the 1984 anti-Sikh riot victims, BJP chief Amit Shah on Sunday said the culprits behind the pogrom will not be spared and attacked the Amarinder Singh-led Government in Punjab for “failing” to honour its poll promises.

Addressing a rally in favour of BJP candidate and actor Sunny Deol, contesting from Gurdaspur parliamentary constituency, Shah also attacked Punjab Minister and former BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu for his remarks after Pulwama attack, asking him to shift to Pakistan.

“Thousands of Sikhs were killed in 1984 and nobody was punished ever since. But after Modi Government was formed, justice was delivered to families of the victims,” Shah said.

“Those who were involved (in the riots) and whether they are in Jabalpur, Kanpur or Delhi, they will be sent to jail,” he added.

He said Congress leader Sajjan Kumar, a three-time MP, was imprisoned because of the report prepared by the Special Investigation Team, formed by Modi, who probed the riots.

“So far, just one (Kumar) has been jailed but there is a long list. The BJP Government will never spare those who committed this sin,” he said. (AGENCIES)
