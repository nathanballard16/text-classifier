Diplomatic victory over Pakistan, terror

The leader of the organisation that carried out the Pulwama attack has finally been designated a global terrorist. This is a major diplomatic victory for India and a setback for Pakistan. True, the official listing of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar in the list of sanctioned terrorists does not contain any direct reference to the Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian security personnel. However, in the UN resolution that condemned the Pulwama attack, JeM was identified as the perpetrator.

The listing of Azhar as a terrorist linked to al-Qaeda mentions his status as the JeM leader. This establishes the link between Pulwama and the UN sanction against Azhar, whether Pakistan likes it or not. Pakistan certainly will not relish China’s failure, this time around, to play the allweather friend that invariably comes to its aid. Even after repeated moves by the US, Britain and France at the UN to designate Azhar as a global terrorist, China had withheld consent, putting the move on technical hold. After sustained diplomatic pressure, Beijing decided to withdraw its reservation.

This brings a 10-year-old diplomatic quest to fruition. However, what this means in practice is something else. There are 20-odd Pakistani citizens on that sanctions list, including Hafiz Saeed, who masterminded the Mumbai attack of 2008. Being sanctioned by the UN has not particularly crimped their style in Pakistan, because of the Pakistani army’s use of non-State actors for strategic depth.

It is to be hoped that Pakistan will act against Azhar beyond the asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo the listing calls for. The US has called upon Pakistan to take further action. In any case, India has to be vigilant against further attempts by non-State actors from Pakistan to attack targets in India.
