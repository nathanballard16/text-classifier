India elections: PM Modi emerges victorious, Rahul Gandhi concedes defeat

NEW DELHI - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi clinched a second term on Thursday (May 23) with what appears to be a historic landslide in the country's general elections as votes were counted in the biggest democratic exercise in the world.

The National Democratic Alliance (NDA), led by Mr Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), was ahead in 345 seats, with the opposition United Progressive Alliance winning in 89, at 2pm (4.30pm Singapore time) on Thursday, about six hours after the counting of about 600 million votes began.

The BJP party extended its lead in more than 298 seats, easily ahead of the 272 seats needed to form a government. The Congress is ahead in 52 seats.

"India wins yet again," Mr Modi said in a tweet. "Together we grow. Together we prosper. Together we will build a strong India."

Mr Modi's challenger, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, conceded defeat at a press conference.

"Frankly, today is the not the day to discuss what I think went wrong because people of India have clearly decided that Narendra Modi is going to be their Prime Minister and as an Indian I respect that," said Mr Gandhi.

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has written to Mr Modi to congratulate him on his re-election. Chinese President Xi Jinping was also among the world leaders to congratulate Mr Modi on his victory, as was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan also extended his congratulations.
