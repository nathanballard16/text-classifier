Bhima-Koregaon case: Activist Anand Teltumbde arrested in Mumbai

Pune Police arrested human rights activist and Elgar Parishad case accused Anand Teltumbde from domestic airport in Mumbai at dawn on Saturday. He will be produced in Pune District Court at 2 pm today.

He is currently in Lashkar Police Station in Pune.

In August last year, Pune Police had raided Teltumbde's house in a multi-city operation in which houses of six other prominent activists were raided. P Varavara Rao, Vernon Gonzalves and Arun Pereira, whose houses were raided during the operation, are in custody already.

On January 30, the police had opposed Teltumbde's plea for an anticipatory bail saying that it was, "necessary to allow sufficient opportunity to the investigating agency to collect the evidence". A custodial interrogation had been sought by the police.

Teltumbde's bail plea was subsequently rejected.

Earlier on January 14, the Supreme Court refused to quash Pune Police's FIR against Teltumbde for his alleged role in the Elgar Parishad-Bhima Koregaon violence. The apex court then refused to interfere in the case.

Pune Police say that "inflammatory speeches" made at Elgar Parishad held on December 31, 2017 at Shaniwarwada in Pune led to violence at Bhima-Koregaon the next day. Police say that Maoists were behind the Elgar Parishad. Anand Teltumbde faces charges in relation to these cases along with other prominent activists, all of whom have been dubbed "urban naxals".

Anand Teltumbde is the brother of Milind Teltumbde who is one of the 22 accused named in the Elgar Parishad case. 10 out of the 22 have been arrested till date. Milind Teltumbde has many cases pending against him for his alleged connection with Naxal Movement.

Teltumbde's lawyer advocate Rohan Nahar alleged that the arrest is illegal. Nahar said that the police arrested Teltumbde before he could approach High Court for relief.
