4.5 million new voters in UP

A total of 4.5 million new voters have been added in the electoral rolls of Uttar Pradesh, taking the total voters strength in the state to 144 million.

The final publication of the electoral rolls would be made on Friday with an increase in number of voters from 141.9 million to 144 million, UP Chief Electoral Officer L Venkateshwarlu disclosed here on Thursday.

He said 1.2 million voters had been registered for the first time after they attained the age of 18 years and would be eligible to vote in the coming Lok Sabha polls.

The Election Commission of India has taken up a massive voter revision programme for the past three months.

The Chief Electoral Officer said that the names of 2.3 million voters had been struck down as they had either died or had voting rights at two places.

Venkateshwarlu said eligible voters whose name were still missing in the electoral roll could register their names online for becoming a voter till the last date of nominations during the election process.

He said the Lok Sabha polls would be held entirely with Voter verifiable paper audit trail (VVPAT) system and a meeting with the representatives of political parties had been held to make them aware of the functioning of the VVPAT attached to electronic voting machines (EVMs).

He denied any possibility of tampering with the EVM or VVPAT machines as they crossed through four transparent checks in front of the representatives of political parties.
