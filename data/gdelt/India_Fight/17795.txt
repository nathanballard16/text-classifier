UPA leaders have made corruption their cause, says Arun Jaitley in his blog

Union Minister Arun Jaitley on Saturday trained his guns at UPA leaders and accused them of making corruption a cause to fight for instead of trying to weed it out.

Jaitley levelled allegation in relation to raids carried out by the Income Tax officials in Karnataka.

Jaitley rubbished Janata Dal (Secular) and Congress' claims of I-T raids being politically motivated and said that a press release from the Income Tax Department clarified the matter and destroyed Congress-JD(S) claims.

"The search was not against political leaders or even political workers it was only against Contractor and Engineers of Public Works Department of the state," said Jaitley in his blog.

India Today had reported about I-T department's clarification on March 28.

"The Department's investigation wing carried out searches on professionals and businesses, including bureaucrats, breweries, multinational companies, mining barons, diagnostic centres, trusts, educational institutions, medical colleges, real estate, fisheries, film industry and politically exposed persons," said BR Balakrishnan, I-T Director-General for Karnataka and Goa. He had released a statement.

Jaitley continued his attack on Karnataka Government and seemed to suggest that state governments are misinterpreting federalism.

"The Rights of the Union are equally important. Security of India, sovereignty, dealing with terrorism, managing the borders, Custom Check Points, Income Tax enforcement are all amongst the several Constitutional powers of the Union. If the States stand in way of any of them it is guilty of breaching federal norms," said Jaitley in his blog.

Eyebrows were raised everywhere when CRPF jawans were called to provide security to I-T officials conducting raids.

Arun Jaitley supported this decision as well. He alleged that if I-T department informs state police, they tip-off the culprits.
