New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the Madras High Court order of conviction of life term to Saravana Bhavan owner, P Rajagopal, for murdering one of his employees in 2001.

The owner of Saravana Bhavan, who was out on bail granted by the Supreme Court in 2009, has to surrender by July 7.

Rajagopal had challenged the Madras High Court verdict, sentencing him to life for murdering Santhakumar. The prosecution had argued that the motive behind the murder was that the Saravana Bhavan owner wanted to marry the employee's wife, Jeevajothi as his third wife and plotted the murder.

Santhakumar was murdered and buried at Perumalmalai in the Kodaikanal forests.

Saravana Bhavan, a well-known restaurant chain, has its outlets in 20 countries including the US, the UK, France and Australia. There are 25 restaurants in India including in Delhi.
