New Delhi: A Noida-based journalist was shot at by a group of unidentified assailants in East Delhi’s Ashok Nagar at around 12:30 am on Sunday.

A case for attempt to murder has been registered at the New Ashok Nagar police station. According to NDTV, senior police officer Jasmeet Singh said, “She has received bullet injuries in her arm. She is out of danger. Prima facie it appears to be a case of family dispute.”

Previously, in 2008, a 26-year-old journalist, Soumya Viswanathan was shot dead in south Delhi’s Vasant Kunj. Freelance journalist, Aparna Kalra was attacked by an unidentified person in April 2017.
