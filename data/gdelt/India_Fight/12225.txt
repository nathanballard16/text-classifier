West Bengal: BJP workers clash with police during bike rally

In an attempt to kick-off the campaign in the run up to Lok Sabha elections, BJP held massive bike rallies in all 42 Parliamentary Constituencies of West Bengal. Lakhs of BJP supporters held multiple "Vijay Sankalp Bike Rally" in Kolkata and every district of the state.

There was lathicharge on supporters in districts like Malda, Murshidabad, where they were not given permission to hold rallies and hundreds were detained by the police authorities.

BJP Mahila Morcha President Locket Chatterjee alleged that permission for bike rallies were denied as Mamata Banerjee was scared of losing upcoming elections.

"PM Narendra Modi supported Indian Army at the time of Pulwama terror attack. But Mamata Banerjee always says positive things about Pakistan. In upcoming elections, Trinamool Congress will be able to win just 12 out of 42 seats," said Chatterjee.

There were massive traffic jams in Kolkata due to the rallies.

In areas like Howrah, Strand Road, Jadavpur, North Kolkata and Central Avenue BJP workers held traffic for many hours.

Sayantan Basu, General Secreatary State General Secretary, was leading the protests. He and many other BJP leaders in the state were detained by the police.

Basu claimed that BJP workers were celebrating Abhinandan Varthaman's return to India and police stopped them unnecessarily.

"Our boys did not break any traffic rules. They were wearing helmets," said Basu.

Union Minister Babul Supriyo was leading the morcha in Asansol. There was a clash between police officers and BJP workers near Aamdiha.

Police resorted to lathicharge. BJP supporters were clearly heard asking others to attack the police.

Santanu Adhikari, Officer In-Charge of Asansol North Police Station was attacked by the protesters. Several BJP workers have been arrested.
