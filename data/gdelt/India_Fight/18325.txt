Biker dies as Chinese manjha slits his throat

New Delhi, April 3 : A teenager riding his bike lost his life after he came in contact with a Chinese 'manjha' (thread used for flying kites) that slit his throat in north Delhi, police said on Tuesday.

The incident occurred on Monday noon when the victim, identified as Ravi, was on his bike going to take cooler grass wood from a market at Nirankari Colony.

"When Ravi reached at GTB nagar area, he came in contact with Chinese manjha and collapsed on the bike. His throat was found deeply cut. He was taken to a hospital where he was declared brought dead," a senior police officer said.

"We have registered a case against unknown persons and are investigating," he added.

Ravi was a resident of Yograj Colony and worked in a factory.

The Chinese manja was banned by Delhi government two years ago after many riders suffered critical injuries and a few of them died in national capital.
