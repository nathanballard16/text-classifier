Hubby Nick Jonas to join Priyanka Chopra in Andamans

Mumbai: Nick Jonas is expected to join Priyanka Chopra in the exotic islands of Andaman and Nicobar when the actress goes there in February to shoot for her film The Sky Is Pink.

Reportedly, there were a few issues initially as Nick is an American citizen and there are certain islands which come under the Restricted Area Permit (RAP) where foreigners are not allowed.

“There was a bit of tension as American national John Allen Chau was killed by the local Sentinelese tribe there last year. But, the local administration that had lifted the RAP for a few islands there are keen to promote the Union Territory for tourism. They have allowed the shoot to happen and for foreigners to visit the island. There are other crew members as well who are not Indian,” says a source.

The last time a Bollywood film was shot in Andaman and Nicobar Islands was the Kaalapani (1996), a bilingual film starring Mohanlal, Prabhu Ganesan, Tabu and Amrish Puri. Shonali Bose’s The Sky Is Pink starring Priyanka Chopra, Farhan Akhtar and Zaira Wasim will be first full-fledged Bollywood film being shot in the protected islands in the Union Territory.

“A major portion of the film has already been done in London, New Delhi and Mumbai. In a few days from now, Priyanka will be flying off to the islands for the shoot,” says a trade source. The patchwork of the film will later be completed in Mumbai.
