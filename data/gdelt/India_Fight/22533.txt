The Indian Air Force (IAF) is planning to test fire the air-launched version of the BrahMos supersonic cruise missile in next few days, following which India would enable it to carry out Balakot-like airstrikes using made in India weapons.

The BrahMos test is planned in next few days from a Sukhoi aircraft, prepared by the HAL for flying with and launching the highly capable missile, IAF sources said.

IAF has plans of having 40 Su-30MKIs fitted with the BrahMos missiles which can carry out long range standoff strikes against enemy targets.

The missiles have also been made lighter for being carried on the fighter plane.

Once successfully integrated, the BrahMos would be a game changer for the country's air combat capability due to the strike range and lethality of the missile.

The retrofitting of the aircraft is expected to be completed by 2020, Indian Air Force (IAF) sources revealed. "It is a very important project considering IAF's evolving requirement to boost air power when the possibility of a two-front war cannot be ruled out," an Indian government official said.

Up until now, only two IAF Su-30 MKI fighters have been converted to fire the new 2.5-ton supersonic air-to-surface cruise missile. Due to the size and weight of the BrahMos-A, each Su-30 MKI can only carry one missile in a transport launch canister.

The IAF test fired a BrahMos-A from a Su-30 MKI in November successfully destroying a naval target. The IAF has conducted several tests of the BrahMos-A in 2016 and 2017.

Modifications in order for the Su-30 MKI to carry and launch the BrahMos-A include reinforcing the aircraft's undercarriage in addition to various mechanical, electrical and software upgrades.
