NEW DELHI, Feb. 8 (Xinhua) -- At least 20 people were killed and many others taken ill Friday due to consumption of spurious liquor in two northern Indian states of Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh, officials said.

The liquor was consumed by people in Haridwar district of Uttarakhand and adjacent Saharanpur district of Uttar Pradesh.

"So far 14 people were killed after the consumption of illicit liquor here and many people have been hospitalized," Nikita Khandelwal, joint magistrate of Rorkee in Haridwar told Xinhua over telephone.

The local government Uttarakhand has ordered suspension of 13 officers and four policemen associated with excise department.

Meanwhile, in Uttar Pradesh's Saharanpur, six deaths related to consumption of illicit liquor have taken place.

"Six people have died so far in the tragedy and many others are undergoing treatment," a senior official said.

Reports said the victims have purchased the liquor from a common shop. The death toll is likely to increase in wake of the critical condition of people undergoing treatment in hospitals.
