Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir: The father of the slain Army soldier Aurangzeb, who was martyred last year while fighting militants in the Kashmir valley is set to join the BJP. Aurangzeb was awarded the Shaurya Chakra posthumously for his bravery. His father attended Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rally in Jammu & Kashmir’s Vijaypur on Sunday, as per an Indian Express report.

Aurangzeb’s father Haneef along with some other locales left Poonch district in Jammu for Modi’s rally. Haneef said he was inspired by PM Modi’s for his determination to help the poor, said the report.

The slain soldier was abducted by militants in was abducted from Kalampora in Pulwama last year which he was on his way to home for Eid celebrations. His bullet-ridden body was recovered by a police team. He was killed execution style with bullet wounds on neck and head.

His father then said he wanted the army to avenge the killing of his son in the next 32 hours.

Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Army chief General Bipin Rawat also visited Haneef, 56, after Aurangzeb’s death. Haneef belongs to Bakarwal community which is perceived by militants as ‘pro-India’ as the community is known for its cooperation in anti-militancy operations in the troubled state.

Haneef joining the BJP is also a boost for the party has it does not have a prominent face in Rajouri and Poonch districts. However, BJP’s opponents say Haneef’s entry in BJP would be insignificant as all prominent persons of the Bakarwal community are already aligned with the National Conference or PDP.
