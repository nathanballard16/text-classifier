ALLAHABAD: To deal with changing modus operandi of law-breakers, Allahabad range police have initiated steps to compile database of criminals who have been arrested in last five years, especially on charges of loot and dacoity.

Once the database of four districts of Allahabad division -Allahabad, Kaushambi, Fatehpur and Pratapgarh - is collected, cops would be able to exchange information on wanted criminals, especially those who execute crime in one district and take shelter in neighbouring district.

After the Rs 1.63 crore cash van heist, in which the involvement of a Tamil Nadu-based gang is suspected, cops said they would also exchange dossier and database of criminals with the states to which they belong.

DIG (Prayagraj range) KP Singh said, "Cops have been instructed to gather complete details of criminals soon after their arrest and share it with police stations of district\state concerned if the criminal hails from another place."

"By sharing information, we will ensure that the record/criminal background of outlaws is maintained even if he has never committed any crime in his home district," he said.

The DIG said the exercise would help cops enhance surveillance and all information will be available at the click of a mouse.

He also instructed thana cops to upload details and photographs of criminals on Trinetra app.

"Database will be prepared on the basis of incident spot and nature of crime, and the native place of criminal," a senior police officer said, adding the exercise had been launched across the state after acknowledging the fact that criminals have changed their modus operandi.
