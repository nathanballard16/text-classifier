Reddy: Hyderabad a ‘breeding ground of terror’

Union Minister of State for Home G Kishan Reddy has again raked up the issue of “illegal immigrants” in Hyderabad and repeated his allegation that the city was a “breeding round of terrorists”.

Reddy, on a visit to Hyderabad, told the media that he stands by his statement made soon after he became a minister in the Modi cabinet.

A day after taking charge as a minister, he had alleged that illegal immigrants had made Hyderabad and other parts of Telangana their home and Hyderabad was a hub of terrorists.

Reiterating that the National Register of Citizens will be implemented in Hyderabad, he said: “Not only Hyderabad, wherever immigrants were living without permission will be sent back. Centre was committed to identify them and respectfully sending them back to their respective countries.”

BJP has been alleging the presence of hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants, especially from Bangladesh, in Hyderabad and other parts of the country.

On the alleged presence of terrorists in Hyderabad, Reddy said: “I had made these remarks earlier on the basis of National Investigation Agency [NIA] raids being conducted in the city in the past. There were also reports of youth from the city being influenced by [Daesh].”

He rejected the criticism of TRS leaders that the BJP was trying to communalise the situation in the state and promote the Hindutva agenda. On the contrary, he said that the Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had joined hands with the AIMIM and used religion to win the elections. “BJP was going to come to power in the state in 2023,” he said.
