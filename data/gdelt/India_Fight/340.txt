Second Indian spy drone shot down on LoC, Pakistan Army claims

Pakistan's Army claims it has shot down two Indian spy drones, or "quadcopters", along the Line of Control (LoC) since January 1.

The first of the claims was made on New Year's Day. A spokesperson for Pakistan's Armed Forces said a quadcopter had been shot down in Bagh sector. The Indian Army dismissed the claim.

Late at night on January 2, the spokesperson, Major General Asif Ghafoor, said a quadcopter was shot down in Satwal sector.

"Not even a quadcopter will be allowed to cross [the] LoC," Ghafoor said when he made the first claim.

This, on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi revealed what he told soldiers who crossed the LoC in September 2016 to carry out surgical strikes on terrorist launchpads.

"I gave clear orders that whether you get success or failure, don't think about that but come back before sunrise. Don't fall for the lure and prolong it [the operation]," he told ANI.

Modi also spoke about relations between New Delhi and Islamabad. India never opposed dialogue with Pakistan, no matter who -- the UPA or the NDA -- was in power, he said.

Dialogue, the prime minister said, cannot be heard amid the noise of bombs and guns.
