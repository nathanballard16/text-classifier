Jammu and Kashmir: Yet another IED blast in Rajouri sector; Army major martyred

In the wake of the ghastly strike Prime Minister Narendra Modi responded harshly and said this is a "new India" which will not tolerate those who provide guns and bombs to target security personnel. "Apart from the government, as citizens of the country, it is our responsibility to stand by the families of those who sacrificed everything for the country. This is the time for mourning and to show restrain and sensitivity," PM said on Saturday.

In a yet another improvised Explosive Device (IED) explosion that took place in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir, an army official has lost his life, news agency ANI reported. The blast took place along the Line of Control in Naushera region. Reports suggest that the martyred army officer was of Major-rank and was killed while defusing an IED which had been planted by the terrorist. The officer who lost his life while defusing the explosive device belonged from the Corps of Engineers. The IED was planted 1.5 kms inside the LoC in the Naushera sector of Rajouri district in Jammu and Kashmir. This is the second blast that has reported from the Valley this week. Two days ago, on February 14, a massive IED blast in Pulwama district took lives of as many as 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) which triggered massive outrage across the country. Terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) claimed responsibility for the attack. A suicide bomber who was later identified as Adil Ahmad Dar rammed an explosive-laden Scorpio car into one of the buses of CRPF convoy which was on its way to Kashmir. The government of India has condemned the attack and vowed to avenge the attack from the people responsible for it. Massive protests and candlelight marches were held on Friday in different parts of the country against the attack and curfew was imposed in Jammu city following violence during demonstrations there.
