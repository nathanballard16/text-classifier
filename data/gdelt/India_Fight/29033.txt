Besides, a cyclonic circulation extending upto 4.5 km above mean sea level lies over Lakshadweep area and adjoining Southeast Arabian Sea. Under its influence, a low pressure area is very likely to form over Southeast and adjoining Eastcentral Arabian Sea during the next 48 hours. It is very likely to move north-northwestwards and intensify gradually.

The normal monsoon onset over Kerala is June 1.
