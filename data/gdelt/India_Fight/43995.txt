“Sometimes You Want to Close the Chapter," says Gladys Staines as ‘The Least of These’ Hits DVD – Hope 103.2

Listen: CONTENT WARNING: This podcast contains stories of Christian persecution that may distress some listeners. Gladys Staines talks to Laura Bennett.

In 1999 Australian missionary Graham Staines and his two sons were killed by Hindu extremists in India.

Together with his wife Gladys and their daughter Esther, the Staines’s had been working with people affected by leprosy, providing aid and attempting to reduce the stigma associated with the condition. As Christians, they were a minority in the country and drew regular criticism and accusations of illegal evangelism.

Sadly, this culminated in an attack on the family, and Gladys had to choose how to confront the system that stole her family, and how she would respond to the extremists.

In this interview with Laura Bennett, Gladys Staines talks about the release of The Least of These: The Graham Staines Story, and opens up about why she chose to forgive.

The film is available in DVD and digital download on September 18. See movieschangepeople.com for details.
