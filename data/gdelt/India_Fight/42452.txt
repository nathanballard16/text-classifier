Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan twin in a black sweater and make for a cute mother-son duo

Kareena Kapoor Khan and Taimur Ali Khan had an amazing mom-son time during their vacation in London. When Saif Ali Khan was shooting for Jawaani Jaaneman, Kareena took Taimur for playdates with his friends and also stroll in the city. The actor knows how to spoil and pamper her son to the fullest. When Bebo was in Mumbai for Dance India Dance shoot, she made sure to FaceTime him at regular intervals to check on him.

Now, we got our hands on a photo of Kareena and Taimur from their recent vacation. In the photo, the mother-son duo is seen twinning in a black sweatshirt which has Flag of the United States printed on it. Both are seen holding hands while looking at the camera. Bebo completed her look by teaming it up with blue flared jeans, green bag and black sunglasses. While Taimur wore a grey T-Shirt and blue denim.

Earlier during an interaction with Rajeev Masand, Kareena described Taimur as a 'terror'. She stated, "He's a terror, very naughty. If I may say, he's exactly like his father. Right now he's just going through the phase where he tells everyone 'don't do this', because he has been told that often."

Currently, Kareena is busy judging Dance India Dance 7 and she is also completing her brand commitments. Her upcoming film is Good News with Akshay Kumar, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani. The film is releasing on December 27, 2019. Kareena also wrapped the shoot of Irrfan Khan starrer Angrezi Medium.
