Soldier martyred in Paki sniper shot

Poonch, Oct 22

A Junior Commissioned Officer was killed by Pakistani army snipers in Nowshera in Jammu and Kashmir’s Rajouri district, sources said on Tuesday as cross border tensions continue between India and Pakistan.

In Poonch, Indian officials accused Pakistan of shelling the Indian side. Two civilians were wounded in heavy shelling along the Line of Control in Poonch’s Mendhar sector. Indian officials said the shelling began at 1.20 pm and said that the Indian Army retaliated “strongly”.

The two civilians were taken to a hospital, sources said. Meanwhile, residents of villages in the area took cover in their homes and underground bunkers, officials said, adding that children in the area’s schools were also evacuated to safety.

Meanwhile, the Army has defused three live mortar shells fired by Pakistan troops along the Line of Control in Jammu’s Poonch district, officials said on Tuesday.

With the safe defusal of the mortar shells by Army engineers, a tragedy had been averted in Karmara village of Poonch district, they said.

Pakistan has been resorting to heavy mortar shelling along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir for the past over one month. “A tragedy has been averted,” officials said.
