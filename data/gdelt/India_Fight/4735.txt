Jabalpur: The junior works manager (JWM) of Guns Carriage Factory (GCF) was found dead in a drain on Tuesday, confirmed police. He was missing since January 17 after being summoned by the CBI in connection with the alleged supply of Chinese-spare parts for production of indigenised Bofors guns used by the Army. A blood-stained blade was also found near the body of 45-year-old SC Kathua. The body, which was found in the factory area behind Section 2 region of GCF, was severely decomposed.

Police have sent the body for post-mortem examination. The family of the deceased have suspected a murder, however, the police team believe that Kathua committed suicide. The deceased wife Mausami Khatua filed a missing report with Ghamapur police station in Jabalpur on January 18.

Earlier in July 2017, the CBI had booked a Delhi-based firm the Gun Carriage Factory for selling fake Chinese spare parts to the ordnance factory, which come under the production department of the Defence Ministry.

The CBI had registered a first information report (FIR) of cheating and forgery against unknown officials of the factory, accusing them of conspiring with the Delhi-based firm which was chosen to supply parts for the manufacture of the artillery guns.
