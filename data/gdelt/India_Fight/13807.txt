Retired policeman, wife looted; brutally killed

Jeypore: In a horrific incident, a retired policeman and his wife were found murdered inside their house at Jaynagar area under Jeypore police limits in Koraput district Saturday morning.

With gold ornaments and cash missing, loot is said to be the reason behind the murder, suspected to have been committed Friday midnight. The deceased couple’s son Saturday lodged a complaint with the Jeypore town police.

According to the complaint, retired policeman M K Rehman and his wife Hapija Bibi lived at Jaynagar. Their only son Latif was away from home related to some work.

When Latif arrived Saturday morning and knocked his home’s door several times there was no answer. When he peeped through the window, Latif saw his parents lying in a pool of blood.

He immediately informed the police and neighbours. On reaching the spot, police recorded Latif’s statement. Police’s preliminary investigation suggested that the couple was hacked to death with an axe. A scientific team and sniffer dog were pressed into service.

On the other hand, locals suspected the heinous murder might be fallout of previous enmity. The miscreants might have killed the couple and to mislead the police might have looted the gold ornaments to show it as a case of loot, a local said.

We are investigating the matter in all angles and the miscreants will be arrested soon, police said.
