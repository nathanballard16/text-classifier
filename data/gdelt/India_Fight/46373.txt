Cops suspect personal rivalry behind medical store firing incident

Ludhiana: The police are suspecting personal rivalry behind the firing incident that occurred at a medical store in Eastman chowk on late Sunday night.

Sahnewal police have registered a case against two unidentified assailants under attempt to murder and Arms Act.

On Saturday around 10pm, Mithlesh Kumar, 30, was at his medical store along with another friend. In the meanwhile, two motorcycle-borne masked assailants barged into the store and asked for money. When Mithlesh resisted, one of the accused open fired at Mithlesh and the bullet hit his leg. Thereafter, the accused escaped from the spot. Mithlesh was rushed to a private hospital where his condition is stated to be out of danger.

It was initially suspected that the accused wanted to rob the medical store owner.

Inspector Inderjit Singh, SHO, Sahnewal police station, said when the accused barged into the medical store, they asked for money but the owner resisted. Thereafter, they shot at him and escaped without robbing.

The inspector said if the accused wanted to rob the medical store owner, they would have brandished weapons to threaten and rob him. Moreover, even after injuring Mithlesh, the accused escaped without taking cash.

“We are suspecting personal rivalry behind the incident. There is a possibility that the accused wanted to make it look like an attempt of loot by asking money from the victim,” said the police.

Sahnewal police have registered a case against unidentified accused under sections 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act. The CCTVs installed near the location are being scanned to trace the accused, who had covered their faces.
