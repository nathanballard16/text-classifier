Kashmir protesters clash with security forces

This was the first such call by separatists seeking Kashmir's secession from India.

India's move was accompanied by travel and communication restrictions in Kashmir that are still largely in place, although some landlines were restored last week.

In a narrow lane of Soura, blocked like many others with rocks and sheets of metal, residents hurled stones at the paramilitary police to stop them moving into an area around the local mosque, Jinab Sahib, which had earlier been packed for Friday prayers.

The police responded with several rounds of tear gas and chilli grenades but were beaten back by dozens of stone-pelting men. Some men suffered pellet injuries.

The locals said the security forces had been repeatedly trying to move into Soura, often using tear gas and pellets.

"We are neither safe at home, nor outside," said Rouf, who did not want to give his full name. He had rubbed salt into his face to counteract the effects of tear gas.

US President Donald Trump plans to discuss Kashmir when he meets Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the sidelines of a G7 meeting in France this weekend, a senior US administration official said on Thursday.

Trump, who has offered to mediate between India and Pakistan, will press Modi on how he plans to calm regional tensions after the withdrawal of Kashmir's autonomy, and stress the need for dialogue, the official said.
