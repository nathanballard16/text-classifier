Pune flag-seller makes a killing

Pune: As protests erupted in the city here all through Friday over the attack on CRPF convoy at Pulwama, a flag-seller here did a brisk business. He sold Pakistani flags with free lighters.

Murudkar Zendewale, a famous flag-selling shop here, sold over 200 national flags of Pakistan and gave a lighter free with every flag.

Pakistani flags were burnt at many places in the city in the wake of the terror attack at Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir Thursday in which more than 45 CRPF personnel were killed.

People expressed anger about the neighbouring country, which is accused of harbouring Jaish-e-Mohammad, the terror outfit which has claimed the responsibility for the ghastly attack. They held demonstrations across the city and everywhere Pakistani flags were burnt.

“Since morning, we sold over 200 Pakistani flags. We gave a lighter free with every flag,” said Girish Murudkar, the owner of the shop.

He informed that his family is in the flag-making business for three generations and the shop sells national flags of almost all the countries.

“I realised the anger within the people and so had Pakistani flags made overnight. It paid off,” stated Murudkar.
