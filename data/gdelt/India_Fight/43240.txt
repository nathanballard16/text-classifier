Pay eunuchs fixed amounts, textile body tells traders

Surat: Now eunuchs will be paid a fixed amount and won’t have any option to bargain or fight. In fact, display boards of fixed amounts will be put up on more than 75,000 shops spread across the 160 markets located on Ring Road, Sahara Darwaja and Salabatpura to this effect. This is part of an advisory issued by the Federation of Surat Textile Traders Association (Fostta) issued to all the textile markets in the city.

Eunuchs flock to the market for the opening of the shops and other auspicious festival days and often create nuisance with their unjustified demands. The textile body’s advisory follows its steps to end clashes between the eunuch community and traders after a the father of a newborn child, who was thrashed by the eunuchs for not paying Rs 11,000, succumbed to his injuries two days ago.

Secretary of the textile body, Champalal Bothra told TOI, “Eunuchs have been visiting the markets for many years now and not a single untoward incident has occurred till date. However, for the safety of the traders, the federation has asked the textile management to fix an amount to be paid to the community for specific auspicious occasions.”

Bothra further said that the recent unfortunate incident where the father of a newborn child who died from being thrashed is an eye opener.

President of Fostta, Manoj Agarwal said, “The security personnel at all the markets have been advised not to allow eunuchs enter into the market without seeking prior permission from the management.”
