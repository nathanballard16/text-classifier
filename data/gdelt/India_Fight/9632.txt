Surgical airstrike: Kandahar Jaish hijacker Yusuf Azhar was present at Balakot camp, say sources

Yusuf Azhar was one of the men who hijacked Indian Airline flight IC 814 in 1999.

New information emerging from sources indicate that Yusuf Azhar, the brother-in-law of Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar was present at the Balakot JeM camp that was attacked by the Indian Air Force in a pre-dawn airstrike on February 26, 2019.

The Indian Air Force on Tuesday conducted a major preemptive strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed training camp, killing a "very large number" of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders, according to Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.

The airstrike against terror camps in Pakistan was conducted by 12 Mirage 2000 jets of the Indian Air Force. Indian Air Force jets crossed the Line of Control and destroyed major terrorist camps in Balakote sector, sources said.

It is not clear whether Yusuf Azhar was killed in the Indian airstrike or not.

Yusuf Azhar alias Mohammad Salim was one of the men who hijacked the Indian Airline flight IC 814 to Kandahar in 1999. The JeM chief was then released by India in exchange for the IC- 814 hijacked passengers.

In 2002, the Government handed over a list of 20 fugitives to Islamabad which featured Yusuf Azhar's name.

In 2000, the Interpol on the basis of a request by Central of Investigation (CBI) opened a red corner notice against the hijacker. The notice said that his place of birth was in Karachi, Pakistan, and he was fluent in "Urdu and Hindi." He is wanted in India for "hijacking, murder and kidnapping."
