A five-year-old girl and a BSF inspector were killed and 17 others injured on Monday as Pakistani troops resorted to intense mortar shelling and small arms around the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district.

The deceased girl Sobia Shafiq, her mother Naseem Akhter (40) and brother Mohammad Safeer (15) were injured when a Pakistani shell exploded near their home at Bandi Cheechian on Monday afternoon. The girl succumbed to her injuries on way to the hospital, sources said.

BSF inspector T Alex Laminlun, who was among five paramilitary personnel injured in the shelling, succumbed to injuries at the hospital. Defence Ministry spokesperson Lt Colonel Devender Anand said, “Pakistani troops initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by shelling with mortars and firing of small arms along the LoC in Shahpur and Kerni areas of Poonch district around 7.45 am.’
