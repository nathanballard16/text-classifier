Only Bangladeshis will be allowed to enter from India: Asaduzzaman

DHAKA, Dec 3, 2019 (BSS) – Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan today said except Bangladeshis none will be allowed to enter the country from India.

“We will not allow anyone except Bangladeshi citizens to enter the country from India. We will consider if it is confirmed that they are Bangladesh citizens,” he said replying to a query from journalist at his ministry office at the Secretariat here.

Asaduzzaman said there is no reason to be panicked over the news of pushed in Bangladesh from India.

“We are not sure whether those, who are trying to come, are Bangladeshis. Although they were trying to enter, but Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) members did not let them enter,” the minister said, adding that the intruders are only a few hundred in number.

Noting that some Rohingyas who entered India somehow wanted to come to Bangladesh, he said, “We will not allow anyone to enter Bangladesh without being sure. It’s up to us how we will receive them if they are confirmed as Bangladeshi citizens”.

Bangladeshi citizens who fall in complexity due to visa expiration date after going to India will be received, Asaduzzaman added.

About wearing caps shaping the flag of Islamic State (IS) on heads by two accused in the Gulshan cafe attack case, the minister said the matter is being examined.

“We will disclose the findings after investigation,” he said, adding that there is no existence of IS in the country.
