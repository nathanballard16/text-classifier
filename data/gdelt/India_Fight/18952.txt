GST evasion racket busted in Junagadh

Rajkot: State Goods and Service Tax (SGST) department raided nine traders in Junagadh on Friday and busted a bogus billing racket with estimated transactions of Rs 227 crore.

During preliminary investigation, it came to light that nine firms were floated in the name of these traders using forged documents and goods worth Rs 227 crore were sent out of Gujarat.

According to officials, the masterminds, who are yet to be identified, secured the PAN numbers and other official ID details of some labourers and small-time traders. Using these documents, other some papers like rent agreement and local body tax bill were also forged to create bogus firms. Then, using the ID proofs and firm’s details, they secured GST numbers.

“Those wanting to sell their goods outside the state without paying the tax, contacted these masterminds. Using the GST numbers of these nine bogus firms, e-way bills were generated and the goods were transported,” an SGST official said.

According to GST officials, the e-way bills of groundnut were generated in most of these cases. The nine traders who were raided on Friday told officials that they were unaware about the transactions. The masterminds will be identified only after those persons who procured the goods outside Gujarat are known.

An official close to the investigation said, “We are working to identity the persons who masterminded this racket . By using the GST numbers, they made sale of Rs 227 crore.”

According to the law, a trader has to furnish GST return in 90 days of selling the goods and thereafter pay the tax.

Officials said in most of these cases, groundnut has been sold in other states. This commoditity attracts 5% tax. Primarily, it’s believed that, those involved have by evaded around Rs 12 crore tax.
