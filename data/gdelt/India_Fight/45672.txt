Mumbai/New Delhi: Once the country’s sixth largest private lender by market capitalisation,stock has seen a spiraling downfall, eroding more than 92 per cent of investors’ wealth from its record high of Rs 404 hit in August 2018.With a market value of Rs 8,161 crore, it is now on the cusp of becoming a smallcap stock.Deven Choksey, Group Managing Director, KR Choksey Investment Managers, said, YES Bank has exposure to every failing institution.“I think investors are getting more nervous now. It is difficult to predict the share price movement. Investors can take a calculated call only when they get clarity. Since clarity is missing, it is difficult to take a call,” he said.The bank, promoted by Rana Kapoor and Ashok Kapur , made its debut in July 2005. Kapur was killed in the 26/11 terrorist attack in 2008, triggering a succession battle at the bank.Kapoor held the reins until last year, when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) denied him permission to run the bank at the helm.Ever since, the stock has been going through continuous turmoil, except for brief spells of bounces, only to tank further at the next negative cue strikes.On Tuesday, the bank’s shares were buzzing in the investing world amid rumours that Kapoor has exited the bank.According to PTI, Reliance Nippon Asset Management Company ( RNAM ) on Tuesday directed its trustees to sell the remaining shares pledged by Rana Kapoor as a collateral with the mutual fund house, sources said.In 2009, Madhu Kapur , Ashok Kapur’s wife, approached the bank to nominate her daughter Shagun Kapur Gogia on the board. The demand was rejected, as it did not fulfill the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) requirements.What followed was a bitter battle, as Madhu’s name was stricken off the list of major shareholders in 2011. To make matters worse, Kapoor published a brief history of the bank in December 2012, without any reference to Kapur.Finally in 2019, after years of litigation and feud, Kapoors and Kapurs buried the hatchet and Shagun was nominated on the board of the bank.In January this year, Kapoor had to step down after the Reserve Bank of India declined to approve his reappointment as CEO. While the official reasons were never made public, media reports said the central bank cited "serious lapses" in governance and a "poor compliance culture" as reasons for its "regulatory discomfort" in allowing Kapoor to head the private lender.Over the past few months, Kapoor who had once termed YES Bank shares as diamonds, and pledged never to sell them, has been trimming his stake in the bank by selling his shares in open market. YES Capital (India), Morgan Credits Private and Rana Kapoor together sold 552 lakh shares, or 2.16 per cent, stake in the open market during September 26-27, according to regulatory filing.As of June 30, Rana Kapoor held 4.30 per cent stake in YES Bank against 7.40 per cent in June 2006. Likewise, Kapoor-led Morgan Credits Capital also reduced its stake to 3 per cent from 6.30 per cent during the same period. Another firm, YES Capital, cut its stake to 3.30 per cent from 4.20 on March 31, 2013.In March quarter of 2019, YES Bank reported a massive quarterly loss, amplified by provisions against bad loans to an infrastructure conglomerate and an airline, as the lender’s first non-founder CEO Ravneet Gill began a cleanup act in right earnest.Prior to that, the bottomline of YES Bank increased over 35 per cent annually during FY2008-2018.Bottomline of the lender declined nearly 91 per cent YoY to Rs 113.80 crore in Q2FY19 from Rs 1,260.40 in Q2FY18.Analysts find it difficult to predict September quarter earnings unless the lender throws up some figures related to provisions.Choksey of KR Choksey Investment Managers said, “Till the bank gives clarity on what they are going to provide for, earnings cannot be quantified.”“The bank may say they are very well secured, but the fact is that it could create a liquidity crunch in the bank, because even though you are secure, by the time you realise your money, your liquidity would dry up,” he said.Of the total standard stress, three accounts that investors are most concerned about are those of ADAG, Essel group and DHFL that add up to Rs 24,200 crore.With such concentrated stress exposures and slow resolutions, IDFC Securities expects a sharper increase in gross non-performing assets (GNPA) for the bank compared with earlier estimates. The brokerage expects GNPAs of 9 per cent and 9.6 per cent in FY20 and FY21, respectively, against 5 per cent in Q1FY20.Over the weekend, IDFC Securities slashed its target price for the stock to Rs 35 (from Rs 75 earlier), as it sees more bad loans, higher haircuts due to slower resolutions and uncertainty around equity raising given the sharp correction in stock price.The YES Bank stock hit this target price on Tuesday.An email to Yes Bank requesting comments on the stock price decline remained unanswered.Analysts and wealth managers do not know what is in store for the stock.“It has been a tale of despair and disappointment since last year due to disturbing revelations about the massive buildup of dodgy assets, which caused tremors among investors, who were left scurrying for cover,” said Ajay Bodke, CEO – PMS at Prabhudas Lilladher.“It was not a one-time shock. The damage kept on unfolding and it is akin to ‘death by thousand cuts’ for investors,” added Bodke.
