Mother of Woolworth's delivery driver Jatinder Brar who died in a collision doesn't know he's dead

The elderly mother of a Woolworths delivery driver killed in a horror collision still doesn't know her son is dead.

Jatinder Brar, 25, died after the truck he was driving crashed into an allegedly stolen car at Salisbury South in Adelaide on Friday.

As news of the 25-year-old's death spread among family and friends, it was decided to keep the tragedy secret from his mother in India - due to her ailing health.

Friends of Mr Brar told The Advertiser that while the accounting graduate's mother knows of the crash, she is unaware that he is dead.

'We have told her that he was in a crash and was not able to talk,' Aman Dhillon told the publication.

'The news has already made it to the village and is in the Indian media so she is insulated at the moment until we can get his body sent home.'

Tragically, the crash comes just months before Mr Brar was due to be married and weeks after he earned a Masters of Accounting from Flinders University.

The female driver who was allegedly behind the wheel of the car that crashed into Mr Brar was arrested after fleeing the crash's scene on Friday, police said.

The vehicle she was driving was stolen from a property in Golden Grove, north-east of Adelaide, on December 28, police allege.

The 25-year-old, who was charged with causing death by dangerous driving and driving dangerously to escape police pursuit, was refused bail and will appear in court next week.

Meanwhile, a fundraising page has been set up to bring Mr Brar's body back to India and as a means to support his family.
