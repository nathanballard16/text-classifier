Model harassed after being taken on foreign assignment

Kolkata: A city-based model who was hired and flown to Thailand by an organisation for shooting a promotional event, has brought charges of harassment and unlawful detention against the organisation. The girl managed to return to the city following the intervention of the External Affairs Ministry. She alleged that she was taken to Phuket in Thailand by a promotional organisation based in Mumbai for shooting an endorsement. She then contacted her family members who in turn took up the matter with the Prime Minister's Office. The matter was taken up with the Indian High Commissioner's office in Thailand and the local administration rescued her.
