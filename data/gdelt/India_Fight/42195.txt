Cops open fire to prevent escape bid

Nepalgunj, September 3

Police opened fire to take a fugitive under their control after he tried to escape at Ranjha Chowk of Nepalgunj Sub-metropolitan City today.

Acting on a tip-off, a police team led by DSP Hem Bahadur Shahi had arrested Narendra Neupane from near Jamuna Customs office.

Neupane, who was convicted in theft and burglary case, had been absconding for the past six years. After his arrest, Neupane was being taken to Area Police Office, Kohalpur, on a motorbike. He had tried to escape when he reached Ranjha Chowk of Neplagunj sub-metropolis. Police had then shot him on his left leg and brought him under control, said DSP Shahi.

At the press meet organised on the premises of Area Police Office, Kohalpur, DSP Shahi said police had to open fire as Neupane tried to flee from police control.

Neupane, Dilli Wali and Mangal Shahi had vandalised and looted a UN vehicle at gunpoint in Deurali of Banshgadi Municipality-1 in Bardiya eight years ago.

Bardiya District Court had sentenced each of the three persons, including Neupane, to six years in prison. After the court verdict, all three had been absconding.
