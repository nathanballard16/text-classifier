Jhund makers summoned

The Sairat’s director Nagraj Manjule’s first collaboration with Amitabh Bachchan, Jhund, has been plagued with problems from the outset. Firstly, the original producer opted out, leaving the project in the lurch. Fortunately, Bhushan Kumar and T-series stepped in to revive the project.

Even after the producer was in place, Jhund got repeatedly delayed during shooting, as apparently the director insisted on re-shooting.

Hence, the release date got postponed at least twice.

Now a looking at the latest development, it seems that the film won’t even make its current release date of December 13, as a Hyderabad-based filmmaker, Nandi Chinni Kuma, sent the producers a legal notice, claiming copyright infringement.

Sources close to T-Series reveal that the producers are ‘seriously fed up’ of director Nagraj Manjule’s high-handed ways.

“He seriously thinks he’s a genius. Agreed Sairat was a hit, but can one film be proof of any filmmaker’s sustaining power?” questioned the source with annoyance.
