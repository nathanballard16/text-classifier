Authorities had cited tensions and curfew as the reasons for not granting him nod. The curfew was lifted on Monday morning.Violent protests against Citizenship (Amendment) Act erupted in Mangaluru on December 19. Police opened fire, which left Nauseen Kudroli, 23, and Jaleel Bengre, 49, dead. A CID probe has now been ordered into the unrest and firing.Siddaramaiah told reporters no amount money could compensate for the two families’ loss. He visited their homes and checked on people who were injured in the violence.“Nauseen was just 23 years old; he was the earning member of his family. He would have lived a long life had this incident not occurred. Jaleel was the only breadwinner in the family of four, which includes two children,” he said.The former chief minister said he wanted to visit Mangaluru on December 20, but he was denied permission. “I had plans to travel on December 20 in a chartered flight. But I got information that my flight would not be allowed to land in Mangaluru. Later, Mangaluru city police commissioner PS Harsha issued a notice, preventing me from visiting the city till curfew is in force,” he said.He said an opposition leader played an important role in a democracy and should not be subjected to restrictions this way. “Why I was not allowed to visit the city when chief minister, deputy chief minister, home minister and Udupi MP come here?” he said, criticising police authorities and BS Yediyurappa government.
