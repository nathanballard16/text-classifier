Lok Sabha polls: Major opposition parties attack poll panel

NEW DELHI : Opposition parties have roundly criticised the Election Commission for “conducting itself in brazenly partisan manner” and “reducing” itself to a “pawn” of the Modi government The EC action of curtailing campaigning by a day in West Bengal after Kolkata clashes united many major opposition parties, with a delegation visiting Nirvachan Sadan.Members of the delegation asked why the entire opposition was ‘punished’ for “violence unleashed by BJP.” The opposition alleged that even while curtailing campaigning, EC ensured PM Modi’s campaign was unaffected on Thursday. They also demanded to know whether EC had framed any rule to deal with possible VVPAT-EVM-count mismatch.Without any quasi-judicial procedure, the EC cut short campaigning in West Bengal, the opposition said.Congress’ Randeep Surjewala said: “Despite clear dissent in EC ranks, and it being a clear cut case of brazen violation of the MCC, it meekly surrendered to the whims of Modi and Shah. Has the MCC become a Modi Code of Misconduct?”DMK chief MK Stalin tweeted: “Ban on campaign in nine constituencies in Bengal. The EC has one set of rules for the opposition and another for the ruling party. Highly condemnable.”
