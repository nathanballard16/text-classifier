CPI(M) leader criticises BJP for raids

The fear of defeat in the elections has pushed the Bharatiya Janata Party to conduct Income Tax raids against Opposition party leaders, said K.Balakrishnan, State secretary, Communist Party of India (Marxist), here on Tuesday.

Addressing a rally at Kumbakonam where he campaigned for Secular Progressive Alliance candidate S.Ramalingam of DMK, he said that the BJP had lost its ground in northern States so that they have turned their attention towards the south. Here too there was a wave against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and this had prompted the BJP government, “which had ruined the independence” of constitutional bodies such as Election Commission, Central Bureau of Investigation, Planning Commission and judiciary, to initiate raids against Opposition leaders, he said.

No party in New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra, Kashmir and Kerala had opted for an alliance with BJP but in Tamil Nadu there exists a ‘mega’ alliance.

If the BJP could give good governance then why did it suffer defeat in elections to the Assemblies in five States, he said.

He alleged that Mr. Modi had chaired a ‘khap panchayat’ to sort out differences between Chief Minister Edappadi K.Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O.Panneerselvam.
