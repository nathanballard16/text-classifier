West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Saturday made a scathing attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) saying that the Modi government's expiry date was over.

Banerjee was addressing TMC's mega opposition rally at the Brigade Parade Grounds in Kolkata.

The chief minister also said the opposition parties had resolved to work together, while the prime minister can be decided after the Lok Sabha elections.

"We (opposition parties) promise to work together; who will be the prime minister can be decided after the Lok Sabha elections," she said at the rally.

Mamata also alleged that bigwigs including Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari were ignored in BJP. She said they will be ignored further if BJP wins the upcoming polls.

"Rajnath Singh, Sushma Swaraj and Nitin Gadkari ignored in BJP; if it wins the LS polls, they will be ignored again," Banerjee said today.

The TMC chief also raised slogan of 'Badal do, badal do, Delhi ka sarkar badal do' (change the government at the Centre) at the Kolkata rally.
