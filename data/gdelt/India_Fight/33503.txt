Pathalgarhi leader shot dead in Kochang village

Ranchi: Sukhram Munda, the village head of Kochang which served as a nodal point in the Pathalgarhi movement for tribal autonomy, was shot dead by an unidentified assailant on Saturday night.Sukhram, who played a key role in the Pathalgarhi movement, was targeted during the bi-weekly haat (village market) in Kochang. He was wrapping up for the day, shutting the eatery he runs with his wife – the biggest establishment at the market — when someone called out from behind. As soon as Sukhram turned, the assailant fired from close range.“The shooter then rode pillion on a bike and fled towards the neighbouring village of Sakey,” an eyewitness said.A police team, including the sub-divisional police officer and the officer in charge of Arki police station reached the spot and set up a camp on Sunday morning. “We are investigating the incident. We don’t know who killed him yet,” said Alok, the superintendent of police at Khunti district.Sukhram held two positions of importance at Kochang — that of the gram pradhan (traditional village chief) and mukhiyapati (husband of the elected village head, a powerful position which is common across Bihar and Jharkhand). His family had given away land on which the village’s only school was built. Even the local post office operates out of his home.
