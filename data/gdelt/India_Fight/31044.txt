Al Umma founder gets 15 days parole

Coimbatore: A police team dropped Coimbatore serial bomb blasts mastermind SA Basha at his house at Bilal Estate in Ukkadam on Thursday morning after the Madras high court granted him parole for 15 days. The 72-year-old man will be taken back to the Coimbatore Central Prison on July 4.

Basha was the founding president of banned militant fundamentalist outfit Al Umma and had planned the serial blasts on February 14, 1998. The chargesheet filed by the special investigation team of CB-CID against Basha on May 5, 1999 accused him of conspiring to kill BJP leader LK Advani using a suicide squad and for the post-blast violence. He arranged the procurement of about 650kg gelatin and other explosive substances from Mysuru to make various types of bombs and IEDs in Coimbatore.

Subsequently, Basha was sentenced to life imprisonment by the special court for bomb blast cases. He spent more than 21 years in the prison here. His appeal is pending before the Supreme Court.

Basha’s daughter Mubeena had approached the HC seeking one month parole for her father claiming that her mother’s health had deteriorated.

While he can spend time with his family, Basha is barred from venturing out of his house or meeting members of political outfits, police sources said.

The city police have been deployed 20 police personnel at the house round-the-clock.
