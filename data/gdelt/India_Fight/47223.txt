A Bangladeshi cow shepherd, Jahurul Islam, has been reportedly shot dead by India's Border Security Force (BSF) in Chapainawabganj district.

The incident happened at Masudpur Indian border in Shibganj upazila of the district on Sunday morning.

Jahurul, 30, is the son of Abdul Kadir from Tarapur Thuthapara area under Monakosha union of the same upazila.

Locals said Jahurul — along with a group of people — had entered India through the border to get some cows.

Indian BSF members of Shovapur camp opened fire at them, killing Jahurul on the spot.

Later, his associates brought his body back to Bangladesh. Jahurul's family then buried him at Baltungi area of the upazila.

Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) 53 Battalion Commander Lt Col Mahbubur Rahman Khan said: "We have heard about the killing at the border.

"After investigation, we will inform the media about the details."
