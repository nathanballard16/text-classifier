One lost his life in a fierce gunfight between security forces and suspected infiltrators in Sunderbani sector of Rajouri district , while another was killed in cross-border firing after Pakistan violated ceasefire in Gurez sector of north Kashmir’s Bandipora district.Pakistan army has been aiding infiltrators by opening heavy fire at Indian posts regularly, said official sources. “Alert Army personnel noticed ‘suspicious movement’ in forward localities of Sunderbani’s Laleali area,” defence spokesperson Lt Col Devendra Anand said. When Indian soldiers challenged the suspects, a huge explosion took place, followed by incessant firing by Pakistani troops to support the suspected infiltrators.In the exchange of fire, a jawan was killed. His identity is yet to be ascertained, Lt Col Anand said. Heavy cross-border firing continued till last reports came in.Pakistan breached the truce thrice on Monday, resorting to unprovoked firing and shelling along the LoC first in Poonch district’s Krishna Ghati sector around 9.45am. The second violation came in Bandipora’s Gurez sector — where a soldier was killed — and the third in Kalal area of Rajouri’s Nowshera sector around 8.30pm, where heavy firing and mortar shelling continued till the filing of this report.
