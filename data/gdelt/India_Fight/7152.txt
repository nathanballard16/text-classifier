Four jawans from the Indian Army, including a Major rank officer, were killed on Monday (February 18) in an encounter with Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists in Pinglena, an area in Kashmir's Pulwama district.

While the encounter is still underway, details of the four martyred soldiers have emerged.

Major VS Dhoundiyal from Dehradun, Havildar Sheo Ram from Jhunjhunu, Sepoy Ajay Kumar from Meerut and Sepoy Hari Singh from Meerut-all from the 55 Rastriya Rifles-have lost their lives during the encounter.

Meanwhile, sources had informed India Today TV that a top Jaish commander Kamran alias Ghazi Rashid and one other terrorist were trapped in the region. Both are suspected of having links to Thursday's dastardly attack which claimed the life of 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel.

Sharing details of the encounter, a police officer said security forces had started a search operation in Pinglena during the night after receiving information about the presence of militants in the area. The gun battle began when the terrorist fired at the forces while they were on a mission.

Top JeM commander Kamran and his accomplice have been killed in the encounter, according to latest reports.

As the situation in Kashmir continues to remain tense, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat is gearing up to brief Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman about the situation in the Valley.

Earlier on February 14, at least 40 CRPF personnel were killed while several others were injured in what has been termed the deadliest attack in three decades of Kashmir's insurgency.

Slamming the attack, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given security forces full freedom to avenge the killings of Indian security forces.
