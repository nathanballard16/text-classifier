WATCH: Karan Johar quips 'Ranbir Kapoor kabhi bhi haath se ja sakta hai'; here's how RK and Alia Bhatt reacted

Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt's relationship became a talk of the town since the time they started shooting for their first film together, Brahmastra. RK, however, confirmed that he is dating Alia during an interaction with a magazine in 2018. The couple has made several public appearances starting from Sonam K Ahuja and Anand S Ahuja's wedding reception in Mumbai to Akash Ambani and Shloka Mehta's pre-wedding bash in Switzerland. Ranbir and Alia were even snapped at the Mumbai airport while heading to Switzerland together.

The lovebirds are making sure to spend quality time together in the beautiful locale of St Moritz. Even in the international destination, their relationship was a hot topic, courtesy Karan Johar! At one of the events, KJo was seen with Ranbir, Alia and Ayan Mukerji on stage. The ace filmmaker cracked a joke about the couple and even addressed them as 'Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi'.

We got our hands on a video where Karan is seen saying, "We have to say that Rab ne bani di jodi...and I wasn't talking about Akash and Shloka...I was talking about Ranbir and Alia because clearly wedding season is on and we are just getting inspirational because you never know when Ranbir... woh kabhi bhi haath se ja sakta hai."

Check out the video below:

This statement by Karan left everyone in shock and Ranbir-Alia kept a minimal smile!

Meanwhile, soon after returning to Mumbai from Switzerland, Ranbir and Alia will be shooting for Brahmastra in the city. The film is slated to release during Christmas weekend this year.
