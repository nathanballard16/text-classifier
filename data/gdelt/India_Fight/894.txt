In the course of the year 2018, 40 “missionaries” and pastoral workers were killed around the world, almost double the previous year’s toll of 23, the Vatican’s Fides news agency reported.



Until 2017, the Americas led the way for 8 consecutive years for the highest number of missionaries killed. In 2018, Africa topped the list.



Fides data showed that of the 40 killed, 35 were priests, 1 was a seminarian and 4 were lay people. Africa accounted for 21 deaths, with 19 priests, a seminarian and a lay woman . South America came second with 15, including 12 priests and 3 lay people. Asia came next with 3 priests and 1 priest in Europe.



“Missionary” according to “Evangelii Gaudium”

Fides explained that it preferred using the word “missionary” for those killed, referring to the Apostolic Exhortation, “Evangelii Gaudium”, where Pope Francis says that “in virtue of their baptism, all the members of the People of God have become missionary disciples.” “All the baptized, whatever their position in the Church or their level of instruction in the faith, are agents of evangelization, and it would be insufficient to envisage a plan of evangelization to be carried out by professionals while the rest of the faithful would simply be passive recipients,” the Pope says.



This is why the annual list of Fides does not just include missionaries “ad gentes” in the strict sense, or missionaries in mission lands, but comprises all the baptized engaged in the life of the Church dying in a violent way and not strictly “in hatred of the faith”.



Fides said that many missionaries have lost their lives during attempted hold-ups and robberies, at times in ferocious circumstances in impoverished and degraded social contexts, where violence predominates, with authorities helpless or weakened by corruption and compromise, or where religion is misused.



Fides further explained that everywhere priests, religious, and laymen share the same daily life as the common people, bringing them the evangelical witness of love and service for all, as a sign of hope and peace, trying to alleviate the suffering of the weak and raising their voices in defense of their trampled rights, denouncing evil and injustice.
