Wheat weevil attack: Residents abandoning Patiala village; administration shuts down godown, asks FCI to compensate villagers

PATIALA: The district administration has ordered to shut down the godown after twenty families from Maian village in Punjab ’s Patiala district opted to go in for distress sale of their houses and agricultural fields when their crops came under the wheat weevil attack about three months ago.The local residents had filed a petition in the SDM’s court after which subsequent hearings were held and finally the owners were asked to vacate the godown. The weevil attack was attributed to the huge wheat godown, which was constructed in 2009.The orders were passed by the court of Patiala sub divisional magistrate Ravinder Arora to shut down the facility owned by some private players, to store wheat for the food corporation India and PUNGRAIN, and to remove 20 lakh tonnes of wheat from the godown within 15 days.The village is just 5-6 km from the Patiala city and around 20 families had abandoned their houses and forced to sell the agricultural fields to move out of this village at throwaway prices.As per the norm, any storage facility should at least 500 meters outside the village limits.The weevils had made life difficult for the residents with many having to undergo surgeries and other medical procedures due to the weevil attack.The administration has also directed the FCI to compensate the villagers who faced various health issues due to the weevil attack.Meanwhile, the villagers said that the problems due to pollution being caused by a local distillery and a paper mill, which were located right outside the village limits couple were not addressed.The villager had sold their land at a throwaway rate of Rs 18 lakh an acre even though the price of land in nearby villages not affected by pollution was Rs 25-34 lakh. The property prices were in the range of Rs 70-80 lakh till about five years back.Patiala Deputy Commissioner Kumar Amit said the main problem in the village was due to the weevil attack while the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) had been asked to ensure that the distillery and paper mill were complying with all the norms to prevent the pollution of air, water and soil in the surrounding areas.It was after the TOI highlighted the plight of the village residents in these columns that action has been taken against the owners of the wheat storage facility.
