Pakistan fully reopens airspace to commercial flights

Pakistan has lifted all airspace restrictions on civilian flights, reopening a key transit air corridor over its territory almost five months after closing it due to aerial attacks with India that brought the two countries to the brink of war, BBC reported.

The closure forced international flights to be rerouted around Pakistan, reportedly costing airlines tens of millions of dollars.

Pakistan shut its airspace in February after India carried out an air strike against what it said was a terrorist training camp in Pakistani territory, in retaliation to a suicide bombing in Kashmir claimed by a Pakistan-based militant group.

In response, Pakistan launched an attack on an Indian fighter jet.

Pakistan partially opened its airspace in March, but not for flights into and out of India.

India’s aviation ministry said there were no further restrictions on airspace in either country.

Leading up to the decision to reopen the air space, United Airlines had announced it was extending the suspension of its flights from the US to Delhi and Mumbai in India until October because of the continued airspace restrictions.
