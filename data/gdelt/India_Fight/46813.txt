West Bengal Three held for murder of TMC leader

Kolkata: Three people have been arrested in connection with the murder of a Trinamool Congress leader in East Midnapore district. On Monday night, six bike-borne miscreants shot dead Kurban Ali Shahar, Trinamool Congress's Panchayat Samiti vice-president of Pashkura area, from a point-blank range at his block office. State Transport Minister and TMC leader Suvendu Adhikari said, "Family members of Shahar believe that the BJP is behind his murder. The BJP wants to threaten local people by killing Shahar who was a popular leader of Panskura area and was very active in our party. The killing of Shahar is an outcome of factional feud within TMC," BJP district president Manas Roy told reporters.
