BS-VI Mahindra XUV300 spied for the first time

With the BS-VI deadline less than a year away, spy shots of BS-VI test mules will be a common affair in the coming months. In the latest, a BS-VI Mahindra XUV300 has been spied on the Chennai-Tindivanam highway.

The Mahindra XUV300 test mule seen in the above image has a BS-VI sticker on its fuel-filler cap. The SUV is available with a 1.2-litre petrol engine and a 1.5-litre diesel engine, and chances are that either of these two could be present in the test mule. However, the publication releasing the spy shot says that the test mule had the 1.5-litre diesel engine under its hood.

The Mahindra XUV300 diesel employs a detuned version of the Mahindra Marazzo's engine. The BS-IV 1.5-litre four-cylinder mill produces 90.2 kW (122.64 PS) at 3,500 rpm and 300 Nm of torque at 1,750-2,500 rpm in the MPV. In the SUV, the tuning is 85.8 kW (116.5 PS) at 3,750 rpm and 300 Nm at 1,500-2,500 rpm. The 1.2-litre turbocharged three-cylinder petrol of the XUV300 also will get upgraded to conform to BS-VI emission norms. The BS-IV version of this engine develops 81 kW (111.5 PS) at 5,000 rpm and 200 Nm of torque at 2,000-3,500 rpm.
