Opposition takes on Amit Shah; says 'BJP Chief is milking air strikes for politics'

Addressing a rally in Gujarat on Sunday, BJP president Amit Shah said “more than 250 terrorists” were killed in the airstrike executed by the Indian Air Force on Jaish-e-Mohammad camp in Balakot on February 26. AVM RGK Kapoor said "it would be premature to say that what is the number of casualties that we have been able to inflict on those camps and what is the number of deaths," BUT @AmitShah says over 250 Terrorists killed in airstrike. Is this not milking Air Strikes for Politics???? — Manish Tewari (@ManishTewari) March 4, 2019

Taking on Shah, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said, “Is Army lying as per Amit Shah? Army had clearly said that it cannot be said if anyone died or not, or how many died.” He further said that “Are BJP and Shah terming Army as liars for their own good?” “The nation believes in Army, does Amit Shah not believe in Army?”
