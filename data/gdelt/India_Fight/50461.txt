Photographer is crushed by an enraged elephant

A photographer was crushed by an enraged elephant after he walked too close to its herd, bringing the tally of trampling deaths in India's West Bengal state to eight in just 10 days.

Asish Shit, 35, from Howrah near Calcutta, was photographing a wild herd of 12 elephants with a friend in the forests around the Atadihi area of Sankrail.

'Shit went to take photographs of some elephants that were roaming in the local forest. He went very close to the elephant that trampled him. He was taken to the Bhangagarh hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival,' said Arup Mukherjee, the divisional forest officer.

It was the eighth deadly elephant attack in India's West Bengal in the space of ten days.

The 35-year-old man, from Howrah (pictured) in Calcutta, India, was killed when he approached a wild herd of a dozen elephants. Though often docile, an elephant's strength and ability to fly into violent rages, makes them one of the most dangerous animals in the world

On Saturday, a 35-year-old labourer was trampled to death in North Bengal after a wild herd cornered him. The man was working, loading stone boulders onto a truck for road works, when the herd appeared from the forest.

Another woman died on October 30 after the 60-year-old went to a forest to collect leaves and mushrooms.

A lone, raging elephant stomped on a young couple walking at home at night on October 28 and killed both of them.

An animal handler, Chaure Majhi, 34, was smashed into the ground on October 26 by one of the state forest department's own elephants. The man later died in hospital.

Gobinda Roy, 22, was killed by an elephant while returning home on the same night.
