Vadodara: Karjan taluka vice-president of BJP’ youth wing Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) was arrested and his friend booked in a prohibition case after the police seized liquor stock of over Rs seven lakh from a plot of land owned by an NRI.

Accused Rohan alias Nishadiya Patel was nabbed from his house on Thursday afternoon as he was taking care of the land owned by Shailesh Patel, who lives in USA. Senior officials of Vadodara rural police had received information that Rohan and his friend Hitesh alias Somo Patel had stocked liquor in a room at Shailesh’s land.

When police raided the room on the outskirts of Choranda village early on Thursday, they found 1,764 bottles of liquor. Rohan and Hitesh were not present when cops raided, however he was arrested from his home on Thursday afternoon.

“The land belongs to Shailesh Patel, but the accused has been entrusted with the task of taking care of it. But he used it for illegal means so we have arrested him,” said in-charge inspector A M Gadhvi of Karjan police station.

Rohan will be produced before a local court on Friday for seeking custody. Gadhvi added that he is yet to be interrogated about the source of liquor and for what purpose he had brought it there.
