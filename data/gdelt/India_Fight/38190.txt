Lawyer's murder: Etah cops detain man for questioning

A man has been detained for questioning in the murder case of government counsel Nutan Yadav, a senior police official said on Wednesday.

Etah ASP Sanjay Kumar told PTI that while suspect Bharat Singh was being questioned, police teams had been constituted to nab other accused Dharampal Singh.

"Prime facie, love affair seems to be the reason behind the murder," the ASP said when asked about the possible motive of the crime.

Yadav (35) was shot dead on the night intervening Monday and Tuesday at her official residence opposite the police lines here.

"Yadav was putting up at the government quarters. She was unmarried. A couple of people used to visit Yadav from her village," Kumar had told PTI on Tuesday.

The victim was a native of an Agra village.

"Prima facie, those who visited her are under suspicion. Yadav's family members also suspected their role," the officer added.

Speaking to reporters in Lucknow, Inspector General of Police (Law & Order) Praveen Kumar had on Tuesday said, "An FIR has been registered against two persons on the complaint of her parents."



Around two months ago, Uttar Pradesh Bar Council president Darvesh Yadav was shot dead in Agra on the court premises.

Yadav, 38, the first woman president of the UP Bar Council, was shot dead on June 12 by a fellow advocate, who ended his life after gunning her down.

In another incident, a 60-year-old Supreme Court lawyer was found murdered inside her bungalow at Sector 31 in Noida on July 4.
