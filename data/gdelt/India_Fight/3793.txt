Due to the constant protests in Assam, the security personnel were asked not to allow any black items in the function. The protests in the state have been fueled by the Citizenship Amendment Bill which was passed on January 8 in the Lok Sabha. Thinking that it will increase migration from Bangladesh, citizens from Assam have been protesting in the state.

According to the News Bytes' report, security personnel were asked to stop all the citizens who have been carrying black flags to Republic Day functions on Saturday. From black handkerchiefs to headbands, the security personnel were asked to confiscate everything.

The three-year-old's jacket was removed because it was black-coloured. The security asked her to remove the jacket though it was a cold winter morning. According to the people who attended the function, they were not allowed to enter the venue if they possessed anything black. The Chief Minister of Assam has asked the Director General of Police to inquire about the case after the video went viral.
