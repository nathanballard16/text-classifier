Levy of Sales Tax and Service Tax on Clubs and Doctrine of Mutuality: What Supreme Court held

The Supreme Court has ruled that the doctrine of mutuality continues to be applicable to incorporated and unincorporated members’ clubs after the 46th Amendment adding Article 366(29-A). Thus, Sales Tax cannot be levied on Clubs, whether incorporated or unincorporated for the supply of food and drinks to permanent members.
