MYSURU: The camera traps, laid near a resort at Maguvinahalli village on the fringe of Bandipur Tiger Reserve , have captured a tiger prowling in the village in the wee hours of Saturday.After finding new photos of the tiger, foresters who are conducting the combing operation near Chowdahalli village for the past month, shifted their search to Maguvinahalli near Mel Kammanahalli near BTR entrance gate.Forest department sources said the team led by Maddur and Moleyuru range forest officers Shylendra Kumar and Hebbar conducted combing operation at Maguvinahalli and surrounding areas to trace the tiger using camp elephants Jayaprakash, Rohit, Ganesh and Parthasarathy.Sources also said foresters found the carcass of an elephant calf near the Gopalayswamy Betta forest range office. It’s suspected it had been hunted by a tiger. The forest staff patrolling the region heard the elephant trumpeting and when they went close to it, they saw the carcass.They informed the higher-ups who, along with veterinarians Dr DN Nagaraj, Dr Mujeeb and Dr Prayag, and elephants Abhimanyu and Gajendra, went to the spot. Samples of the calf have been collected and sent to the lab.As preliminary investigation shows the calf was killed by a tiger, foresters decided to erect a ‘machan’ (raised platform) near the place where staff can sit and wait for the tiger and shoot a tranquilliser dart at it.Confirming that a tiger was captured in the trap camera near Mel Kammanahalli, Gundlupet ACF K Paramesh told STOI the operation is also being taken up near Maguvinahalli along with Chowdahalli. “We’re trying our best to trap the tiger,” he said.Chamarajanagara DC BB Cauvery, who visited Chowdahalli village and met family members of deceased farmers Shivalingappa and Shivamadaiah killed by the tiger recently, on Friday assured them all facilities from the government.She clamped prohibitory orders under Section 144 of CrPC in combing areas, restricting the movement of people from Saturday.
