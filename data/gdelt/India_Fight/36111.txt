GHAZIABAD: The husband and father-in-law of a woman who was found dead in her house at Shipra Suncity in Indirapuram earlier this week have been arrested.

Divya Singh (34) was found hanging from the ceiling fan of her room last Monday. Police also found a note that purportedly said she was committing suicide and asked her father to take care of her one-year-old son.

Police had filed a case under section 302 (murder) of the IPC after Divya’s father Vinod Yadav, a former bureaucrat, filed a complaint, accusing her husband and in-laws of killing her. He alleged Divya was forced to quit multiple jobs and do household chores by her in-laws.

Divya’s husband Shailendra is a senior executive with a private firm based in Gurugram. Before the court hearing, Shailendra told this correspondent he was in office when he got a call from his father. “He told me she (Divya) had committed suicide. Divya was suffering from depression and for the last two years, her treatment was on at a private hospital. We also submitted her prescription file to the police.”

After the autopsy report, police filed a case under Section 306 (abetment to suicide) instead of Section 302. SP (city) Shlok Kumar said the report revealed the cause of death was hanging. Shailendra and his father have been sent to judicial custody.
