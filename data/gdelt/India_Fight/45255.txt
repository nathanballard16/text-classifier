NFAI discovers 30 film reels of unedited footage of Mahatma Gandhi

“It is indeed a very wonderful discovery for NFAI, coming at a time when the entire world is celebrating the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. There seem to be some rare footages in this collection while many visuals are now part of available short films and documentaries. Some of these shots have been used but some visuals seem unique,” NFAI Director Prakash Magdum said.
