Manish Sharma, the advocate who allegedly shot to death Darvesh Yadav, Chairperson of Bar Council of Uttar Pradesh on June 12, died in a Gurugram hospital on Saturday, reports IANS.

As per eyewitness accounts, Manish Sharma, opened three rounds of fire at Yadav at Agra Court premises, killing her on spot. After the attack, he fired a shot at himself.

He was undergoing treatment since then.

Darvesh Yadav was the first woman president of the Bar Council and was elected on June 9.

Following the tragedy, a woman lawyer has approached the Supreme Court with a PIL petition seeking security measures for lady advocates.

In her petition, Advocate Indu Kaul submitted that the condition of lady advocates is vulnerable in all courts across the country. About the murder case, she submitted that the male insecurity has been a common feature from women placed at a higher position and in many instances this becomes a constant threat for successful women.

The Supreme Court has agreed to hear the matter on 25th June.

The Bar Council of India has issued a statement condemning the murder of Yadav.

In a resolution passed shortly after the tragedy, the Oudh Bar Association had demanded proper investigation into the case and measures for enhancing security for lawyers.

Last March, a lawyer was shot dead in a court campus in Basti district in UP.
