Mumbai: Mumbai crime branch, on Wednesday, arrested two people in connection with the murderous attack of Shiv Sena Upvibhagpramukh leader Chandrashekhar Jadhav. The arrest was made after a primary link to the underworld in connection with the murder was established by the police. The accused have been identified as Krishnadhar Singh and Anand Phadner.

Based on the investigation that was carried out by the crime department in Mumbai, it is being suspected that the murder was committed on the instructions of kingpin gangster Prasad Pujari, who, while sitting overseas, might have instructed his men to kill Jadhav. While Singh was tracked down from Madhya Pradesh, the police traced down Phadner to Thane. Sagar Mishra, the assailant who had opened fire on Jadhav, had, on the day of the murder, been caught by Jadhav’s don and the passers-by while he was trying to escape and is admitted to a hospital and getting treatment because for the injuries that he sustained after he was beaten up by those who caught him.

During the investigation, the police found out that the weapon that was used to attack Jadhav was manufactured in a Kanpur factory. A police official, while talking about the same, said, "We managed to trace the owner of the weapon, Singh, to Naini in Madhya Pradesh.

He, while talking about the possible cause of the attack, said, "Since Pujari too hailed from Tagore Nagar in Vikhroli, he wanted to establish his supremacy in the area. Jadhav was the only obstacle on his path. So Pujari tried to get rid of him.”

The incident took place on the morning of December 19. According to media reports, Jadhav was fired at around 7 am. The attack was carried out from a close range near a temple in Tagore Nagar Area of Vikhroli. The attack left Jadhav critically injured. However, he survived the attack as the bullet had hit him on his right arm.
