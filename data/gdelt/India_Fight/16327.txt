Kashmir has been a disputed region with India and its neighbour Pakistan; both have staked a claim to it since 1947. The two nuclear-armed nations have fought three major wars since then. Relations between India and Pakistan witnessed a sharp decline over the 14 February Pulwama terror attack, which left over 40 Indian troops dead; India claimed that Pakistan had been a facilitator of terrorism. India has been accusing Pakistan of harbouring terrorists, a charge which Pakistan denies. Last month the two conducted air strikes into each other's airspace in a demonstration of their power and readiness to retaliate in the event of misadventure.
