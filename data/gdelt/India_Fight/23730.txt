Dhanush definitely has a huge reason to celebrate and throw a party this weekend. Dhanush is currently shooting for the final schedule of his upcoming Tamil film, Asuran, directed by Vetrimaaran. It has been reported that this will be the longest schedule of the film yet. Dhanush had also made his debut at Cannes Film Festival to promote his foreign film, The Extraordinary Journey of The Fakir, directed by Ken Scott. The film has now bagged an international award for Best Comedy at the Barcelona Sant-Jordi International Film Festival. We cannot wait for Dhanush to express his happiness on Twitter already.

The film was released in France last year and got positive reviews from the audience. It is yet to release in India and fans are quite excited about it. Dhanush’s film is based on the book, The Extraordinary Journey of The Fakir Who Got Trapped in an Ikea Wardrobe, written by Romain Puertolas. We have already seen the funny side of Dhanush in his South films and we are eagerly waiting for this one to hit the screens already in India. The makers were initially planning to rope in Uma Thurman and Alexandra Daddario for the lead roles but dropped the idea later on.

The Tamil version of the film will be titled Vazhkaiya Thedi Naanum Ponaen. On the work front, Dhanush will be playing a dual role in Asuran and Manju Warrier will be making her Tamil debut with the Vetrimaaran film. The actor will then begin shooting for Vada Chennai 2. The first part of the film, which was released last year, got the actor a lot of awards. His last films, Vada Chennai and Maari 2, were blockbusters and have raised the bar for his upcoming films.
