Tribute to husband: Martyr’s wife clears SSB Exam to join Indian Army

Mumbai: As a tribute to her slain husband, a 32-year-old woman from Virar in Mumbai, Gauri Mahadik will join the Indian Army for her husband Major Prasad Mahadik, who was killed by terrorists at his shelter at the Indo-China border in Tawang, Arunachal Pradesh in December 2017.

Gauri has cleared the SSB (Service Selection Board) SSB in her second attempt and will join the army as a Lieutenant in March 2020 once her training is complete at Officers Training Academy (OTA) Chennai.

While talking to ANI, Gauri said: “I am a qualified lawyer and company secretary and was employed. But after the death of my husband I left the job and started preparing for the armed forces. I was determined to join the army as a tribute to my husband and the uniform which I will wear after commissioning will become ours…mine and my husband.”

Notably, Gauri married Prasad in 2015 and resides with her in-laws in Virar.
