Apache has edge over Mi-35 in e-warfare, missile payload

New Delhi: The Apache combat helicopter’s capability at electronic warfare, along with its modern firepower, is what is expected to provide an edge to Indian armed forces in a battlefield. As per defence experts, the Apache also scores over the Russian Mi-35 chopper, which it is set to replace, in its night vision capability and missile power. Eight units of the multi-role Apache AH64E (I) choppers - where the ‘I’ stands for India-specific enhancements - were inducted to the Indian Air Force (IAF) at the Pathankot Air Base in Punjab earlier this week. India had entered a purchase agreement with US-based defence manufacturer Boeing in September 2015 whereby 22 units of the AH64E variant, which is the most modern version of the Apache, will be handed over to IAF in a phased manner by March 2020. As per IAF sources, another four choppers are set to arrive in India in September. The AH64E variant comes equipped with a payload of four air-to-air Stinger missiles, 16 air-to-ground Hellfire missiles, 76 Hydra rockets of 70 mm and a 30-mm chain gun with 1,200 rounds that can fire at the rate of 625 rounds per minute. The missiles can be fired in ‘fire-and-forget’ mode. (IANS)
