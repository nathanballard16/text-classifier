Pulwama type attacks will continue till Kashmir issue is resolved politically: Farooq Abdullah

He was speaking to a group of Kashmiri people who are stranded in Jammu and staying at a mosque in Bathindi area near his residence following imposition of curfew in the city on Friday.

JAMMU: Former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Farooq Abdullah has said that people of Kashmir are not responsible for the Pulwama attack but such type of incidents will continue till the "Kashmir issue is resolved politically". He also expressed concern over the alleged attacks on Kashmiri students and businessmen outside the Valley. Abdullah said the common people have no role in the attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber struck their convoy on the Jammu-Srinagar National Highway on Thursday. Referring to the all-party meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh in Delhi in the aftermath of the deadly attack, the National Conference president said, "I said in the meeting that it is not our fault but your mistake as you did not address our aspirations."
