At least 22 killed as floods, landslides hit Kerala

BENGALURU/MUMBAI • At least 22 people have died in the southern Indian state of Kerala after torrential monsoon rains caused landslides and flooding that cut off some areas, the authorities said yesterday.

Seasonal monsoon rains from June to September cause deaths and mass displacement across South Asia every year, but they also deliver more than 70 per cent of India's rainfall and are crucial for farm output and economic growth.

In Kerala, the disaster forced the evacuation of more than 22,000 people and the closure of Cochin International Airport, the busiest airport in the tourist state.

Located along the banks of the Periyar River, the airport will be shut until at least 5.30pm Singapore time today, although the Indian Navy has opened an airfield at a naval base for use by commercial flights, officials said.

Kerala was hit by devastating floods last August that killed more than 200 people and affected more than five million people. Those floods, dubbed the worst to hit the state in nearly a century, caused billions of dollars worth of damage to fields, homes and other infrastructure.

A few dozen people are feared trapped after a major landslide in Puthumala village in the hilly district of Wayanad.

Rescuers have recovered seven bodies, and the state government is planning to airlift rescue equipment to the area, said Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, adding: "All arrangements have been put in place to deal with the disaster."

The states of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka in western India have also been hit this week by heavy rain and flooding.

Officials said at least 38 people have been killed in the states this week due to the rain and more than 200,000 have been evacuated.
