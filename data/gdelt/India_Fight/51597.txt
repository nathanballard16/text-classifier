Copy-paste job in ED’s plea against DK Shivakumar a “tragic comedy”, Justice Rohinton Nariman

The Supreme Court on Friday dismissed a plea filed by the Enforcement Directorate against Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar seeking cancellation of his bail. The hearing, however, was not short of drama as the Court was told that the ED had merely “copy-pasted” paragraphs from the petition it had filed earlier against Former Union Minister P Chidamabaram.
