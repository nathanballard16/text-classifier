China hopes India, Pakistan to meet halfway

China encouraged India and Pakistan on Wednesday to continue talks and meet each other halfway, urging the two sides to resolve conflicts through dialogue.

Pakistan's foreign ministry on Tuesday announced it would send back an envoy to India and a reciprocal Indian visit would be made soon.

China noticed the Pakistani foreign ministry's announcement and believed this progress is conducive to easing the situation and further improving bilateral ties, said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lu Kang at a routine press briefing.

Lu reiterated as Pakistan and India are neighbors,the two sides' friendship will not only serve the interest of both countries but also would lead to regional peace and stability.

He added China will continue to play a constructive role in this regard.

The spokesman also confirmed Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Kong Xuanyou is currently visiting Pakistan at the invitation of the Pakistani government to facilitate communication with Pakistan on the current situation between India and Pakistan.

The latest tension between New Delhi and Islamabad escalated after India carried out an air strike inside Pakistan, triggering a retaliation.
