Salman Khan to promote MP tourism, says Kamal Nath

Bhopal, March 7 : Some five years back, Salman Khan was known to be a huge fan of Prime Minister Narendra Modi -- he had done some kite-flying in 2014 along with the then BJP's prime ministerial candidate in Ahmedebad during a festival. On Thursday, however, Congress in Madhya Pradesh made the Bollywood star its newest friend with Chief Minister Kamal Nath saying Khan will promote tourism and heritage in the state.

Presenting the report card of his 76-days tenure, the Chief Minister said: "As Salman Khan hails from Indore in M-P, I spoke to him on the phone and asked him if he would help the state."

Nath said Khan's reply was: "Sure!".

Khan will work in the areas of tourism and heritage and will be in the state from April 1 to 18," said Kamal Nath.

However, Nath chose silence when asked if the actor would contest on Congress ticket against Lok Sabha Speaker and eight-time sitting BJP MP Sumitra Mahajan from Indore seat in the coming general election.

Khan was born in Indore and spent his childhood days there.
