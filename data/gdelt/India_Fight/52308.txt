Jr NTR refuses to play his grandfather in Jayalalithaa's biopic Thalaivi: Reports

Telugu star Jr NTR is busy shooting for SS Rajamouli's big-budget flick, RRR along with Ram Charan. Reportedly, the actor was offered a role in J Jayalalithaa's biopic starring Kangana Ranaut. The film is being made in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi.

According to reports, Jr NTR was asked to play the role of his grandfather NT Rama Rao (NTR) in the Tamil biopic. However, it looks like the Telugu star politely declined the offer and stated that he wouldn't be able to reprise his grandfather in the film.

This is not the first time Jr NTR is refusing to play his grandfather in films. At several instances, the actor has reiterated that he wouldn't be able to step into the shoes of his grandfather as it is extremely difficult to recreate the charm and aura of the legend.

Even though Jr NTR had paid tributes to his grandfather in his films, he is clear that he wouldn't be able to do a full-fledged role. Now, the makers of Thalaivi are looking for a suitable actor to essay the role of NTR in the biopic.

While Kangana Ranaut will be seen as J Jayalalithaa in the film, the makers have roped in Arvind Swami to play MGR (MG Ramachandran). The shooting of Thalaivi began on November 10 in the country. Kangana and Arvind are shooting for their portions in the ongoing schedule.

Thalaivi is helmed by director AL Vijay and jointly produced by Vishnu Vardhan Induri and Shaailesh R Singh. In an earlier interview, Vijay said, "She (Kangana) is one of the biggest stars in India today and I think it is right that a top star plays the role of an important politician. This way, the story will also reach audiences across India. We consider this a pan-Indian film, not a regional one."
