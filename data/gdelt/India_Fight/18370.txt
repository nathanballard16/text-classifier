Indian gangster associate wanted in plot to kill filmmakers deported from N.J., officials say

An Indian national who entered the U.S. illegally and was arrested in Middlesex County was deported on Monday to his home country, where he is reportedly wanted in a plot to kill two filmmakers, officials said.

Ubaidullah Abdulrashid Radiowala, known as Obed Radiowala, was sought in India on charges including attempted murder, criminal conspiracy, extortion, forgery and weapons offenses, according to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Officers with ICE’s Newark division arrested Radiowala Sept. 20, 2017, in Iselin, federal officials said. An immigration judge ordered Radiowala deported and the 46-year-old lost an appeal to stop his removal.

“This individual’s long list of criminal charges in his home country, including attempted murder, show that he was a danger to the community here in the U.S.,” John Tsoukaris, field office director with ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations in Newark, said in a statement. “The courageous and targeted efforts of our officers show our ongoing commitment to public safety.”

Working at the direction of reputed Indian gangster Ravi Pujari, Radiowala was allegedly part of a scheme to kill filmmakers Mahesh Bhatt and Karim Morani in 2014, according to a report from Indian newspaper Hindustan Times.

The plot stemmed from a dispute over the rights to a Bollywood film, Mumbai-based newspaper The Indian Express reported.

Authorities issued a worldwide alert to find Radiowala, according to India’s Central Bureau of Investigation website.
