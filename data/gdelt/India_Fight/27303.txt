New Delhi: Haryana police have arrested a 24-year-old engineering student for allegedly murdering a manager of a shop in Narela area of Delhi. The victim's body was found lying on railway tracks near Sonipat two weeks ago. The accused has been identified as Ravi.

Ravi's arrest came following questioning of at least 18 people in connection with the murder. The questioning of the accused revealed the sequence of the events which led to the murder of shop manager Anil. The cops tracked Ravi with the help of CCTV footage and other evidence seized from Anil's shop. He was arrested on Friday.

According to a report in Times of India, Ravi told police that he went to Narela railway station to see of one of his relatives on May 7. After returning from the railway station, he parked his bike at a nearby shop to have some snacks. At that time, manager Anil, who was passing by, accidentally brushed with the vehicle which fell to a side from the impact.

This incensed Ravi and the argument ensued between the two. Ravi demanded money for the bike damage to which Anil agreed to pay RS 2,000. However, Ravi later called the deceased and demanded more money which Anil refused to give. The accused later reached the victim's shop and starting beating the Anil, who became unconscious.

The accused pulled down the shutter of the shop and fled from the scene. He later returned to the shop in the night with some his friends in a car. The accused dragged Anil's body into the car and took it to Sonipat to dump it on the railway tracks.

The next day the victim's family was informed about Anil's murder. The body was badly mutilated after it was run over by a train.
