India’s oppressed minorities

According to a report by the United Nations, violence and intolerance based on religious extremism are on the rise in India. The report states that violence against Muslims and Dalits has increased over the past five years under Modi’s rule. Hindu extremist groups have been carrying out mob violence against Muslims over rumours of slaughtering cows or eating beef. A video recently surfaced of an extremist mob torturing a Muslim man. The man was beaten and forced to say slogans mostly used by the Hindutva elements. The man died after a few days. Such incidents have become a common occurrence in India. This is tarnishing India’s image of a secular democracy. The country is being condemned by human rights groups across the world for the rise in intolerance. It is the right of every individual to follow and practise their religion freely. A secular democracy is supposed to defend its minorities.Muslims, Dalits, Christians, Sikhs, Buddhists and all other minorities are facing testing times in India. They are being attacked and killed by organised mobs. They are living in an atmosphere of hate and fear. Their homes, business establishments and places of worship are being attacked. Several Christian priests have been killed in recent years in India.Muhammad BakhtiyarPublished in The Express Tribune, June 27, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
