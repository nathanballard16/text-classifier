Mumbai: Sonchiriya which showcases the era of dacoits, has a sequence that was shot with 50-60 men who traveled all the way from Punjab were trained to fire real guns.

As the film is set back in the era where dacoits were prominent, guns were used extensively. In order, to give action sequences a real touch, the makers made sure that these fighters get formal training to use real guns.

It showcases strong and rough characters with talented lead actor Sushant Singh Rajput in an unseen avatar.

Starring Sushant Singh Rajput, Bhumi Pednekar, Manoj Bajpayee, Ranvir Shorey, and Ashutosh Rana in pivotal roles, Sonchiriya presents tale set in the era of dacoits.
