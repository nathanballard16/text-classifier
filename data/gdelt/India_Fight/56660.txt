However, interchange facility at the Rajiv Chowk, Mandi House and Central Secretariat stations was allowed.The police also claimed that no untoward incident was reported during the anti-CAA protests in the national capital.Apart from police personnel, 52 companies of other forces, including RAF, were deployed to maintain law and order, Randhawa said.He also said the force is closely monitoring social media platforms, including WhatsApp groups to check rumour mongering.Legal action will be taken against those who spread rumours, Randhawa told reporters.
