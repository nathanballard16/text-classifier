Court orders inquiry into cop-lawyer clash

New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Sunday ordered judicial inquiry by one of its retired judges into the clash between lawyers and police at Tis Hazari court complex here.

A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice C Hari Shankar, which sat on Sunday after taking suo motu (on its own) cognisance of media reports of the incident, said that former high court judge Justice (retd) S P Garg would hold a judicial inquiry into the matter.

The bench directed the Delhi Police commissioner to transfer Special Commissioner Sanjay Singh and Additional DCP Harinder Singh during pendency of the investigation.

It also made clear that no coercive action would be taken against any lawyer. Lawyers and police had clashed at Tis Hazari Court complex here on Saturday afternoon during which at least 20 police personnel and several lawyers were injured while 17 vehicles vandalised, according to officials and eyewitnesses.

During the hearing, Delhi Police told the bench that a special investigation team (SIT) has been formed to look into the clash.

Advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi Police, told the bench that one assistant sub inspector has been suspended and another transferred for alleged involvement in the clash.

He said that 21 police officials and eight advocates were injured in the clash. Lawyers, however, said more of their colleagues were injured than the number claimed by police.

The special investigation team of the crime branch will probe the matter, he said, adding that four FIRs have been lodged in connection with the incident under relevant sections. (PTI)
