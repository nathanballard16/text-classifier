Pakistan requests for restraint, kills JCO

SRINAGAR/ NEW DELHI: In what could be a possible BAT (border action team) operation by the Pakistan army, an Indian junior commissioned officer (JCO) was killed and another soldier injured in Nowshera sector of Rajouri in Jammu & Kashmir on Tuesday afternoon.According to official sources in Srinagar, Naib Subedar Sunil Kumar of the Sikh regiment was killed while sepoy Yashraj was critically injured in the operation when Pakistani troops entered 500 metres inside Indian territory across the Line of Control.Army sources in Delhi, however, said the JCO was killed when terrorists fired at the post from a “stand-off distance” at 2.40pm. “There was first an IED blast near the post but no one was injured in it,” a source said.The development came on a day Pakistan army resorted to firing across the LoC despite requesting the Indian Army to exercise restraint because it was taking diplomats and journalists on a tour of the border areas, official sources said.At least two civilians were injured in the ceasefire violation (CFV) by the Pakistan army in the Balakote-Mendhar area of Poonch district.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, at the naval commanders’ conference in Delhi, warned that all nefarious designs against the country would be thwarted with full military force. “India’s character is such that it has not attacked any country, nor occupied an inch of territory belonging to some other nation. But our armed forces have the capability and strength to give a befitting reply to anyone who casts an evil eye on us,” he said.India has recorded 2,450 ceasefire violations along the LoC already this year, with a recent cross-border duel leading the Indian Army to undertake targeted firing assaults with Bofors 155mm howitzers to destroy three terror launchpads in Pakistan-Occupied Kashmir on Sunday. At least six Pakistani soldiers and a similar number of terrorists were killed in the counter-offensive, while India lost two soldiers and a civilian, as per Army chief General Bipin Rawat Official sources dismissed Pakistan’s “orchestrated propaganda exercise” of taking a group of diplomats and military attaches from different countries, along with journalists, to civilian areas ostensibly affected by Indian cross-border firings.The Pakistan army on Monday, using the established hotline between the two directorate generals of military operations, had “requested” its counterpart to not undertake any firing when the diplomatic community visited the border areas on Tuesday.“The Indian Army respected the request and exercised restraint. But the Pakistan army opened heavy fire in the Balakote and Mendhar area of Poonch, in which at least two civilians were injured and many children left stranded in schools,” a source said.The visit of the diplomats and journalists “is an attempt to divert attention from Pakistan’s negative role in promoting, encouraging and abetting cross-border terrorism and infiltration into India”, the source said.“What Pakistan will present through the visit is its known narrative of denial. Launch pads are places close to the border, generally in close vicinity to Pakistan army posts, where groups of terrorists are brought from training camps, supplied with weapons and rations and then infiltrated into India,” the source said.
