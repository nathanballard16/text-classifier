Sambhal, October 27

An alcoholic man shot dead his 17-year-old daughter who tried to stop him from drinking in Uttar Pradesh’s Sambhal district, police said.

The man has been arrested and he has confessed to killing her.

Nem Singh, 52, a resident of Bandarai village, allegedly shot dead his daughter, Nitesh, from point-blank range late on Saturday.

The girl was taken to hospital, where doctors declared her dead on arrival. The body was sent for autopsy.

According to police, on hearing the gunshot, neighbours rushed to the spot and informed the police.

Nem’s wife had committed suicide 15 years ago and after her death, Singh had started drinking heavily.

He had even sold a big part of his agricultural land. His eldest son, Gaurav, used to oppose his drinking habit and daughter also sided with the brother.

Two years ago, Gaurav moved to Delhi along with his wife. Singh’s younger son, Saurabh, and daughter Nitesh continued living with their father.

SHO Praveen Kumar Solanki said when Singh shot his daughter, Saurabh was not home.

“We have arrested Singh and he has confessed to his crime. We have also recovered the country-made pistol,” Solanki said. IANS
