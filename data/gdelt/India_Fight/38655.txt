Wing Commander Abhinandan Fit to Fly Fighter Jets Again after Clearing Medical Tests

NEW DELHI: Wing commander Abhidan, who shot down an enemy F-16 aircraft in the Pakistan border on February 27, will once again be seen flying a MiG-21 fighter plane. A medical board has cleared the way for the wing commander to return to flying duty. IAF Bengaluru's Institute of Aerospace Medicine has allowed the reception to fly fighter jets once again.

For this, He had to give a medical fitness test, in which he passed. According to the information, the fighter plane may begin flying in the MiG-21 in the next two weeks. The greetings came during the news of an air strike by the Indian Air Force on terrorist targets in Balakot. In fact, Pakistan, bewildered by the Indian Air Force's air strike, had violated India's airspace on February 27, which was thwarted by the Indian Air Force.

Pakistan had 24 fighter jets to target Indian military bases, but the Indian Army's Wing Commander Abhishek Vardhan could not stand by the bravery. After the ejector, the greetings were landed on the Pakistani border, after which the Pakistani soldiers had taken the greetings into custody. He was then diplomatically released by India on March 1. The Air Force had subsequently banned the flying duty of the reception for security reasons.
