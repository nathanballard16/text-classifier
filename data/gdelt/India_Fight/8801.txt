Supreme Court tells states to protect Kashmiris from assaults

The Supreme Court on Friday directed state governments and Union Territories to take immediate action to prevent any threat, assault, boycott and intimidation of Kashmiris in the wake of the Pulwama attack. In a reminder to states to ensure law and order, their constitutional responsibility, a bench led by Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi directed the state chief secretaries and DGPs (director generals of police) to take prompt prevention and corrective action to address the issue.While hearing a public interest litigation filed by lawyer Tariq Adeeb, the SC also asked the Union home ministry to widely disseminate the advisories issued to states to ensure that people are aware of it. “…all acts of assault, threats, intimidation and boycott of Kashmiris and other minorities” can be brought to the attention of district-wise nodal officers, the court observed.These nodal officers were earlier appointed under court orders to prevent honour killings in case of inter-caste and inter-religious marriages as well as cow vigilantism. They comprise high ranking police officers and are authorised to take all steps to prevent untoward incidents of any sorts. The court also issued notices to the Central government and 11 states. In his PIL, drawing the court’s attention to anti-Kashimiri sentiments being fanned by certain sections in the country after the Pulwama attack on February 14, Adeeb highlighted several alleged instances of violence against Kashmiris and also hate speeches being delivered against them by vested interests.There have been reports of attacks on Kashmiri people from some parts of the country, forcing some, including a group of students studying in Dehradun, to a flee back to their home state.HRD minister Prakash Javadeker, however, had on Wednesday denied such reports of alleged harassment of Kashmiri students as “not true”. Adeeb in his PIL urged the Supreme Court to direct the state governments to crack down on hate speeches which add to the victimisation of the community. In this context, he referred to the boycott called issued by Meghalaya Governor Tathagata Roy against Kashmiris. Attorney General K K Venugopal told the court that the home ministry had issued advisories to states listing out steps they could take to check such incidents.
