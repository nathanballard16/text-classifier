National Capital, warned of terror attacks from Pakistan

The Delhi Police has been warned by the Intelligence Bureau (IB) of terror attacks to be carried out by terror groups backed by Pakistan’s spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) in the National Capital Region (NCR).

“With Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) exposed at international platforms, Al-umar-Mujahideen (AuM) is the new poster boy of ISI (Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence) and is capable of carrying major terror strikes outside the Valley,” said the agency in its report.

Also there are reports of attacks from Al-umar-Mujahideen (AuM) who might carry out the terror activities outside the Kashmir valley, following Centre’s move of abrogating special status to Jammu and Kashmir.
