Sardar Patel statue not built to belittle Nehru

AMRELI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Thursday that the aim behind building the towering statue of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at Kevadiya was not to denigrate former PM Jawaharlal Nehru in poor light even as he criticized the Congress leaders for not visiting the monument even once.I have not built Sardar Patel 's statue to belittle Pandit Nehru. Patel’s stature is so tall that it doesn’t require much effort to make other’s look small. Patel was their (Congress) leader, but no leader of that party has visited the statue so far,” Modi said addressing an election rally in Amreli Launching a tirade against the Congress, Modi said that party is fighting on lowest number of seats since Independence and is still dreaming to come to power.“Congress set a new record when its tally plummeted to 40 from 400. This is the power of a chaiwala from Gujarat ,” he said to a cheering crowd.Modi continued to dwell on the BJP government’s strong counter to terrorism and said that the scourge is now confined to only two-and-a-half’ districts in Jammu & Kashmir.“The voter turnout in the recent panchayat polls in Kashmir was a whopping 75% that too without a single incident of violence,” he said.Modi, who spoke in Gujarati, struck a local chord when he said that he had come to address an election rally but to thank people Gujarat for grooming him to stand firm in challenging times like Pulwama terror attack and Doklam stand-off with China.“When the Chinese and Indian forces came face to face in Doklam. people from other parts of the country often called me and ask him to take extra care. But, people from Gujarat boosted my morale,” Modi said.Referring to the Balakot air strike after the Pulwama terror attack, Modi said, “They (Pakistan) forgot that this is Modi...For the first time, you must have seen Pakistan crying. They were urging Modi to pick up the phone...we have put Pakistan in such a situation.”Modi continued to hit out at the Congress for promising to review the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, repeal the sedition law and reduce security forces in Kashmir.Referring to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's statement of trying to approach India after the Balakot air strike, Modi said Khan had to make a public plea to us to pick up the phone.
