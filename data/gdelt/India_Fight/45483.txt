BSP leader's son booked for power theft

A case of power theft has been registered against Farman Ali, the son of Bahujan Samaj Party's (BSP) Uttar Pradesh President and Rajya Sabha MP Munquad Ali.

The case was registered after a vigilance team raided a college in Meerut's Kithor area.

The team led by the Power Department's Vigilance Inspector Bharat Kumar Rathi and Executive Engineer Dhirendra Kumar raided the college on Meerut-Garh road and found an illegal connection drawing 15 KV directly from the transmission line.

According to a senior Power Department official, the institution has a sanctioned load of 20 KV but an additional cable which was bypassing the electronic meter was illegally drawing a separate load of 15 KV.
