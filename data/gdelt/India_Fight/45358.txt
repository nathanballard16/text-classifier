After Imran Khanâ€™s UNGA Speech, Protests In Kashmir, Authorities Reimpose Restrictions

New Delhi:

After war of words between India and Pakistan at the United Nations General Assembly, authorities have reimposed restrictions in Kashmir parts. Protests broke out in several parts of Srinagar soon after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan concluded his maiden UNGA speech warning that there will be a bloodbath when the curfew in Kashmir is lifted.

"Has PM Modi thought what would happen when the curfew in Kashmir is lifted? Do you think people in Kashmir would accept that you have withdrawn the special status? Thousands of children in Kashmir have been put under detention. They, too, will come out on the streets after the curfew in the state is lifted and the Army will shoot them. Today also we hear about pellet guns being used by the Indian Army. But whatever happens in Kashmir after the curfew is lifted, there will be another terror attack like Pulwama and Pakistan will be blamed," Imran Khan had said.

Few shops that had opened in the Valley from 7 to 9 am — were forced to down shutters. Police and paramilitary also blocked the roads leading to the clock tower in city centre Lal Chowk.

Media reports said that restrictions were also back in Anantnag, Awantipora, Ganderbal, Kupwara and Handwara towns in North Kashmir.

The restrictions came back barely 12 hours after the government claimed that day-time curbs on civilian movement had been lifted. MK Dwivedi, Secretary of Information & Public Relations in Jammu and Kashmir administration announced that restrictions have been eased in all 22 districts in Jammu and Kashmir. "Day time restrictions relaxed from all 105 police station jurisdictions in #Kashmir. So now no restrictions in all 22 districts of #JammuAndKashmir (sic)" he had tweeted.

The restrictions have been in place ever since Narendra Modi-government decided to scrap provisions of Article 370, which gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The Parliament of India has also approved the bifurcation of the state of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories.
