Pak actress mocks IAF pilot Abhinandan; Swara Bhasker slams 'sick mindset'

Ever since the Pulwama terror attacks, and the tensions that have followed, celebrities in Pakistan and India have called for peace. However, some like Pakistani actress Veena Malik have been insensitive, fuelling tension. After videos of Indian Air Force's Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman in Pakistani custody emerged on Wednesday, Veena Malik mocked Varthaman in a tweet.

Sharing a picture of Varthaman, blinded, and hands tied, Veena Malik said he will be 'received well' in Pakistan. The tweet hasn't gone down well, and actress Swara Bhasker was quick to speak her mind. In a tweet addressed to Veena Malik, Swara Bhasker slammed her 'sick mindset'.

Veena ji.. Shame on you & ur sick mindset. Your glee is just gross! Our officer is a hero- brave, gracious & dignified in the face of capture. At least some decency from that major in you army who was questioning #WingCommanderAbhinandan or the many Pakistanis suing 4 peace #sick https://t.co/KvJH8ClkmW — Swara Bhasker (@ReallySwara) February 28, 2019

Veena Malik has been sharing distasteful tweets, mocking India, ever since India attacked terror camps in Balakot.
