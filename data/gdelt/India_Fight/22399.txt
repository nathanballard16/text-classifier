New Delhi: Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, on Friday said that Congress president Rahul Gandhi is showing signs of desperation as his fake narrative on Rafale and loan waiver to business houses have evaporated. In a Facebook blog post, Jaitley hit out at Gandhi saying that his party positioned itself 'against' national interest by considering 'Balakot not a blow to Pakistan sponsored terrorism but to the Congress Party'.

"The desperation reached a peak when he, without realising that Arvind Kejriwal was playing games with him, offered him four seats contrary to the advice of the State unit. He displayed the desperation of a loser," Jaitley said in his post.

Hitting out at the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Jaitley said that the "desperation of Gandhi was at a climax" when, while 'outsourcing' the job of attacking Prime Minister Modi to Raj Thackeray, the Congress-NCP alliance has not realised the 'fallout of such a move in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and the other North Indian States'.

He also said that Rahul had to seek cover at Wayanad and Priyanka had to skip Varanasi and feel satisfied not to contest because there was no Wayanad available to her.

"The ‘New India’ is a positive India. It does not accept the negativism of Rahul, Arvind Kejriwal, Mamata Banerjee and TDP. The ‘New India’ wants to look up rather than be cynical and critical about their own country.

The Congress Party and Rahul Gandhi are 48 years behind the times. 2019 and 1971 are 48 years apart. India’s social combination and economic profile have completely changed. The Congress is contesting the 2019 election on the 1971 agenda," Jaitley further said.
