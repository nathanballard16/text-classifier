Former Indian CJ acknowledges Pakistan’s nuclear might

NEW DELHI (Web Desk): Former Indian Supreme Court chief justice (CJ) Markunday Katju has warned the Modi government from attacking Pakistan, a nuclear power of the region, in the wake of Pulwama incident.

“Not to even think of any so-called military strike against Pakistan’s armed forces are well on their guard at the borders and the Line of Control (LoC),” Markunday said.

He said Indian leadership always fooled its citizen over the Kashmir issue and, “It’s true that the Kashmiri youth are now standing armed against India over its unrealistic and oppressive policies in the valley.

To a question, Justice Markunday Katju said Indian leadership has alienated the Kashmiris particularly the youth due to their own unrealistic and oppressive policies over the decades.

Tension between India and Pakistan is on the rise with every passing day, as the Indian side continuing to accuse Pakistan over its alleged hand in Pulwama attack.

Following the attack, Prime Minister Imran Khan in his reaction over the Indian allegations, urged the Indian leadership to provide concrete evidence, rather than leveling base-less allegations against Islamabad.

He also warned the BJP government that Pakistan will retaliate promptly If India tries any misadventure

On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle-borne suicide bomber at Lethpora in the Pulwama district of India-Ocuupied Jammu and Kashmir.

The attack resulted in the death of more than 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

A local youth named Adil Ahmed Dar was identified as the attacker. Indian media and politicians have since been blaming Pakistan for the attack without any evidence.
