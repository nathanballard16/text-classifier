NCP names Sunil Tatkare as candidate from Raigad

The NCP on Thursday named former State irrigation minister Sunil Tatkare as its candidate from the Raigad Lok Sabha seat, presently held by Union Heavy Industries minister and Shiv Sena MP Anant Geete.

“Sunil Tatkare was defeated by a mere 2,000 votes in 2014 despite the so-called Modi wave. He is the right candidate to bring development to this region. His work in the State government proves this. I am confident that the people of Raigad will ensure his victory this time,” said State unit chief Jayant Patil at the launch of the Parivarvartan Yatra.

Former deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar said even though seat sharing between Congress and NCP is yet to be finalised, Mr. Tatkare would be the candidate from Raigad. “Sharad Pawar is camping in Delhi and meeting leaders to form a front to defeat Delhi’s anti-democratic and communal government. In Raigad, the Congress and PWP have come with us and this will be the beginning of change,” he said.

Mr. Tatkare said the Parivartan tour is aimed at giving local citizens an option to choose how development is brought to their region. “I will do what party tells me to do. My past is behind me and I am ready to accept any future challenge,” he said.

In 2014, the Peasants and Workers Party had fought against him leading to a vote divide. Both the parties have now bridged their differences and decided to contest together.
