Court convicts man for murdering friend

Accused killed victim by hitting with a spoon in 2013 over teasing his wife

A Delhi court has convicted a man for killing his friend by hitting him with a spoon over teasing his wife in west Delhi’s Anand Parvat in 2013.

The prosecution proved the motive behind the murder based on the evidence of the victim’s brother, who testified that his brother had told him that the accused was planning to kill him to take revenge for the offensive remarks he had passed against his wife.

The victim’s brother was an eye-witness to the crime as he had seen the accused hit his brother with a spoon when he went there to meet him. On seeing him, the accused pushed him and ran away from the spot, he told in his evidence.

Two other public witnesses-- the one from whom the accused had inquired about the address of the accused and the other who had seen him run away from the spot, also identified the accused in the trial.

Holding accused Bhagwan Dass guilty of murdering his friend, Additional Sessions Judge Pooran Chand said “From the aforesaid proved facts, it can be inferred without doubt that it was the accused and none else who got annoyed because of teasing of his wife by deceased, had murdered the deceased by hitting on his face with a spoon with the intention of causing severe injuries which he knew likely to cause death and which otherwise is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.”

“As per prosecution story, brother of deceased has deposed that deceased had told him that accused was planning to kill him as he had teased his wife. Resultantly, the accused stands convicted for offence punishable under Section 302 of IPC,” the Judge said.
