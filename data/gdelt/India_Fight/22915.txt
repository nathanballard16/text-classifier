Two local residents fell into the trap of fake travel agents and lost lakhs of rupees. In the first case, Suraj Kumar lodged a police complaint accusing Jaspal Singh of Krishna Nagar, Tarn Taran, of defrauding him of Rs 5.50 lakh. He said the accused promised him a Ukrainian work permit visa, but arranged a tourist visa due to which he was forced to return from a Ukraine airport as the authorities didn’t allow him entry, he said.

Suraj had submitted his complaint to the city police commissioner and, following a probe by ACP (Investigations) and getting district attorney opinion, a case under Section 420 of the IPC and Section 13 of the Punjab Travel Professionals Regulation Act was registered against Jaspal Singh at Kotwali police station here.

In another case, Gurnam Singh of Basti Dabbar village has been allegedly duped by Gurbhej Singh of the same village. Gurnam alleged that the accused took Rs 1.50 lakh for sending his son Ravinder Singh to Malaysia on a work permit, but he gave a tourist visa to him. The initial probe was conducted by a DSP-rank officer who recommended registration of the case.

Sections 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Section 13 of the Punjab Travel Professionals Regulation Act have been slapped on the accused.

In both the cases, no arrest has been made till now. The police said raids were on to nab the suspects.

Such cases are frequently reported from not only Amritsar district but from across the state. Despite orders, a number of travel agents haven’t got themselves resigtered with the government.
