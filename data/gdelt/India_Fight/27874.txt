Wire snare stuck in cub’s paw in Maharashtra sanctuary

NAGPUR: A two-year-old male tiger was injured after his front right paw got trapped in a nylon wire snare in Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary in Maharashtra . The snare is yet to be removed. This comes two months after the death of an adult tigress that was entangled in wire snare.The collared tiger, C3, is one of the three male cubs of T1 and nicknamed Jack by guides. All the felines are on the verge of dispersal. C3 and another cub was radio-collared by Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun , on February 25.According to sources, C3 had been limping for 5-6 days and was seen in bamboo clusters in Pilkhan area. The injured cub was sighted on Tuesday evening by tourists, and then again at the same spot on Wednesday, as it was unable to move properly. Initially, the field staff had ignored the injury thinking the cub had sustained it in a territorial fight.However, on Wednesday, tourists spotted the injured tiger in the bamboo cluster and waited for it to come out. “The tiger came out limping to quench its thirst. I could judge it was a snare as I was part of many de-snaring drives,”said Aditya Kshirsagar, who captured the injured tiger on his camera.Sanctuary authorities said experts from Wildlife Institute of India have been called to capture the tiger and remove the snare.
