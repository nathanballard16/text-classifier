Five held for killing truck driver

Five persons have been arrested for allegedly killing a 35-year-old truck driver and looting the consignment in Maharashtra's Thane district in February, police said Monday.

Thane police superintendent (Rural) Shivaji Rathod said they tracked down the accused through CCTV footages, and finally picked them up on Sunday from various places.

The incident occurred on February 26 when the gang of five allegedly intercepted the truck near Vadpe village and killed the driver Subhash Yadav.

The accused then fled with the truck, which was transporting cement blocks worth over Rs 64,000, the SP said.

Police have booked the accused Mohammad Azmal Vasiahmed Shaikh, Mohammad Shakhir Riaz Ahmed Shaikh, Jahanjeb Amin Khan, Imran Ali Khan, and Kaif Ahmed Altaf Shaikh, all in their 30s, under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including murder.

They all are residents of Mumbai, and Bhiwandi in Thane district.
