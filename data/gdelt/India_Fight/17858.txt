A Delhi police officer and his accomplice have been arrested for allegedly killing a woman and her fiancé on a temple premises in Ghaziabad last week, the police said on Saturday.

The police said the accused killed the couple as the woman was earlier in a relationship with Dinesh. She later got into a relationship with Surendra and the rejection did not go down well with the accused.

Past relationship

The police claimed that during investigation, they were informed that the woman was earlier in a relationship with Dinesh which raised suspicion on him.

According to the police, Preeti had changed her mobile number a week ago and stopped talking to Dinesh.

“On March 25, he came back from work and went to the temple along with Pintoo to see Preeti where he also found her fiancé. In a fit of rage, he pulled out his service pistol and shot the couple,” said an officer.
