5 crore pilgrims swamp Kumbh nagri for mauni amavasya snan

ALLAHABAD: Sleep was a remotest thought for millions of pilgrims who tread several km on foot to reach the Kumbh Mela grounds all through the night. Bags stacked with basic amenities and jholas stacked on their heads, millions of pilgrims jostled their way to reach the Sangam as the shahi snan began 11 minutes past midnight, when the moon was eclipsed. The Mela ground was teeming with people hours before the second and largest snan on Mauni Amavasya.Mela authorities said more than 5 crore people took the holy dip by 5 pm on Monday and 5,200 people were reunited with their families on the auspicious day.Legend has it that on this day, the first sage, Rishabh Dev, broke his indefinite vow of silence (maun) and bathed in the Sangam. It is this aspect of Hindu mythology that is recaptured at Mauni Amavasya when seers enter into a vow of silence on the day and take part in the shahi snan. Even under a dark sky, abundant lighting on mela grounds, including the decorative entry ways set up by akharas, had the Mela ground roaring with activity, and vehicular movement remained barred from all city points to the Sangam. This lead to lakhs of pilgrims making their way into Allahabad and to the Mela ground on foot for two days.Hundreds of seers and Naga sadhus had begun to converge at their respective akharas for puja before a formal procession with symbols and devotees were taken out from akharas to the Sangam on the one of the biggest.The biggest gathering of Naga sadhus was at the main camp of the Juna Akhara, where they covered themselves in bhaboot (ash) and wore floral garlands before they charged towards the Sangam.
