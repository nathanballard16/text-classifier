Pulwama aftermath: Pakistani inmate murdered inside Jaipur Central Jail

A Pakistani man being held at the Jaipur Central Jail in Rajasthan was allegedly murdered by fellow inmates, police officials said. Four fellow inmates were behind a the murder, officials said.

The Pakistani inmate killed was Shakirullah, alias Hanif Mohammed, who was convicted under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in a case filed by the Anti-Terrorism Squad.

According to Lakshman Gaur, an additional commissioner in the Rajasthan Police, Shakirullah got into a brawl over the volume of a television inside the prison. "He was killed by four inmates. This is as per investigation so far. He was booked under UAPA in 2011. He was convicted in 2017. Shakirullah was a resident of Sialkot in Pakistan," Gaur said.

Top police officials reached the prison following the alleged murder.

The news of the murder comes days after 40 jawans were martyred in a suicide bombing in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama.

Security agencies have said that the Pakistan Army and the Inter-Services Intelligence, the Pakistani spy agency, were directly involved in the Pulwama terror attack. The actual bombing was carried out by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad.

Pakistan, as usual, has denied it played any role in the attack, which India has vowed to avenge. PM Narendra Modi said that security forces have been given full freedom to retaliate to the Pulwama attack in manner and at a time of their choosing.
