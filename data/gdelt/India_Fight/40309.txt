Currently, Vietjet operates around 400 flights daily, carrying more than 80 million passengers to date, with 129 routes covering destinations across Vietnam and international destinations.

The airline is well-known for its racy and even sexist marketing gimmicks. It is run by a woman entrepreneur - VietJet Air CEO Nguyen Thi Phuong Thao who shot to fame with draping women in nothing but skimpy bikinis. Thao then went on to become Vietnam's first woman billionaire.
