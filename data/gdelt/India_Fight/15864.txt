India’s NSA Vows Retaliation on Kashmir Attack Amid Overnight Pakistan Firing

Meanwhile, heavy cross-border fire exchanges continue to take place between Indian and Pakistani forces on the Line of Control (LoC) in the northernmost Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir. The state shares its borders with Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir.

"The Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation in Rajouri's Sunderbani sector and Jammu's Akhnoor sector on Monday night", Lieutenant Colonel Devender Anand, Indian defence ministry spokesman, told the media.

Exchanges of fire in the Sunderbani sector started at 10:45 p.m. local time, but stopped soon, Anand added.

"In Akhnoor, the Pakistan Army resorted to mortar shelling and firing of small arms which continued till Tuesday morning. Our troops retaliated effectively", he stated.

One Indian Army soldier was killed and three others injured in cross-border Pakistani firing in the Sundarbani sector on Monday morning.

The backdrop of the current India-Pakistan cross-border hostilities is the 14 February Pulwama terror attack that was claimed by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops. India after a week had conducted a pre-emptive air strike against alleged JeM terror camps at Balakot in Pakistan.
