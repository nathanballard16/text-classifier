Kareena Kapoor Khan to start shooting for her TV debut show Dance India Dance in THIS month?

While one of the best pieces of news for reality show lovers was the return of Dance India Dance, another buzz that was cherry on the cake was that Kareena Kapoor Khan will be an integral part of the new season. This was probably hard to gulp down rumour which soon turned to reality and it was confirmed that Kareena is all set to make her TV debut as a judge on the reality show, Dance India Dance. Now, that the cat is out of the bag, the fans can’t wait to see how Bebo pulls off her stint as a reality show judge like a pro.

Amidst all the news about Dance India Dance, the recent one relates to the time when Kareena will start shooting for Dance India Dance. As per a report in Mumbai Mirror, Kareena is scheduled to shoot for DID at the end of this month. This is because Kareena will soon be joining Angrezi Medium shoot and the rest of the shoots had to be planned around the shoot Angrezi Medium. Thus, Bebo will shoot for the dance reality show by the month-end.

Dance India Dance will be going on air in the month of June. It will see choreographer Bosco Martis, Kareena Kapoor Khan and rapper Raftaar as judges on the show while TV actor Dheeraj Dhoopar will play the host. As per Mumbai Mirror’s report, “The channel has had several meetings with Kareena as she preps for her big TV debut which will be launched on a big scale. She is slated to leave for London to shoot Angrezi Medium (Dinesh Vijan’s Irrfan Khan and Radhika Madan co-starrer) in June, so the shoot schedule has been planned in a way that she can juggle both commitments. Dance performances are currently being planned on her popular songs.” Now that surely adds to the curiosity as Bebo will be making her TV screen debut with this popular dance show.
