RBI Supersedes Board of Dewan Housing Finance

New Delhi: The Reserve Bank of India on Wednesday effectively took control of beleaguered Dewan Housing Finance Corporation Ltd (DHFL) over “governance concerns” and defaults by the company in “meeting various payment obligations”.

A late evening statement by the central bank indicated that it had superseded DHFL’s board of directors under its powers conferred by Section 45-IE(I) of the Reserve Bank of India Act.

“Shri R. Subramaniakumar, ex-MD and CEO of Indian Overseas Bank has been appointed as the Administrator under Section 45-IE (2) of the Act,” the RBI said in a statement.

The central bank also added that it intended to shortly initiate the process of resolution of the company under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Rules 2019 and would soon apply to the National Company Law Tribunal for appointing the administrator as the insolvency resolution professional.

Troubles have mounted for DHFL over the last year after it struggled with debt repayment obligations and allegations of fraud.

In October 2019, a KPMG forensic audit reportedly found that the company’s promoters had diverted Rs 20,000 crore in bank loans to its related entities.
