‘Disappointing a lot of things haven’t come out’

Actor Radhika Apte believes the #MeToo movement just came and went in Bollywood with many things in the industry still remaining unchanged.

The #MeToo movement gained momentum in India last year with women calling out actors, filmmakers, comedians, authors and journalists.

When asked what were the things she liked or hated about the decade, Radhika said, “Me Too movement came and went. It is disappointing. A lot of things that should’ve changed, have not changed. A lot of things have not come out, have not changed. That’s really disappointing,” The actor said another issue which still hasn’t changed, is that of pay disparity.

“There’s no pay parity at all. We don’t need to talk about pay parity like ‘should this A list actress get few more crores than a male A list actor.’ It’s not just that. If an A list actor is getting you that sure shot three crore of money, he should be getting paid more money, talking in broader strokes.

Radhika also said one of the wonderful things to have happened is more female representation on set. (PTI)
