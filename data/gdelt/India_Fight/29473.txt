Gold worth Rs 13cr seized from airport last fiscal

Coimbatore: The Coimbatore unit of the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) seized 43kg gold worth Rs 13crore from the airport in the last financial year and recovered Rs 69crore as import duty and fine from various firms.

DRI sleuths are closely monitoring passengers who arrive from Sharjah, Singapore and Sri Lanka, sources said. “We have the power to recall a flight carrying contraband before it crosses the International borders. Those who give us information about smuggling will be rewarded with 10% value of the smuggled item,” an official told TOI.

The sleuths arrested Usman of Malapuram and Shajahan of Palakkad on February 3 for smuggling 1kg gold worth Rs 46.78lakh from Sharjah by an Air Arabia flight. On January 25, two airline staff were caught red-handed with 16 crude gold bars worth Rs 55lakh.

The Coimbatore unit had seized 34kg gold worth Rs 10 crore during 2017-18 and 24kg gold worth Rs 7.28crore during 2016-17.

Commercial fraud is also rampant, the official said. “Many industries import machineries. They can get import duty exemption only if they reach a fixed target. Otherwise, they have to pay import duty. If a machine worth Rs 10crore is imported to Coimbatore, the industrialist has to pay Rs 4 crore as import duty. The industrialist can get import duty exemption if he reaches a target of Rs 32 crore. If an industrialist imports a textile machine for his firm and sells it, our sleuths would identify the industrialist and collect the import duty of Rs 4crore and fine of Rs 4crore. We registered 14 cases of commercial frauds and economic offences in the last financial year and recovered Rs 69crores as import duty and fine from various firms,” he added.
