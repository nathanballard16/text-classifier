JN Ganesh News : Congress MLA suspended after cops file attempt-to-murder case

BENGALURU: The ruling Congress faced more embarrassment on Monday when they were forced to suspend Kampli MLA J N Ganesh after police registered a case of 'attempt to murder" against him for allegedly assaulting his colleague Anand Singh at a resort in Bidadi , 40km from here, in the wee hours of Sunday.The police, who are being accused of trying to cover up the case by the opposition BJP, registered the FIR after recording the statement of Singh, who is being treated at Apollo Hospital for grievous injuries.AICC president Rahul Gandhi , who is said to have taken the incident seriously, has reportedly told some Congress seniors that "party workers should be given tickets in elections, not party-hoppers".' Both Ganesh and Singh joined Congress during the 2018 assembly polls.The brawl broke out at Eagleton Golf Resort where Congress MLAs had been camping since January 18 to thwart BJP's poaching attempts. Congress has also formed a special committee led by deputy CM G Parameshwara to investigate the brawl and recommend future course of action. Law minister Krishna Byregowda and industries minister K J George are also part of the committee.According to an eyewitness in the resort, Ganesh and Singh had an overnight drinking session from 7pm to 3am. "No one knows what provoked Ganesh, but he took a flower pot and hit Singh, after which the latter fell. Ganesh's gunman rushed to prevent his boss from attacking further, and was bitten by him," the source said.Water resources minister D K Shivakumar and his MP-brother D K Shivakumar, who were staying in the resort, rushed to Singh's room to enquire about his condition.In the FIR, Singh has alleged that he was hit by Ganesh with pots and a stick. Minister E Tukaram and MLA Tanveer Sait, who pulled back Ganesh, were witness to the incident.Ganesh denied attacking Singh and claimed that they only had a heated argument. "I would like to apologise to Singh's family if they are hurt. Whatever the media is reporting is false," said Ganesh, who was reportedly on BJP's radar in its alleged toppling game against JD(S)-Congress government in Karnataka
