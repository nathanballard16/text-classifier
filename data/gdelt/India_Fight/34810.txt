Bengaluru/New Delhi, July 17

United Airlines Holdings Inc said on Wednesday it would restart daily nonstop service between New York/Newark, New Delhi and Mumbai from Sept. 6, after Pakistan lifted airspace restrictions.

The company will also start a new daily service between San Francisco and New Delhi beginning December 5, a spokesman said.

Pakistan reopened its airspace to international civil aviation on Tuesday after months of restrictions imposed because of clashes with India, which forced long detours that cost airlines millions of dollars. Reuters
