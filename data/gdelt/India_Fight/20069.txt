Did Imran Khan back Modi's re-election as PM? Pakistan Foreign Minister Qureshi clears air

Days after furore in India over a comment made by Imran Khan about how PM Modi's re-election can be good for Indo-Pak talks, now Pakistan Foreign Minister has cleared the air. Most opposition parties in India tried to corner PM Modi and BJP over Imran Khan's remarks.

They tried to project as if Narendra Modi has won an endorsement from Pakistan. However, Pakistan Foreign Minister Mahmood Qureshi has played down the remarks. He has dubbed it to be taken as out of context and accused the Indian media of sensationalisation. Qureshi also said that 'everyone knows' about Imran Khan's 'reservations' with Indian PM Narendra Modi.

Pakistan Foreign Minister gave the clarification to a standing committee of Senate. Elections in India kicked off on April 11 and wil continue till May 19. The results will be published on May 23.

India on February 27 handed over to Pakistan the dossier on "specific details" of involvement of the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in the Pulwama terror attack on CRPF as also the presence of camps of the UN-proscribed terror outfit in the country.

The JeM had taken the responsibility of the terror strike in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.
