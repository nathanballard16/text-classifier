Shirin Kanchwala excited by Siva’s appreciation

Kannada actress and former airhostess Shirin Kanchwala is making her Tamil debut with a Sivakarthikeyan production. Titled Nenjamundu Nermaiundu Odu Raja, the film has popular Vijay TV anchor Rio Raj as the male lead.

Shirin shares her experiences working in NNOR — “I am really excited foraying in to Tamil industry. Though I was getting offers from Tamil, I was waiting for the right project. And when this came from Siva sir's banner, known for making quality films, I didn't want to let go of my hand.”

Shirin is said to have done an audition and look test before coming on board. “Though I am not familiar with the Tamil language, I was confident that I would pull it off during the audition. I loved the script when my director Karthik Venugopalan narrated it.”

On her role she says, “I play a media news reporter named Nisha who does a bit of investigative journalism. It is very strong character. I had lot of lengthy dialogues and I was very nervous initially. But I took it as a challenge and rehearsed my portions many times before even coming to Chennai. Also, I wrote all the dialogues in English and asked Karthik sir the meaning of each and everything on the sets. By now, I know all the lines by heart. It was fun working in the film. Rio was very simple and supportive.”

On producer Sivakarthikeyan, she says, “I met him twice, during the launch of the film and once he came to the sets when an important scene was being shot. After the shot he has told my director that I had done a good job. It was a big moment for me. I am looking forward to it.”
