BJP credits PM Modi’s diplomacy for listing

NEW DELHI: The timing of the UN move on Masood Azhar could not have been more appropriate for BJP with three crucial phases of the Lok Sabha polls yet to take place. The diplomatic win at the cost of the hostile neighbour is sure to provide fresh grist for the party’s campaign themes of national security and PM Modi’s decisive leadership.Encouraged by the signs of a breakthrough being around the corner, the party, which had been hungrily awaiting China’s decision on Azhar, moved swiftly to highlight the achievement. While the PM himself celebrated the development as a big victory for India and said more such successes off Pakistan could be in the offing, BJP chief Amit Shah attributed the UN decision to Modi’s leadership.“That is why India needs a strong and decisive leader. Grateful to PM Narendra Modi and his diplomatic efforts...” Shah tweeted adding, “This also reflects PM Modi’s commitment towards zero tolerance against terrorism.”FM Arun Jaitley said India stands vindicated. “Masood Azhar is now a global terrorist. India is in safe hands,” he said. Home minister Rajnath Singh tweeted: “The credit of the diplomatic success goes to our Prime Minister and the effective steps taken by him against terrorism.”UNSC’s decision comes at a time when the Lok Sabha battle has entered the crucial stretch, with BJP required to hold on to a huge chunk of seats it won five years ago in UP, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand , Rajasthan and Haryana while hoping for better returns from West Bengal and Odisha. There is consensus among the political class that the Balakot air strike has helped BJP’s campaign. The retaliation against the Pulwama attack has stayed firm in the fray, defying the estimate of opponents and others that it will peter out.UNSC’s strike against Pakistan and its terror proxy, Azhar, may well have ensured that it packs in the traction until the last round.That it came on a day when Maoists killed 16 police personnel may also help blunt opposition's criticism for the failing to prevent the attack by the ultra reds in Maharashtra
