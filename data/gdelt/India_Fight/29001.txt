Aligarh murder: Forensic report to clear if 2.5 yr-old was raped; Protesters demand justice

"In the post-mortem report, the cause of death is ante-mortem injuries. Post-mortem examination has not found any sign of sexual assault or acid being used for the crime. The report confirmed death due to strangulation," Senior Superintendent of Police Akash Kulhari said.

The mutilated body of the girl was found in a garbage dump on June 2, 100 meters close to her residence in Tappal Township. The toddler had gone missing on May 30. The mutilated body was discovered after a pack of stray dogs had been spotted biting what appeared to be human body parts. One of her hands was also seen disfigured. Police in its initial probe said the killing was fallout of a monetary dispute. As per reports, the girl’s father had lent Rs 40,000 to the two accused Zahid and Aslam and got into a heated argument with them for not being able to repay the full amount on time. This enraged the two accused, who then plotted the murder of the little girl to teach her father a lesson.
