New Delhi, Feb 26: The Indian Air Force today carried out a decisive strike on terror camps in Pakistan as part of the action to avenge the Pulwama attack in which 44 CRPF jawans were martyred.

The IAF struck at three places, Balakote, Chakothi and Muzaffarabad and sources say inflicted heavy damage. The biggest strike was at Balakote, which houses a 7 acre terror camp of the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Maulana Masood Azhar led terror group that carried out the Pulwama attack.

The Balakote camp is located at KPK. The IAF according to sources struck these camps with laser guided bombs, which it may be recalled were first used in Kargil. Balakot is a town in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province of Pakistan. It is around 50 kilometres away from the Line of Control.
