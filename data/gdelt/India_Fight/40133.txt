Army soldier killed as Pakistan violates ceasefire in Poonch district

Jammu: One Army man killed and four others injured in Pakistan firing along LoC in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district officials said Tuesday.

The Pakistan army targeted forward posts and villages along the LoC with mortars and firing from small arms, a defence spokesman said. The firing from across the border in Krishna Ghati sector started around 11.00 hours, drawing immediate response from the Indian Army, the spokesman said. He said the cross-border firing between the two sides was going on when last reports came in.

However, there was no immediate report of any casualty in the Pakistani firing.

Last week, the Pakistan Army had opened fire in Nowshera sector of nearby Rajouri district leaving an Indian soldier dead. Pakistan also suffered a number of casualties in the retaliatory action in that incident, the spokesman said.

The firing comes in the wake of the Pakistan summoning Monday the Indian Deputy High Commissioner, Gaurav Ahluwalia over alleged ceasefire violations by the Indian Army along the LoC.

Pakistan Foreign Office said that Director General (South Asia and SAARC) Mohammad Faisal ‘condemned the unprovoked ceasefire violations August 18 in Hot Spring and Chirikot Sectors’. It claimed that two elderly civilians were killed and a seven-year-old boy was seriously injured in the firing.

“This unprecedented escalation in ceasefire violations by India is continuing from the year 2017 when the Indian forces committed 1,970 ceasefire violations,” Faisal, who is also the spokesperson of Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry, said in a statement.
