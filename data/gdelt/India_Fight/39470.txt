Indoor Residual Spray

"Indoor Residual Spray is used to kill adult mosquitoes. Besides, door-to-door survey is conducted to find if anyone is suffering from vector-borne diseases and required services are provided if someone tests positive for malaria or dengue. Besides, dry days are observed. As part of this, people are encouraged to maintain stagnant water-free environment in and around their home so that mosquitoes will not find place to breed," said a Health official from the district.
