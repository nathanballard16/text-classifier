lsquoNirbhayarsquos death a brutal murder not merely rapersquo

Feminist writer and professor of English Germaine Greer said on Thursday ‘Nirbhaya’ was a victim of “brutal murder”, not merely “rape”. In her latest book “On Rape”, Greer advocates reducing the sentence for rape. Rape is merely non-consensual sex. The brutality of how she was killed was what made it a gruesome crime. Instead, she recommends “200 hours of community service” or tattooing an "R" on the hand, arm or cheek of the accused, as punishment.
