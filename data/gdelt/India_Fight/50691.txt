Crop residual burning in neighbouring states of Delhi-NCR is considered one of the prime reasons for constant degrading air quality of the national capital. It is due to stubble burning that the prospects of air quality in Delhi and NCR remain in the 'poor' category while the Ghaziabad's air quality nosedived to 'severe' category.

According to a report, the contribution of stubble burning is likely to be around 2 per cent for Delhi though the possibility of rain, mist and shallow fog may worsen the situation. Reportedly, light rain may end up adding particulate matter in the atmosphere. Meanwhile, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had received complaints concerning violation of construction and demolition waste management rules, unpaved and broken roads, garbage burning and dumping and last but not the least of biomass burning.

Reportedly, in Delhi alone, 111 cases of waste management violations were reported and fines of Rs 13,35,000 were imposed. The authorities raided 62 dumping sites and fines of Rs 2,79,100 were imposed. Along with it, 10 FIRs on garbage dumping were filed where Rs 2,40,000 fines were levied.

The officials also fined several other pollution-causing activities like operation of diesel sets and tandoors were observed and fines of Rs 64,000 was levied. Meanwhile, after the odd-even rationing scheme kicked in on November 4, the Delhi government's claimed a 25 per cent reduction in air pollution levels has been recorded. Debunking the claims, NGO Greenpeace inviting a quick rebuttal from city's ruling party. According to a Greenpeace India officials, the Centre in its affidavit to the Supreme Court has said it under oath that the pollution in Delhi has reduced and the pollution in October and November is due to stubble-burning.

However, Greenpeace India said that satellite data shows no statistically significant reduction in PM2.5 levels. It also revealed that over the period from 2013 to 2018 and only shows slight reductions in later part of 2018 compared to the past three years.
