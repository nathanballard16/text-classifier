Dr Kafeel felicitated; bursts into tears recalling infants’ deaths

Kanpur: Dr Kafeel Khan, who was made the scapegoat by Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government to hide their administrative failure in Gorakhpur’s hospital tragedy, urged the people to be ‘desh bhakt’ instead of ‘Modi bhakt’. Dr Kafeel Khan paediatrician of Gorakhpur’s BRD Medical College and Hospital was suspended in connection with the death of infants at the state-run BRD Medical College.

Dr Kafeel said our fight is not with Modi or Yogi but with the ideology which makes humans enemy of humans. He was addressing the MMA Jauhar Fans Association Foundation Day function.

Chief guest Dr Kafeel Khan was felicitated for trying to save lives of infants at BRD Medical College. He urged all communities in general and Muslims, in particular, to excel in the educational field because he said we have to fight with pen, not with sword.

He said, unfortunately, the probe, in connection with the deaths of infants occurred due to the failure of the health system, is handed over to those who should have been in jail.

Recalling the tragic incident Dr Kafeel Khan burst into tears during his speech.

Alleging injustice on part of the Yogi government, Dr Kafeel recalled that UP CM Yogi who was on a visit to hospital asked who is Dr Kafeel, then said, ‘So you are Dr. Kafeel…, want to become hero?… Will see you….’ Dr Kafeel said these four sentences changed my life. I was charged with such allegations which I didn’t know. My family business was ruined, my brother was shot dead, however people’s prayers and support gave me spiritual power.

Mayor Pramila Pandey, MLA Haji Irfan Solanki, Mahant of Sidhanth mandir Swami Anandpuri Maharaj, General Secretary Bar Association Bhanu Pratap Singh, former President Samajwadi Party Syed Fazal Mahmood, veteran journalist Zubair Ahmed Farooqui and others addressed the function.
