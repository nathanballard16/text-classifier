Muslim youth arrested during NIA raids produced in Patiala Court

New Delhi: The Muslim youth arrested from Delhi and UP during NIA raids have been produced in Patiala Court. Advocate engaged by Jamia Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind who is defending the accused was also present.

Advocate Mohammad Noorullah told that NIA has sought further remand of all the accused. After hearing the arguments from both the sides, Additional Session Judge permitted another 5 days demand for Mufti Sohail and Saqib. The court asked to shift the remaining 5 accused, Mohammad Irshad, Sayeed, Rayees, Zafar and Azam to Tihar for judicial custody.

Advocate Mohammad Noorullah told that the court also permitted the accused to meet their family members though advocates of NIA had insisted on denying the permission.

Jamiat Ulama-i-Hind announced legal support to the accused, as it has always been saying that innocent people are being targeted in the name of terrorism.
