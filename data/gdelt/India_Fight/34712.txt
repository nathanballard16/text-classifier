Police say three elderly people were killed in a suspected case of human sacrifice at a 15th century Shiv temple at a village in Andhra Pradesh’s Anantapur.

Police claim the case came to light on Monday after some people found the ‘Shivalingam’ at Korthikota village in Tanakallu Mandal and some anthills nearby smeared with blood. Three people—70-year-old temple priest Sivarami Reddy, who, with the help of locals, was trying to restore the temple, his 75-year-old sister K Kamalamma, and another woman, 70-year-old Satya Lakshmamma, believed to be a relative—were killed using a blunt instrument, Anantapur Superintendent of Police Satya Yesubabu said.

Investigators believe that a group of 4-5 people came to the temple in search of gold and precious gems that local legends claim are hidden somewhere within the temple. The attackers are believed to have killed all three victims, then smeared their blood on the Shivalingam and anthills to “appease gods” and help find the hidden treasure, police said.
