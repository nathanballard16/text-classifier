NORFOLK COUNTY - For the second time this month, someone from Norfolk County dialled 9-1-1 because of raccoons.

The latest incident happened on Thursday afternoon. The 43-year-old homeowner called the emergency line to report that they had seen a raccoon on their porch and didn't know who to call. Officers attended the address however the animal had left prior to arrival. Police are continuing to being inundated with calls for service after people are spotting raccoons on their property during the day. There is no need to contact 9-1-1.

It's a common myth that a raccoon walking around during the day is sick or has rabies. It's true that raccoons are mostly nocturnal, but they can be active during the day for many different reasons. Raccoons will come out during the day if there is a food source available at a particular time, if they have been frightened out of their daytime sleeping spot, or if there is high competition in the area at night from other nocturnal animals.
