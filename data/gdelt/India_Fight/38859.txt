Four cops sacked for taking Rs 6.5 crore of Rs 16.5 crore seized from Jalandhar priest’s house

PATIALA: Four months after police sparked a row by raiding the house of a Jalandhar-based priest and losing Rs 6.5 crore of the Rs 16.5 crore which it seized from there, the state government on Saturday dismissed three assistant sub-inspectors and a head constable, who were part of the raiding team, from service.DGP Dinkar Gupta passed the dismissal orders on the basis of an inquiry by Patiala senior superintendent of police (SSP) M S Sidhu. Sidhu said action against ASIs Joginder Singh, Rajpreet Singh and Dilbagh Singh, and head constable Amrik Singh had been taken under Section 311(2) (B) of the Constitution.The four cops are lodged in Patiala central jail. While ASIs Joginder and Rajpreet had gone missing with the cash they allegedly looted from the priest’s house, Dalbir and Amrik had been arrested for helping them.Police had formed a special investigation team (SIT) for the case. The SIT arrested six others — police informer Surinder Singh, Rajpreet’s uncle Nirmal Singh of Raipur village in Mansa, Joginder’s neighbour Surinderpal alias Chiri of Patran, Mohammad Shakeel and Devinder Kumar of Moonak, and one Sanjeev Kumar.On March 29 this year, Khanna police carried out a raid at Partappura village residence of Father Antony Madasserry, a key functionary of Diocese of Jalandhar, and seized Rs 16.5 crore from there. The next day, Khanna SSP held a presser and claimed that they had seized Rs 9.66 crore of hawala money during checking near Doraha. However, the next day, the priest held a press briefing in Jalandhar and alleged that police took away Rs 16.65 crore from his house and “misappropriated Rs 6.5 crore”.On April 1, Punjab DGP ordered an inquiry and later constituted an SIT under IGP (crime) Parveen Sinha, which cracked the case. On April 30, the SIT arrested the two absconding ASIs from Kochi, which led to additional arrests and seizure of Rs 4.49 crore.
