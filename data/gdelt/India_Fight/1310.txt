Jammu: Heavy firing exchanges took place Thursday between Indian and Pakistan troopers on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Poonch district, defence sources said.

Heavy shelling and firing exchanges between the two armies have been intermittently continuing for the last eight days in Poonch and Rajouri districts.
