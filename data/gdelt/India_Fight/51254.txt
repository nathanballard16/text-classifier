Rani reveals, “What I remember about Mehndi is shooting in Jaipur. I was shooting in and around the city and I think this was the first time ever I had visited Jaipur as a teenager. I was obviously bowled over with the beauty of Rajasthan the moment I saw the city. Jaipur is one just of the most exotic cities and I was loving every bit about this shoot sequence.”

However, an actor’s life is not all that rosy. She adds, “I remember really freezing in the cold there. I was wearing a pink sari in one of the song sequences and I remember it was freezing at that point of time when we shot there. It was tough for me but I managed to pull through.”

Rani cherishes the shooting schedule at Rajasthan. She says, “I also visited Ajmer Sharif for the first time, so it was a very memorable shoot for Mehndi. It felt amazing being there. Mehndi had this huge ensemble cast, so it was one of my first experiences with so many actors together shooting for a film. It was a learning experience for me.”

Mehndi was directed by Hamid Ali Khan and Rani was appreciated for playing the role of a young bride who has to battle the culture of dowry.
