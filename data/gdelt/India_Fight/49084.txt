Bengaluru: In a major crackdown on illegal immigrants in Karnataka, Bengaluru City Crime Branch on Saturday arrested 30 Bangladeshi nationals who were living in the city without any visa. They have been booked under the Foreigners Act and concerned authorities have initiated the deportation process.

Earlier in the month, BS Yediyurappa-led Karnataka government had proposed the National Register of Citizens (NRC) to identify the illegal immigrants living in the state. The decision was announced by state Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai.

According to reports, the BJP-led Karnataka government is mulling over developing detention centres in the state to house illegal immigrants.

Senior BJP leader Ganesh Karnik had suggested, "As a rule, police cannot arrest alleged immigrants, but they need to be deported. But no country will be ready to accept them and, therefore, they need to be kept at the detention centre."

While announcing the decision, Bommai had confirmed that the government had asked the police to prepare a database of illegal immigrants in the state. He also stressed that Karnataka is one of the few states in the country where a lot of illegal immigrants come and settle down.

The Karnataka government's initiative came days after Union Home Minister Amit Shah called for a nationwide NRC. Earlier on August 31, the final NRC list in Assam was published which excluded over 19 lakh from the citizens' list.
