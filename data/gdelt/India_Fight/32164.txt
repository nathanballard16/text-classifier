NEW DELHI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Congress party leader was shot dead on Thursday in India's northern state of Haryana, police said.

Vikas Chaudhary, 38, was gunned down by unknown men in Sector 9 of Faridabad district, on the outskirts of New Delhi, the capital city of India.

"This morning unidentified men fired upon Congress party leader Vikas Chaudhary when he was inside his car," a police official posted in Faridabad said. "Chaudhary was rushed to the nearest medical facility, however, doctors there declared him brought dead."

According to the police, he succumbed to his injury on way to the hospital.

Chaudhary had got into the car after coming back from a gym in the area. The CCTV footage of the incident showed masked men raining bullets on his car.
