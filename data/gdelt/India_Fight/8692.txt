Jaish-e-Mohammed: Crackdown or an eyewash? Under global pressure, Pak Punjab takes over Jaish HQ

Pulwama effect: Masood Azhar gets ‘VVIP shield’ as Pak army takes over Jaish HQ in Bahawalpur

ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI: The government of Pakistan ’s Punjab province on Friday took control of the Islamic seminaries in Bahawalpur of Maulana Masood Azhar-led Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) , the terrorist organisation that owned up to the suicide bombing of a CRPF convoy that killed 40 jawans in Pulwama on February 14 The move came a day after Pakistani PM Imran Khan directed the interior ministry and security institutions to accelerate action against extremist outfits in the country, following a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC), Pakistan’s top civil-military body tasked to make crucial decisions on security and foreign affairs.The takeover of the complex, however, did not impress Indian observers, with reports that Azhar had left Bahawalpur days ago, and remains in the ‘safekeeping’ of the Pakistan military, which regards him as a valuable “asset” in the proxy war against India. There have been similar crackdowns in the past that did not amount to much, such as after the 26/11 attacks on Mumbai, when some Lashkar-e-Taiba camps were raided.The action seems a hasty response to international pressure and the fresh decision of anti-terror financing body FATF to keep Pakistan on the ‘grey list’. Unless backed by concrete steps against Azhar and terror training camps along the Line of Control, taking over the Jaish campus may not amount to much more than Lashkar chief Hafiz Saeed’s sporadic house arrests, which lack any serious intent.The government of Punjab has taken over control of a campus comprising Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah in Bahawalpur, reportedly the headquarters of Jaish-e-Mohammed , and appointed an administrator to manage its affairs,” a spokesperson for the interior ministry said. “Punjab police has taken over security of the campus,” the spokesperson added.He said the action was taken in line with the decision of the NSC meeting on Thursday under the chairmanship of PM Khan. According to the spokesperson, 600 students study on the JeM campus, which has a faculty of 70 teachers.The NSC had also decided to ban Jamaat-ud Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), militant organisations.A subsequent statement issued by the interior ministry spokesperson explained that the Bahawalpur complex was “purely a madressah and Jamia Masjid (central mosque) where scores of orphans and students from underprivileged families are receiving religious and worldly education”, Dawn, a Pakistani English daily, reported.
