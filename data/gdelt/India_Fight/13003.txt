Gujarat: CWC meet on March 12, Congress to firm up strategy for Lok Sabha battle

The Congress Working Committee is set to meet on March 12 in Ahmedabad to firm up its election strategy for the Lok Sabha polls, the party announced on Tuesday. The party's top leadership would take part in the meeting where the strategy for the upcoming Lok Sabha elections would be discussed.

The CWC meeting was originally slated to take place at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel National Memorial at Shahibaug on February 28 but was put off due to rising tension between India and Pakistan following the air strikes.

"The CWC meeting will take place on March 12. All our top leaders will be taking part in the meeting. It will be followed by a prayer meeting at Sabarmati Ashram and public rally at Trimandir in Adalaj," said Manish Doshi, Gujarat Congress spokesperson.

More than 60 party leaders will be attending the CWC meet, which is taking place in Gujarat for the first time since 1961.

Congress president Rahul Gandhi, former president Sonia Gandhi, former prime minister Manmohan Singh, newly inducted general secretary Priyanka Gandhi, and other top leaders of Congress party will take part in the CWC meet and the public rally.

The Congress had drawn a blank in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections as the Narendra Modi wave led the BJP to victory in all 26 seats in the state. However, the Congress is confident of winning a good number of seats in the coming elections.

"Gujarat will lead the way and show to the whole country that the BJP can be defeated in the elections," said leader of opposition Paresh Dhanani.

In a media interaction last week, state Congress in-charge Rajeev Satav said that two more rallies of party president Rahul Gandhi were being planned in the state in March.
