EXCLUSIVE: Varun Dhawan and Street Dancer 3D Producers to do THIS special deed for the dancing community

Varun Dhawan is immensely busy with the dance rehearsals for his next film, titled Street Dancer 3D. We have already witnessed Varun's superb dancing skills in ABCD 2 (2015) and we can only imagine how amazing he is going to be in this Remo D'Souza film. Along with Varun, Shraddha Kapoor reunites with her ABCD 2 team as well and has replaced Katrina Kaif, as the latter was busy with the shoot of Bharat. The duo will soon be heading to Dubai to shoot the climax sequence of the movie.

Now, Pinkvilla has come to know that Varun is planning to do something super special for the dancing community. A source revealed to us, "Varun has a special equation with Suresh Mukund, who is the co-founder of the popular dance group, Kings United. After Kings United clinched victory at NBC's World of Dance, Dhawan was inspired to do something extra special for the dancing community. The actor is now in talks with his producers of Street Dancer 3D to put aside a fund to help and encourage the dancing community in the country."

This is indeed an amazing gesture from Team Street Dancer 3D! Wouldn't you agree?

Meanwhile, talking about the Dubai schedule of Street Dancer 3D, Remo had told Mumbai Mirror, "Yes, we will be shooting in Dubai for a fortnight. It is the second last schedule of our film. The final one is in Mumbai. We are shooting a big song in the city for which rehearsals have begun. It will mostly be shot at indoor locations."
