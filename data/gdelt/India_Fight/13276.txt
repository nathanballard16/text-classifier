Files feared gutted in fire at Delhi CGO complex; 1 killed

CISF sub-inspector succumbed to toxic fumes



NEWDELHI A CISF official died and several files and documents gutted on Wednesday in a major fire at the office of the Ministry of Social Justice in South Delhi’s CGO Complex that also houses other important government offices.



Central Industrial Security Force sub-inspector M P Godara (53) died in the fire on the fifth floor of Pandit Deendayal Antodaya Bhawan, previously known as Paryavaran Bhawan.



The 11-storey building houses several government offices, including that of Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.



Godara, a former Air Force personnel, first noticed the smoke coming out of the fifth floor and reached the spot with other CISF personnel to start evacuating the area. But during the evacuation process, he inhaled toxic gasses and fell unconscious. He was taken to AIIMS, where he died. Godara, a resident of Churu district in Rajasthan, had joined CISF in 2008. He is survived by two sons and wife.



Ministry officials said 80 per cent of the entire B1 wing of the building has been gutted in the fire and several files and documents have been destroyed.



The fire department received a call about the fire at 8.34 am and 25 tenders were rushed, Delhi Fire Services officials said. The fire was brought under control at 10. 50 am. Prima facie, it appears that a short-circuit caused the fire. The exact reason will be ascertained after investigations.
