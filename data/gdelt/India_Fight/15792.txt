Mumbai: Two arrested in magazine editor murder case

The Kashimira police have arrested two people in the murder case of Nityanand Pandey, a 45-year-old editor of the monthly magazine 'India Unbound'. The accused duo identified as Ankita Mishra (24) and Satish Mishra (34) was taken into custody on Sunday night and the duo, on being interrogated, confessed that Pandey was killed over his repeated attempts to sexually harass Ankita for the last two years. While Ankita worked as a receptionist at Pandey's office, Satish used to handle the printing press in Kandivali which publishes the magazine.

A preliminary investigation into the case has revealed that Ankita, who was working under Pandey for the last three years, was frequently molested and sexually harassed by the latter. However, she could not quit the job owing to the fact that she was the only earning member in the family and was facing financial problems. She confided in Satish, who was also having monetary issues with Pandey. The duo then decided to eliminate Pandey.

"The accused duo had started the planning the murder eight days before the D-day. On Friday morning, Satish and Ankita lured an unsuspecting Pandey into visiting a cheap row house which is ready for sale. On the way, Ankita made him drink a protein shake mixed with sleeping pills which made him unconscious. The duo first strangulated him with a rope and after ascertaining that he was dead, they took his body to Khardi and threw him off a deserted bridge," said superintendent of police, Thane rural, Shivaji Rathod.

The duo had removed Pandey's valuables before dumping his body. They had also disposed of Pandey's phone. The police have recovered the ornaments except for the phone.
