Maha teen injured after firecracker bursts inside mouth

A 19-year-old man was injured on Monday after a firecracker burst in his mouth on board a train in Parli in Maharashtra's Parbhani district, 150 kilometres from here, railway police said.

Sayyad Akram, a resident of Pathri in Parbhani, was in the train's toilet when the firecracker went off, and he was found bleeding severely from the mouth by those who rushed to the site, said an official.

"Akram was on his way to Hyderabad with his mother and sister. The train had just arrived at Parli station. We do not know how the firecracker went off or what he was doing with it in his mouth. He is undergoing treatment at a hospital in Ambajogai," the official said.
