Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput to move into their Worli sea-face apartment by year-end?

Shahid Kapoor and Mira Rajput are finally set to move from their Juhu residence into the Worli apartment that the couple dreamt of. Before tying the knot with Mira in 2015, Shahid had booked the apartment. Four years later, the actor and his Mrs are all set to move into their new apartment.

Mumbai Mirror goes on to report that Shahid and Mira would receive possession of the house by the end of the year. “Shahid had been looking to move into a space that would be a better fit for his family of four. And this over 8000 square feet apartment is expected to be ready for possession by the year end,” a source told the daily.

“Shahid was looking for an unrestricted view of the city and the 500 square feet balcony in the new house faces the Bandra Worli sea link, offering a great view of the city’s skyline. The apartment complex also features indoor facilities like spa, swimming pool, gym and ballrooms,” added the source.

Shahid and Mira were blessed with a baby boy Zain Kapoor in September 2018. Now since they are a family of four - Shahid, Mira, daughter Misha and son Zain, the timing for possession of the apartment seems to be perfect. Shahid and Mira would also be neighbours to Deepika Padukone and Anushka Sharma.
