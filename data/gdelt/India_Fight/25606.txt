An ‘international’ debut

To be a film actor was the biggest dream of Ijaaz Ebrahim. An International Local Story, the directorial debut of actor Harisree Ashokan, realised his dream. The youngster plays an important role in the movie, which also features actors like Rahul Madhav, Dharmajan Bolgatty, Bijukuttan, Deepak Parambol, Manoj K. Jayan and Tini Tom.

A business management graduate from Bangalore University, Ijaaz Ebrahim had earlier acted in four short films. “Arjun Ashokan actually gave me the opportunity to be part of An International Local Story. I didn't even know about the project until Arjun called to inform me about the casting call,” says Ijaaz, who is playing the younger version of the character essayed by Tini Tom – Krishnan.

Ijaaz says Krishnan is a rough and tough character. “I had a stunt scene with Mafia Sasi sir,” adds Ijaaz, who even though had only 10 days of shoot considers being part of the film as a great experience.

Ijaaz was one of the three people selected from a thousand aspiring actors who attended the auditions. “My character has similarities with that of Krishna,” says Ijaaz, referring to his short temper. Ijaaz adds that he knew some of the co-stars like Arjun Ashokan, Mafia Sasi and Johns, but majority of them were strangers. After a while, he made friends with everyone on the sets.

Talking about his role, Ijaaz says that it was challenging primarily because it was his first film, but Harisree Ashokan was always there to help and teach him. In 2004, Ijaaz first acted on stage and even then his family was all supportive of him. They have always been there for him and give him all support as he chases his dreams. "My favourite actor is Fahadh Faasil; I follow all his films," says Ijaaz, who takes immense inspiration from Fahadh's acting.

Ijaaz Ebrahim, who is currently working as a media promoter in Ernakulam, has signed two more film projects.
