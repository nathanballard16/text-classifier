World communist movement suffering from 'ideological bankruptcy': Prachanda

The world communist movement is suffering from "ideological bankruptcy", Chairman of the ruling Nepal Communist Party and former prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal 'Prachanda' said on Tuesday.

Prachanda made the remarks on the eve of International Labour Day on May 1 at an event in Kathmandu where he honoured former minister for science and environment and trade union activist Ganesh Shah.

Speaking on the occasion, the former prime minister asked all the workers to "take the side of socialism standing against the imperialist forces."



"The world communist movement is suffering from ideological bankruptcy," Prachanda said, without explaining.

"The international community is not only suffering from political fascism but also from economic fascism as a handful of capitalists are taking control of 90 per cent of world assets," said H Mahadevan, Deputy General Secretary of World Federation of Trade Union.

Trade Unions can be powerful weapons in the hands of workers to change the world social order, said Mahadevan, who is also the president of All India Trade Union Congress.
