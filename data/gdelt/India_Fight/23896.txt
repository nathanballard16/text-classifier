Cong-BJP workers clash during roadshow in Jaipur

A scuffle broke out between Congress workers and BJP supporters after the latter raised pro-Modi slogans during a Congress' roadshow here on Saturday, police said.

The roadshow was being conducted by the Congress in support of party candidate Jyoti Khandelwal.

During the roadshow, a group of people raised slogans in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Reacting to that, Congress supporters allegedly manhandled two-three people and raised slogans like 'chowkidar chor hai' (watchman is a thief).

Police said both the groups were separated within a short span of time and situation was brought under control.
