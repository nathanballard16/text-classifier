PM Modi sent police to my bedroom, agencies being unleashed against rivals: Arvind Kejriwal

Arvind Kejriwal says Prime Minister Narendra Modi sent police to raid his home, and that the cops entered his bedroom and kitchen.

The Delhi chief minister accused PM Modi of wanting to destroy India's federal structure. He said the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED) and the Income Tax (I-T) department were being unleashed against political opponents, and that government machinery was being misused.

Arvind Kejriwal's allegations came in an interview with ANI, in the wake of an extraordinary face-off between the West Bengal government and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

What happened, you ask?

On Sunday, a CBI team tried to enter Kolkata Police Commissioner Rajeev Kumar's home to question him in connection with the Saradha chit fund cases. He's accused to have destroyed evidence.

That sparked the face-off between the state police and the CBI. CBI officials were briefly detained, and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee -- who went to Rajeev Kumar's home -- described the situation as "worse than an emergency".

In his interview with ANI, Arvind Kejriwal asked: How can the CBI enter the police commissioner's house without a warrant?

He described the situation in West Bengal as dangerous, undemocratic, and unconstitutional.

QUICK RECAP: Amid a face-off between the West Bengal government and the CBI, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has accused the Centre of unleashing agencies like the CBI and the ED against political rivals.
