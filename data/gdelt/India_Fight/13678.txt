Jammu Grenade Attack Was Ordered by HuM, Suspect Arrested: J&K Police

J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik, while condemning the grenade attack, announced an ex-gratia of Rs 5 lakh to the next of the kin of the deceased and Rs 20,000 each to those injured in the incident, ANI reported.

Calling it a “heinous and cowardly attack on innocent people”, Malik said, “It was a reaction by anti-nationals and terrorists, as they are losing their grip. The government has come down very heavily on such elements after the Pulwama terrorist attack.”

Meanwhile, MoS Defence, Subhash Bhamre, said that the government has already given “complete liberty to the forces to take all necessary steps”.
