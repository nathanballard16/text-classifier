CAIRO – 18 February 2019: Egypt's Foreign Ministry issued on Sunday a statement condemning the terrorist attack on a bus carrying Indian police elements in Kashmir, killing 44 people and injuring others.



The statement offered Egypt's sincere condolences to the families of the victims and wished the injured speedy recovery. It also reiterated the country's call to consolidate international efforts to eliminate terrorism.



A bomb attack was carried out on Thursday in the disputed region of Kashmir killing 44 paramilitary policemen, making it the worst in decades of insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim majority state.



India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan on Friday to expect a strong response. "We will give a befitting reply, our neighbor will not be allowed to de-stabilize us," Modi said in a speech, after meeting security advisers to discuss options.



The Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed responsibility soon after a suicide bomber rammed an explosives-laden car into a bus carrying police personnel.
