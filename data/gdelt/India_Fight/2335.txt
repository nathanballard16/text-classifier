Bride injured in ‘celebratory firing’ in Delhi, returns after first aid

Bullet grazed her leg and she began bleeding profusely.

A 19-year-old bride walking towards the stage for her ‘jaimala’ ceremony was injured in east Delhi’s Shakarpur during an alleged celebratory firing late on Thursday. She was rushed to a hospital, and returned later to be married in a quiet ceremony.

The incident was reported to have taken place at a community hall in the Shakarpur area. The bride, Pooja Sen, was walking towards the stage for the ceremony when a bullet grazed her leg and she began bleeding profusely. She was rushed to a hospital and the police was informed about the incident.

“Fortunately, the bullet brushed past her right leg and she fell on the stage. After getting first aid from a government hospital, she was back at the wedding venue after four hours and completed the rituals with the groom,” added the police officer. The police said that it was a case of “celebratory firing”, though they were also looking into other possible angles.

Guest identified

“We have identified the guest, who fired the shot, from the bridegroom’s side. The suspect has been identified as Rinku, a florist living with his family in east Delhi’s Shastri Nagar,” said Pankaj Singh, Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP)-East.

“The bride told the police that she did not know Rinku. We have registered a case of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means under Section 326 of the Indian Penal Code and the Arms Act. Rinku fled the wedding venue after the crime. Our teams are looking for him,” said DCP Singh.
