Delhi Police vs lawyers: No coercive action against lawyers for Nov 2 FIRs, directs HC

Probe details of Tis Hazari Court incident

After carrying out a probe for four days, sources in the Delhi Police suspect that false information was spread at the Tis Hazari Court on Saturday that police attacked a lawyer inside the lockup.

As soon as the word spread that a particular lawyer has been "dragged" and "beaten", angry lawyers then attacked the police post and lockup.

So far, no lawyers statement has been recorded. Three have been identified including a woman lawyer who indulged in violence.

Help is being taken from constables (with 20 odd years of experience who regularly go to Tihar Jail with undertrials) to identify the instigators. They have claimed that a few lawyers who indulged in violence are not practising at Tis Hazari.

Injured cops have told SIT officials that the attack on them was planned and many had to run for cover to save themselves.

Police officials, who fired the shots at lawyers, said that it was an act of self-defence and were trying to save their senior. They fired to prevent lawyers from entering the lockup where undertrials were locked, the official said.
