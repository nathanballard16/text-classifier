Srinagar, May 29: Two Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorists, including a Pakistani national, were Tuesday killed in an encounter with security forces in the forests of Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district, police said. Based on specific intelligence inputs, security forces had launched a cordon and search operation in the Kachwan forest area of Kokernag in the south Kashmir district, a police spokesman said.

The operation turned into an encounter as the terrorists opened fire at the search party, he said.

In the subsequent exchange of fire, two gunmen were killed, the official said.

He said one of them was identified as Faisal Nazir Mir, a resident of Anantnag, and incriminating materials recovered at the site of the encounter revealed that the other was a Pakistani citizen.

As per the police records, both were affiliated with the JeM, the official said, adding that Mir had joined the outfit recently.
