Bengaluru: Congress minister DK Shivakumar was quizzed by I-T officials on December 3. His and his associates' properties were raided by the Income-Tax Department in 2017. I-T officials have raided about 50 places along with places of some actors from the Kannada film industry.

The I-T officials told Times Now that it was a long-pending investigation. The investigation is ongoing for almost one year now.
