Indian Army personnel will soon get more firepower with Defence Ministry signing a contract on Tuesday to procure 72,000 Sig Sauer assault rifles under fast-track procedures.

Aiming to modernise the infantry, India has signed the contract with the US for the assault rifles which are already being used by armed forces in the US and several European countries. According to agencies sources, the US firm will have to now deliver the rifles within a year.

The assault rifles could be a game changer for the Indian Army and may be given to troops deployed in areas on the border with China. The need for such rifles was repeatedly pitched in view of evolving security threats from both China and Pakistan.

The Sig Sauer assault rifles are renowned for their firepower as well as reliability in extreme weather conditions. The company which manufactures them claims that the assault rifles can be invaluable for troops using them for tactical operations.

The Indian Army had previously rejected rifles from the Rifle Factory in Ishapore after they failed firing tests.
