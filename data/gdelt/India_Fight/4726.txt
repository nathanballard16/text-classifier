Deputy Commissioner of Police (East Zone) M. Ramesh told reporters that the 19-year-old will be booked for attempt to murder and also under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Ramesh said the boy and the girl had been friends, but a few days ago, her family had approached 'Bharosa Centre', a support centre of Hyderabad police for women and children, alleging that the boy was harassing her. As the boy's family agreed to make him mend his ways, the girl's parents did not lodge a complaint with the police.

However, Bharat continued to pester the girl. As she was not talking to him, he took revenge on her by attacking her.
