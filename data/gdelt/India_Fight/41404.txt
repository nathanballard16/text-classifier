Shahid is currently staying in a sea-facing apartment in Juhu. He was looking for a bigger house for a long time. Shahid and his wife Mira have been wanting to shift ever since Mira was pregnant with their second child Zain. Finally, their wait has ended as the house that they had finalised in Worli is ready for possession . The sea-facing duplex in Worli is as big as they wanted for their family. It's an 8000 square feet apartment. With a 500 square feet balcony. The apartment complex has many amenities including a swimming pool, gym and spa.





The massive house is in the same area where Ranveer Singh stays with wife Deepika Padukone. Deepveer's house is close to Shahid's new abode. Anushka Sharma and Virat Kohli also live in the same locality. Well, we congratulate the actor for this new beginning.
