Mehbooba calls Amit Shah a ‘street ruffian’ after he says Rahul doing ‘ilu ilu’ with terrorists

"Rahul baba's guru Sam Pitroda said do not bomb (Pakistan) but negotiate... Rahul baba if your party wants to do 'Ilu Ilu' with terrorists you can do that. But our intention is clear, if a shot is fired, we will reply with a bomb," Shah said here, addressing an election meeting in support of BJP's Badaun candidate Sanghmitra Maurya.

BJP president Amit Shah Saturday accused the Congress of doing 'Ilu Ilu' with terrorists, in an apparent reference to a popular Bollywood love song from the nineties.

In the song, 'Ilu Ilu' is an acronym for I love you.



"Rahul baba's guru Sam Pitroda said do not bomb (Pakistan) but negotiate... Rahul baba if your party wants to do 'Ilu Ilu' with terrorists you can do that. But our intention is clear, if a shot is fired, we will reply with a bomb," Shah said here, addressing an election meeting in support of BJP's Badaun candidate Sanghmitra Maurya.

This led Mehbooba Mufti, who has been crying hoarse about Section 370, slammed Amit Shah. He said: “You’d be forgiven for assuming this was said by a street ruffian & not a national party president. Rahul Gandhi has paid the price for terrorism with his loved ones so he out of all the people doesn’t need your gangster style advice.”
