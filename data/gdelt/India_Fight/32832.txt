Xiaomi is Moving into the Logistics Business in China

Xiaomi has registered a new trademark for “Xiaomi Express” aiming to offer courier services and express deliveries in China. The trademark was applied for at the China Trademark Office back in August 2018.

Xiaomi Express was registered under six categories which all focused on the shipment of goods. Specifically, these categories are parcel shipping, express delivery, towing, shipping, freight transport, freight storage and transport of valuables.

Registering all these new categories gives us the impression that Xiaomi is going to start shipping their products by themselves. Xiaomi was previously using Fengda Express for shipping services, but apparently, Xiaomi’s customers were not satisfied with it.

Before filing the trademark application, it was reported that Xiaomi is working on launching a “next day” delivery service that will cover more than 150 cities in India. Based on this, there are speculations that “Xiaomi Express” might as well be the official name of this service.

Only in China For Now

Xiaomi’s move to register a logistics trademark is widely seen as an effort to expand into logistics. Courier service is an important component for Xiaomi, a brand that initially sold online only. For now, the courier service is only gonna be a part of China. Its launch in India hasn’t been confirmed yet.

The company still has to obtain an operating license from the State Post Bureau if it wants to run an in-house logistics business, Zhao Xiaomin, a logistics expert, told Beijing News.
