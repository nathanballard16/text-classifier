New Delhi: In a joint operation, two Delhi policemen, an engineering student and a passerby managed to catch bike-borne phone snatchers after a 20-minute chase in Central Delhi.

The incident happened on Saturday morning.

According to a report in Hindustan Times, the two accused targeted a 19-year-old student Abhishek Kumar when he was moving towards Talkatora Stadium at 6 am in the morning. The first year engineering student lives in Kali Bari area in the city.

"I was at the Kali Bari Marg Chauraha and was speaking to a friend over phone when two men on a motorcycle approached me. One of them caught me tightly by my waist while the other snatched my phone and pushed me to the ground," the report quoted Abhishek Kumar as saying.

As the snatchers fled the scene, the victims managed to note down the registration of the bike. Abhishek immediately signaled to stop a passerby to help him stop the snatcher. As the duo reached Mandir Marg police station, they sought the help from a patrolling policeman, who immediately joined the chase. Two other policemen also followed the team to chase the accused.

According to Deputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) Madhur Verma, the chase lasted 20-minute as the accused moved into narrow alleys to evade the police.

The accused have been identified as Mohd Rafique and Shahbaz, both residents of Nabi Karim area in Central Delhi.

"They had been involved in many snatching incidents when they were minors, but got off easily because of their age. This time, they are adults and have been booked for robbery," said Madhur Verma.

The two accused faces up to 10 years in jail if convicted under IPC section 392 (robbery).
