SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, March 13 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen shot dead a 25-year-old youth on Wednesday in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.

The youth was fired upon at village Pingleena in Pulwama district, about 32 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Unidentified gunmen today shot dead a youth namely Showkat Ahmad Naik here," a police official posted in Pulwama said. "He was fired from point-blank range. Despite being removed to a hospital immediately, he succumbed on his way and was declared brought dead at the hospital."

Police suspect militants behind Naik's killing. However, so far no militant outfit has claimed responsibility for the killing.

Naik, according to officials, was previously affiliated with army.

"He was enrolled last year on Jan. 15 in Territorial army and then went to join JAKLI regiment in March. However, in September, he went on three days leave and never returned," Indian army spokesman Col Rajesh Kalia said. "After that he was declared deserter."

Reports said following the killing, contingents of Indian police and army cordoned off the area and launched searches to trace assailants.

Militants in the region usually target families and individuals for their possible links with police and defense agencies. Even people having associations with pro-India political parties and police are targeted at times.
