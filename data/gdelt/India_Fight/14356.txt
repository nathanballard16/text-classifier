Chennai: A 50-year-old man was arrested for murdering his son suspecting him of having illicit affair with his mother at his house in Ramapuram, in the wee hours of Monday.

Police identified the deceased youth as S. Satish (22). According to police, Satish's father Sakthivel, a painter, lived in Senthamil Nagar, Ramapuram, with wife Loganayaki (45), son Sathish and a daughter.

Sources said Shakthivel often picked up arguments with his wife suspecting her fidelity. He even stalked her to work. Sathish who did not like his father suspecting his mother, asked him to mend his thoughts and behaviour. This soon turned out into a personal fight between the son and father.

On the fateful day, Sakthivel, in the middle of the night, stabbed his son sleeping in another room with a knife, and fled the spot. Hearing his screams, his mother Loganayaki and daughter Sangeetha ran to his room. In the melee, Loganayaki also suffered cut injuries on her hand.

Loganayaki with the help of neighbours rushed Satish to a hospital, where doctors declared him 'brought dead'. Based on Loganayaki's complaint, the Royala Nagar police have registered a case and arrested Sakthivel on charges of murder.

Preliminary inquiries revealed that the deceased youth, Satish, worked as a typist while his mother Loganayaki worked as a housekeeping staff in a private hospital in the city. The family lived in a rented house in Ramapuram for one-and-half years.

Police said Sakthivel often picked up quarrels with wife Loganayaki as he suspected her of having an illicit relationship with his son, Satish.
