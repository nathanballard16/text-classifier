Woman Celebrating Anniversary Asks For A Knife To Cut The Cake, Waiter Attacks Her With It

In a rather bizarre incident, an NRI woman who was in Mumbai while on her way to Gujarat was attacked by a hotel waiter with a knife.

Farzana Mirat, who is originally from Gujarat and currently living in South Africa was on her way to attend a wedding in Porbandar on Sunday.

The 30-year-old who was accompanied by her mother went to a hotel in Andheri to celebrate her wedding anniversary.

Among several things, Mirat also ordered a cake to mark her anniversary.

But, when the cake arrived there was no knife to cut it. So she asked the waiter Nishant Gowda to get one. Gowda went back and came back with a knife. But instead of handing it over to Mirat, Gowda attacked the woman on her neck with the knife.

Lucky for her the knife wasn't sharp to inflict a serious injury.

Police who arrested the 23-year-old waiter said he became angry after Mirat kept on ordering things. They also added that he had been “upset” at work even before the incident.
