Soft stand on mob lynching unfortunate; NIA terrorizing Muslims: Mufti Mukarram

New Delhi: Shahi Imam Masjid Fatehpuri Mufti Mohammed Mukarram Ahmed appealed Muslims to pay attention towards education and training of children. He told this during Friday sermon. He asked to engage children in some or other activity so that their life is not ruined.

Shahi Imam said strict action is needed against mob lynching and mere condemnation is not enough. He lamented that NIA is terrorizing Muslims by conducting raids in Delhi and Amroha. It should not arrest innocent Muslims on the basis of mere suspension and should not seize domestic items. He expressed hope that no one could produce evidence against the Muslim youth in the court and they will be soon acquitted.
