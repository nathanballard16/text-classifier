Dalai Lama, 83, taken to hospital with chest infection

Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama has been taken to hospital with a chest infection.

The 83-year-old Buddhist monk was admitted to a hospital in New Delhi, India, yesterday.

His personal secretary, Tenzin Taklha, told Reuters news agency he is in a stable condition and is expected to stay at the hospital for several days.

A day before he was hospitalised, the Dalai Lama posted on his Facebook page: "Violence will never solve problems. While external disarmament is necessary, it's internal disarmament that is crucial."

Following a brutal crackdown of the Tibetan national uprising by Chinese troops, the Dalai Lama was forced to escape into exile in 1959.

Since then, the religious and political leader of the Tibetan people has been living in Dharamsala, northern India.

He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 for his non-violent struggle for the liberation of Tibet.

China took control of Tibet in 1950 and has portrayed the Dalai Lama as a dangerous separatist.

In 2011, clear guidelines for the recognition of the next Tibetan spiritual leader were published.

The Dalai Lama has warned that apart from a reincarnation recognised through legitimate methods, no recognition or acceptance should be given to a candidate chosen for political reasons by anyone, including China.

Sky News has contacted the Dalai Lama's representatives for further information on his condition.
