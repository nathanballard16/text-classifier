Over 1,000 FIRs against traders, yet gutkha mafia thrives in Mumbai

A well-oiled network behind the supply of banned tobacco products such as gutkha, scented supari and pan masala has exposed in the city. A senior police officer says huge consignments of gutkha come to the Mira Road-Bhayandar area and are distributed through a complex and widespread network. Police have conducted over 25 raids in the Mira-Bhayandar area alone in the past few months, but the trade still thrives. In its attempt to expose how the mafia has spread its roots in the city, DNA investigated how the banned tobacco product is openly sold and consumed at every nook and corner. DNA combed Colaba, Marine Drive, Dadar, Bandra, Goregaon, Malad, CST, Borivali, Kandivali, Andheri and Juhu and found that larger stores hide sachets in drawers, but at smaller stalls, citizens can be found chewing gutkha openly.
