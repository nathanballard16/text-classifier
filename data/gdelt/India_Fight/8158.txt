There is fire in my heart, when Kashmiris are killed there: Pervez Musharraf – KashmirWatch

PTK reports from Indian occupied Kashmir

SRINAGAR: Former Pakistan president General Pervez Musharraf said that PM Modi says there is a fire in my heart. I say that when Kashmiris are killed there, there is a lot of fire in my heart, Kashmiri children get pills in their eyes, then tears in my eyes.

In an Interview with Aaj Tak Musharraf said that I express my heartfelt sympathies to the soldiers killed in the Pulwama. My whole sympathy for his family. I have lost my best friend in the 1971 war. I know what happens to the loss of losing ones.

Musharraf said that after the attack, the kind of environment in India is very provocative. The manner in which the channels are being given to Pakistan in debate of TV channels there is not good.

He further added “At this time all Indian channels are giving abuses to all Pakistan. From the very next day of the attack all are blaming Pakistan. Swabs are being used for Pakistan in the debit of TV channels”.

Former Pakistan president General Pervez Musharraf said that Narendra Modi, did not have any “real emotion” for the CRPF personnel killed in the Pulwama attack.

President Pervez Musharraf said if Pakistan was attacked then it would be the biggest mistake of Modi’s life. Musharraf said stop threatening Pakistan. You can not teach us a lesson.

Musharraf added, “I don’t think Imran Khan should or will have any sympathy for Jaish. And I don’t believe Pakistan government was involved in it.” (PTK)
