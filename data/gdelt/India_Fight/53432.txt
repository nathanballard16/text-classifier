Indian policewoman poses as bride to arrest wanted criminal

MADHYA PRADESH (Dunya News) – An undercover police officer in India’s Madhya Pradesh posed as a bride to detain murder absconder, Balkishan Choubey.



“When I was preparing to meet him, I kept reminding myself of his habit of carrying guns and shooting without hesitation,” 28-year-old sub-inspector Madhvi Agnihotri told.



“I initiated a conversation with him as ‘Radha Lodhi’. I told him that I am from Chhattarpur and works as a laborer in Delhi. After chatting for three days, he offered me to marry me,” the policewoman said.



“A loaded pistol was seized from him,” said Madhvi, adding: “He looked completely shocked when I said, ‘Radha, aa gayi’ after his arrest.”



Choubey was wanted in 15 cases of murder and robbery.
