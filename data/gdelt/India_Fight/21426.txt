Word 'Hindutva' not in my dictionary; Person who used 'Hindu terror' was made minister by BJP: Digvijaya Singh

"I think they do not have the knowledge of Hindu civilisation. The person who, as home secretary, issued a statement with the word Hindu terror was given Lok Sabha ticket by the BJP and was made a Union minister," Singh told reporters here.

BHOPAL: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, who was often targeted by the BJP for allegedly using the term Hindu or saffron terror, has said the word Hindutva does not exist in his dictionary. While speaking to the media in Bhopal, from where he is contesting the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, the former Madhya Pradesh chief minister said the word Hindutva did not exist for him. "Why do you use the word Hindutva? The word does not exist in my dictionary," he said. Amid the political row over the term Hindu terrorism, the Congress had pointed earlier that it was used by Union minister R K Singh when he was home secretary. Singh was a Union home secretary during the UPA regime and later joined the BJP and became minister. Apparently referring to Singh, Digvijaya claimed that the BJP made the person who used the term "Hindu terror" in official parlance a Union minister.
