Is Saif Ali Khan playing Islamabad's Indian diplomat JP Singh in upcoming flick?

Saif Ali Khan's having a good year.

The actor is all set to return to Netflix with the second season of Sacred Games and is currently shooting Jaawani Jaaneman with Tabu. Mumbai Mirror is now reporting that the actor has signed another flick already: a gritty drama based on the true story of Delhi's Dr. Uzma Ahmed who allegedly fell in love with a Pakistani cab driver, Tahir Ali in Malaysia.

When she arrived in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, she discovered that Ali was already married with four children. She then claimed that she was forced to marry him on gun point and was subjected to torture. Uzma and Ali had subsequently filed petitions in the Islamabad High Court.

While the former had requested to be repatriated to India, Ali had asked to be allowed to meet his wife. The IHC eventually allowed Uzma to return to India via Wagah border.

Khan will be playing Islamabad's Indian Deputy High Commissioner JP Singh who, along with Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, was instrumental in getting Uzma home.

Ritesh Shah of Pink fame is adapting the story for the big screen whereas Shivam Nair will be directing. The filmmakers are still on the hunt to cast Uzma's role; no release date has been announced yet but the movie's production is expected to hit floors early next year.
