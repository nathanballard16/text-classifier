Comedian Trevor Noah Thrashed by Netizens for Ridiculing Indo-Pak Standoff

New Delhi (Sputnik): South Africa-born comedian Trevor Noah was excoriated by social media users for making light of the on-going India-Pakistan exchange of fire in restive Kashmir; Twitter users swore at him and called him everything from an 'insensitive artiste' to an outright racist.

I’ve really always liked ur humour @Trevornoah. Really have. And we In India have a good sense of humour. This still crosses a line. We’ve lost our forces to terror attacks. Somehow it doesn’t sound as funny. #JustSaying #TheDailyShow pic.twitter.com/qknBmi6qfd — Sonal Kalra (@sonalkalra) February 28, 2019

One person spoke about the irony of a black man from South Africa engaging in "stereotypical racism".

There was nothing funny about Trevor Noah from the very get go…



What's ironic here is… as a black man hailing from South Africa of all places, he is indulging in stereotypical racism regarding matters like war and terrorism. — RAY (@BeingAntiHero) February 28, 2019

Another user insisted that he didn't compare favourably with his popular Daily Show predecessor.
