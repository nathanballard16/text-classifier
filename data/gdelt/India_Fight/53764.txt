Change the Law, Hang the Rapists – Protesters Demand Death Penalty for Telangana Rapists

Udupi: Like-minded youth organised a protest at the war memorial at Ajjarkad on Tuesday, December 3 against the rape and murder of a doctor in Hyderabad.

The protesters wore black bands and carried placards that read “We want justice” and “Hang the rapists”. On November 28, a veterinary Doctor was brutally raped and murdered in Hyderabad.

Addressing the gathering Pramod Uchil said that a veterinary Doctor was gang-raped and brutally killed by four persons before they burnt her body at Shamshabad in Telangana’s Ranga Reddy district last week. The accused have been arrested by the Cyberabad Police.

He demanded the Union government to hang the rapists within six months of their conviction. Stressing that implementation of the law is important, he demanded strict laws that punish the guilty in crimes against women within a fixed time-frame. If the laws are implied and the police do their investigation properly then we will be able to give justice to the victim. We want the accused to be hanged, he said.

Meanwhile, Karnataka veterinary association Udupi district held a protest march from Manipal to the DC office on Tuesday regarding Dr Priyanka Reddys gruesome murder. The protesters condemned the heinous crime.
