PIL in High Court seeking CBI probe over YS Viveka Murder case

Hyderabad: As the sensational murder case of former minister YS Vivekananda Reddy is coming to a conclusion. Since the last four days, SIT officials and Pulivendula police are conducting the investigation in the case.

So far, the police have interrogated nearly 20 suspects and have collected important clues in the case. It's also said that the investigation will be concluded in coming one or two days.

At this crucial time, a PIL has been filed in the high court seeking CBI to investigate YS Vivekananda Reddy murder case.

This PIL was filed by the Republic Party of India working president B Anil. In the petition, he stated that they have no confidence in the Special Investigation Team (SIT) which was formed by the AP government.

He requested HC, that CBI should investigate this case and all the accused should be punished. On this petition, the high court is going to conduct the hearing on Tuesday.

Along with YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, other YSRCP leaders are demanding CBI investigation since the murder time.

But the AP government has clarified that SIT investigation is sufficient to track the case. Now all eyes are on the high court decision.

On hearing the petition, if the high court gives nod for CBI investigation, then it will be a victory for YSRCP, and if it agrees with the government decision of SIT, then it will be benefited to the TDP government.

There are chances that high court may ask the AP government to file a counter affidavit in the case.
