Kamal Haasanâ€™s MNM party explains his remarks on Nathuram Godse, says he was quoted 'out of context'

New Delhi:

Actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan’s Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) on Wednesday tried to explain the party chief comments on Mahatma Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Ghodse and said that Haasan was calling for “religious tolerance and co-existence”.

“This has been taken absolutely out of context and the speech has been painted as anti -Hindu with a malafide intent. This has created complete confusion and utmost anxiety amongst many common citizens who are not privy to this larger conspiracy,” the MNM said, according to news agency ANI.

The Tamil Nadu police Tuesday filed an FIR against actor-politician Kamal Haasan for his controversial "free India’s first extremist was a Hindu" remarks referring to Nathuram Godse. Several saffron organisations had moved the courts in Delhi against the actor-politician. However, the Delhi High Court dismissed petition against Haasan, and said that the petitioner Ashwini Upadhyay may approach the appropriate forum as the incident took place in Tamil Nadu.

Haasan had said on Sunday that “free India’s first extremist was a Hindu”, referring to Nathuram Godse who killed Mahatma Gandhi. Mahatma Gandhi was shot dead by Nathuram Godse on January 30, 1948, in New Delhi.

"I am not saying this because this is Muslim-dominated area, but I am saying this before a statue of Gandhi. Free India’s first extremist was a Hindu, his name is Nathuram Godse. There it (extremism, apparently) starts," he said in bypoll-bound Aravakurichi.

BJP and AIADMK condemned him for his remarks, though Congress and rationalist outfit Dravidar Kazhagam backed him.

Tamil Nadu had gone to polls for 38 Lok Sabha seats and 18 Assembly by-polls on April 18. Voting for four more assembly by-polls will be held on May 19 along with the last phase of the national election.
