A Designer Who Views the World as a Collage

“Growing up, I saw the atelier as a whimsical playground full of bright patterns, watercolors, paintbrushes and pens,” says the designer Veronica Etro, who is in her 22nd year at the house her father, Gimmo Etro, founded in 1968. The Milan-based label started as a textile purveyor to other houses before expanding into a full-fledged fashion brand known for its bohemian sensibility, rich color combinations and signature paisleys — the latter inspired by Gimmo’s travels to India, which led him to become obsessed with the tear-dropped motif, just like Mughal Empire courtiers and 18th-century Parisians before him. Veronica, too, showed a taste for prints at a young age. After studying fashion at Central Saint Martins in London, she returned to Milan to help design Etro’s ready-to-wear at the age of 23. Three years later, in 2000, she debuted her first collection as the creative director of women’s wear, and still oversees the family business with her father and three older brothers today.

Her perspective now extends far beyond the walls of the workshop: The 45-year-old is an avid traveler who embodies her vision of the freewheeling Etro woman. Her aesthetic is global: Indian passementeries and Javanese and Moroccan silks collide with Japanese intarsias in her designs for silk kimonos, jacquard duster coats and fringed ponchos. “I think of the world as a collage,” she says. Indeed, Etro’s spring 2019 collection evokes a fictional Pacific island where tropical Hawaiian florals and ancient Japanese calligraphy flourish alongside Southern California-style surf and skate culture. “I’ve never been too literal,” she says. “I think the most interesting expressions of creativity are those that go beyond reality.”
