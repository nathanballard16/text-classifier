TTV takes aim at Dravidian majors

The Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) deputy general secretary T.T.V. Dhinakaran on Tuesday devoted his last day’s campaign for the Lok Sabha elections to attack the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) strongly.

Mr Dhinakaran, who went to different parts of the North and Central Chennai constituencies in support of his nominees, said the DMK had been “cheating” people of the State under the garb of having formed a “secular alliance.”

Despite being a constituent of the Congress-led government at the Centre between 2004 and 2013, it had acted “selfishly,” neglecting interests of the State. The party had remained a “mute spectator” when a large number of Sri Lankan Tamils were killed in the final stages of the civil war in 2009. This was why people of the State had “punished” the DMK in the 2011 Assembly and 2014 Lok Sabha polls. In the R.K. Nagar by-election, the party had to forfeit deposit.

He blamed the DMK for getting the by-election to the Tiruvarur assembly constituency postponed a few months ago as the latter was “apprehensive” of losing the by-poll, if held. He also pulled up the DMK for, what he called, carrying on a “false propaganda” that if minorities voted for him, this would pave the way for the success of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Referring to the by-elections to 18 Assembly constituencies, the AMMK founder said this had provided an opportunity to voters to bring to an end the regime led by Edappadi K. Palaniswami, which had been surviving due to Mr Modi’s “support.” The defeat of the AIADMK in the R.K. Nagar by-election was a reflection of the will of the people in the constitutency, rejecting the government of “traitors.”
