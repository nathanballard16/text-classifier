New Delhi: US fast-food chain McDonald’s and its estranged Indian partner Vikram Bakshi are reportedly working towards an out-of-court settlement after six years of acrimonious legal battles, the two parties informed a two-member National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) bench, headed by SJ Mukhopadhyay.



"We have informed the courts that a settlement is in progress with Mr Bakshi. However, we do not have any details to share at this point,” McDonald’s director for corporate relations Barry Sum said in a statement. McDonald’s, however, did not mention any timeline for the settlement.



The bench directed either of the parties may file an affidavit including the terms of the settlement being arrived at on the next date of hearing on May 13.



In 1995, McDonald’s had inked a 25-year partnership agreement with Bakshi to open its outlets in India in the North and East. At that time, the partnership was a 50:50 venture between McDonald’s India and Bakshi’s Connaught Plaza Restaurant Ltd (CPRL), wherein the latter would be responsible for opening and managing outlets of the US fast food chain in the country.



In August 2013, Bakshi was removed as the managing director of the joint venture, triggering the acrimonious legal battle. Bakshi challenged his ouster at the Company Law Board (now National Company Law Tribunal), alleging McDonald’s India of mismanagement and oppression.



In 2017, McDonald India terminated the franchise deal of 165 outlets managed by CPRL citing non-payment of royalties. Mc Donald India told the NCLAT at that time that a settlement of the dispute with Bakshi was not possible. Bakshi continues to run 165 McDonald's branded outlets in the northern and the eastern regions. In the southern and western regions, McDonald’s outlets are managed by Amit Jatia-led Westlife Development, according to a report in the Economic Times.
