Rubabuddin Sheikh files appeal in Bombay HC against acquittal of 22 accused

Bombay High Court

Madhya Pradesh

Ahmedabad

Slain gangster Sohrabuddin Sheikh’s brother Rubabuddin has approached theseeking to set aside the acquittal of 22 accused in the case and, in the alternate, a retrial alleging the “entire trial was vitiated from the beginning.”“The observations and conclusion made by the Special Judge whilst passing the impugned order were contradictory to the evidence. The order is full of perversity which is devoid of any reasonableness. The Special Judge bases his judgement on unwarranted assumptions and manifestly erroneous appreciation of evidence. His actions have led to substantial miscarriage of justice and hence interference of this court is justified in order to secure the ends of justice,” Rubabuddin’s appeal says.Then special Central Bureau of Investigation judge SJ Sharma had acquitted all the accused in December, last year, after the trial lasted a little over a year. The judge had made various observations against the prosecution’s case, and had ruled that entire chain of circumstances was not proved, resulting in acquittal of all the accused.Rubabuddin’s appeal, filed through Advocate Gautam Tiwari, says that in a case where over 200 witnesses were examined by the prosecution, and over 90 were declared hostile. In all 118 witnesses were not declared hostile.It adds that there were various witnesses whose statements were either recorded before a Magistrate or video recorded by the investigating officers, but, either these statements were not cited, or not produced before the trial court.Sohrabuddin, a criminal from, was gunned down on November 26, 2005, nearin a joint operation by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad and the Rajasthan Police’s Special Task Force.The then Gujarat ATS chief, DG Vanzara, announced the encounter in a press conference, saying Sohrabuddin was on a Lashkar-e-Toiba and ISI mission to kill an important leader. Kauser Bi, who was accompanying Sohrabuddin, and was picked up by the police team long with him, was allegedly killed and her body was burned three days after Sohrabuddin’s killing.Citing certain Supreme Court judgments in cases related to police encounters, the appeal says that the special judge should have kept this principle in mind that it is not easy to have direct evidence in cases of alleged fake encounters.“It is well settled law that in cases of fake police encounter direct evidence is hard to come and the prosecution may rely on circumstantial evidence. Moreover, it has been time and again held by the SC that there should not be insistence on direct and ocular evidence as the offenders are police and the investigators are police too,” the appeal read.Pointing at the evidence of 22 witnesses, the appeals says that their evidence “clearly and unmistakably corroborates the entire sequence of event leading upto the fake encounters of Sohrabuddin and Tulsiram Prajapati and also the killing of Kauser bi.” The appeal will come up for hearing in due course.
