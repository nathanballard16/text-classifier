New Delhi: The armies of India and Myanmar in a joint operation during February 17 to March 2 dismantled the terror camps inside Myanmar territory against insurgents in order to avoid a possible threat to the Kaladan multi-modal transit project which is vital to North-East India, reported the news agency PTI. The Indian Army did not cross the border during the operation. The Kaladan multi-modal transit project will link India’s north-east to Myanmar.

The target of the joint operation was the insurgent group Arakan Army, the report said. The insurgents had moved close to the international border with Myanmar along the state of Mizoram, the report said. The Indian Army beefed up security along the border from Nagaland to Manipur to make sure the insurgents do not cross the border and move into India. The Arakan Army is a designated terror group by Yangon.

The Indian Army provided intelligence to the Myanmar Army during the operation. The Indian Army had intelligence report that the members of the Arakan Army planned to cross-over into India. The armies of the two countries were concerned about reports of the insurgent group setting up camps.

A large scale joint operation was launched by the Indian and Myanmar armies to flush out the insurgents which posed a threat to the coveted project inking Mizoram to Myanmar. The first part of the operation targeted the camps near Mizoram while the second phase of the operation targeted the deadly Naga group NSCN(K).
