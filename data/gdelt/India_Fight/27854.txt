New Delhi: Supporters of Samajwadi Party leader Mulayam Singh Yadav thrashed villagers in Mainpuri for not voting for the party patriarch.

The shocking incident was reported from Unva area when people from the Yadav community entered the village and started beating the villagers for not voting.

After the incident, State Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Commission Chairman Brij Lal directed the Superintendent of Police Ajay Shankar Rai to visit the spot where the incident took place and provide security guards to those who were attacked.

Lal has also ordered the police officials to file a case against the accused under the SC/ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act.

Mulayam Singh Yadav won Mainpuri Parliamentary seat with a margin of 94,389 votes. He was pitted against Prem Singh Shakya of the BJP.

Post-poll violence has been reported in many states.

Just a few days ago, Smriti Irani’s close aide Surendra Singh, a former head of Baraulia village, was shot dead. The police later claimed that local political rivalry was behind the murder and three suspects have been arrested so far.

West Bengal also witnessed a surge in attacks on BJP workers and violent incidents were reported from Paharpur in Jalpaiguri, Dinhata in Coochbehar, and Gangarampur in Dakshin Dinajpur.

A Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) worker was shot dead in North 24 Parganas district of West Bengal while he was driving a two-wheeler.

While the BJP has blamed the TMC for the attack on party workers, West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee has said that the state government has not received any such reports.

The BJP inflicted a crushing blow to the TMC in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls by winning 18 of total 42 Lok Sabha seats in the state while the TMC managed to get 22 seats.
