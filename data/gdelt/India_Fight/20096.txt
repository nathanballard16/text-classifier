New Delhi, Apr 11: The first phase of voting was held across 91 Lok Sabha constituencies on Thursday. Election 2019 kicked off to a troubled start with two people being killed in clashes in Andhra Pradesh, IED blasts in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, reports of EVM glitches and multiple complaints from voters about their names not being on the electoral list.

As round one of the seven-phase Lok Sabha election began in 91 constituencies across the length and breadth of India, from the hills of Kashmir to the islands of Andaman and Nicobar, reports of unrest and irregularities cast shadows over the world's biggest poll process.

There were reports of violence from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh while the chiefs of several parties, including TDP's N Chandrababu Naidu, AAP's Arvind Kejriwal and PDP's Mehbooba Mufti, came forward to complain about administrative and other lapses.

More than 14 crore people were listed to vote in the first phase, held in 91 Lok Sabha constituencies spread across 18 states and two union territories. The votes for the election, being held over seven phases, will be counted on May 23.

The Election Commission said 0.73 % of the ballot units and 0.61 % of the control units of electronic voting machines had to be replaced. Also, the commission said 1.7 per cent of the VVPATs were replaced. This is the first Lok Sabha election where VVPATs have been attached to all voting machines.
