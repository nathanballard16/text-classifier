Many Hurt in Gang War in Masaurhi in Patna District

Patna: Gang war in Masaurhi, about 30 kilometers from the state capital, led to some tense moment on Tuesday as gunshots filled the air in Kumhar Toli leaving several injured, including several law enforcement officials.

The trouble began when a man with long criminal history was shot in Kumhar Toli by a rival gang-member on Tuesday morning. Soon the members of the victim's gang, in an attempt to exact revenge from the other gang, arrived at Rahmatganj where they began pelting stones at the rival gang-members.

The situation, however, escalated in a matter of minutes when criminals began firing at each other. They also vandalized properties and vehicles.

When the police arrived, they were caught in the crossfire and at least eight cops, including Dhanarua police station in-charge Ajay Kumar Singh, were hurt in the incident. The mob also attacked the vehicle of City Superintendent of Police (SP) Rajendra Kumar though he somehow managed to escape injury.

Patna District Magistrate (DM) Kumar Ravi and Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Manu Maharaj reached the scene and tried to keep the crowd under control but when that failed to yield the desired result, police were ordered to open lathi charge on the miscreants. They also lobbed tear gas shells forcing the mob to disperse and retreat.

Reports said the dispute between the two gangs began a few days ago on a playground in Masaurhi. As a result of this, criminals in Rahmatganj shot one Suraj Kumar of Kumhar Toli on Tuesday morning. He was rushed to the Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH) for treatment.

Four men were arrested in the case and many more were expected to be arrested later, the SSP said.
