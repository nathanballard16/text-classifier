Kejriwal’s car attacked in outer Delhi

Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s car was allegedly attacked by a mob armed with sticks in Narela on Friday, an official in the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said. The incident occurred when Kejriwal had gone to the outer Delhi locality to inaugurate development works in 25 unauthorised colonies. However, nobody was hurt in the said attack, the police said.

“Attack took place in police presence on the route cleared by area DCP. This is fifth such attack on the Chief Minister in last three years. Under political pressure from the Central Government, Delhi Police has deliberately allowed these attacks,” quoted a statement from the CMO.

Interestingly, Kejriwal’s vehicle was moving along the route cleared by the Deputy Commissioner of Police of the area, when the BJP workers armed with sticks attacked the vehicle in police presence.

“The police, in its presence allowed the BJP workers to surround the Chief Minister’s vehicle, block it and bang the window panes of the vehicle in full public view with sticks, the Government said in their statement. “Instead of making any effort to prevent these goons from reaching the Chief Minister, it seemed the Delhi Police personnel present at the spot were more interested in escorting them till the Chief Minister’s vehicle,” the Government further stated. A group of about 100 men tried to stop Kejriwal’s car and attacked it with sticks.

Meanwhile, Delhi Police has refuted any breach of security of the Chief Minister. Former MLA of BJP Neeldaman Khatri and his followers were tried to gherao the Chief Minister but the same was foiled by alert police officers. ACP Narela who was piloting the car of Kejriwal got down and cleared the passage for the official, vehicle of the Chief Minister who later went to attend the function in school and remained there for two hours. The Chief Minister was provided full security and escorted to his next destination, a senior police official said.
