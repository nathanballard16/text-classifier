New Delhi:

A soldier was killed after Pakistani rangers on Friday violated ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir’s Krishna Ghati sector. Defence PRO Jammu said, "One Army jawan has lost his life in ceasefire violation by Pakistan in KG sector of Mendhar sub-division." This year, according to officials, Pakistan has violated the ceasefire along the LoC over 2,000 times, leaving 21 Indians dead and scores injured.

In July, there were 296 cases of ceasefire violations (CFVs), 307 in August and 292 in September, sources said. September also recorded 61 caliber escalation, implying usage of mortar and heavy ammunition.

In July 2018, the Army had recorded 13 cases of CFVs, followed by 44 in August and 102 in September. In 2017, there were 68 cases of CFVs in July, followed by 108 in August and 101 in September.

In September this year, of the 292 cases, the area north of Pir Panjal recorded 42 cases of cross-border firing, while the rest were reported in the south of the mountain ranges.

The ties between India and Pakistan have been severely strained since the repealing of the special provisions under Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5. The state of Jammu and Kashmir has been bifurcated into Union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.
