At downsized VS hospital, drug shortage poses new challenge

After the inauguration of the SVP hospital by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on January 17, the superintendent of VS hospital, Sandeep T Malhan, was transferred there. AdvertisingAbdul Razak Sheikh was taken to the VS General Hospital for an anti-rabies shot in the afternoon. As for the anti-rabies vaccines, we have only a single supplier Pune-based Serum Institute of India. Less than a month after the VS Hospital was downsized with over 600 of its beds being transferred to the new Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation-run hospital is witnessing a shortage of everyday drugs. How can I afford the anti-rabies vaccine which costs some Rs 350-400 per dose,” said Gulam Rabbani, his son who had taken Sheikh to the hospital.
