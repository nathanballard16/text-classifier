Republic Day or Black Day?

THE governor of India-held Kashmir has sent out a memo ordering all government officials in the state to attend India’s 70th Republic Day function falling on Jan 26. The memo goes on to state that: “Absence will be construed as a dereliction of duty and disobedience and court strict action.”

The ‘order’ is sequel to the realisation that last year local residents had boycotted the 69th Republic Day. In its stead they observed Jan 26 as a black day.

According to an Al-Jazeera report of Jan 26, 2018 regarding the 69th Republic Day, internet and phone networks in the state were blocked and a security clampdown imposed.

The report states: “Barricades were set up on all major roads of the city as thousands of soldiers patrolled the streets and carried out stop and search operations. Since 1989, 70,000 Kashmiris have been killed in the military crackdown.”

Continued occupation of Kashmir by the Indian army and economic neglect has destroyed tourism and other economic sectors of the occupied state.

An Indian parliamentary standing committee which visited the state was appalled to see the pathetic state of affairs particularly in the education sector.

Schools — particularly girls’ schools — had no access to basic facilities like electricity in sub-zero temperature, boundary walls, playgrounds, drinking water, etc. The occupied Kashmir ranks sixth in terms of number of untrained teachers which number more than 27,000.

It is time the Modi Sarkar listened to its own parliamentary delegations if not international rapporteurs about the Kashmiris’ pathetic plight.
