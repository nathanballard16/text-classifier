Choor choor ho jayega: Mamata Banerjee warns BJP against clashing in West Bengal

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has once again hit out at BJP and this time she has said anyone who clashes with the Trinamool Congress, will be completely demolished.

Speaking at an Eid gathering in Bengal on Wednesday, Mamata Banerjee said, "Jo humse takrayega, woh choor choor ho jayega (Anyone who takes on us will be demolished)".

She also drew an analogy with sunrise and the BJP's rise in West Bengal. Mamata Banerjee said that when the sun comes up, it is initially very harsh, similarly BJP has risen by capturing EVMs and they will also go down in the same way.

Meanwhile, accusing the BJP of mixing religion with politics, Trinamool MP Abhishek Banerjee on Tuesday mocked the party's new "Jai Maha Kali" slogan, saying the saffron camp has replaced its "Jai Shri Ram" slogan as Ram's TRP is on a downward slide after the elections.

The BJP had on Monday said Bengal is the land of Maha Kali and the party's slogans in the state will be "Jai Shri Ram" and "Jai Maha Kali".

"They (BJP) have decided to change the slogan from Jai Shri Ram to Jai Maha Kali as the TRP of Ram is on a downward slide. They are mixing religion with politics," Abhishek, who is also nephew of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said while addressing a protest rally against fuel price hike in Kolkata.

BJP, on the other hand, continues with its attack on Mamata Banerjee and her party.

BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has said that the Trinamool government in West Bengal may not even be able to complete its term and urged his party workers to prepare themselves as an "alternative force" before the assembly election.

Addressing his first meeting with elected representatives and state office bearers after the Lok Sabha election, Vijayvargiya, who is the Bharatiya Janata Party's incharge of the state, lashed out at Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for being "an arrogant administrator".
