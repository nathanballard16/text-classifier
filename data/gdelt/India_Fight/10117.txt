Only a day after the Indian Air Force (IAF) destroyed the biggest Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Pakistan, the existing tension between the two countries after the Pulwama terror attack has escalated further.

Meanwhile, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj on Wednesday raised the recent Pulwama suicide attack on the CRPF soldiers in her bilateral meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, a day after India destroyed a major terror training camp in Pakistan.

"I am visiting China at a time when there are grief and anger in India. It is the worst terrorist attack directed against our security forces in Jammu and Kashmir," she said.

Swaraj met her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi during the Russia-India-China Foreign Ministers' meeting on February 27.

She is attending the 16th Foreign Ministers Meeting of Russia-India-China (RIC) in Wuzhen, China.

The External Affairs Minister will also hold bilateral discussions with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, besides the Chinese Foreign Minister.
