Cong, NC want to secede Kashmir from India: Shah

NEEMUCH/RAJGARH (MP), May 2(Agencies): BJP chief Amit Shah today Thursday claimed the Congress and National Conference wanted Kashmir’s separation from India and vowed to scrap Article 370 if ‘his party is voted back to power.’

Shah addressed three rallies in Madhya Pradesh, where three phases of Lok Sabha polls are yet to be held.

Speaking at Ashta in Dewas Lok Sabha constituency, Shah said, “If elected to power again, Article 370 (which gives a special status to Jammu and Kashmir) will be wiped out from its roots.”

On National Conference leader Omar Abdullah’s demand for a separate PM for J&K, Shah said the Congress also wanted a separate PM for Kashmir. But BJP would never allow it to happen, he said.

Shah said that under the Narendra Modi regime, a bullet fired by Pakistan would be met with a shell from India’s side. Shah sought to underscore the difference between the approach of the previous UPA and that of the present NDA Government to national security.

The Manmohan Singh Government did not say a word when terrorists from Pakistan “beheaded Indian jawans,” the BJP chief alleged.

On the other hand, the Modi Government carried out air strikes in Balakot in the neighboring country after 40 CRPF personnel were killed in Pulwama terror attack in February this year, he said.

“Modi is a man with 56-inch chest. He gave orders to the Air Force and our fighter jets bombed Balakot, destroying terror camps,” Shah said.

He alleged that the entire country celebrated India’s retaliation in Balakot, “but Pakistan and Rahul Baba (Congress president Rahul Gandhi) and Company were sad.”
