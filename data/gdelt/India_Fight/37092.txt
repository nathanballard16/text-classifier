Hajipur triple rape-murder: Telangana police file 3 chargesheets against accused

Nearly three months after the sensational rape-murder case involving three minors in Hajipur, the Rachakonda police have filed three different chargesheets in a local court in Nalgonda.

The investigating officer submitted forensic lab reports, technical evidence like his mobile location during the incident, and eyewitness accounts to the court as part of the evidence.

The Times of India quoted a police officer as stating that they are looking to fast track the case. “Steps are being taken to conduct trial by fast track court and to ensure conviction of the accused Srinivas Reddy, who is currently lodged in Warangal Central Jail.’’

The accused, M Srinivas Reddy, is allegedly a serial rapist and murder. He is accused of raping and murdering four women, among which three of the victims are minor girls.

The accused used to target girls. Since the village did not have enough bus services, he would offer the victims a ride on his bike, abduct and rape them.

However, he was arrested while police were probing the ‘missing case’ of a girl from Hajipur in April, who did not return from school. During investigation, the girl’s bag was found at an abandoned well in Hajipur. Soon, police established the role of Srinivas, who belonged to the same village, in the crime. He was arrested on April 28.

During investigation, police found out that Srinivas had killed two other minor girls from the same village before raping them, and disposed them by burying in an abandoned well. Police and villagers were shocked when they recovered dead bodies of the victims from the same well.

Angry villagers demanded that the accused be shot dead. They ransacked the accused’s house, and the accused’s family have fled the village fearing violence.

Police have now closed the well with debris. Further, they have increased public bus services to prevent such an incident.
