Bootleg liquor kills more than 100 in northeastern India

In 2015, more than 100 people died in Mumbai, India’s financial capital, after consuming tainted liquor. The victims were mostly daily-wage laborers from one of the city’s slums who reportedly bought small plastic packets of bootleg alcohol for less than 10 cents. Another mass poisoning from illicit liquor took place in 2011 in the state of West Bengal, where more than 140 people were killed.
