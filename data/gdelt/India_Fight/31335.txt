Hurriyat ready for talks, says J&K governor

SRINAGAR: J&K governor Satya Pal Malik on Saturday said that the situation in the Valley had improved over the past year and that Hurriyat leaders were ready for unconditional talks with the government.At a function in Srinagar during the distribution of Doordarshan set-top boxes to residents in border areas, Malik said, “Hurriyat leaders who once shut the door on Ram Vilas Paswan when he approached them for talks (2016) are now ready for a dialogue. This is an encouraging sign.” The governor shared his concern about the youth in Kashmir and said there is need to address their displeasure.There are 22,000 students from Kashmir who study outside the state. For any issue, we have appointed liaison officers so students are not made to go to the police station. “There is a lot of thought being given as to what kind of scheme is needed to bring around the youth who are misled,” Malik said.“But when someone opens fire, the security forces will return fire. They will not offer a bouquet of flowers.” Noting the situation in the Valley had improved since he took office in 2018, Malik said recruitment of militants had almost stopped and stone-pelting incidents on Fridays had ended. “I feel good the temperature has come down significantly since the day I arrived here,” he said.“There is change everywhere. New recruitment in militant ranks is almost zero and there is no stone-pelting after Friday prayers.” The governor also welcomed Hurriyat chairman Mirwaiz Umar Farooq ’s statement on Friday, where he had shared his concern over the growing menace of drug abuse among Kashmiri youth. The Mirwaiz had said that distribution of drugs had become awell-oiled racket in Kashmir, especially in Srinagar.
