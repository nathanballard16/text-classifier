NEW DELHI: Polling for phase three of the Lok Sabha polls is underway in 117 Lok Sabha seats in 13 states and two union territories.In this phase, all eyes will be on the states of Gujarat and Kerala. While in the southern state BJP will be hoping to make its debut, in Gujarat, where it won all the 26 seats in 2014, the saffron party will like to prevent the Congress from gaining re-entry into the state.The third phase will also see several high-pitched battles between political heavyweights. In J&K, PDP's Mehbooba Mufti will have a face-off with NC's Hasnain Masoodi. In Rampur, the fight is between SP's Azam Khan and BJP's Jaya Prada.BJP's Varun Gandhi will be defending his mother Maneka Gandhi's constituency in Pilibhit against SP's Hemraj Singh.In Bihar, Madhepura will see a high-stake battle between RJD's Sharad Yadav and JAPL's Pappu Yadav. In Kerala, Congress president Rahul Gandhi will be contesting from Wayanad, while Shashi Tharoor will be defending the Thiruvananthapuram seat.In Gujarat's Gandhinagar, BJP president Amit Shah will be making his Lok Sabha polls debut when he takes on Congress's Dr CJ Chavda.In Uttar Pradesh, the mahagathbandhan will be hoping to better its performance from 2014 when Samajwadi Party won three of the 10 seats going to polls in this phase.While, in Maharashtra, the NDA has an upper hand, in West Bengal, the Congress will be looking to retain the three of five seats it won in 2014.Let's take a look at what is at stake for various political parties in the third phase —Since 2014, the politics in Gujarat has seen several twist and turns. In the run up to the 2017 assembly elections, the state was embroiled in the Patidar agitation. The agitation played a pivotal role in Congress's performance in the state when it won 81 seats in the assembly polls. The growing discontent among the trading community against the NDA government after the implementation of GST and demonetisation also worked in Congress's favour.However, Congress, it appears, has failed to materialise on the resentment prevalent in the state against the BJP.One of the biggest challenge the Congress faces in the state is to challenge the supremacy of Modi-Shah. In this election, BJP president Amit Shah marked his Lok Sabha polls debut when the party announced his candidature from Gandhinagar constituency. The decision is bound to provide a momentum to the party cadre in the state. One of the major roadblocks for Congress in the state is to lure away the voters from the prospect of electing a Gujarati Prime Minister.A look at the 2014 vote share of parties would reveal that there are six seats where the difference of votes between the Congress and the BJP was less than 15%. In all the other seats, the saffron party swept the polls in a one-sided battle.Three constituencies where Congress was defeated by a margin of 14-15% votes were Patan (14.51%), Junagadh (14.43%) and Bharuch (14.45%).But more than this Congress has a better chance of winning in Sabarkantha and Anand constituencies where it lost to BJP only by a margin of 6-8% votes.Another prospective win for Congress could be Bardoli where BJP won against Congress by 10.27% votes and Chhota Udaipur where if Congress could push its luck can score a victory given that it lost by a margin of 16.33%, a difference that is not seen as insurmountable in poll arithmetic.In 2014, Congress led the race by winning eight of the 20 seats. The decision of the Congress president Rahul Gandhi to contest from state's Wayanad constituency has further bolstered party's chances in the state.The constituency lies at the tri-junction of three key southern states — Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka and is being hailed as an attempt by the party to further solidify Congress's base in South India.The LDF government, on the other hand hopes to cash on development work and the schemes introduced by the government. While Vijayan is largely said to have handled the post-flood rescue operations well, many have held the government responsible for worsening the floods by releasing water from the Periyar river dam. For some people, maintaining Sabarimala's sanctity has been a bigger concern given how the agitation at times turned violent due to state government's implementation of Supreme Court order which permitted women of menstruating age to pray at the hill shrine.Meanwhile, BJP continues to try to make its Kerala debut. BJP is focussing on winning four to five seats including some hard-to-crack left bastions and constituencies which have alternated between LDF and UDF like Kannur — considered to be a slippery ground for all parties. BJP has been leading a special campaign in the coastal areas since the assembly election. It has been using Sabarimala row as a poll plank in constituencies that served as a hotbed of the agitation. However, BJP also has the candidate facing the highest number of criminal cases in Kerala; nominee for Pathanamthitta constituency, K Surendran, has 240 cases in all districts.Ten constituencies will be going to polls in the third phase. This phase is highlighted by the presence of several heavyweights such as SP's Azam Khan and BJP's Jaya Prada from Rampur, BJP's Varun Gandhi from Pilibhit, PSP's Shivpal Yadav from Firozabad, and SP supremo Mulayam Singh Yadav from Mainpuri.Considered to be a Samajwadi Party stronghold, this phase will also see three of the five members of the Yadav clan take on the saffron party. In 2014, SP had won three of these ten seats.Though the contest in this phase is essentially between the SP-BSP-RLD alliance and the BJP, the presence of Shipal Yadav's PSP and Congress has made the contest triangular in several constituencies.Though the BJP won 11 of the 14 seats going to poll in phase three, a look at the results of the 2014 general elections would reveal that the Congress gave tough fight to the saffron party on all these seats.Barring Shimoga, where the BJP won by a comprehensive margin of over 32% votes, the vote difference between the two parties was less than 11% on all these seats.In 2014, the Congress barely managed to hold on to Raichur and Chikkodi by a vote difference of less than a percent.On the other hand, the seat of Davanagere was won by BJP by a margin of 1.58% votes.Fourteen of the 48 Lok Sabha constituencies in the state will go to polls as part of the third phase of Lok Sabha elections.This phase will seal the political fate of some of the state's prominent political clans such as the Pawars, the Mohite-Patils and the late Vasantrao 'Dada' Patil's family.Nine of these 14 seats were won the BJP-Shiv Sena alliance in 2014, while four went to the NCP.The state will witness a close battle between the Congress and the CPM on three of the five seats going to poll in this phase. In 2014, the Congress won three, while one seat each was one by All India Trinamool Congress and CPM. While the Congress won the Jangipur seat be defeating CPM by a difference of less than 1% votes, in Murshidabad, the CPM clinched the seat by a margin of 1.61% votes.The other states going to poll in phase 3 of the Lok Sabha elections are — Odisha, six seats, Chhattisgarh, seven seats, Assam, four seats, Goa, two seats, J&K, one seat along with Dadra and Nagar Haveli, Daman and Diu.
