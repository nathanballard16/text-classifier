Ebola cases rising in eastern Congo, WHO says: The World Health Organization said Ebola is on the rise in eastern Congo in the wake of attacks on health facilities. Dozens of armed groups operate in the region. A WHO spokesman, Christian Lindmeier, said a record number of new cases in this outbreak have been registered in the past two weeks. The violence has hampered vaccination efforts and safe burials, so more people were exposed to the deadly virus. The spokesman said 73 new cases were reported last week, compared with 57 the week before.
