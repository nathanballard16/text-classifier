A case under thewas registered and one person was arrested.During the course of the investigation, the name of the complainant’s brother cropped up and he was subsequently declared absconding in the case. On December 29, Bhoir allegedly visited the complainant at his liquor shop in Fort and demanded Rs 25 lakh for not arresting his brother.The two haggled and later settled on an amount of Rs 22 lakh. The complainant then approached the anti-corruption bureau.It was decided that the amount will be paid on January 1 and Bhoir asked the complainant to come to his office at Andheri Crime branch with the money. According to the complainant, Bhoir made him wait for over half an hour as he stepped out for a meeting. After he returned, the policeman asked the complainant to accompany him to his car.ACB sleuths who were tracking them caught Bhoir red-handed while accepting the bribe. A departmental inquiry (DE) was initiated against him.According to the DE findings, Bhoir deliberately tried to mould the case proceedings in such a way that instead of implicating the accused, they would in turn help him.“In the remand application of the accused, he mentioned such reasons to seek his custody which would benefit the accused person,” the inquiry report states.He also deliberately hid the case papers showing intentional lapses made by him in the investigation from his seniors.“As per the provisions of the Bombay Police (Punishment and Appeals) Rules, 1956, Bhoir has been removed from service,” reads the DE order accessed by Mirror.Interestingly, in 2011 Bhoir, who was then posted at Kashimira police station as a sub-inspector, was roped in to investigate a minor’s kidnapping in Kandivali. Within four days, he cracked the case and not only helped identify and arrest the kidnappers, but also rescue the child from the interiors of Uttar Pradesh.A decorated cop, Bhoir has solved a record 300 criminal cases during his three-year tenure at Andheri police station. Nicknamed ‘Naya Nayak’ (new hero), Bhoir has received over 150 rewards from the department for his work.
