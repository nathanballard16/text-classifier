Three policemen and another person were killed when a truck hit their vehicle while they were escorting Madhya Pradesh Assembly's Deputy Speaker in Balaghat district in the wee hours of Monday, police said.

A constable in the escort vehicle received serious injuries in the mishap, Balaghat's Superintendent of Police A Jaydevan said.
