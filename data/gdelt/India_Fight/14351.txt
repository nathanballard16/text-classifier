Pakistan Assures US It Will 'Firmly' Deal With Terrorists - Bolton

The Indian airstrike came after a deadly 14 February attack by Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Indian paramilitary police force in Kashmir. While India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militants and having a "direct hand" in the incident, Pakistan, in turn, has rejected the allegations, accusing India of being responsible for alleged human rights violations taking place in Kashmir.
