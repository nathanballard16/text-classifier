I hope the film shapes up well," he said.Vicky has carved a niche for himself after delivering back-to-back commendable performances over the past few years. Asked if he feels pressurised while signing a film now, he said: "You don't sign films thinking about pressure. If you like the script and if you want to work with that director, and agree with the vision and get excited, then you just plunge into it.

So, whenever my heart says yes to a particular film, I do it."IANS
