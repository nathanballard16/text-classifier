Taxi stand owner attacked by auto drivers

Ludhiana: Some autorickshaw drivers allegedly attacked Sanjeev Verma (44) of Shivpuri — the owner of a taxi stand — when he objected to them blocking the Raikhi Cinema road on Wednesday evening. It is alleged that the auto drivers were stopping in the middle of the road to pick up passengers, which caused a traffic chaos there.

Verma said he was going to the railway station from Shivpuri on Wednesday on his motorcycle to meet a friend. When he reached the Raikhi Cinema road, there was traffic chaos caused by the autorickshaws. When he objected, one auto driver asked him to wait, as he was picking up passengers. Meanwhile, when he tried to get away from there by making some way, another auto driver blocked him.

“When I objected, the second auto driver started thrashing me. He picked a sharp-edged weapon from his auto and attacked me. On seeing this, three other auto drivers also attacked me. Meanwhile, some commuters came to my rescue, and the auto drivers escaped from there, but one of them was nabbed. Then, I was taken to the civil hospital, where I was administered stitches on my eyes, head, and back,” he added.

The onlookers also sounded the police, following which Division 1 police reached the spot, and recorded Verma’s statement for lodging a complaint.
