No stand of CBI on DG Vanzara & NK Amin's plea in Ishrat Jahan case

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Wednesday left it on the special court conducting the trial in the Ishrat Jahan fake encounter case to decide on the pleas of former cops DG Vanzara and NK Amin seeking to drop court proceedings against them in the case. The duo had approached the court with their pleas after the Gujarat government refused sanction to prosecute them.

Counsel for CBI RC Kodekar submitted before special judge JK Pandya that the court may pass "appropriate order in accordance with the law" on the pleas of Vanzara and Amin. The probe agency refused to either support or oppose the plea.

Meanwhile, Justice Pandya on Wednesday allowed Ishrat's mother Shamima Kauser to file her reply opposing the applications made by the former cops and put forth her arguments in the case on April 9. The court said that it will decide the applications on merit.

The probe agency had earlier informed the court about the refusal of the state government to prosecute the former cops under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Vanzara is a former deputy inspector general of police, while Amin retired as a superintendent of police.

As per the case details, Ishrat, a 19-year-old woman from Mumbra near Mumbai, Javed Shaikh alias Pranesh Pillai, Amjadali Akbarali Rana, and Zeeshan Johar, were killed by the Gujarat police in an encounter on the outskirts of Ahmedabad on June 15, 2004. The police claimed that they were terrorists and were planning to kill then chief minister Narendra Modi.

A Special Investigation Team set up by the Gujarat High Court later concluded that the encounter was fake, after which the HC transferred the case to the CBI. In the first charge-sheet filed by the CBI in 2013, seven Gujarat police officers, including IPS officers PP Pandey, Vanzara and G L Singhal, were named as accused. The court later discharged Pandey.
