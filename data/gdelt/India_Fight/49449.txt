Four UP cops injured in attack by villagers

Four policemen were injured when a police team was attacked by residents of Harsos village in Jansa police station area of Varanasi on Tuesday.

According to police, the incident happened when an 11-member Crime Branch team from Jaunpur came to the village looking for two wanted criminals who had allegedly shot a businessman after looting Rs 2.4 lakh from him on October 25.

Police said that villagers began protesting after the team arrested one of the accused — Rajan Rajbhar — and was taking him away with them. “In the melee, villagers caught two policemen — Sub-Inspector Kaushal Yadav and Constable Ved Prakash Rai— and starting thrashing them. They tied the constable to a tree and beat him,” a police officer said. A police team from Varanasi then reached the village, but villagers pelted them with stones, said the officer.

Additional SP (Varanasi Rural) M P Singh said that the Jaunpur police team did not inform the Jansa police station before conducting the raid in the village.

According to police, the situation was brought under control when additional forces reached the spot. However, the arrested accused managed to escape.

Two other policemen — Rohaniya’s Station Officer and a constable — were also injured.

Rai and constable Yadav, who sustained serious injuries, are undergoing treatment at Banaras Hindu University’s Trauma Centre, where their condition is said to be stable. “It has come to light that villagers reached the spot after rumours circulated that a gang of child-lifters had entered the village,” said Ramashish Ram, SHO of Jansa Police Station.

An FIR has been filed against 17 people.
