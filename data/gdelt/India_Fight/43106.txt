The poster features Salman Khan in his Chulbul Pandey avatar donning that swagger attitude right on his sleeves as he asks his viewers to welcome him, adding a little twist to his signature dialogue as he says, “Swagat to karo humara”.

Also to be noticed is the low angle shot which made the motion teaser more quirky, truly the Dabangg style fans were waiting for.
