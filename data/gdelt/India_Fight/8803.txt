Washington, Feb 23 (UNI/IBNS) US president Donald Trump has described the current situation between India and Pakistan as “very, very bad” after last week’s Pulwama terror attack which claimed the lives of 44 CRPF soldiers, local media reported on Saturday.

While interacting with media at the Oval Office on Friday, Trump said, 'Right now between Pakistan and India, there is a very, very bad situation. A very dangerous situation. We would like to see it hostilities stop. A lot of people were just killed. We want to see it just stop. We are very much involved in that process".

He also said that the White House is in contact with both the countries and hoped hostilities would soon end in the Valley.

"India is looking at something very strong. India just lost almost 50 people in the attack. I can understand that too," Trump added.

India has been demanding action against militants, as the attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), an Islamist extremist group based in Pakistan.

The terror attack has led to an escalation of tensions between India and Pakistan.

The United States in recent years has allied with India, seeing common interests with a fellow democracy that has been battling Islamist extremists.

The Trump administration last year cut off $300 million in military aid to Pakistan, saying that Islamabad has not done enough to fight extremists at home or close safe havens for militants in neighboring Afghanistan.
