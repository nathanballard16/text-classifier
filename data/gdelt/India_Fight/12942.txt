Row over placement of party flag leads to suicide attempt

Police personnel restrain man during argument at station

Police personnel had a tough time restraining a man who attempted to end his life to assert his right to install a party flag post in Nandambakkam.

Trouble began when a State Minister noticed that a flag post bearing an AIADMK party flag was shorter than the DMK’s while passing by in his car two days ago. The Minister immediately called the local party functionaries and reprimanded them.

The functionaries, Kannan, 33, his brother Manikanda Babu, 32, and others collected money for a new flag post. They installed a post 71 feet tall, replacing the old one and encroaching on the carriageway on Saturday. National Highways Authority of India personnel removed the post, as it was obstructing road users.

When party functionaries later saw the uprooted post, they went to the Nandambakkam police station on Monday, and found that highways officials had removed the post.

The party functionaries were stubborn in their demand to install the post at the same spot and refused to disperse from the station.

Sudden action

Even as they were arguing with police, one of the functionaries, Babu, suddenly doused himself with kerosene and took out a cigarette lighter, intending to self-immolate. The police grabbed him and thwarted his bid. “Other party members were busy shooting on their mobile phones.”
