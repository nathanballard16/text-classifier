Asked about the matter, 25 BGB Battalion Deputy Commander Major Md Shafik said BGB is operating under the assumption that the persons present in the no-man’s land are Indian nationals.

“We may be able to know for certain who they are after we hold a flag meeting with our counterparts,” he said.

The locality is tense on this side of the Indian border pillar 2029/3/S as BSF and BGB have taken position on both sides with the refugees in the middle.
