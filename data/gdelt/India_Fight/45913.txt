Banke police nab 10 middlemen

Nepalgunj, October 2

Banke police on Wednesday arrested ten agents of hotels from Jamunaha border for roughly pulling migrant workers coming home for Dashain from India to their hotels in Banke.

A police team deployed from Area Police Office Jamunaha had taken ten hotel middlemen under control after the latter started intimidating migrant workers. Hotels have kept agents at the border area to bring customers to their hotels. These agents have been harassing migrant workers.

SI Madhav Rijal said police had taken the middlemen under control as they did not stop harassing migrant workers despite repeated warning not to do so. The names of those arrested have been kept secret. Around 500 migrant workers from India enter the country in a day. Migrant people enter Nepal in droves. Agents of hotels harass customers to lure them to their hotels.

Hotel Entrepreneurs’ Association Banke Chair Bhimlal Kandel said his office had urged hotels not to intimidate migrant workers. SP Bir Bahadur Oli at Banke District Police Office said with the arrival of the festive season, incidents of theft and looting had soared at the border.
