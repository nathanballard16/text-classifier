Man found dead under mysterious circumstances

Ludhiana: A 30-year-old man was found dead under mysterious circumstances near Malhotra Resort in Salem Tabri area on Thursday evening. It is suspected that the man was thrashed to death as injuries were found on his head.

The deceased has been identified as Vipan Kumar Jha, a resident of Ashok Nagar, Khajur Chowk of Salem Tabri. Police said Vipan, who was a factory worker, had liquor with two friends on Thursday evening in Jassiyan.

The trio then had a fight after which they moved to some other place. Later, Vipan’s body was found near a resort.

Inspector Kanwaljit Singh, SHO of Salem Tabri police station said that Vipan and his two friends Bawra and Majla of Salem Tabri, had a fight after they got drunk. When some onlookers intervened, they left the place. Quoting eye witnesses, he said, Vipan was so drunk that he could not even walk properly. Later, some passersby saw Vipan’s body near Malhotra resort and informed the police.

Police have not ruled out that Vipan could have died due to falling as he was heavily drunk. “Since he was drunk, there is a possibility that he fell down and injured himself. However, nothing can be ruled out at this stage and all possible angles are being probed,” said a police official.

Meanwhile, Viapn’s brother Anil Kumar Jha, in his statement, accused Vipan’s two friends of thrashing him to death and asked the police to lodge a case of murder.
