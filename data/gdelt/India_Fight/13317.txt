Three already arrested before the case was transferred toThe Criminal Investigation Division () has arrested Vasudev Suryavanshi, a 29-year-old mechanic from Jalgaon for stealing a Bajaj Discover bike from Dharwad which was used to ferry’s shooters on August 30, 2015. Suryavanshi is the third accused in the Gauri Lankesh murder case, to be booked for Kalburgi’s killing after the arrest of Ganesh Miskin and Amit Baddi, in September 2018. Suryavanshi (codename Mechanic) was formally booked a couple of days before the apex court handed over the Kalburgi probe to the Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the. Sources claimed that the SIT is expected to arrest at least four more men accused of Gauri’s murder for their alleged involvement in the Kalburgi case.“It will take some more time but yes, most of the operatives are the same,” said sources.Investigators suspect that Baddi and Miskin were the two unidentified assailants who arrived at Kalburgi’s residence and shot him. Both Baddi and Miskin had undergone firearm training at multiple training camps inand Maharashtra. The SIT is expected to formally take custody of Amol Kale, the present commander of the group held responsible for the murder of Gauri Lankesh along with Amit Degwekar, Rajesh Bangera, Sharat Kalaskar for their alleged involvement in the Kalburgi murder conspiracy. Interestingly Professor Kalburgi was murdered when this fringe group of radicals were under the command of Dr Veerendra Tawde who later became a prime accused in Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare murder cases.The CID had arrested Baddi and Miskin last year after the SIT submitted a report stating that they were present at Kalburgi’s residence when he was shot dead. The Bajaj Discover bike was later recovered by Maharashtra ATS when they raided the residence of a Vaibhav Raut, a local right winger in Nallasopara in August 2018. The CID had come under severe criticism for its inability to achieve a breakthrough in the Kalburgi murder case till the SIT started picking up suspects in Gauri Lankesh murder case in 2018, almost three years after the Kalburgi, murder.
