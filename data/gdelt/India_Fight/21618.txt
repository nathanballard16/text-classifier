Parth Samthaan lost his father on Friday while he was shooting on the sets of Kasautii Zindagii Kay. Parth's father had been hospitalised a couple of days before he passed away and Parth left the sets of the show as soon as he heard of the news.

According to a report on Spotboye, the actor has already resumed shoot for Kasautii while he is still grieving the loss of his father. The portal quoted a source saying, “Parth was very sombre throughout the day, he was very close to his father and he might take time to come out of it.”
