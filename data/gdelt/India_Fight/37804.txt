Revoking of Article 370 | Move triggers fears in the northeastern region

A “red alert” for region which enjoys similar constitutional safeguards: Ex-Mizoram CM

The Centre’s move to revoke Article 370 has triggered apprehensions in the northeastern States enjoying similar constitutional safeguards. The Constitution bestows special provisions under Article 371A for Nagaland, Article 371B for Assam, Article 371C for Manipur, Article 371F for Sikkim and Article 371F for Mizoram.

Former Mizoram Chief Minister Lal Thanhawla said the move by the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was a “red alert” for the people of the northeast.

“It has become a threat to States like Mizoram, Nagaland and Arunachal which are protected by the Constitution. If 35A and 370 are repealed, Article 371G safeguarding the interests and existence of lesser tribals of Mizoram will be under severe threat,” he said.

The Mizo National Front government chose to adopt a “wait and watch” policy but NGOs such as the influential Young Mizo Association — which has spearheaded a movement against the Centre’s bid to push the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill — said any move to “tamper with” Article 371G would be opposed to the hilt.

The Neiphiu Rio-led coalition government in Nagaland, in which BJP is a partner, chose not to react. Neither did the Naga Students’ Federation.

‘Minorities undermined’

“This is something undermining the minorities in India. I think this is very undemocratic. People in Nagaland would be particularly worried as a settlement of the Naga political process is long overdue,” said Chuba Ozukum, president of Naga Hoho, apex body of all Naga tribes. The “political process” is a term used for the peace talks between New Delhi and the Isak-Muivah faction of the extremist National Socialist Council of Nagaland that fought a secessionist battle with the armed forces until declaring a truce in July 1997.
