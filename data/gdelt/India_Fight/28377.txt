Maharashtra education board confirms seized degree certificates bogus

The bogus degrees and marksheets were printed under names of different universities in Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan

VADODARA: Investigation into the fake degree racket has revealed that all the marksheets and degrees were printed by an organized gang that has been operating in the state.

Separate teams of crime branch sleuths visited colleges in Maharashtra and Punjab and met the authorities there.

“The accused had said that the degrees seized from them were bogus. But we wanted to verify it so we sent in our teams to Maharashtra and Punjab. They met officials of Maharashtra State Board of Secondary & Higher Secondary Education who confirmed that they haven’t issued the degrees that we have seized,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police (crime).

Police are now questioning the accused Viral Jaiswal and Nilay Shah, who arrested last week for selling bogus degrees to the needy students. “Our investigation will now focus on the gang that prints such bogus certificates and their network. We are close to making some arrests,” Jadeja told TOI.

Jaiswal and Shah’s racket was exposed after Prashant Rathod, who was sold a bogus degree, approached the police.

Police had raided the premises of Kaplon Group run by the accused in Windsor Plaza and recovered 72 fake certificates, bogus degrees and marksheets from there. The degrees and marksheets belonged to different institutes and universities in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.

The accused used to charge anywhere between Rs 60,000 to Rs 90,000 for providing fake degrees or marksheets. The police has also begun efforts to track down the customers who have bought fake degrees from the accused till date.
