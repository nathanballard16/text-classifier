Darwin Group confident of winning bid for Jet Airways

New Delhi [India], May 20 (ANI): Darwin Platform Group of Companies, which recently shot into prominence for its interest in taking stakes in Jet Airways with infusion of Rs 14,000 crore, has geared up to foray into the Indian aviation sector.

"We are a debt-free company," said its Chairman Ajay Harinath Singh. "Darwin Group is all set to expand its wings into several sectors and given the opportunities in the aviation sector. Darwin Aviation proposes to acquire a considerable stake in Jet Airways."

"Our main priority is to save the airline and thousands of employees who are jobless and in pain. I feel sad for thousands of Jet Airways employees and their family members. But soon, I believe Jet Airways will be back in the air," said Singh while talking to ANI.

Darwin is operating in several countries and has enough global exposure, he said.

Earlier, lenders led by State Bank of India had called for bids to acquire cash strapped and grounded Jet Airways. Among qualified parties, only Etihad Airways submitted a conditional investment offer.

Darwin Group's businesses include finance, mining, energy, mixed farming, wine, mass media, news, airlines, logistics, pharmaceuticals, shipping, realty, infrastructure, information technology, sports, banking, education and charities.

Allegations of financial fraud were made against the company when some of its previous employees reportedly lured some people to make investments in exchange for high returns.

"False, fake and malicious allegations were made through some cases. We were victims of malafide intentions of our opponents. All legal cases against me or my company have been closed,'' said Singh.

Jet Airways and SBI Caps invited Darwin Group even after the formal bidding process was over.
