National Day Rally 2019: How the Chinese Singaporean identity has evolved in 200 years

SINGAPORE - It has taken 200 years to forge the Chinese Singaporean identity, from the time immigrants flocked here from China to the present day, said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Sunday (Aug 18).

And it is crucial for Singaporeans to be aware of the history of this gradual transfer of their loyalties to Singapore, in order to understand how the national consciousness has evolved, he added.

In his Mandarin speech at the National Day Rally, PM Lee cited turning points at which the Chinese community began to identify as Singaporeans.

In the 1950s, when China stated that overseas Chinese who had taken citizenship elsewhere would no longer be considered Chinese nationals, the majority of them here did not return but chose to put down roots.

After independence, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Industry also raised a significant sum for the National Defence Fund to build up the Singapore's military.

"Being aware of Singapore's history over 200 years and more will help us understand how our national consciousness evolved. It will also help our people understand current affairs as well as Singapore's position on international issues."

In his speech, PM Lee described at length how the immigrant Chinese gradually began to see themselves as Singaporean.
