Donald Trump: Modi’s remark against terrorism well received: Donald Trump

NEW DELHI: US President Donald Trump in meeting with Pakistani PM Imran Khan on Monday praised the ‘Howdy, Modi!’ event and said Prime Minister Narendra Modi ’s comments on terrorism were “very aggressive” and “very well received”.“It was very well received within the room,” Trump said, referring to a gathering of about 50,000 people at the NRG stadium in Houston on Sunday.Renewing his mediation offer, Trump said he was ready to arbitrate between India and Pakistan on the Kashmir issue but both sides have to agree for that. At a meeting with Khan in New York , Trump said: “I am ready, willing and able. It’s a complex issue. It’s being going on for a long time. But if both (Prime ministers Narendra Modi and Imran Khan) want it, I am ready to do it. I think I’d be an extremely good arbitrator.” India has repeatedly ruled out any third-party mediation.Earlier, ahead of his meeting with Trump, Khan went on the defensive and claimed that Islamabad was in favour of dialogue with India but New Delhi wasn’t keen. Under pressure from the US for not doing enough to combat terrorism, Khan touted his government’s anti-terror measures.Khan, while speaking at the US think tank, Council on Foreign Relations, asserted his government was committed to eliminating terrorism from its soil. But India does not want to trust Pakistan, Khan said.Khan also took a swipe at Trump for his “radical Islam” comment at ‘Howdy, Modi!’ event on Sunday and said: “There’s only one Islam, not moderate or radical.”
