Red alert in Delhi over terror threat; police hunt for JeM activists

A Red alert has been sounded in Delhi following a category-A intelligence input about the presence of 3-4 hardcore and “highly-motivated” terrorists in the capital.

A report in The Times of India citing official sources said a group of fidayeen belonging to Pakistan’s Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) may have infiltrated into the city last week to execute an attack in retaliation to the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu & Kashmir.

At least two of them could be foreign (Pakistan-based) terrorists, says the report.

A joint team of the Delhi Police’s Special Cell and sleuths from an intelligence agency reportedly carried out raids at nine locations in the capital at about 9 PM on Wednesday. At least two suspects have been detained for questioning. Raids were conducted at Seelampur and two other places in northeast Delhi, Jamia Nagar and two localities near Paharganj in central Delhi.

Earlier, the security alert level four defence establishments had been upgraded to “orange” following intelligence alerts of imminent terror strike. Reports last week also suggested that JeM was readying a special squad to target Prime Minister Narendra Modi and NSA Ajit Doval. It also suggested that the terror attack could occur between 25 and 30 September.

The Pakistani authorities, including the army, the ISI and terror led by Masood Azhar groups have been jointly plotting fidayeen attacks in India since 5 August.
