Delhi police arrest top Jaish operative Sajjad Khan

The Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested Jaish-e-Mohammad operative Sajjad Khan near Red Fort in the early hours of Friday.

The said operative was arrested following a month-long probe launched after the dastardly Pulwama attack on February 14, which was orchestrated by the Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).

Khan is a close associate of the mastermind of the Pulwama attack Mudassir Ahmed Khan, who got eliminated in an encounter with the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on March 11, police said.

Soon after the arrest, Khan was produced before the Delhi's Patiala House Court. The court has sent him to the custody of the Investigation Agency (NIA) till March 29.

As many as 40 CRPF personnel were killed in the terror attack when their convoy was targeted on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway in Pulwama district. Later, JeM took the responsibility of the attack.
