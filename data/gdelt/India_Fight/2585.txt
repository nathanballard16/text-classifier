Sidharth Malhotra refuses to use a body double; performs own fire stunts for Marjaavan

Sidharth Malhotra recently wrapped the last schedule of Jabariya Jodi with Parineeti Chopra, in which he plays a flamboyant Patna boy. Post this, the actor has immediately changed gears and got into action mode for Milap Zaveri’s Marjaavan, produced by Nikhil Advani and Bhushan Kumar. We hear that the film will see Sidharth in his best action avatar. As an insider adds, “The film is high on action and Sidharth is keen on doing most of it himself. He has refused to use body doubles for some of the most risky stunts.”

The actor has currently been shooting late nights for some intense fire action sequences. As the source further reveals, “We are currently shooting an action sequence with a late night set up, dozens of goons, fire, and rain. The stunt team wanted to shoot with a body double because Sid’s back and shoulder would be on fire but he was adamant on doing the scene himself to make it look authentic and stay true to his character. There is a lot raw action in the film and he has pulled it all off himself.” Riteish Deshmukh plays the villain and is shown to be a vertically challenged character in Marjaavan. This is Riteish and Sidharth’s second film together after Ek Villain and there’s buzz of it being a sequel. The source says, “Riteish will be joining the team for the shoot next week and the lengthy schedule will continue till March-end.”

Meanwhile, for his role in Jabariya Jodi – that revolves around ‘pakadwa vivah’ which involves kidnapping the groom and forcefully getting him married – Sidharth had to work on getting the perfect accent to make it sound like Hindi spoken locally in Patna. Describing his role as ‘desi’ the actor had spoken about enjoying the process of learning the language.
