Under the leadership of Hon'ble PM Sri @narendramodi ji, Our Govt. has decided to stop our share of water which used to flow to Pakistan. We will divert water from Eastern rivers and supply it to our people in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab. — Nitin Gadkari (@nitin_gadkari) February 21, 2019

So water which we rightfully owned was going into Pakistan. Now we are planning to create a project and divert the waters of these three rivers to the Yamuna. So you can understand that there will be enough water in the Yamuna," he said while inaugurating several water projects in Uttar Pradesh.Amid relentless sabre-rattling from New Delhi Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday authorised the armed forces of Pakistan to respond “decisively and comprehensively” to any aggression or misadventure by India.
