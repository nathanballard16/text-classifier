Pak PM discusses security situation with top military leadership

Pakistan Prime Minister on Wednesday discussed the security situation in the country, including on the eastern border with India, with the top leadership of the Army, Navy and Air Force, sources said, amid tensions between the two nations after the Pulwama attack.

Khan met Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Zubair Mahmood Hayat, Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chief of Air Staff Air Marshal Mujahid Anwar Khan and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Zafar Mahmood Abbasi.

The meeting came just two days ahead of the Pakistan Day parade in Islamabad which would feature a display of military hardware.

"The security situation of the country including professional matters pertaining to Armed Forces of Pakistan were discussed during the meeting," according to an official statement.

Government sources said that the security situation on the eastern border with India was also discussed.

Tensions between India and Pakistan flared up after the February 14 Pulwama attack by Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM).

Amid mounting outrage, the Indian Air Force carried out a counter-terror operation, hitting what it said was a JeM training camp in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan on February 26. The next day, Pakistan Air Force retaliated and downed a MiG-21 in an aerial combat and captured Indian pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was handed over to India later.
