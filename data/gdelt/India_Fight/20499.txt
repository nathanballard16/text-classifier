Is RRR team considering Shraddha Kapoor as replacement for Daisy Edgar Jones?

Director SS Rajamouli is busy with the production of his upcoming flick RRR, which has Jr NTR, Ram Charan and Alia Bhatt in the lead roles. The team is on a schedule break and will begin the next schedule in Pune in the coming weeks.

Recently, British actress Daisy Edgar Jones, who was paired opposite Jr NTR in RRR, walked out of the film citing 'family circumstances'. Rajamouli is now back to square one looking for suitable actresses to play Jr NTR's pair.

Reports are rife that the director is considering Shraddha Kapoor to play one of the female leads in the movie. Also, Parineeti Chopra's name is doing the rounds as well. Since Alia Bhatt and Ajay Devgn are part of the cast, there are high chances for the film to be released in Hindi.

With Parineeti Chopra or Shraddha Kapoor on board, RRR will have a great opening in Bollywood as well. An official confirmation regarding the same will be announced in the coming weeks.

Meanwhile, Ram Charan, who plays Telugu freedom fighter Alluri Seetharama Raju, has injured his ankle during a workout session. The actor is now recuperating and will resume shooting in Pune next week.

RRR is a fictitious tale of two Telugu freedom fighters Alluri Seetharama Raju and Komaram Bheem. In a recent interview, Rajamoui said, "I wanted to paint the canvas with a new brush so that the universe I create contains valour, energy, and grit."
