Four of a Telugu family found dead in U.S.

Gunshot wounds found on the bodies of the victims

Four members of a Telugu-speaking family were found dead with gunshot wounds at their West Des Moines house in Iowa of the United States of America on Saturday.

Information reaching here said the victims were identified as Chandrasekhar Sunkara (44), Lavanya Sunkara (41), and two boys — aged 15 and 10.

Four other family members, who were staying with them as guests, found the bodies lying in a pool of blood. They ran out of the house and requested the help of a passer-by who called 911 for help.

Autopsy

Police identified apparent gunshot wounds on all the victims, but autopsy would be performed to determine the cause of the deaths, said a local news website, quoting a release from the Des Moines police. In a video, a police spokesman said there was no threat to the safety of the general public.

The tragedy would impact the family, friends, co-workers, and anyone that knew the family, said Sgt. Dan Wade of the West Des Moines Police Department.

Mr. Wade said that, after receiving a call around 10 a.m., a team was sent to the 900th block of 65th Street, between Ashworth Road and Aspen Drive, where they found the bodies.

When contacted from Hyderabad, representatives of the Telugu community in the U.S. said they were already in touch with Indian Embassy officials and trying to help the family. Sunday being a holiday, they were unable to do much.

Police said that Chandrasekhar Sunkara worked in the Iowa Department of Public Safety's Technology Services Bureau.
