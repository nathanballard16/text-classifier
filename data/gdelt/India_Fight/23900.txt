IED suspected to be planted by Maoists in Bihar’s Aurangabad kills villager

A 56-year-old villager was killed on Friday when an improvised explosive device (IED), suspected to be planted by Maoists to target security personnel, exploded in Aurangabad district of Magadh region, about 125 km south of Patna, police said Saturday.

The incident occurred between Pachrukhia and Langurahi forest area where road construction work was on. The villager who was herding his cattle home stepped on the IED which blew up injuring him seriously. He succumbed to injuries on the way to hospital.

The deceased was identified as Karu Bhuiyan of Koilwa village Madanpur Tehsil. A police official said Karu had gone to the area to bring back his cattle when he stepped on the IED.

The official said the Maoists often plant IEDs to target security forces who regularly visit the area on routine patrol. A police team rushed to the spot after the blast and Karu’s body was sent for post mortem.

Additional Superintendent of Police (operations) Rajesh Kumar Singh said that a case has been registered in this connection. “Security forces have launched a combing operation in the area to trace the ultras,” he said.

Maoists, who had called for a boycott of the ongoing parliamentary election, have stepped up violence in their areas of influence.

On Friday night, suspected Maoists blew up the election office of Jharkhand’s former chief minister and BJP candidate from Khunti Arjun Munda.

On Wednesday, Maoists blew up a vehicle in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district killing 15 policemen and the driver on Dadapur road.

Shortly after the attack, Maoists set ablaze at least six vehicles and other machines of a construction company engaged in road construction in Bihar’s Magadh division.
