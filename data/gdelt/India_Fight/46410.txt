Police: Indian fire kills woman in Pakistan-held Kashmir

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (AP) — Sniper fire from India killed a woman outside her home in the border village of Abbaspur, in Pakistan-held Kashmir, a senior Pakistani police official said Monday.

According to police chief Zulqarnain Chaudhry, the 45-year-old woman was killed on Sunday. The fire came from the Indian sector, across the boundary in the disputed Himalayan region, he said.

Although Pakistan and India often exchange fire in Kashmir, Sunday's incident took place as U.S. Senators Chris Van Hollen and Maggie Hassan, along with Ambassador Paul Jones, charge d' affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, were visiting Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir.

Tensions in Kashmir, which is divided between Pakistan and India but claimed by both in its entirety, have escalated since August, when India downgraded the autonomy of Indian-administered Kashmir and imposed a lockdown. The development drew condemnation from Pakistan, where people often rally against Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over changing the status of Kashmir.
