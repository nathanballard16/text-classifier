300-odd cars gutted in fire at Aero India venue in Bangalore

Around 300 cars were gutted in a fire that broke out at a parking lot near the Aero India Show venue in Bangalore.

People who had come to witness the show had parked their vehicles in an open field near the Yelahanka Air Base. The flight display was halted when smoke was seen billowing from the makeshift parking lot. 10 fire engines were dispatched to the scene to control the blaze.

While the cause of the fire is not yet known, high winds and dry grass is believed to have aided the fire.

In response to the incident, Toyota has reached out to its customers to assist with insurance claims. The carmaker will provide on-site assistance through their insurance arm. It will also arrange for a conference call with the dealer's customer relations to coordinate with insurance inspection or to provide towing assistance.
