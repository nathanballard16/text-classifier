Troops from India and Pakistan were exchanging fire across the so-called Line of Control in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir territory on Monday including the use of mortars, according to reports from the ground. An Indian soldier lost his life after a Pakistani soldier died two days earlier, when four civilians were also injured.

The latest incident occurred in Sunderbani in the southern part of the separation line. Skirmishes started on July 20 as Pakistan's military said India bombed its positions. It said the other side used rockets in the apparent attack in Battal, Satwal, Khanjar, Nikyal and Jandrot.
