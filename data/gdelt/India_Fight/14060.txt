Three terrorists gunned down by security forces in encounter at Pulwama's Pinglish

New Delhi:

Three terrorists were killed in an encounter with security forces in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir on Sunday, a defence spokesman said. The security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Pinglish in the Tral area of south Kashmir's Pulwama district after receiving specific intelligence input about the presence of terrorists in the area. The search operation turned into an encounter after the terrorists opened fire at the search party of the forces who retaliated. The gunfight was going on, the spokesman said, adding the identity and group affiliation of the slain terrorists was being ascertained.

Last week, security forces killed two terrorists in an encounter in Tral. The encounter had begun when security forces launched a search operation in the area in the evening following a tip off about the militants. Tral is 46 km southeast of Srinagar.

Pulwama district has been on high alert since a suicide bomber of the Jaish-e-Mohammad killed 40 CRPF troopers on February 14 when he rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a bus in a troop convoy.

Last month, security forces fought a three-day gun battle with two terrorists in Handwara in north Kashmir before eliminating them. Three CRPF men, two Jammu and Kashmir policemen and a civilian were also killed in the gun battles.
