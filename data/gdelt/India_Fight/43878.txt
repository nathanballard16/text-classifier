J&K govt restricts access to media centre in Srinagar

Entry for all non- accredited, including journalists from New Delhi restricted

SRINAGAR, Sep 16 (Agencies): In a surprise move, the department of Information and Public Relation in Jammu-Kashmir Monday restricted access for journalists, including members of the foreign press, to the Media Facilitation Centre (MFC) setup in Sarovar Portico hotel in Srinagar.

Only journalists accredited by the state government are being allowed into the centre. The move was later withdrawn following the intervention of the Kashmir Press Club and senior journalists.

Director, Information, J&K, Sherish Asgar said: “Yes, we have done this following some complaints of misuse.”

Security officials deputed at the MFC told that they have received instructions from the government to allow only those journalists who are accredited with the government of Jammu and Kashmir. “We have been given a list of names and only those journalists will be allowed,” said an official.

In the morning, entry for all non- accredited journalists, including journalists from New Delhi, was restricted. A non-local journalist working for a national television channel showed his PIB card to the security officials at MFC, but he was not allowed to enter.

Delhi-based journalists working for foreign media too were not allowed access on Monday morning. “How can this happen. I have an accreditation card from New Delhi,” a journalist working for foreign media was heard telling the security persons.

With the communication clampdown still in place in most parts of Kashmir, journalists have been using the centre’s internet facilities to file stories.
