HYDERABAD: Congress leaders in Telangana on Tuesday complained to Governor Tamilisai Soundararajan that Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao had 'undermined' the anti-defection law by admitting MLAs elected on other party tickets into his party."We explained to the Governor, citing dates, how the Chief Minister has murdered the anti-defection bill (act) and admitted MLAs elected on other parties into his party," Congress Legislature Party leader M Bhatti Vikramarka told reporters after meeting Tamilisai Soundararjan.He was referring to the merger of 12 Congress MLAs with the TRS a few months ago.As 12 MLAs account for two-third of the CLP, which has an effective strength of 18, they will not attract provisions under the anti-defection law, political analysts had said then.Claiming that the merger of the 12 MLAs is not legal and that the matter is pending before court, Vikramarka said they sought disqualification of the said MLAs.He alleged that the Chief Minister had 'murdered democracy ' by inducting one of the 12 MLAs, Sabita Indra Reddy, as a minister
