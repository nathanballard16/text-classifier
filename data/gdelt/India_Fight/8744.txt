Govt clearing judges’ appointment, we lag in clearing backlog: CJI

NEW DELHI: Appointment of high court judges, which had slowed down after the Supreme Court struck down the National Judicial Appointments Commission in 2015, has picked up pace and CJI Ranjan Gogoi on Friday refused to blame the Centre for delay in selections while admitting that the collegium was finding it difficult to cope with the backlog.When advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for NGO ‘Centre for PIL’, accused the Centre of sitting on collegium recommendations for months when HCs were facing nearly 40% vacancies, a bench of CJI Gogoi and Justice Sanjiv Khanna said the Union government had been clearing appointments expeditiously in the recent past.“As the Chief Justice of India, I am telling you that what is pending with the government is just 27 recommendations. It is we in the collegium who have not been able to clear the proposals for appointment of HC judges. Nearly 70 to 80 proposals in this regard are pending with the collegium,” the CJI said.Bhushan said according to a chart prepared by him, the government was sitting on nine recommendations, which after being returned by the law ministry were reiterated by the collegium, making it binding on the government to implement them. However, the CJI said it would be better if the petition was heard after six weeks.After Justice Gogoi became CJI, the government has shown unusual speed in clearing recommendations for appointment of judges to the Supreme Court and HCs. In the recent past, some recommendations for appointment of SC judges were cleared within three days.Despite the appointment process picking up speed, HC judges are fighting a grim battle given that there are only 686 judges against the sanctioned strength of 1,079 in 25 HCs, or a vacancy of 37%. Nearly 40 lakh cases are pending in the HCs.Allahabad HC with a sanctioned strength of 160 judges has a working strength of 108, Andhra Pradesh HC with 37 sanctioned posts has 13, Bombay HC has 70 judges against a sanctioned strength of 94, Calcutta HC has 36 judges against 72 sanctioned posts, Delhi HC has 38 judges out of 60, Madras HC has 60 judges (75), Karnataka HC has 31 judges (62), Punjab and Haryana HC has 53 judges (85), Patna HC has 27 judges (53), Madhya Pradesh HC has 37 judges (53), Kerala HC has 37 judges (47), Rajasthan HC has 25 judges (50), Orissa HC has 15 judges (27), Gujarat HC has 32 judges (52), Gauhati HC has 20 judges (24) and Jharkhand HC has 18 judges (25).
