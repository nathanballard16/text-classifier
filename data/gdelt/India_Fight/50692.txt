Bengaluru: Minto hospital doctors called off the protest on Saturday after Karnataka Rakshana Vedike activists surrender before the police.

Thirteen KRV activists including Ashwini Gowda surrender at VV Puram police station in Bengaluru on Friday. The police later produced the accused before the court.

The Doctors’ after calling off the strike returned to hospital for duty, informed sources.

It may be recalled that the Doctors of the government Minto Eye Hospital were on strike since a few days after the alleged attack of a colleague by members of Karnataka Rakshana Vedike, a pro- Kannada outfit.

People with minor health complications had to struggle to get medical assistance. Junior doctors in government hospitals too joined the strike, burdening the seniors.

Meanwhile, the KRV members who had allegedly attacked a doctor at the Minto Hospital said they were contemplating surrendering to the police.

A KRV office-bearer said the surrender of those behind the attack should not be seen as a defeat, adding they would continue to fight for the 22 cataract patients who allegedly lost their vision in the botched operation in July at the Minto Hospital.

The KRV members have been demanding justice and proper compensation to the victims of the botched cataract surgery.

A few people had lost their vision partially due to a drug reaction.
