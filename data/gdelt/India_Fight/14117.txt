Pulwama: Three terrorists were gunned down by security forces in an encounter that broke out in Pinglish village of Pulwama’s Tral on Sunday. The identity of the militants is yet to be ascertained.

On receiving intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the south Kashmir's district, security forces launched a cordon and search operation. A gunfight ensued after militants opened fire on security forces who were conducting searches.

Security forces have recovered two AK-47 rifles and one pistol.

The encounter is still underway between terrorists and security forces. The search operation is on to smoke out the remaining terrorists, if any.

On March 7, one terrorist was killed in an encounter in Jammu & Kashmir's Handwara. The terrorist was reportedly a Pakistan national and was affiliated to terror organisation Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).

These encounters come at a time when India has been reinstating its effort to curb the menace of terrorism. The recent Pulwama terror attack that was carried out by JeM has triggered a huge outrage among the people of the country who have been demanding stern action against terrorists and their outfits.
