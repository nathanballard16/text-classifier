India will seek details from the US on the service provider of the “virtual SIMs” that were allegedly used by the JeM suicideand hisand Kashmir-based handlers while orchestrating and carrying out theattack.Piecing together findings from the site of the terror strike, searches carried out by the Jammu and Kashmir police and central security agencies at another encounter site in Tral and other locations, it has been concluded that the bomber, Adil Dar, was in constant touch with the JeM across the border.The main mastermind of the attack, Mudassir Khan, was killed in the encounter in Tral.The ‘virtual SIM’ used during the attack was reportedly generated by a service provider in the United States. Unlike its widely-used counterpart, ‘virtual SIMs’ are generated by a computer and the user needs to download the service provider’s app on theirThe number is linked to various social networking sites like WhatsApp, Facebook, Telegram or Twitter. Once the verification code generated by these networking sites is received, the user is ready.In case of Pulwama, Dar was in constant touch with the Jaish handler as well as Mudassir Khan using the same technology. The numbers used were pre-fixed with “+1”, the Mobile Station International Subscriber Directory Number (MSISDN) for the United States.The request to the US will include details of phone numbers that got in touch with the “Virtual SIM” and who had activated it, they said, adding thataddresses would also be sought.While the security agencies would attempt to find who had paid for the virtual SIM, they were also aware that the terror groups used forged identities, as was done during the Mumbai 26/11terror strikes.At least 44 CRPF personnel were killed on February 14 when Dar rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus at Pulwama in South Kashmir. India retaliated after the strike by bombing Jaish’s hideout inin Pakistan.Asoldier was killed on Sunday when Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by targeting forward posts and villages with heavy caliber weapons and rockets along the Line of Control in Poonch and Rajouri.Grenadier Hari Bhakar was admitted to the hospital with serious injuries, but succumbed later, taking the number of Army personnel killed in unprovoked cross-border firings since last week to three.
