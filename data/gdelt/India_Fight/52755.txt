Toyah Cordingley murder brief of evidence tied up in red tape for months

A brief of evidence recommending the arrest of a key person of interest in the murder of Cairns woman Toyah Cordingley, languished with police lawyers for months.

Ms Cordingley was killed while walking her dog along Wangetti Beach in Far North Queensland on October 21 last year.

The key suspect, Innisfail nurse Rajwinder Singh, fled to India two days after her murder, leaving behind his wife and children.

He is believed to be living in the state of Punjab near the Pakistani border.

9News can reveal homicide detectives finalized a comprehensive brief of evidence, recommending Singh's arrest, four months ago.

Before a decision on whether Singh will be extradited is made, the brief must move up the chain inside the Queensland Police Service, to state prosecutors and then to the federal Attorney-General.

But it spent months with police lawyers, wrapped in red tape, before being handed to the Director of Public Prosecutions just a week ago.

"It certainly seems to be taking a long time," legal expert Terry Goldsworthy said.

"The only things they need to look at is, is there a reasonable prospect of success? Do they know where the suspect is and is there a treaty in existence? Now I would have thought those questions would have been relatively easy to answer.

"So it's frustrating for the investigators I would imagine."

In a statement, a police spokesperson said the investigation was complex and police were taking an appropriately thorough approach to all aspects of the investigation.

If an extradition is requested, it will then be up to Indian police to make the arrest, before prosecutors can put Singh before a Queensland court.
