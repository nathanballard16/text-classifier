Game of Thrones stars Emilia Clarke and Rose Leslie were in India for a secret trip

Just hours ago, Emilia Clarke, or as Game of Thrones fans would know her, Daenerys Targaryen, took to Instagram to share a few pictures from her secret trip to India. The British actor, who was also accompanied by co-star Rose Leslie (who played Ygritte in the show), was reportedly staying at the Ananda in the Himalayas property in Uttarakhand for a quick, relaxing getaway.

Clarke shared an entire album of photographs showcasing her time in the country, which looked equal parts serene and eventful. The images showed Leslie and Clarke getting their inner peace on through yoga, reading books and enjoying spicy Indian cuisine, and in one picture, you can see the stars’ room being raided by monkeys, happily stealing their fruit. Her caption said, "this is NOT an ad, this is just two gals buzzed off our faces on India, peace, being robbed blind by monkeys, (we hardly put up a fight) the best two books I’ve read in years (#theoverstoryshould be mandatory reading the world over), yoga, spice, mamma earth and figuring out that all you’re ever looking for can be found within. Corny as hell but my god is it true."

The sun-soaked, happy post sees the duo in the breezy white kurta sets and rudraksha malas offered to guests staying at the resort, lighting diyas next to the Ganga river, and visiting a temple. After the incredibly taxing Game of Thrones shoot schedules, there couldn't have been a better way to unwind.
