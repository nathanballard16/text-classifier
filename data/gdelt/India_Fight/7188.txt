New Delhi: Mohammad Umair, a nephew of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar the mastermind of the Pulwama terror attack is believed to be cornered by the security forces in an ongoing encounter in Pinglin village of Pulwama district on Monday.

Abdul Rashid Ghazi, a Jaish-e-Mohammad commander and an Afghan war veteran is also believed to have been cornered in the operation. Ghazi infiltrated into Kashmir in December 2018 to carry out terror attacks.

Three jawans and a Major-ranking officer were martyred in the encounter. The four Army personnel belonged to 55 Rashtriya Rifles, news agency ANI reported. Meanwhile, one civilian has also reportedly lost his life during the operation. The security forces also recovered ane AK-47 and one pistol.

The operation is being carried out by a joint team consisting of 55 Rashtriya Rifles, police and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Meanwhile, the police appealed to locals to leave the encounter site.

On February 14, at least 40 CRPF personnel were killed and several others injured after a terrorist of Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based terror group rammed his explosive-laden vehicle into CRPF convoy on Jammu-Srinagar highway in Pulwama district. NIA experts are studying the forensic pieces of evidence of the blast that also potentially involved an IED device fitted into the moving vehicle, not a work that novices can pull off.
