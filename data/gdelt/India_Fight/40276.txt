Akshay Kumar and Rana Daggubati to have a qawwali dance off in Housefull 4? Here’s what we know

Housefull 4 has been in the news for a lot of reasons- from the director, Sajid Khan being accused in the Me Too case to Farhad Samji taking over as the captain of the ship to Rana Daggubati replacing Nana Patekar in the film after the latter was accused of sexual misconduct by Tanushree Dutta. Now, although the shooting of the film has wrapped up, the makers are now planning to shoot a qawwali sequence for the film.

Not an action face-off but it is being reported that the makers are planning to have a qawwali face off between Akshay Kumar and Rana Daggubati and this sequence will be a crucial part of the plot and will take the story forward. “It appears at a crucial juncture and is on the lines of a fun conversation between the protagonist and the antagonist,” as quoted by Mumbai Mirror. Currently, Rana is in USA and once he returns from USA, the makers will shoot for the fun qawwali sequence. And since the makers want to release the film in October, the shooting of the qawwali song will mostly kick start by end of the month.



Directed by Farhad Samji, Housefull 4 is the fourth instalment from the comedy franchise and the film stars Akshay Kumar, Kriti Sanon, Bobby Deol, Pooja Hedge, Retiesh Dekhmukh and others. Besides Housefull 4, Akshay has a couple of films lined up like Laxmmi Bomb, Good News and currently, he is shooting for Rohit Shetty’s Sooryavanshi.
