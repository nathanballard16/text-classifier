'Voting for YSR Congress like writing death warrant,' says Chandrababu Naidu

New Delhi :

Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu on Friday launched a blistering attack on regional rival YSR Congress, saying that voting for the party would be like "writing your own death warrant". Speaking at a rally in Visakhapatnam, the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief said, "Voting for TDP will be the victory of people, but voting for YSR Congress is like writing your own death warrant."

The Andhra Pradesh chief minister appealed people to vote for the TDP in the crucial Lok Sabha elections as polls will decide the future of the state. "The Lok Sabha elections will decide the future of the state. People should vote for TDP for better future and development," Naidu said.

Naidu accused YSR Congress chief Jagan Reddy of looting public money and said that the development of the state will be hampered if he comes to power. "Jagan (YSRCP chief YS Jaganmohan Reddy) is an anarchist. If he comes to power, state development will be hampered. He is an expert in crimes. If he comes to power, there will be no law and order in the state," he said.

The TDP chief also alleged that the YSR Congress chief was behind the murder of his own uncle. "Jagan Reddy's paternal uncle was killed in his own house, but they tried to make people believe that it was a heart attack. They tampered with evidence and altered the crime scene," he said.

The Andhra chief minister highlighted the welfare schemes launched by him and promised to bring water from Godavari river to Visakhapatnam. "I am like an elder son in every family. I gave financial support to 98 lakh DWCRA (Development of Women and Children in Rural Areas) sisters under the Pasupu Kumkuma scheme. I provided welfare pension of Rs. 2000 to senior citizens. We will bring water from the Godavari to Visakhapatnam and the Uttara Andhra Sujala Sravanti project will be completed in a year," he said.
