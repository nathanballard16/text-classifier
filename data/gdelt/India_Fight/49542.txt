By praising Baghdadi-cornering K-9, Trump stirs Islam’s complicated dog history — and his own

President Donald Trump has singled out a U.S. military dog that helped corner Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi before he killed himself during a Saturday mission in Syria. In doing so, he has waded into the Middle East’s — and his own — complicated history with the species.

As he announced the extremist group leader’s death in Sunday morning remarks from the White House, the commander in chief sent mixed messages about canines. It was difficult to determine how Trump, widely known as not a big animal fan, feels about dogs, even as he described the Syria raid.

By both describing in some detail how the U.S. military K-9 cornered al-Baghdadi and saying the terrorist mastermind “died like a dog,” it was not clear the president was all that immersed in the Muslim world’s centuries-old skepticism of the species.

America’s other post-9/11 presidents, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, tried to respect the traditions and views of Islam, but the 45th president has a history of criticizing it and attacking some Muslims — including Democratic Reps. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, two members of the all-female, all-minority House “squad.”
