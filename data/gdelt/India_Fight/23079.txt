The Butler County coroner has identified the four people found dead in West Chester, Ohio, on Sunday night. Those killed include Hakiakat Singh Pannag, 59; Parmjit Kaur, 62; Amarjit Kaur, 58; and Shalinderjit Kaur, 39. Hakiakat Singh Pannag and Parmjit Kaur were husband and wife. Shalinderjit Kaur was their daughter. Amarjit Kaur was Hakiakat Singh Pannag's sister-in-law.The coroner said all four died from "gunshots." Investigators have not said how many times each victim was shot. A motive behind the slayings remains unclear, and investigators have not revealed any suspect information. An Indian national is among the four dead in the mass shooting, Chowkidar Sushma Swaraj said. Swaraj, minister of external affairs for the government of India, said her office was informed that one of the four people killed Sunday night in West Chester was visiting the United States, while the three others were of Indian origin. Swaraj added that an Indian ambassador confirmed that the matter is not being investigated as a hate crime. West Chester Police Chief Joel Herzog also said he believes the homicides are not classified as hate crimes or random shootings. It was not clear which individual was the Indian national.“The victims and their families are on our minds every step of the way in this investigation,” said Herzog. “This case will continue to be our top priority until those who committed this crime are held accountable.”On Tuesday afternoon, a forensic dive team scoured the lake behind the West Chester apartment on Wyndtree Drive where the four were found dead of multiple gunshot wounds.Shortly after noon, WLWT watched as a member of the dive team pulled something from the water. It appeared to be a gun.Rick Karvosky and other neighbors were looking on."One of the guys was walking with a metal detector, and all of a sudden, he looked up, shouted, and everybody rushed towards him," Karvosky said. "The neighbors next to me said, 'Hey they got the gun.'"West Chester police have not confirmed if the gun that was found was the one thought to have been used in the shootings. "I was shocked and my family, my wife and the Sikh community," said Satnam Singh, who owns the India Bazar in West Chester. "They would never hurt anybody."Family members of the victims tell WLWT they hope to send the victims' bodies back to India, their native country, for burial. The married victims, Hakiakat Singh Pannag and Parmjit Kaur, were planning to visit India later this week, according to Singh."They were very happy," he said. "Had no problems," he said referring to the last time he saw the family on Sunday.In a 911 call released by police, a family member told a dispatcher that he came home to find his wife and three other family members bleeding."My wife and my family are bleeding ... They're on the ground and they're bleeding," the caller said to the dispatcher.Police confirmed the caller was a family member who discovered the victims. The caller was not taken into custody, police saidJasminder Singh, who said he had a conversation with one of the four who died, just a few hours before the shooting, said the four were very involved in the Sikh community."I met him yesterday in temple. He was here," Singh said from inside the Sikh temple on Tylerville Road."It's sad, very sad. Whatever happened, we lost four people," Singh said. The victim Singh spoke to was among the first people he met when he came to the area 12 years ago."The best I know about him, he's a very good friend," Singh said.Police said it does not appear that the shooter is among the dead or that anyone returned fire. No suspects or persons of interest have been named.Neighbors said that since the shootings, there has been an increased police presence in the area."A detective came to the house yesterday and asked if I had seen anything, and he told us it was an isolated incident, we feel everybody's safe, and we're keeping a presence here as a safety factor," Karvosky said.Police said children live in the home, but weren't there at the time of the shooting and are currently with other family members.Anyone with information about the incident is asked to call West Chester police.
