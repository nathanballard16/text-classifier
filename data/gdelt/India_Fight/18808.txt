AFP question mistress of man whose wife was killed in India

The mistress of a Gold Coast man whose pregnant wife was kidnapped and murdered in India last month is being questioned by Australian Federal Police.

Aged care nurse Ravneet Kaur, who has a four-year-old daughter and was pregnant with her second baby, travelled to India on February 25 to visit family and friends.

Her body was found in an canal, in Punjab, on March 25.

The AFP did not comment today but have previously said they would assist the Indian authorities in any way possible.

Indian police have told 9News her husband, Jaspreet Singh, from Surfers Paradise, is a suspect in her death.

They allege Mr Singh was having an affair, and “hatched the conspiracy” with his mistress.

Mr Singh has told 9News he wasn’t involved.

“I have lost everything,” he said.

“Why would I kill her? She’s my wife. I have a daughter of four years.”
