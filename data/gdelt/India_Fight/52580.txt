A BJP panel has demanded an “independent and fair judicial inquiry” into the brutal murder of Dalit labourer Jagmail Singh at Changaliwala village in Sangrur district.

Constituted by BJP chief Amit Shah to probe the murder, the three-member committee comprises party vice-president and Rajya Sabha member Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, Baghpat MP Satyapal Singh and Lok Sabha member from Jharkhand VD Ram. They accused the police and local administration of working under the pressure of “local Congress leaders led by Rajinder Kaur Bhattal as the accused were closely associated with her.”

“The Punjab Government cannot wash its hands by announcing compensation. Justice should be ensured for the family by bringing the culprits to the book. We demand an independent and fair judicial inquiry into the case as no action has been taken against the local officials for their inaction,” Sahasrabuddhe said.

The BJP said, “the fabric of society is becoming weak under the Congress rule in the state. In past years, incidents of atrocities against Dalits have increased in Punjab. A scenario where justice is not ensured for weaker sections of society can be exploited by anti-national forces to foment trouble.”

The committee had visited the village and met the victim’s family, community leaders, villagers and government officials.
