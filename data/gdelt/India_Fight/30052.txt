New Delhi: A video of slain Hizbul Mujahideen commander Zakir Musa’s father Abdul Rashid Bhat has surfaced on the internet where he can be seen spewing venom against the Indian government.

The father of the dreaded terrorist receives a pension for his upkeep from the Centre but he, on the other hand, is actively fuelling anti-India sentiments. In the video, Abdul Rashid Bhat can be heard appealing to the people of the Valley to not get divided.

“Please be united, don't get divided. The enemy is always looking for an opportunity to divide us. Already, they have succeeded in doing so. Now, they are trying to create wedges between different outfits. All Mujahids are our darlings; all those fighting for Allah are equal. It hardly matters which outfit he belongs to or how educated he is,” says Bhat.

Bhat retired as a senior engineer and used to work with the state government.

According to Times Now he receives Rs 50,000 per month as pension besides other perks but in the video, he can be seen indoctrinating young impressionable minds in the Valley.

This video comes after five Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) troopers and one militant were killed while four others, including one civilian and three security men, were injured after a gunfight erupted in Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district on Wednesday.

As per the CRPF sources, one of the terrorists involved in the attack was on a 'fidayeen' (suicide) mission as he did not leave the place after carrying out the attack but his two accomplices managed to flee from the spot.

While the Indian security forces killed over 100 terrorists this year including Zakir Musa, a new development has alarmed the Centre as terrorism in the Valley has shifted from armed insurgency to the rise of political Islam similar to the Islamic State.
