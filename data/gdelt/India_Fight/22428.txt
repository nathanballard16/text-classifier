Raid my house if I do anything wrong: PM Modi

Bhopal: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said that his residence should also be raided by the Income Tax officers if he was found indulging in any gadbad (wrongdoing).

Addressing an election meeting in district headquarters of Sidhi in Madhya Pradesh, Mr Modi said, “Law is equal for all. My residence should also be searched, if I have done wrong.”

Referring to recent raids on close aides of MP Chief Minister Kamal Nath by I-T sleuths, he said, “They (the Congressmen) were complaining that they were targeted by the agencies. They were targeted because they indulged in wrongdoing. My house should also be searched if I have done wrong.”

Mr Modi told BJP booth-level workers before filing his nomination papers in Varanasi that a pro-incumbency wave was witnessed for the first time in the country.

According to his affidavit filed with the Election Commission, Mr Modi has assets worth Rs 2.5 crore including a residential plot in Gujarat’s Gandhinagar, fixed deposits of Rs 1.27 crore and Rs 38,750 cash in hand.

Mr Modi has named Jashodaben as his wife and declared that he has an M.A. degree from Gujarat University in 1983.

The affidavit said that he was an arts graduate from Delhi University (1978 batch).
