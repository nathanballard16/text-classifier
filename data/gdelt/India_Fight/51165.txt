And yet again, Ranveer is back to not letting his wife Deepika Padukone know how much he loves her but also announce it to the world, thanks to social media. If you have been following him on Deepika's posts then you would know what we are trying to say. The moment she shares a picture of herself be it a magazine shoot or a red carpet appearance, Ranveer has to leave a cheesy comment. It's become more like a social media routine for these lovebirds, ever since they got married.

So it comes as no surprise that Ranveer couldn't calm down his emotions seeing a red hot Deepika setting her Instagram feed on fire, today. The beauty opted for a stunning all-red off-shoulder dress and paired with same coloured pumps. We love how she decided to go minimal in terms of accessories and make-up and allowed red to dominate her style statement. However, it's the caption that's making Ranveer's imaginations run wild.

" RED- is the color that makes people hungry. Red also instantly attracts attention,makes people excited,energetic and increases heart rate! All of the things I’m going for today, " wrote DP and Ranveer was quick to leave multiple comments that summed up his state of mind. "Yes ! All of the above are happening to me right now," read his first comment followed by the second one that said, "My spirit colour" along with his last comment, "The colour of Passion hayye."

Who else wants to second Ranveer's thoughts, after seeing Deepika's red hot avatar?

Meanwhile, this much-in-love couple will be celebrating their first wedding anniversary on November 14-15. The duo has decided to ring in this special ocassion by visiting Tirupati and Golden Temple, Amritsar with their families.
