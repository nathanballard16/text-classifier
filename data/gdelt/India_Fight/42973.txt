Amritsar, September 10

The Archbishop of Canterbury, United Kingdom, Justin Portal Welby on Tuesday visited the Jallianwalla Bagh in Amritsar, where he said the experience was “deeply humbling” and provoked “profound shame”.

In a message written for the book of condolences at the Bagh, the Archbishop said: “It is deeply humbling and provokes feelings of profound shame for me as British Christian to visit this place that witnessed such an atrocity over a hundred years ago. My first response is pray to my loving heavenly father for healing to those still suffering grief, loss and anger. That prayer to god for healing then compels me to commit to actions that may seek to bridge divides of culture and religion that we may together root out hatred and seek the common good.”

I feel a deep sense of grief, humility and profound shame having visited the site of the horrific #JallianwalaBagh massacre in Amritsar today.

The Archbishop had arrived in Amritsar on Monday, which is the last leg of his 10-day tour.

Accompanied by his wife Caroline, the Archbishop had received a warm welcome at Sri Guru Ram Dass Jee International Airport amid Punjabi dhol beats.
