Indian police battle baton charge students over fee protests

NEW DELHI: Indian police fought street battles in New Delhi on Monday with thousands of students who stepped up protests over fee increases at one of the country´s top universities.

Police baton charged some groups of demonstrators and media reports said dozens of students from Jawaharlal Nehru University were detained. The university is one of India´s most prestigious and counts top politicians including FM Subrahmanyam Jaishankar and this year´s Nobel economics prize winner Abhijit Banerjee among past students. Defying a ban on groups of more than four people, demonstrators started a march from the university to the parliament as part of their action against higher costs for accommodation as well as curfews and other restrictions on campus.
