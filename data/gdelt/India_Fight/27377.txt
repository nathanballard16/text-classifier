Prateek Jain to debut in Telugu

Former Mr India World Prateek Jain is all set to make his debut in Tollywood. Prateek, who won the coveted title in 2014, has since then been active in the modeling circuit. Impressed by his looks and body language, K. S. Ravindra (Bobby), the director of Venky Mama, has roped him in to play a crucial role in the film. The mixed martial arts fighter from Bengaluru will be seen sharing the screen with protagonists Venkatesh and Naga Chaitanya in the forthcoming film.

Apparently, the actor commenced shooting for his part in Kashmir a few ago, and the unit was reportedly elated about his inclusion. Although Prateek’s role in the film has not been disclosed yet, rumours are rife that he has been commissioned to play a badass.

“Bobby is convinced that a new face will complement the role. Other than lending a fresh appeal to the character, Prateek’s performance is also expected to accentuate the impact of the scenes,” said a source in the know.
