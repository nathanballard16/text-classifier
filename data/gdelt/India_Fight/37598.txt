Man involved in four murders arrested

A sharpshooter of the Abdul Naseer gang, who was involved in four murder cases, has been arrested, the police said on Sunday.

Kumar Gyanesh, Additional DCP (South-East) said that the accused Ible Hassan alias Dilshad was an active member of the gang. “A team from Shaheen Bagh police station was keeping an eye on the movements of criminals released on bail recently. We got an information about Ible and a trap was laid at Abul Fazal Enclave where he was spotted,” he said.

A countrymade pistol and a live cartridge were recovered from his possession, Mr. Gyanesh said.

During interrogation, Ible told the police that he was a vegetable seller before he started keeping bad company. He said he started committing crimes from 1999 to earn quick money.

In 2008, to avenge the murder of his cousin Wakeel Ahmed, Ible killed one Shameen at Gulaoti in Uttar Pradesh after which he was in jail for three years.

In 2014, he killed another person at Okhla. In the same year, he killed one Akil Mama at Jafarabad. Personal enmity was said to have been the motive behind these two murders.

Zahid, the brother of Akil Mama, was the eyewitness of the latter’s murder in 2014. Zahid’s life was under threat and he was provided a personal security officer by Delhi Police. In 2015, Ible, along with his accomplices, put chilli powder in the eyes of Zahid’s PSO and eliminated Zahid.

Ible was released on bail in June. Due to MCOCA proceedings initiated against kingpin Abdul Naseer and his gang members by the Crime Branch, they all went underground. In their absence, Ible was planning to lead the gang and was looking forward to recruit new people, the police said.
