BH-CHIRAG-TERROR

Pulwama avenged but fight should continue till every terrorist

in Pak is killed: Chirag

Patna, Mar 7 (PTI) Lok Janshakti Party leader Chirag

Paswan on Thursday lauded the armed forces for having

"avenged" the Pultwama terror attack but asserted that the

operations "must continue till each and every terrorist hiding

in Pakistan was eliminated."

The LJP parliamentary board chief, who had shot off an

emotional letter after the dastardly attack on a CRPF convoy

last month, which claimed 40 lives, also said that he was "yet

to recover from the emotional trauma", so he would be staying

away from the upcoming Holi festivities.

"Prime Minister Narendra Modi took strong action and

our brave armed forces avenged the Pulwama terror attack

inside the Pakistani territory. But the fight against

terrorism must continue till each and every terrorist hiding

there was killed," Paswan said in a statement here.

The Jamui MP also said "Holi is a festival of colours,

a celebration of fraternity. I am used to celebrating it

enthusiastically with people ... But I am yet to recover from

the emotional trauma that was caused to me by the dastardly

terror attack. I express my solidarity with the bereaved

family members of the CRPF men who were killed in the attack

and hereby decide to stay away from the festivities this

year." PTI NAC
