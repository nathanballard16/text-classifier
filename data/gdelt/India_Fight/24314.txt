Why do you want us to stop chanting 'Jai Shri Ram', Lord Rama is every Indian's idol: Amit Shah asks Mamata

None can be forced to chant what Narendra Modi or BJP wants, she said adding that West Bengal’s culture has never been what the saffron party is trying to make it.

Addressing a political rally in West Bengal's Paschim Medinipur, Shah asked: "Mamata Didi, why do you want to stop us from chanting ‘Jai Shree Ram’ in India? Shree Ram is the idol of every Indian, he exists in the culture and ethos of India. No one can stop Indians from worshipping him." Shah's remarks came a day after Banerjee said that ‘Jai Shri Ram’ is the BJP’s slogan and it is trying to force everybody to chant it. “Does Ramchandra become BJP’s election agent when election comes?” the fiery TMC supremo asked at public rallies here.
