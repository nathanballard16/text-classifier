India has published the final version of a list which effectively strips about 1.9 million people in the north-eastern state of Assam of their citizenship. People left off the list will have 120 days to appeal against their exclusion. Several reports said, It is unclear what happens next.

1.9 million people have been left out in the final National Register of Citizens (NRC) - a list intended to identify legal residents and weed out illegal immigrants from Assam.

Coming just weeks after the centre struck down Jammu and Kashmir's decades-old autonomy, the NRC too is expected to go down as one of the biggest moves in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's second term.

Security has been tightened in Assam, with tens of thousands of paramilitary personnel and police posted across the north-eastern state bordering Bangladesh.

A draft version of the list published last year had four million people excluded.
