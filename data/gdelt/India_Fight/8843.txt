Pulwama incident outcome of intelligence failure: Former minister

New Delhi, February 22, 2019 (PPI-OT): Congress leader and India’s former minister of State of Defence, Jitendra Singh, has termed the Pulwama incident as a major failure of Indian Intelligence agencies. “The Pulwama attack is highly condemnable, but I can’t deny that there was an intelligence failure as I have worked in Defence,” said the Congress leader, who was the Minister of State for Defence in 2012.

More than 40 troops of Indian Central Reserve Police Force were killed and dozens others injured when a car laden with explosives hit one of the vehicles of a large CRPF convoy in Lethpora area of Pulwama on Srinagar-Jammu Highway on February 14.
