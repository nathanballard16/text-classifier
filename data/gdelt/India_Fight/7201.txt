New Delhi: Amid increasingly stressed diplomatic ties between India and Pakistan following the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror attack in Pulwama, Islamabad, on Monday, called back its High Commissioner in India Sohail Mahmood 'for consultations'. The development comes just days after India revoked the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status granted to Pakistan in light of the dastardly attack on CRPF personnel on February 14.

"We have called back our High Commissioner in India for consultations. He left New Delhi this morning," Dr Mohammad Faisal, spokesperson of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a tweet on Monday morning. Earlier, Pakistan dismissed India's assertions that Pakistan-backed Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists had carried out the February 14 attack on CRPF convoy, which resulted in the death of 40 CRPF jawans.

"India owes an explanation on reports of Adil Ahmed Dar’s arrest and custody since 2017. India needs to introspect and respond to questions about its security and intelligence lapses that led to this attack," he had earlier said. Meanwhile, India received overwhelming support from the international community following the Pulawama attack on its security forces. A day after the attack, the MEA had appraised representatives of 25 nations about the terror emanating from Pakistan's soil and reiterated its proposal to list terrorists, including JeM Chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan.
