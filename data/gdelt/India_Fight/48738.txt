An early morning encounter broke out between a group of criminals and Delhi Police personnel in Delhi's Connaught Place on Wednesday. Three of four criminals who opened fire at the police were caught while two of them were injured in the firing.

Delhi Police chased down a group of criminals in a bid to crackdown on a racket of chain snatchers that have been prowling in the heart of Delhi for several weeks.

The group of 4 robbers opened fire at the police near the Shankar Market area early on Wednesday morning. Police retaliated and two of them were injured in the cross-firing.

The 3 criminals arrested have been identified as Salim, Ismail and Saud. Salim and Ismail have been taken to RML Hospital after they suffered bullet injuries in the encounter.

One of the four in the group managed to flee the scene. The group was riding motorbikes when the encounter broke out.

In a statement, Delhi Police said, "Information was received that the robbers and snatchers who target cyclists in the morning will again carry out robbery today. On the basis of this information, a trap was laid near Shankar Market."

"When two suspects riding a black Pulsar came by, they were asked to stop by the police team but they tried to run away and started firing on the police. Police team fired back in self defence. In the process, 2 persons namely Mohd Salim and Mohd Ismail suffered bullet injuries."

A case under Sections 186/353/307/34 of IPC and 25/27 of Arms Act has been registered and raids are being carried out by several teams.
