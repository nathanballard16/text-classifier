New Oviedo Mayor Megan Sladek hopes to give residents a voice

“I did it to give a voice to the people,” said Sladek, 40. “It’s about respect for the residents. If people come [to a meeting] and they want to share an opinion that is different from yours, I don’t want us to be like ‘Oh, you don’t understand. Your concern is not truly valid.’ That’s not the right answer. A better answer is: ‘Let me try to understand why you’re fully concerned and see if we can come up with a way to have you be less concerned.’”
