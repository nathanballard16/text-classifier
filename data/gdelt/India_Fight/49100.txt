Kamlesh Tiwari Murder: Islamic Body Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind Ready To ‘Provide Legal Aid’ To Accused

New Delhi:

Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, the largest Muslim body in India, has decided to bear the legal expenses for the five accused held in the Kamlesh Tiwari murder case. The Islamic body has further offered to extend the service of its legal cell in the case.

Meanwhile, Kiran Tiwari, wife of Kamlesh Tiwari, has been announced as the new president of the Hindu Samaj Party.

Kamlesh Tiwari was killed in his residence-cum-office in Lucknow on October 18. Both the assailants, Moinuddin Pathan and Ashfaq Shaikh, both residents of Surat, were arrested earlier this week by the Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS).

A total of five persons have been arrested so far in connection with the case. Other accused -- Rashid Pathan, Faizan Sheikh, and Maulana Mohsin Sheikh - were on October 22 sent to police custody for four days in connection with the case.

The autopsy report of former Hindu Mahasabha leader had revealed some gruesome details. Kamlesh Tiwari was stabbed 15 times, shot in the face and an attempt was made to slit his throat. It seemed that the killers did not want Tiwari to survive under any circumstance. The stabbing was mostly on the upper part of Tiwari's body, revealed the post-mortem report. It added that two deep cut marks on Tiwari's neck underlined that an attempt was made to slit his throat.
