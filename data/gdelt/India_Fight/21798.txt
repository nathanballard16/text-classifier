Sridevi didn't approve of THIS tattoo on her younger daughter Khushi Kapoor; Read on

The Kapoor sisters Janhvi and Khushi appeared on BFF's with Vogue recently. The two were twinning with their looks as they wore cute mini skirts and white tops. Janhvi made her debut with the film 'Dhadak' alongside Ishaan Khatter and she soon became everyone's favourite. On the show, Khushi shared that she wants to follow her sister's footsteps and enter the film industry. Khushi also said that she trusts Karan Johar blindly and hopes that Karan would launch her as he did with other celebrities like Alia Bhatt, Varun Dhawan and her own sister Janhvi too.

The famous Kapoor sisters also talked about the tattoos on their body. Khushi revealed that she has three —one with all her family’s birthdays in Roman numerals, another one of her best friend's name, and the third one is on her bum which says, "Khud ki raah banao." In fact, she unveiled that the third tattoo is the one that she is most embarrassed about. Her mom Sridevi and sister Janhvi did not like her tattoo obsession. The Dhadak actress also said that she thinks that she is 'too chicken to get inked'. Janhvi also joked as to how she would get her future husband to get inked saying 'Property of JK'.
