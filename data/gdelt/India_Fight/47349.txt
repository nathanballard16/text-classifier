Primary School Students Forced To Eat ‘Turmeric-Rice’ For Mid-Day Meal In Uttar Pradesh

Chief minister Yogi Aditynath-led Uttar Pradesh government was once again left red-faced after a video surfaced online where primary school children were seen eating “turmeric-rice” under the Mid-Day Meal scheme.

Children of the primary school at Vichparia village in the state's Sitapur district, around 90 kilometres from state capital Lucknow, were served rice and juice prepared with turmeric though as per the menu they were supposed to be served vegetables and rice.

After the video went viral on social media, District basic education department officials rushed to the school for damage control and refuted the charges. They even claimed that the students were served rice and vegetables and the video was a plot to malign the authorities.

The education department officials claimed that the video was shot after students were through their meal.

Officials also recorded statements of the students from the school. However, there has been no action in this regard yet.

In August, a similar controversy erupted when chapatis with salt were served to students of a government school as part of mid-day meal in Hinauta village of Mirzapur district in Uttar Pradesh.

After the district authorities learned about the incident, they suspended a teacher of the school and launched an inquiry into the incident.

The controversy snowballed when UP government booked the journalist who reported about the incident, shot a video and exposed school authorities.

Pawan Jaiswal, a local journalist with Jansandesh Times, was booked on charges of cheating and criminal conspiracy, based on a complaint by the block education officer of the area, who accused him and a representative of the local village head, of colluding to slander the Uttar Pradesh government.
