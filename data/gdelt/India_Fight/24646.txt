Brigadier (retired) Khushal Thakur, a Kargil War veteran, has said that a day after Tiger Hill was recaptured, PM Modi visited the area to boost the Army's morale.

Thakur, who is now a BJP leader, said Modi's visit showed he was very concerned about the country's security even when he wasn't holding any official post.

Thakur told media persons in Shimla that when Modi visited Tiger Hill on July 5, 1999, he was neither PM nor was he the Gujarat chief minister at the time. Khushal Thakur was the commanding officer of the 18 Grenadiers at the time of Tiger Hill's recapture.

He said Modi at the time was the Himachal Pradesh BJP in-charge.

Thakur said India's national security and foreign policy has witnessed a significant shift in the last five years under Modi's watch. He said BJP's zero tolerance towards terrorism was "proved" through surgical and air strikes.

Thakur said two soldiers of Himachal Pradesh received Param Vir Chakras for laying down their lives during the Kargil War.

He said the issue of creating a Himachal Regiment will be taken up with the Centre.

Efforts will be made to increase the quota for the state's youth in the Army by making suitable changes in the existing recruitable male population (RMP) formula, he added.
