Patna, July 19 : In another case of street justice in a Bihar village, three men were allegedly thrashed to death and one critically injured by villagers over suspicion of cattle theft on Friday, police said.

The deceased were identified as Naushad Quraishi, Raju Nut and Videsh Nut. The incident took place in Pithori Nandlal village under Baniyapur police station in Saran district, according to the police.

"Four suspected cattle thieves were caught by villagers, three were beaten badly and they died on the way to the hospital. One was seriously injured and was admitted to a hospital. Police have arrested the three accused in the case, but it was not a case of mob lynching," said Saran Superintendent of Police Hari Kishore Rai.

Police have lodged a case of murder against half-a-dozen unidentified people.
