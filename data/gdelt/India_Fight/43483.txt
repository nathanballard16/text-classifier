Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today announced return of odd-even scheme in the national capital from November 4 to 15 as part of its ambitious ‘Parali Pradushan’ action plan to combat incoming smog from Punjab and Haryana, caused by burning of stubble in winter months.

Last week, Kejriwal had shared data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) that showed PM 2.5 concentration in Delhi declining 25 per cent over the past three years.

The Chief Minister had last week sought suggestions from public on how to prepare for the smog season. In one week, the government received 1,200 emails from citizens, based on which the action plan has been designed. This is in addition to the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).

During the 12-day odd-even scheme, vehicles will ply alternately on odd and even dates as per their registration numbers. The previous two versions of the scheme were implemented in January and April in 2016. “Studies have shown that the odd-even scheme had reduced air pollution in Delhi by 10-13 per cent,” he said.

The government would procure N-95 anti-pollution masks that would be distributed among people in October, he said. With the SC prohibiting bursting of crackers in Delhi, the government would organise a community laser show on the eve of Diwali. To control dust on roads, the frequency and area of water sprinkling would be increased, he said, adding special plans would be devised to deal with 12 identified pollution hotspots in the city.

Two environment marshals would be appointed in every ward to keep leaf burning in check. “Leaf burning is a major factor in the winter pollution,” he said. A “Delhi Tree Challenge” campaign would be started in which saplings would be home-delivered to people, he said. Also, a war room would be set up to deal with pollution complaints.
