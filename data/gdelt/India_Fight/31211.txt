Sanjay Gupta’s new directorial, Mumbai Saga, has piqued cinegoers’ curiosity since its announcement. Starring John Abraham and Emraan Hashmi together for the first time, the gangster flick set in Bombay of 1980s and ’90s also sees old associates collaborating again, more so for Gulshan Grover.

This is the fifth movie that Bollywood’s Bad Man is doing with Sanjay — after Aatish (1994), Kaante (2002), Woodstock Villa (2008) and Acid Factory (2009).

Gulshan says his ‘favourite’ director gave him a chance to shine in (Sanjay’s debut) Aatish, and the impact of his role as the one-eyed gangster Kaniya is still felt.

Like in Sanjay’s maiden movie, Gulshan played a pivotal part in John’s debut, Jism (2003), too. And he’ll share screen space with Emraan after Gangster (2006).

“And both, Emraan and I are Mahesh Bhatt’s proteges,” says Gulshan. Jackie Shroff and Suniel Shetty, who are also a part of the ensemble cast of Mumbai Saga, are ‘brothers’ for him and so is Rohit Roy, with whom he’ll be working after a long time. And for someone who has shared screen space with Smita Patil and Raj Babbar, Gulshan will be working with their son, Prateik, for the first time in this gangster movie.
