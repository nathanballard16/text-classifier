The passenger train smashed into a freight train, overturning carriages.

The Akbar Express, heading to the western city of Quetta from Lahore, crashed into the freight train in the Sadiqabad area of Punjab province's southern Rahim Yar Khan district

It destroyed five carriages and trapped passengers.

Rescue workers freed the wounded by cutting through the twisted metal of the carriages and dozens were taken to hospital, police said.

Prime Minister Imran Khan blamed the infrastructure of Pakistan's colonial-era railway network, which has fallen into disrepair due to chronic under-investment and poor maintenance.

He said: "Have asked Railways Minister to take emergency steps to counter decades of neglect of railway infrastructure and ensure safety standards."

Last month, six people were killed when a freight train collided with a passenger train in Hyderabad 165 km (100 miles) from Karachi.

The cause of Thursday's crash is under investigation but Railways Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed said human error was believed to be responsible.

He told Geo Television: "I have ordered an inquiry. Investigation will complete in two-three days."

The minister also announced compensation for the dead and injured.
