Claymore mine, sniper rifle: How agencies prevented Pak-based plot to mass murder Amarnath pilgrims

On Friday, the Jammu and Kashmir government issued an advisory asking tourists and pilgrims to curtail their travels and return after sniper guns and a Pakistani-made claymore mine was found on the pilgrimage route. In its advisory, the state government immediately asked pilgrims to return.

On Friday, the Jammu and Kashmir government issued an advisory asking tourists and pilgrims to curtail their travels and return after sniper guns and a Pakistani-made claymore mine was found on the pilgrimage route. In its advisory, the state government immediately asked pilgrims to return.

This is the first time a Claymore Mine has been discovered in Kashmir and intel agency sources suggest that Pakistani-based terrorists were plotting a mass murder.

The discovery of the mine has understandably got the security agencies in a tizzy whose job to find the mine before it could cause casualties must be commended. The mine was found near Sheshnaag.

The mine bears marks to suggest it was made by the Pakistan Ordnance Factories. The mine appeared to have been hidden some time ago.

While Maoists have used a similar device, this is the first time it makes an appearance in Kashmir. A similar mine was used in 2014 along the LoC.

The development comes at a time when US President Donald Trump expressed a desire to 'mediate in Kashmir', an offer India has rebuffed time and again, letting the world know that there was no scope of third-party mediation.
