11 departments failed to combat dengue in 2018

PATIALA: Even as the state government constituted a task force, comprising top functionaries of 11 departments, to combat the spread of dengue, the joint efforts failed to curtail the problem in Patiala Cabinet minister for health Brahm Mohindra said that last year 35,075 tests were conducted at 32 laboratories across the state.“The number of causalities was less compared to 2017 on the back of elaborate arrangements put in place by the state health department. These arrangements included setting up of special wards for dengue patients and ensuring availability of platelet kits,” the minister said.He added that government departments like animal husbandry, labour, local government, water supply and sanitation, rural development, school education and transport were roped to work with Indian Medical Association and a comprehensive strategy was chalked out to deal with the menace.“For the first time portable fogging machines were used to cover areas from where dengue cases were reported. The role of my department started when a patient was admitted in a hospital. Before that preventive measures were taken by the department of local bodies, rural development.“Departments like labour, education and transport too played an important role in generating public awareness and informing people to take preventive measures,” the health minister said.However, official data states otherwise. The number of dengue cases in 2018 were only 102 less than a year ago period. In 2017, Patiala reported 2,434 cases of dengue.A total of 5,183 elisa tests were conducted at Rajindra hospital and Mata Kausalya hospital. As many as 10,285 challans were issued to property owners for not keeping their surroundings clean.Despite patiala municipal corporation’s claims of spending Rs 50,000 a day on fumigation, the number of dengue cases could not be curtailed. Even the deployment of 150 men and women, along with sanitary inspectors and Asha workers, failed to curb the outbreak.
