Kabisuryanagar turns a drug trafficking hub

Kabisuryanagar: The smuggling of country liquor and cannabis to neighbouring states from Kabisuryanagar in Ganjam district is rapidly increasing as law enforcers are doing nothing to check it.

Although the smuggling of these items is taking place under the eyes of the Excise Department office in Banadevi Colony, the Department has not been able to control the traffickers.

Due to rampant unemployment there is no shortage of men and women, especially youths, who are willing to take the risks associated with drugs smuggling.

Sources said drug traffickers have created a group in this area employing tribal women and youths. The traffickers are smuggling drugs to Surat through their agents from Kabisuryanagar.

Many locals have turned their houses into business centres of cannabis. Country liquor is sold near schools, temples and government offices openly.

The Excise Department operates from a rented house and the owner is a liquor businessman.

When Excise Inspector Gitanjali Sahoo was asked about this, she said they will take steps to control the smugglers soon.
