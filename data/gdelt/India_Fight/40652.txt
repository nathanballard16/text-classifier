Calls for McDonald’s Boycott Go Viral in India Over ‘Halal Meat’ Admission

McDonald's was involved in a social media storm on Friday following a query by a Twitter user who asked the fast-food chain if it had a halal certificate,

Halal food is prepared by slaughtering an animal under Islamic law whereby the animal's throat is cut by a sharp knife severing the carotid artery, jugular vein and windpipe in a single swipe to drain out the blood of the carcass.

The company replied to the query saying all its “restaurants have halal certificates,” perhaps little realising the backlash that was soon to follow.
