Chandigarh: Man gets 5-yr jail for attempt to murder

CHANDIGARH: A local court awarded five-year imprisonment to Rahul, a resident of Ram Darbar, in an attempt to murder case and for voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons. The court of civil judge Kushal Singla also imposed a fine of Rs 11,000 on him.The matter dates back to September 25, 2016, when an FIR was registered at Sector 34 police station under sections 307 (attempt to murder) and 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the IPC.In the complaint, Manish Thapa, 23, said he worked as a cleaner of buses at Raju Travels (Pal Tourist), Sector 46, Chandigarh, and took shelter in the bus only.He is from Nepal. On September 25, 2016, he went to meet his friend Bhalu, who stays in Sector 34 opposite the power house.When he reached in front of the public toilet of Sector 34C, a sanitation worker, Rahul, who is a resident of Ram Darbar, started abusing him. When Manish objected as to why he was abusing, Rahul then picked up a knife (vegetable cutter) from a nearby tea stall and stabbed on the left side of his chest.Bhalu tried to catch him, but he ran away. Later, Bhalu along with one more person took him to GMCH-32 hospital, where his statement was recorded by the police. The police have registered a case under sections 307 and 324 of the IPC. In the court, Rahul pleaded that he was the only bread earner of his family and he had two children whose entire expenses were borne by him. Also, medical expenses of his parents were also borne by him.Whereas, additional public prosecutor, Phool Singh, opposed the request by contending that without any provocation, he inflicted wound in the chest of the complainant, which could have proved fatal, hence looking at the gravity of the offence, the convict must not be shown any leniency.After hearing the arguments, the court awarded five-year imprisonment to Rahul.
