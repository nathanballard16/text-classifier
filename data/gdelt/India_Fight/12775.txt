Karachi, Mar 05: The Pakistan Navy on Tuesday claimed it had detected an Indian submarine trying to enter its territorial waters and successfully thwarted the attempt, Dawn reported, quoting the Navy's spokesperson.

According to the spokesperson, the Pakistan Navy detected an Indian submarine and stopped it from entering Pakistani waters. By doing so, the Pakistan Navy foiled every attempt of the Indian submarine to avoid being detected, dealing a setback to India in the seas.

The report further claimed that the Pakistan Navy used its specialised skills to ward off the submarine which was equipped with the latest technology. The achievement is an evidence of Pakistan Navy's capabilities and shows it is ready and vigilant at all times to defend the country's maritime frontiers, the spokesperson said. Pakistan Navy is capable of giving a jaw-breaking response to any aggression, the statement added.

This was the second instance of the Pakistan Navy detecting an Indian submarine trying to cross into Pakistani waters since November 2016.

The development comes as tensions between India and Pakistan are at an all-time high following the Indian Air Force airstrike in Pakistan that took out Jaish-e-Mohammad's largest terrorist camp.

On February 14, a Jaish-e-Mohammad suicide bomber rammed into a bus that was part of a Central Reserve Police Force convoy. 40 jawans were martyred in the attack, which took place in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama. India vowed a befitting response to the attack.
