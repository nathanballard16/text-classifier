Global Warming Will Raise Temperatures By 1.5 Celsius In 5 Years, And It Will Hit India Hard

Even as groups around the world make their attempts to combat global warming and the climate change it brings, others continue their wanton destruction of our planet. And now, the situation is starting to look grim enough that you wonder if we'll even be able to recover at all.

According to the UK's Met office, global warming could temporarily hit 1.5C above pre-industrial levels by 2023. It's the first time that has ever happened, and the results could be catastrophic.

According to the report, there's a 10 percent chance of us experiencing a year where the average temperature rise is more than 1.5 celsius. Of the two Paris agreements signed to combat global warming, that was the lower danger threshold of the two for the end of the century.

So far, the hottest year on record was 2016, when Earth heated up to 1.11C above pre-industrial levels. It may sound heartening that the heat has gone down in the past two years, but it's unfortunately only a small part of a long term upward trend.

Natural factors tend to make that heat we experience vary year to year. However, scientists estimate we're warming the planet about 0.2-degrees every 10 years. And we're about to hit a critical point in the next five years.

According to the researches, though an outlier event, this rise in temperature would hit regions prone to extreme weather especially hard. This includes regions like South America, parts of Australia and Africa, and India's monsoon belt.

And until we drastically scale back our greenhouse gas emissions, the probability of each year being that hot will continue to rise.
