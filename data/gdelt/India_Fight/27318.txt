In the first incident of post-poll violence in Uttar Pradesh, Singh, a close aide of Irani, the newly elected MP from Amethi Lok Sabha constituency, was shot dead by two men, with the police not ruling out the possibility of it being a "political murder". Singh (50), a former head of Baraulia village, was shot at around 11.30pm on Saturday, said Additional Superintendent of Police Daya Ram.

Singh was referred to a Lucknow hospital but he succumbed during treatment, Ram said. Speaking to reporters in Lucknow, UP DGP Om Prakash Singh said, "We have come to know about old enmity. We are also finding out if there was any political enmity. In initial investigation, we have got some vital clues."

"UP police teams are conducting a very intensive investigation. We have taken seven persons in custody, and they are being intensely interrogated. We have also got important evidence through electronic surveillance. I am hopeful that in the next 12 hours, we will solve the case," the DGP said.

He said they are looking into a number of possible angles that could have led to the killing. Expressing grief over Singh's death, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said, "The death of a party worker is indeed very sad and unfortunate. He was a hard worker. Even if his killers are hiding below the ground, they will be caught. The entire Amethi is sad over the incident."

UP minister Rita Bahuguna Joshi said there's no place for violence in a democracy and demanded strict action against the killers.

Mohsin Raza, the in-charge minister for Amethi district, visited Singh's home and consoled his family members. "As per information received, Singh was attacked in his sleep. This is a very heinous and disgusting incident," he said.

Abhay Singh, son of the former village head, told reporters, "I think some pro-Congress anti-social elements did not like our celebration following BJP's win from Amethi. They were upset. And, yesterday night, this unfortunate incident took place."

Irani defeated the Congress president on Amethi seat, for long a Gandhi family bastion.
