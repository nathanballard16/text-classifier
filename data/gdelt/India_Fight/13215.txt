Tailor helps police crack murder case

The only lead was a collar tag

A tailor who marked every item of clothing he worked on with a collar tag helped the police crack a murder case.

On February 26, the Doddabelavangala police in Bengaluru Rural district discovered the body of man. His face was smashed beyond recognition.

“Our only lead was the collar on the victim’s shirt, which was custom-made by a tailor in Hesaraghatta in Bengaluru,” said the police.

The police learned that the tailor maintained a log book of his regular customers. On cross-checking the tag, he informed that it belonged to Umesh, who was a plumber.

The police have arrested his wife Gayathri, 35, who had separated from him, her friend Kiran, 20, and his 16-year-old brother for the murder.

According to the police, Gayathri and Umesh have been married for 15 years and were residing in KG Lakkur in Bengaluru. They had a son and daughter. The couple separated two years ago and Gayathri moved back to the home of her parents in Kodihalli. There she met Kiran, who was a neighbour.

One week before Umesh was murdered, he had met Gayathri, along with the children, requesting her to return, but she refused. “Umesh decided to stay there and convince her,” said the police.

Gayathri allegedly asked Kiran to take him to the top of a hill and murder him. On February 24, Kiran and his brother took Umesh to the hill, got him drunk and killed him.
