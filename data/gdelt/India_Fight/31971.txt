Centre Will Bear Polavaram Construction Costs: Prakash Javdekar

New Delhi: Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar stated that the Centre would bear all costs pertaining to the construction of Polavaram project, giving YSRCP government in Andhra Pradesh a major shot in the arm. All efforts would be made to hasten the construction process, he added.

Speaking to press persons here on Wednesday, Javadekar said that the Centre had cancelled the Stop-Work order for two years and hence there would be no obstacles for Polavaram. Although the Centre tried to cancel the said order once for all, he said it couldn't be done due to legal issues involved.

He clarified that the Centre was aware of revised estimates vis-a-vis Polavaram and it would take care of the enhanced costs. The Central Hydro Power Department recently approved the revised estimates of Rs 55,548.87 crore towards Polavaram project construction. These estimates were worked out based on the 2017-18 prices.
