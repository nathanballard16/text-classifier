Back in India, relatives of Sikh family murdered in Ohio battle shock and grief

The relatives and friends of Hakikat Singh Panag, who was shot dead along with three other family members in Ohio, are in a state of shock. He and his wife were set to arrive on May 2 at his village in Punjab from the US.

“We are totally in the dark. Don’t know how it happened and who is behind it? I just know that I have lost my brother. He along with his wife were set to arrive here on May 2,” said Harbans Singh, brother of Hakikat Singh.

Hakikat Singh Panag, 59, his wife, Paramjit Kaur, 62, their daughter, Shalinderjit Kaur, 39, and Amarjit Kaur, 58, were shot dead at their residence.

“My brother had gone to the US about 40 years back, and was living happily. I don’t know much about his work and life style in the US, but in India, he is cordial with relatives and friends. Everyone is in shock,” Harbans said.

“I don’t know who will cremate them in the US or whether they will send the bodies to India,” said Harbans. He appealed the External Affairs Ministry to ask the US government to ensure proper investigation and nab the accused.

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj tweeted: “The matter is under investigation by the Police but it is not a hate crime. Our Consul General in New York is coordinating with the concerned authorities and will keep me informed me on this”.

Both Hakikat and his wife Paramjit Kaur had visited the village last year. Paramjit’s nephew Jashandeep Singh said, “Bhau ji (aunt) was looking forward to visiting India. On May 1, I was to take a taxi to reach IGI (airport). But, yesterday, we got this news.”
