A deadly suicide attack in Indian-occupied Kashmir's (IoK) Pulwama district, killing at least 44 Indian paramilitary soldiers, grabbed headlines across various Indian and foreign media outlets on Thursday.The suicide bombing took place when a car rammed a bus carrying troops belonging to India's Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).Hours after the attack, sections of the Indian government and media pinned the attack on Islamabad. The Foreign Office (FO) rejected allegations seeking to link the attack to Pakistan without investigations.The Indian Express quoted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi hinting towards Pakistan in a headline that read: "If our neighbour thinks it can destabilise India, it's making a big mistake". The article emphasised on India's resolve to "initiate diplomatic steps to ensure Pakistan's isolation from the international community".It also quoted Indian Finance Minister Arun Jaitley stating that the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status granted to Pakistan had been withdrawn.Another news piece by India Today covering the incident termed it a "well-planned attack". The publication, later in the piece, claimed that "the Pulwama attack is the biggest in Jammu and Kashmir's history".Holding Pakistan responsible – without evidence or investigation –PM Modi, in a story published on the Indian news website Times Now News, maintained that "perpetrators will pay for it". He further mourned the loss of 44 security personnel and added that "Indian security forces had been given full freedom".A monthly online magazine called The Kashmir Walla ran a story with a headline likely to inflame tensions between the two countries. The publication quoted the attacker: "Your oppression fuels our Jihad". The article narrated that the JeM group also reportedly released a video of the suicide bomber Adil Ahmad Dar.The international media largely described the incident as the 'deadliest' attack in Kashmir in three decades.The New York Times, quoted a southern Kashmir resident saying that he had never heard such a blast in his entire life. The publication emphasised that the JeM is listed as a terrorist outfit by the United States Treasury Department.The Guardian, in their coverage of the Pulwama attack, quoted an associate fellow at the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation, claiming that "Pakistanis are wanting to up the ante again ahead of the elections".The British publication also remarked that militant groups had been fighting Indian security forces in Kashmir for 30 years.US-based Washington Post called it the worst attack on security personnel "since the start of the insurgency in the region three decades ago".The article also highlighted that India accuses Pakistan of "harbouring militants that cross into the Indian-held territory to carry out attacks against Indian rule". Making its inclination eminent towards India, the Post stated that "militants had waged attacks against Indian security forces in Kashmir, fighting either for its territory's independence or its merger with Pakistan".Foreign media reports largely supported India's stance with The Times and CNN being an exception. The two included comments from the Pakistani Foreign Office (FO) condemning violent acts in the region and rejecting allegations made against Pakistan.The Post, on the other hand, posted a statement tweeted by US ambassador to India Kenneth Juster, stating that "the US stands alongside India in confronting terror and defeating it". The publication did not report remarks by the FO or Pakistani leadership in regards to the attack.Islamabad has repeatedly urged New Delhi to respect the 2003 ceasefire arrangement, investigate the incidents of ceasefire violations, instruct Indian forces to respect the agreement in letter and spirit and maintain peace along the Line of Control (LoC). However, the violation of the truce has been continuing.Earlier in 2018, the United Nations (UN) High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report revealing “impunity for human rights violations and lack of access to justice” to be among human rights challenges in the occupied valley.
