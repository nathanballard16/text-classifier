Congress terms raids as ‘political vengeance’

INDORE/BHOPAL: Hitting back at BJP over the I-T raids on MP CM Kamal Nath ’s two aides, Congress’s Shobha Oza said, “It’s political vengeance, a futile attempt by BJP to tarnish the image of Congress on poll eve. It won’t succeed. It’s a sign that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is rattled by the Congress victories in three assembly elections.” The raids started around 3 am when tax officers, escorted by CRPF jawans, arrived at addresses in hired cars. BJP’s Kailash Vijayvargiya took a dig at Congress and said, “It is clear that only thieves have complaints with chowkidars.”Kakkar’s houses in Indore and Bhopal were searched.So were the homes of Miglani’s children in Delhi. Many locations in Chhindwara are also being searched. Local I-T officials said the raids were handled by Delhi teams and they had little involvement in it.
