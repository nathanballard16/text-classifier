MAU: Walidpur, a nagar panchayat town in eastern UP's Mau district , witnessed a rare show of communal harmony on Tuesday as bereaved families of the 13 killed in Monday's cooking gas explosion came together to bid their loved ones a final farewell." Janaza (funeral procession for Muslims) and arthi (funeral procession for Hindus) were taken out from one place. People of both communities consoled each other," said Ezar Ahmad, the cousin of Imteyaz (22) who lost his life trying to rescue those in the house of late Chhotu Vishwakarma. The impact of the LPG cylinder blast was so strong that it brought Vishwakarma's three-storey building crashing, leaving many trapped under the debris.Besides Imteyaz, two more Muslim boys lost their lives in the fire and building collapses. They have been identified as Yasir Gani (10) and Md Jeeshan (16). The district of Mau had witnessed gory communal riots in October 2005, but residents of Walidpur town insist they have lived in harmony and will continue doing so. Muslim neighbours were also seen consoling Kanhaiyalal Vishwakarma whose two daughters - Sarita (22) and Simpi (18) - were killed and two others, Reena and Sonam, besides his wife Mansa Devi are in hospital with grievous injuries.Rita Devi, the widow of Chhotu Vishwakarma, said her three daughters - Mona, Mamta and Sanjana - sustained injuries and were in hospital.
