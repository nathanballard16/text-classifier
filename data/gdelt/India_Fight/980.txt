NDA’s quota move will need to overcome twin barriers of Mandal judgment

NEW DELHI: Will the NDA government’s 10% quota for economically backward classes overcome twin barriers — no reservation based on a person’s financial status and capping quota at 50% — erected by the Supreme Court in its 1992 Indra Sawhney judgment facilitating the 27% reservation for OBCs?The NDA government hopes to overcome both barriers. First, by introducing “economic backwardness” as a new criteria in Article 16(4) of the Constitution, which so far had recognised only social and educational backwardness as twin criteria for reservation. And second, the SC had itself clarified that 50% cap applied only to quota for such classes and there could be other grounds for reservation.In the Indra Sawhney judgment, the SC had considered the September 25, 1991 office memorandum issued by the P V Narasimha Rao government for implementation of Mandal Commission report for 27% reservation to OBCs and had introduced 10% reservation for economically backward classes. The SC had struck down the 10% quota saying “though the criteria is not yet evolved by the government, it is obvious that the basis is either the income of a person and/or the extent of property held by him. The impugned memorandum does not say whether this classification is made under Clause (4) or Clause (1) of Article 16.”The change, if it goes through Parliament, will take the quantum of quotas to 59.5% which many argued will mark a violation of the 50% cap mandated by the Supreme Court in the Indira Sawhney case and, thus, legally untenable.But the government asserted that the ceiling is applicable only to the jobs reserved for the “backward” classes (read SCs/STs and OBCs), and will not be a deterrent for its move to reach quotas to “economically weaker” among “non-reserved” categories: a chunk that includes dominant castes like Marathas, Jats, Patels, Kapus, Brahmins, Thakurs, Bhumihars and Banias who have been restive because of scarce opportunities and blame their plight on “caste quotas”.As it happens, BJP, which traditionally enjoyed good support among upper castes like Brahmins, Banias, Rajputs/Thakurs, has also made successful inroads among other potential beneficiaries; for instance, Jats, Patels and Marathas. For its plan to secure a second term for Narendra Modi as PM, it needs to keep the influential categories in its quarter. “This is a long-pending demand for 70 years. What we are doing is empowering the poor belonging to the so-called upper castes. A historical wrong is being corrected at nobody’e expense,” said a senior minister.Quotas for them will also salve their anger, incited and stoked by Congress and others in opposition, against BJP for nullifying the Supreme Court order which sought to introduce safeguards against summary arrests for alleged atrocities against Dalits. In a season when issues of farm distress have come to the fore and when there is no forward movement on construction of Ram Mandir, consolidating the core constituency becomes a political imperative.The “late swing” by the government caught the opposition off-guard. Congress and others saw the move as “opportunism” and trashed it as jumla, but were reluctant not to oppose it outright: the restraint being dictated by not just their support for the demand for “upper caste quota” in the past, but also because of the sheer numbers at stake.The proposed criteria for adjudging who is “economically weak” and, therefore, eligible for the proposed quota: family income not exceeding Rs 8 lakh per annum, landholding of less than five acres, residential plot not measuring more than 100 square yards in a notified municipality and less than 200 square yards in non-notified areas, etc; a threshold identical to the one applied for defining “creamy layer” among the OBCs who are debarred from quota benefits.The yardstick, which was criticised as “excessively liberal” when enforced for defining who constituted the “creamy layer” among the OBCs, will mean that almost the entire population, save the super rich numbering around just above a crore or so, cutting across communities, becomes eligible for quotas.For the government, the democratisation of “quota” can be a risky enterprise, too, especially with the likelihood of OBC outfits crying foul against the “subversion” of the reservation scheme. But BJP reckons that Modi’s own credentials as the first “backward” to have become PM on his own steam, the fragmentation of OBC unity and the need for OBC satraps to woo upper castes will buffer them against any serious fallout.
