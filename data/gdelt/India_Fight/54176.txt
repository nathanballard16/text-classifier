Chitrakoot (UP), December 6

In a shocking incident, a case of a woman being shot in the face after she stopped dancing at a wedding has come to light.

The bizarre incident, which took place in Chitrakoot in Uttar Pradesh, has been caught on a video where the young woman, who was part of a dancing group, is seen on the stage with a co-performer.

Two people were arrested on Friday for allegedly shooting the 22-year-old dancer in her face at a marriage function at Tikra village in Mau area here, police said.

In the one-minute-long clip, a man in an inebriated condition is heard saying, "Goli chal jayegi (shots will be fired)," as soon as the woman stops dancing.

"Sudhir bhaiya, aap goli chala hi do (Brother, you should fire the gun)," another man is heard saying and the woman is suddenly shot from behind, which takes everybody by surprise.

The bullet hits her face.

The dancer—Hina—sustained a bullet injury in her jaw and two others sustained pellet injuries during firing at the function held to celebrate the wedding of the daughter of village head Suhir Singh Patel on November 30, Superintendent of Police Ankit Mittal said.

According to reports, the video was shot on December 1 during a performance at the wedding of village head Sudhir Singh Patel's daughter.

The groom's maternal uncles, Mithilesh and Akhilesh, who were on the stage, were also injured in the firing, according to the police.

"We are trying to arrest the accused. We are making all the efforts to bring the culprit to justice," senior police officer Ankit Mittal said.

Hina was rushed to a hospital where her condition was stated to be out of danger, he said.

Those who fired the shots were identified as Sudhir Singh and Phool Singh and were arrested on Friday, he added. — With PTI/ IANS
