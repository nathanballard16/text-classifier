Congress firefights after its neta scorns Amit Shah

Congress sought to distance itself from their leader B K Hariprasad's remarks in which he mocked at BJP chief Amit Shah for having contracted swine flu since his party BJP made an attempt to break MLAs from Congress in Karnataka.

Speaking at a Congress protest rally in Bengaluru against alleged attempts by the BJP to dislodge the Congress-JD(S) government in Karnataka by luring the ruling coalition MLAs, Hariprasad in Kannada said, "As a few legislators have already come back, Amit Shah is shaken and has got a fever. It is not a normal fever. It is swine flu."

Later on explaining he said, "Hindi mein usey Suar ka Jukham kehte hain."

He added they (BJP) should know that if they try to destabilise the Karnataka government further, not just swine flu, Shah will get vomiting and dysentery also."

"The kind of ugly and indecent comments Congress MP B K Hariprasad have made about BJP president Amit Shah's health show the standards of the Congress. Flu is curable but it is difficult to cure Congress leaders mental illness," union minister Piyush Goyal said.

BJP national spokesperson GVL Narasimha Rao claimed the Congress leadership's silence affirms that such toxic comments are sanctioned directly by its top leadership.
