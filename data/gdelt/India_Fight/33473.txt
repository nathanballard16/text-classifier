New Delhi: Karnataka Speaker KR Ramesh Kumar, on Tuesday, said that he will stick to the rulebook while considering the resignations of 13 Congress and JD(S) MLAs. Talking to reporters, Kumar said that eight of the 13 resignations 'were not in order' and added that five MLAs have been called for discussions. Kumar said that he has given reporters five days to meet him.

Kumar further said that none of the MLAs had met him, but added that he had received a petition from Siddaramaiah, Congress Legislative Party (CLP) Leader, seeking disqualification of the MLAs.

"I have written to the governor that none of the rebel MLAs has met me. He has expressed confidence that I'll uphold constitutional norms. Out of 13 resignations, 8 are not according to law. I've given them time to present themselves before me," Kumar was quoted as saying by ANI.

"I've certain rules, 'll go by that. Then, the decision will be taken. I've to be responsible. Certain things in law are implied. Office of Speaker should behave responsibly. No time-frame is mentioned there... The clause says if the Speaker is convinced that the resignations are voluntary & genuine he can accept otherwise...I don't know, I am not a well-read man. I have to see," Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

With resignations of 14 MLAs — latest being Roshan Baig — all eyes are on Kumar, whose verdict will decide the fate of the 225-seater Vidhana Soudha. In case he rejects the resignations, the MLAs have the option of challenging the decision in the court. If, on the other hand, he accepts the resignations, the strength of the Assembly will come down and give the BJP an upper hand in claiming stake to form a government in the state.

The Congress party has already warned the MLAs that they could face disqualification for 'anti-party' activities.
