Pak compelled to act against terrorists due to Modi's political will: Shah - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

TELANGANA: Pakistan has been compelled to act against terrorists as it now realises that Indian security forces have been given a free hand by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to retaliate, BJP president Amit Shah said on Wednesday.

Though, Indian soldiers were beheaded during the previous UPA government’s regime, there was no response to such dastardly acts, he told a meeting of BJP functionaries from five Lok Sabha constituencies under the Nizamabad cluster.

Shah said following the Uri terror attack, the Modi government replied with surgical strikes. Similarly, after the Pulwama incident, in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out air strikes on terror camps in Pakistan, he said.

“Our IAF carried out air strikes on three terror camps and destroyed them”, the BJP chief said.

“Today, for the first time Pakistan feels that terrorism will not work…They are now compelled to arrest and curb that (terrorism)…The reason for that is our leader Narendra Modi has demonstrated political will,” he said.

He said Pakistan knows India will respond to their every action.

Shah’s comments came a day after Pakistan announced it had taken into “preventive detention” 44 members of banned militant outfits, including Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar’s son and brother. (AGENCIES)
