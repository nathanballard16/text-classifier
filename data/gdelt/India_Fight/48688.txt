Among metros, 35% of crimes against children in Delhi: Data

The previous years, however, saw more crimes against children — 8,035 in 2015 and 7,392 in 2016.

Of the 19 metro cities in the country, Delhi reported the highest crime rate against girl child victims in 2017. Sexual offences in this category are dealt with under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The capital recorded 19.2 such cases per lakh population – ahead of Pune (17.4) and Nagpur (17.1), the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) data of 2017, released Monday night, shows.

As per the data, Delhi recorded 6,844 crimes against children in 2017. The 19 metros, which included Bengaluru, Mumbai and Kochi, recorded a total of 19,544 cases — which means 35% of crimes against children were recorded in Delhi alone. The previous years, however, saw more crimes against children — 8,035 in 2015 and 7,392 in 2016.

Murder cases, too, showed a dip from 2015, when 464 cases were lodged, to 2017, which saw 400 cases. In 2017, Delhi reported 2.5 murder cases per one lakh population — better than Patna (8.9) and Bengaluru (2.8) but worse than Mumbai (0.7) and Kolkata (0.5).

One in four murder cases in 2017 were over disputes ranging from property to money to family, while 29 were over illicit relationships and 14 over love affairs. The bulk of victims were men in the age group of 18-30.

“Delhi Police files each FIR that comes its way; that reflects in the numbers. It’s a sign of a robust police force. Overall, numbers indicate high registration of cases due to systems such as e-FIRs. It’s a revolutionary idea,” said DCP (PRO) Mandeep Singh Randhawa.

In crimes against women in 2017, Delhi reported 152.4 cases per one lakh population, second to Lucknow, which reported 178.5 cases per one lakh population. But this was less than in 2016 (13,803 cases) and 2015 (14,766 cases).
