Mahesh Babu and Namrata Shirodkar's love story is one of our favourites. The much in love couple met each other for the first time in 2000 at the mahurat of their film Vamsi and since then, the couple has set major goals with their strong bonding. They are proud parents to two kids, Sitara and Gautham.

In an interview with Pinkvilla, Mahesh Babu spoke about how Namrata is a strong support to him when it is about the work. He said, "Namrata is a very supportive and encouraging person as well as extremely critical of all my work ...having said that she’s my balancing factor at times when I’m in doubt .. however it is, it works out (He smiles)."
