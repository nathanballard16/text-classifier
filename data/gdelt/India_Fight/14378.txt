Man kills parents for property

Jeypore: Jeypore town police have succeeded in cracking the double murder case of Jaynagar within six hours. Police arrested the accused Latif Rehman who murdered his parents over a property issue.

Saturday morning, the bodies of retired police officer MK Rehman, 88, and his wife Hafiza Bibi were recovered from their house. Investigating the case, police found the murderer was the son of Rehman.

Sources said, Rehman had decided to distribute his property between his daughter and son. But Latif was not happy with the decision. So, he thought if he killed his parents he would be the only owner of all property.

To execute his evil thought he hatched a plan. First, Latif attacked his parents with an iron rod on Friday night. Using a drill, he then cut the bodies into pieces. To cover up the heinous crime and present the murders as part of a robbery, he stole gold necklace and bangles of his mother and Rs 15,000 cash. Latif also injured himself.

After six hours of investigation and interrogation of Latif, he confessed to the crime. Police seized gold jewellery, a drilling machine, torch and a mobile phone from Latif’s rented house. Police have decided to prepare the charge sheet within ten days.

Under the supervision of Jeypore SDPO Sagarika Nath and Borigumma SDPO Hare Krushna Majhi, two teams were formed to investigate the crime. At first, police found Latif unconscious in a room and Rehman and his wife dead in another room.

Town police IIC Baleswar Gidhi and SI Shiva Shankar Sahoo had investigated the murders.
