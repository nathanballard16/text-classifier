Balakot secrets revealed: Pakistan burnt terroristsâ€™ bodies after IAF air strike

New Delhi:

Even as Pakistan continues to deny the February 26 air strike in its Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, sensational proofs unmask Islamabad’s doublespeak. Latest media reports by two news channels have revealed how Islamabad tried to get rid of the terrorists’ bodies after the Indian Air Force air strike on the terror camp run by Jaish-e-Mohammed. According to Republic TV, an eyewitness have come forward and talked extensively about the way authorities across the border tried to doctor the site. Bodies of some terrorists were thrown in river while others were set on fire.

Meanwhile, Times Now, another news channel ha also aired some incriminating details about the Balakot air strike. According to the news channel, 263 terrorists had gathered at the terror camp. These terrorists were categorised according to a strict hierarchy, the channel reported. 18 senior Jaish commanders were present at Balakot facility to train the terror recruits. While 83 terrorists had assembled for Daura-e-Aam — the beginners’ training course, 91 terrorists had assembled for Daura-e-Khas — advanced training, the channel reported.

As many as 25 terrorists were selected for special fidayeen training. A total of four missiles, which have now been identified as SPICE bombs were dropped at the Balakot JeM camp by Indian Air Force Mirage-2000 fighter jets. Among those killed were IED expert, video expert of the Jaish-e-Mohammed. Those injured were send to a local hospital in adjoining Waziristan.

In a three-minute long video proof, the Republic channel quoted an eyewitness saying that the local residents of Balakot was forced to give away their cellphones. The internet services have been suspended in the area since the February 26 pre-dawn air strike.

While post-strike images of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist training camp in Pakistan's Balakot showcase prominent bomb impact points in the area, the Pakistani security officials have reportedly barred the media from entering the site yet again on Friday, denying any damage to the place. A group of Reuters journalists on Friday reached Balakot to visit the Islamic seminary and the adjacent buildings but could not climb the hillock as the path to the buildings was blocked. The camp has been sealed off for journalists and visitors for an indefinite period of time, according to sources.

On February 26, the Indian Air Force (IAF)'s Mirage 2000 fighters armed with SPICE 2000 satellite-guided bombs had struck the Jaish-e-Mohammed's Balakot training camp in response to the gruesome terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14. Being touted as the Surgical Strike 2.0, the airstrike killed "a very large number of Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorists, trainers, senior commanders, and groups of jihadis" at the alleged terror camp in Balakot, India’s foreign secretary Vijay Gokhale said.

This was the third time in the last nine days that the media professionals were prevented from entering the site, citing security, weather and organisational reasons. The press wing of the Pakistani military said that no media visits will be possible for a few more days.
