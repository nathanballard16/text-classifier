BSF kills 1 near border in Dinajpur

A Bangladeshi died early yesterday after Indian border guards opened fire on him at Dharmajoin border of Dinajpur.

The victim has been identified as Md Alam, 40, a cattle trader. He was a resident of Kamdebpur village under Biral upazila of the northern district.

According to Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB), its Indian counterpart Border Security Force (BSF) shot Alam while he was returning from India around 2.30am.

“Alam intruded India late at night to bring back his cattle. Members of BSF Katalia camp under 40 BSF Battalion shot him while he was on his way back home through 20/10s pillar,” said Nayed Mehdi Hasan, commander at Dharmajoin outpost under Dinajpur 42 BGB Battalion.

“The killing took place about 50 metres inside the Indian territory,” said the official, adding, “Alam died on the spot. Villagers rescued the body and carried it to his home.”

Lt Col Nahiduzzaman, commanding officer, Dinajpur 42 BGB Battalion, said a flag meeting was held in the afternoon where BGB strongly protested the killing and urged BSF to show highest tolerance to maintain calm at the border.
