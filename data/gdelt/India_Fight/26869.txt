Bhawana Kanth is IAF’s first combat-ready woman fighter pilot

New Delhi: Scripting history, Flight Lieutenant Bhawana Kanth on Wednesday became the first woman pilot of the Indian Air Force to qualify to undertake combat missions on a fighter jet.

IAF officials said Kanth has completed operational syllabus for carrying out combat missions on MiG-21 Bison aircraft during day time.

“She is the first woman fighter pilot to be qualified to undertake missions by day on a fighter aircraft,” IAF Spokesperson Group Capt Anupam Banerjee said.
