J&K Bank scam: Anti-Corruption Bureau sends notice to Mehbooba Mufti

NEW DELHI: The Anti-Corruption Bureau on Sunday sent a notice to PDP chief and former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir Mehbooba Mufti asking her to clarify her role regarding appointments in J&K Bank.The letter that was tweeted by Mufti said, "During the course of investigation of case FIR No 10/2019, police station ACKB dated 08-06-2019, it has surfaced that some appointments were made by Chairman of J&K Bank on references and recommendations of a few ministers."It may please be clarified whether such references had your endorsement, verbal or otherwise for appointments in J&K Bank," it added.The PDP chief said she was "not surprised" to receive the letter from the ACB , adding that concerted efforts were being made to browbeat mainstream leaders and thwart potential efforts for a collective response."I am too small an entity vis a vis the cause that unites us today. Such tactics won’t work," she added.In June this year, the J&K governor's administration had sacked J&K Bank chairman Parvez Ahmad Negroo over wide-spread irregularities under his nose, following which the ACB sleuths conducted raids on the corporate office of the bank on TRC Road, Srinagar.Jammu and Kashmir has been on the edge following deployment of additional security forces in the state last week. The administration, which is under President's rule, also ordered curtailment of the Amarnath Yatra and asked pilgrims and tourists to leave Kashmir Valley, citing terror threat.
