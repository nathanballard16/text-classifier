Meanwhile, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) condemned the attack.

In a statement, the MARD said, "We, the medical fraternity, are under tremendous mental stress due to the increasing assault and violence against us."

"We urge the deaf government to hear our plea and make a strict Central Protection Act for doctors. We demand that the state government makes necessary changes in the existing Doctors Protection Act and make solid norms against mob lynching," it added.

"At the college administration level, security audits, pass system and emergency alarm system should be made effective promptly and urgently," it said.
