Srinagar witnesses 23 street protests within 24 hours

Law and order worsens instantly after Imran’s speech at U.N.

The police have recorded at least 15 late night protests and eight daytime incidents of stone pelting in the past 24 hours in Srinagar, indicating a sudden worsening of the law and order in the wake of Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s speech at the United Nations on Friday.

Scores of youth took to the streets in at least 15 locations across Srinagar on Friday, immediately after Mr. Khan concluded his speech. They clashed with security forces and raised slogans. The forces used tear-smoke shells to break up the protests in Batapora, Lal Bazar, Soura, Chanapora, Bagh-e-Mehtab and parts of the old city.

Several youth managed to enter mosques and use its public address system to raise anti-India slogans and play religious songs, a police officer, posted in the old city, told The Hindu.

In the sudden rise, the police recorded eight incidents of stone pelting in Srinagar during the daytime on Saturday both in the old city and the uptown area. “There were nine major blockades erected by protesters,” the police officer said.

When contacted, IGP S.P. Pani said he was busy and would not comment immediately.

It’s for the first time since August 20, when around 40 incidents of protests were reported, that the Valley saw a sudden spurt in street protests. The police also recorded two incidents where youth burst crackers.

The Valley is in the grip of an uneasy calm since the Centre had revoked J&K’s special status. However, this month saw a significant dip in the number of incidents of stone pelting as security forces ensured no civilian casualty takes place during the clashes.
