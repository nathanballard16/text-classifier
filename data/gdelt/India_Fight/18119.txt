Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray on Monday said that he was not a chowkidar as he was born a Shiv Sainik. He also said that he does not work for a Congress- mukt Bharat agenda.

In an interview with senior party leader Sanjay Raut, Uddhav Thackeray said, I am not chowkidar. I was born a Shiv Sainik, so I am sainik."

Reiterating that PM Modi should be given another five years, he said, "I don't work for Congress mukt Bharat but PM Modi should be given another five years. He added that he will visit Ayodhya again if the building of Shri Ram Temple does not gain momentum.

The interview raised eyebrows as Uddhav Thackeray was present in Gujarat a day after the interview to show support to the NDA.

Interestingly, the interview was taken by senior Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut. Uddhav Thackeray has till now not taken any direct questions from the media.

Thackeray was present in Gujarat when BJP national president Amit Shah was filing his nomination from Gandhinagar seat.

Earlier, Shiv Sena had declared contesting the Lok Sabha elections alone. However, the two parties joined hands just before the election announcement. Even in the alliance press conference, Uddhav Thackeray was the only one who did not answer any media questions.

However, even after the alliance, Shiv Sena continues to attack BJP and its policies.
