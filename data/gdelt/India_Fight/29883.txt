Several BJP workers, including senior leaders Mukul Roy and state BJP general secretary Raju Banerjee were injured as BJP's protest rally turned violent in Kolkata. Police resorted to lathi charge, water cannons and tear gas to disperse the crowd. BJP workers also pelted stones and bottles at police personnel. Injured BJP leader Raju Banerjee was admitted to a nearby hospital while Mukul Roy was taken to the party office and his condition is stated to be stable. BJP national general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya said "West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has lost her mental balance due to the unprecedented growth of the BJP. She has resorted to politics of violence in order to save her chair. If such a situation continues then the central government should take a call on what should be done or not." BJP leader Dilip Ghosh criticised police administration alleging provoking water cannon and tear gash shell firing. "We were conducting a peaceful protest march, then why did the police get into unprovoked water cannon and tear gas shell firing? The TMC government is determined to create an atmosphere of violence and intimidation." The rally was held to protest against the post-poll violence in West Bengal. However, TMC accused BJP for disturbing law & order in the state. (BCCL)
