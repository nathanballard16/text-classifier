Editor's Guild Condemns Attack on Journalists in West Bengal Elections

New Delhi: The Editors Guild has condemned several incidents of physical attack on journalists in West Bengal during the fifth phase of polling and urged the Election Commission to take action against those who participated in such acts.

“Physical attacks against journalists are always reprehensible, but particularly so during elections as they undermine fair media scrutiny of an election,” the guild said in a statement.

Journalists from media organisations like NewsX, ABP Ananda and Zee News were attacked, allegedly by workers of the Trinamool Congress (TMC), the statement said.

The guild urged the EC to initiate “necessary action” against those involved in violence against journalist. It asked the TMC-led West Bengal government to “ensure law and order in the state so that journalists are not attacked by political parties and they can perform their professional duties safely”.
