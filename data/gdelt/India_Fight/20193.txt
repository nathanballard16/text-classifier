Kriti Sanon opens up on her role in Panipat, says she was thrilled to shoot with swords & perform action scene

The ever gorgeous and charming Kriti Sanon has always impressed her fans with her girl next door roles on big screens. Throughout her films in her career, for instance, in Heropanti, Raabta, Luka Chuppi, Bareily ki Barfi and others, she has played the role of a sweet and innocent girl in town and has somehow gotten used to playing bubbly characters on screen. However, Kriti has stepped on to a ‘hatke’ role in her upcoming period drama film titled as Panipat in which she has starred along with Arjun Kapoor.

Talking about her role in the film, she tells Bollywood Life, “For me, it is very interesting to play a Marathi character that too belonging to a different era. And for the first time, I am playing someone who exists in reality. I don't know Marathi at all. It is a Hindi film but it has Marathi words here and there-- which are colloquial, commonly used. I did learn the language from a tutor named, Ketki. I would like to sit with her during my every scene and learn how to pronounce different words and add more on my own.”



Talking about her action scenes in the film, Kriti gets excited as she tells about her experience of shooting with swords for the first time. She added, “I did a small portion of a sword fight, which was very interesting and a first for me. I have never done sword fighting. I was very excited and thrilled on that day because I was getting to do action. I was not at all scared but jumping with joy.I obviously did rehearse for it because I had to get it right, the postures - and not genuinely killing anyone on the set. And fighting in a nauvari saree was a task. I could never imagine myself doing that but it was a lot of fun. When you get to know about your injuries after the shoot is done and only when you hit the bed, you know it's done well.”
