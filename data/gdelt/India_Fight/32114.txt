Gujarat has again begun witnessing weather activity in terms of light to moderate rains. Surat and Valsad, in particular, have witnessed rains which are going to increase in intensity. The south coastal region of Gujarat including Amreli, Porbandar, Surat, Valsad will get to see light to moderate rains with one or two heavy spells for the next two days.

Meanwhile, rain and thundershower activities will commence over Baroda, Gandhinagar, Ahmedabad, and Rajkot, while isolated rains would be a sight in the northern districts during the next 24 to 48 hours.

These rains would be a result of the Cyclonic Circulation over the Arabian Sea and a Trough extending from South Gujarat up to the Karnataka coast.

According to our meteorologists, due to the persisting systems, the spread of rains will extend up to the Kutch region as well and scanty rains with one or two moderate spells would be witnessed here. By June 29, Monsoon may advance into some more parts of Gujarat. The increased rainfall activities would also boost the morale of Gujarat farmers.

In the wake of these activities, the temperatures will subside and the Mercury would settle below the 40-degree mark. The rainfall activity will make the weather conditions comfortable for the residents, however, humidity levels would remain high.
