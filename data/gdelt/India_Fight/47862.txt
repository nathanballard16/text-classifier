Surat: Teen girl, her lover who eloped found

SURAT: A young boy and girl from different communities, who had eloped from Jamalpore village near Navsari on October 14, were traced in Jambusar town of Bharuch district on Thursday.Their elopement had sparked tension in the village as the girl is a tribal and the boy a Muslim. They were brought back to the village by Navsari police which said that she had allegedly pressurized him to elope with her.Navsari police said the girl belonging to Dholiya Patel tribal community was in touch with the boy for the past three years. She knew him since the time she was a student of class X. When she turned 18 a few days ago, she put pressure on the boy to run away from the village with her, police claimed. She allegedly threatened to kill herself if he didn’t agree, they claimed.Local crime branch officials said the couple, after fleeing from Navsari, went to Ahmedabad and Somnath. Then they came to Jambusar at the boy’s friend’s house from where they were nabbed.“They had run out of money and hence came to Jambusar. The girl says she had gone with the boy of her own volition. The boy’s father had helped us to locate the two,” VS Palash, police inspector of LCB, said.The news about the tribal girl eloping with a boy belonging to minority community created anger among locals, who came out in protest. Led by some Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VH) activists, they blocked roads at various places on Wednesday. They lifted the blockade only after the police assured them that the girl would be brought back to her parents within 24 hours.
