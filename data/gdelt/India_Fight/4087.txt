‘Modi govt. using ED, CBI to target non-BJP parties’

A day after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) conducted raids in connection with the alleged irregularities in Mayawati memorials scam, Chief Minister and Telugu Desam Partry national president N. Chandrababu Naidu alleged that the Modi government was using the Central agencies to target leaders of non-BJP parties. After the Samajwadi Party leader Akhilesh Yadav, the Centre turned up the heat on Bahujan Samajwadi Party (BSP) president Mayawati with the ED raids, he said.

During a teleconference with the party leaders on Friday, Mr. Naidu recalled that the move came a week after CBI raided officers and ministers of former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's Cabinet in the alleged sand mining scam. Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about the broad outlook. It was ridiculous that the narrow-minded people were talking on the broad outlook. “Is ED and IT raids on Opposition parties is called as broad outlook?” he asked.

The Chief Minister said the TDP would go for an all-out fight against the BJP in people’s court after February 14. Till then, the Telugu Desam would conduct “dharma poratam” in Delhi from February 11 to 14. Protests would be organised in Delhi with the support of other national parties, he said.

Referring to the issue of Telugu students who were facing problem in U.S., he said the government would stand by them. Legal action would be taken. The parents need not panic. The government already wrote letters to officials concerned. All steps would be taken through A.P. Bhavan, Mr. Naidu added.
