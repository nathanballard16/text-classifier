Maoists shot dead five policemen and took away their firearms in an ambush in the eastern state of Jharkhand in India on Friday, officials said.







According to Sub-Divisional Police Officer Avinash Kumar, the five policemen -- two Assistant Sub-Inspectors and three Constables -- came under attack when they were patrolling the Tiruldih police station area of the Seraikhla-Kharsawan district along the Jharkhand-West Bengal border, reports our New Delhi correspondent.







District Superintendent of Police Chandan Kumar said 10 to 12 Maoists came on motor-cycles, surrounded the policemen and shot them dead near Kukoru Bazaar locality. They also looted five arms of the slain policemen, he said.
