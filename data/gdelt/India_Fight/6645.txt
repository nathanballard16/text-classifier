Jaipur: The Rajasthan government Saturday revised the ex-gratia to the family members of CRPF jawans from the state who were among the 40 killed in the Pulwama terror attack to Rs 50 lakh from Rs 25 lakh. The government has also announced jobs to family members of the slain jawans.

Five CRPF personnel soldiers from Rajasthan were killed in Thursday’s attack. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot revised the ex-gratia and relief package for the family members of the five slain soldiers.

“The brave soldiers have made the supreme sacrifice while securing the country and the state government is with the family of martyrs in this hour,” Gehlot said in his message.

“The government will provide either Rs 50 lakh cash or Rs 25 lakh cash and 25 bigha land on the Indira Gandhi Canal Project or Rs 25 lakh with a housing board residence. The state government will continue to provide a government job to a dependent of the martyr, scholarship for children and Rs 3 ,00,000 to parents, besides other facilities,” Ghelot added.

Gehlot prayed for peace to the departed souls and courage to the family members. He also wished speedy recovery to those who were injured in the deadly terror attack.
