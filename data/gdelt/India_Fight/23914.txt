'Naamdar ke liye malai ka poora intezam tha': PM Modi slams Rahul Gandhi's alleged link in UPA-era defence deal

The BJP Saturday attacked Congress president Rahul Gandhi over his alleged link to a defence firm that got offset contract when the UPA was in power and asked the opposition party to respond to what it said is a very serious charge.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley cited a media report and gave more information that he said he had found out to take a swipe at Gandhi, saying it is story of a man who aspired to be a defence deal pusher and is now aspiring to be prime minister.

In an election rally in Pratapgarh, PM Modi said, "Today I read that during UPA's tenure, one of naamdar's (dynast) business partners got defence offset contracts. Apni sarkar, dost bhi apna, aur raksha sauda bhi bada - yaani naamdar ke liye malai ka poora intezam tha." PM Modi essentially said that with their own government in place, and own friend being given huge defence deal, all arrangements were made for 'Rahul Gandhi to get the cream. Rahul Gandhi though have denied all accusations.

Gandhi, however, has refuted the charge made in a news article and said that he was ready to face any probe by the government.Speaking at a press conference earlier in the day, Gandhi said: "Please undertake any investigation you want, do any inquiry you want, I am ready as I know I have not done anything wrong, but please also investigate Rafale."
