Mata Amritanandamayi to Donate Rs 5 lakh Each to Families of CRPF Troopers Martyred in Pulwama Terror Attack

New Delhi: The Mata Amritanandamayi Math will be donating Rs 5 lakh each to the families of more than 40 CRPF troopers who were martyred in the dastardly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district last week.

Deeply saddened at the nation losing so many of its brave hearts, Sri Mata Amritanandamayi Devi (Amma) said, “It is our dharma to support the families of these brave men who died while doing their dharma of protecting the nation. My heart goes out to their families and loved ones. May we all pray for their peace and wellbeing.”

The Mata Amritanandamayi Math announced the donation as Amma was travelling to Mysore, the first stop on the northern leg of her 2019 Bharata Yatra.
