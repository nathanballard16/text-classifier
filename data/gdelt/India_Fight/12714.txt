Anushka Sharma has time and again made heads turn with her charms and candid photos. The actress is blessed with a beautiful smile and she is not afraid to flaunt it.

In the recent magazine shoot, the ever gorgeous actress was seen flaunting her two sides and her fans were hooked with her every single look.

While she was a breath of fresh air on the cover of the magazine, the lady is looking even more beautiful in all the photos she shared on her social media handle. Dressed in a floral skirt, with her hair flying with the wind, Anushka's look is fresh, trendy and super summery.

From beautiful floral strappy dresses to floral skirts and blouses, we are as much in love with both her photos as well as her outfits for the shoot. Take a look at the photos shared by the diva on her social media handle right here:

In the same issue of the magazine, the actress revealed how she used fake names while booking the venue for her wedding because she wanted to keep it a very secret affair. Talking about the same she said "We wanted to have a home-style wedding. There were only 42 people there, with all our friends and family present. I wanted it to be about Virat and me marrying each other, and not this big celebrity wedding. The energy at our wedding was blessed,” she told Vogue India. “I think Virat’s was Rahul.”
