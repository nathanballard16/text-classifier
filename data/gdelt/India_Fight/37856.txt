Article 370 scrapped: Kashmiri Pandits hail historic decision, say those forced to leave J&K will be able to go back

"Scrapping Article 370 is a historic decision by the Modi government. The minority community of Kashmiri Pandits will benefit from this move," president of the Kashmiri Samiti in Delhi, Sumeer Chrungoo said.

Displaced Kashmiri Pandits on Monday hailed the central government's "historic" decision of scrapping Article 370 of the Constitution and several took to the streets to celebrate the move on Monday.

"Scrapping Article 370 is a historic decision by the Modi government. The minority community of Kashmiri Pandits will benefit from this move," president of the Kashmiri Samiti in Delhi, Sumeer Chrungoo, told ANI.

He said that the people who were forced to leave Kashmir will finally be able to go back to the valley.

Earlier today, the Centre scrapped Article 370 of the Constitution that gave a special status to Jammu and Kashmir and barred people from the rest of the country from buying property there.

Shortly after Home Minister Amit Shah tabled a resolution to this effect in Rajya Sabha, President Ram Nath Kovind came out with a notification — The Constitution (Application to Jammu and Kashmir) Order, 2019 that will come into force immediately.

The Centre also converted Jammu and Kashmir into a Union Territory with a legislature, while hiving off Ladakh as a separate Union Territory without a legislature.
