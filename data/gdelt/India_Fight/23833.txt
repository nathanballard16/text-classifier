The Goa police on Friday arrested the fugitive main accused Sukhvinder Singh (28) in the alleged murder of his wife while on a holiday at a resort in Arpora village in North coastal Goa on April 27. Sukhvinder was remanded in 10-day police custody from Friday when he was produced before a court by police.

Chandigarh-based part-time travel agent Sukhvinder was nabbed from a hotel in Ludhiana, Punjab, following a manhunt which spanned over days and across several cities, Goa Superintendent of Police (SP) (Crime Branch) Pankaj Kumar Singh said on Friday.

"During the interrogation, it was revealed that, on the fateful day, the duo had a heated argument resulting in a fight after which he slit her throat with a knife," the police official said.
