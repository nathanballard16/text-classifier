Earlier this week, the Pakistani Army blasted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over his remarks about New Delhi’s willingness to use its “mother of nuclear bombs” to retaliate in case of a nuclear war between the two South Asian powers.

A nuclear exchange between Pakistan and India would quickly turn into a “nuclear Armageddon” affecting the whole world, Sardar Masood Khan, president of the Pakistani-administered jurisdiction of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, has warned.



“If there was a nuclear conflict between the two countries, 20 million people would die immediately,” Khan said, speaking at a conference organised by the Centre for Islam and Global Affairs in Istanbul, Turkey, with his remarks cited by the Anadolu Agency.

According to Khan, the long-running Pakistani-Indian conflict over Kashmir, which came into being immediately after the two countries gained independence from Britain in 1947, “should be resolved and peace should be established. We have no other options,” he stressed.

Among the three wars India and Pakistan have fought, between 1948 and 1971, two of them were over the Kashmir region, with low-intensity conflict raging inside the divided Kashmir region for decades, claiming thousands of lives and occasionally spilling out into broader tensions.
