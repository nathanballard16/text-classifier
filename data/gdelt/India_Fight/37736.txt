Brave and historic decision: Rupani on abolition of Art 370

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani on Monday welcomed the central government's move to abolish Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, saying it was a "historic and brave" decision.

Terming Kashmir as the "crown" of India, Rupani said the government's decision was a befitting tribute to Jan Sangh founder Syama Prasad Mookerjee.

The government on Monday abolished the Article that gave special status to Jammu and Kashmir, and moved a separate bill to bifurcate the state into two separate Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

Union Home Minister Amit Shah moved a resolution in the Rajya Sabha that Article 370, which allowed Jammu and Kashmir to have its own Constitution, will no longer be applicable.

Rupani said it was an important chapter in the "golden history of India".

"I congratulate PM Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah for taking this historic and brave decision to scrap Article 370 on Jammu and Kashmir," Rupani tweeted.

"Kashmir is the crown of India. Today is a historic day and it would be remembered as an important chapter in the golden history of India. I firmly believe that this decision is a befitting tribute to Syama Prasad Mookerjee," he said in another tweet.
