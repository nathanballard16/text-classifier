Kulwinder Singh, 41, is on trial in the NSW Supreme Court accused of murdering his wife by lighting her on fire or forcing her to light herself. He has pleaded not guilty and says he ran downstairs to find her already ablaze.

On Wednesday, Gurvinder Kaur told the court she believed her sister Parwinder was living in tang, a Punjabi word for restricted living conditions, in the years before her death.
