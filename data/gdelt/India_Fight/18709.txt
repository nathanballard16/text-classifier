Booze-Ban Induced Unemployment May Cost BJP Dearly in Elections - Analyst

A few kilometres away, in Supaul, similar undercurrent simmering was seen in people who furiously stated that they will vote against the Bihar government led by Nitish Kumar, who is the Bharatiya Janata Party's close ally.

"We are not literate. Socially powerful people have been selling liquor in connivance with police. Now, liquor is available everywhere with extra payment. Thousands of us have lost our livelihoods but a dream to convert Bihar [into an] alcohol free-state is far from the truth", one Ram Pravesh told Sputnik.

Incidentally, joblessness due to the ban on alcohol is not from any particular caste and a substantial number of people involved in providing ancillary services are impacted.

"The government should not be a preacher. Banning of alcohol in the state completely breaks the chain that was generating a huge amount of employment in the state", Mukhopadhyay added.

Initially, it seemed that women in society were very happy with the decision of total prohibition. The government claimed that its action had led women with drinking husbands to save money. But now women are saying that the cost of expenditure on liquor has increased as their male family members have been buying costlier liquor from the black market.
