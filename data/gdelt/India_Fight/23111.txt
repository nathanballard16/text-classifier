Insolvency case against Reliance Comms allowed to proceed

MUMBAI (Reuters) – An Indian appellate tribunal has lifted a stay on insolvency proceedings against business tycoon Anil Ambani’s debt-laden Reliance Communications, the Economic Times reported on Tuesday. Also, financial creditors like banks typically would get precedence over operational creditors, such as Ericsson, in debt payments, according to India’s insolvency laws. RCom, once India’s second-biggest phone carrier, will now move back into the insolvency process at the National Company Law Tribunal, India’s bankruptcy court, in the country’s financial capital of Mumbai. The NCLAT this month said Ericsson would have to refund that money back to RCom if insolvency proceedings against the telecoms company begin, the Economic Times earlier reported. RCom did not respond to requests for comment while the tribunal does not usually comment on its proceedings.
