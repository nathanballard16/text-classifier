Autopsy confirms suicide

Ludhiana: The autopsy report of Ravi Kumar, Issa Nagari, who was found dead under mysterious circumstances has indicated hanging as the possible cause of death. The post-mortem of Ravi, who was found dead under mysterious circumstances, was conducted on Saturday.

Initially Ravi’s live-in-partner Manjeet Kaur had told police that on Thursday night Ravi came home drunk and went to sleep. Later when she tried to wake him up for dinner, she found him dead. He was taken to the hospital where doctors confirmed that he was dead. Kaur had maintained that Ravi might have died due to excessive drinking. The mystery had shrouded the cause of death after Ravi’s brother had noticed some marks around Ravi’s neck. Assistant Commissioner of Police (Central) Waryam Singh said that when questioned persistently, Manjeet Kaur confirmed that Ravi had in fact committed suicide and she was scared to reveal it to the police about it. The Division number 3 police have initiated inquest proceedings in the case.
