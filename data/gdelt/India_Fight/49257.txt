[In Pictures] Since 2014, Here’s How PM Modi Has Celebrated Every Diwali With Soldiers Guarding India’s Borders

In 2014, his very first year as the Prime Minister (PM) of India, Narendra Modi visited Siachen - the world’s highest battleground - to celebrate Diwali with the soldiers guarding India’s borders in an extremely inhospitable terrain. At the time, no one could guess this would become an annual tradition.

Atop 18,875-foot glacier with soldiers, PM Modi hailed the services of the armed forces for the nation. He said that he had come unannounced, but one need not announce his arrival when coming to family.

“I have specially come on the occasion of Diwali to be with you. I am aware how it feels like to spend Diwali with your family. The happiness is different, but you are so involved in the devotion of your motherland that family is spending Diwali somewhere else and you are somewhere else guarding the motherland,” he said.
