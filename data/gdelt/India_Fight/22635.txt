"I miss every set up from 'Baahubali'. From shooting for the film, the sets, the war sequences. It is a journey of five years which is a really long time to have an emotional connect with. The whole mood of the periodic effect that Rajamouli created is one of the most cherished times that I could ever be a part of," Prabhas said in a statement.
