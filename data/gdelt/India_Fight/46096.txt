Savarkar’s Hindutva was part of the plot of Gandhi’s assassination by Godse: CG CM Baghel.

Present Gandhi Bhajana (worship) by PM Modi and BJP President and Home Minister Amit Shah may inspire Baghel…..

Hindutva, Savarkar, RSS all were part of Gandhi’s assassination plot, hinted Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel.

Upendra Bharti | HENB | Raipur | Oct 4, 2019:: In Chhattisgarh capital Raipur, CM Bhupesh Baghel on Thursday said Hindutva ideologue Vinayak Damodar Savarkar was part of the conspiracy to assassinate Mahatma Gandhi. … The Congress leader said there was enough evidence to show that Gandhi’s assassin Nathuram Godse was a disciple of Savarkar. Not mentioning RSS, the Chhattisgarh sparked over role of the Right org in Gandi murder charge. CM Bghel might be inspired by the present Gandhi Bhajana (worship) by PM Modi and BJP President and Home Minister Amit Shah. . Baghel said the Father of the Nation advocated non- violence, Savarkar stood for violence. . He asserted that Gandhi’s fight against provocative and anarchic nationalism needed to be carried forward in order to maintain communal harmony in the society. . The Congress CM was speaking on the concluding day of the two-day special Assembly session convened to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Gandhi. . “In 1909, on the invitation of Vinayak Damodar Savarkars associates, Gandhi ji went to London for an event. There, both had cited examples of epic Ramayana.

.

“Gandhi had cited the lines which give message of non- violence and sacrifice, while Savarkar had mentioned that only violence is the way to destroy unrighteousness, Baghel said.

.

“Gandhi talks about non-violence while Savarkar about violence. It is fact that Gandhi was not afraid of death while it is evident from history that Savarkar was not afraid of attacking while in hiding. Gandhi is veer (brave) for us (Congress), while Savarkar is for you (BJP), he said.

.

“There was enough evidence to prove that Godse was a disciple of Savarkar, who hatched conspiracy to kill Gandhi, he claimed…what was the reason that Godse killed Gandhi.

.

“When the incident (Gandhis assassination) took place, there was an announcement on the radio that a mentally unstable man killed him.

.

“He was not mentally unstable…rather he was representing an ideology… Godse was trained like a human bomb to kill Gandhi.

.

He was trained by an ideology. Today there is battle between ideologies,” he added.

.

Baghel said the cultural nationalism promoted by Gandhi has been effective in unifying the country, while nowadays a “provocative” form of nationalism is prevailing in the country which speaks about crushing its opposition.

.

“There were no differences in karuna (compassion) of Lord Buddha, Gandhi, B R Ambedkar and Pt Jawaharlal Nehru. There was a gambhir (serious) nationalism in their thoughts.

.

That nationalism had space for everyone in the country and had respect even for dissent. That nationalism was a thread which tied people together, he said.

.

Baghel denounced the current narrative on nationalism as “dangerous”, hinting as of BJP, Shiv Sena and other Hindutva organisations like RSS, VHP, Bajrang Dal without proper mentioning of their names.

.

“However, there is another nationalism which is provocative and dangerous. In that nationalism, there is no respect for life.

.

They only know one language and act (that is of violence).

.

“If you disagree with them, then you will be crushed and killed. This nationalism does not have its roots in this country, but it is imported. This nationalism has its roots in Germany and influenced by Mussolini in Italy,” Baghel said.

.

“Today this House takes pledge to take forward Gandhi’s fight against provocative nationalism,” he added.

.

During their speeches, BJP MLAs raised objection over Baghel’s claims that Savarkar was part of Gandhis murder conspiracy and demanded that these lines be expunged from House record.

.

When the Speaker did not pay heed to their demand, BJP legislators boycotted the assembly proceedings.

.

Earlier, taking part in the discussion, Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik slammed previous Congress governments for imposing Emergency in 1975 and for 1984 anti- Sikh riots, and said those who got power in the name of Gandhi ji, they themselves ignored his principles and ideals.

Post Script: Nasty Dynasty of Gandhi.

Nation must know the anti-Hindu, anti-Hindutva and pro-Muslim role of Gandhi and Modi-Shah-BJP-RSS must stop its double standard Gandhi worship.

~ Upananda Brahmachari

In a ‘Gandhi 150’ programme, the Chhattishgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel attacked RSS-BJP for the killing of their father of the nation M K Gandhi and in a masked way he abused the BJP’s Father of the Nation PM Modi and Brother of the Nation Amit Shah as they are not true followers of Gandhi.

Gandhi worship in Congress is traditional and natural… But Why PM Modi and Company started Gandhi worship so shamefully. Read more+….
