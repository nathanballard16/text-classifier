IAF launches air-to-land Brahmos from Su-30 MKI in the Andamans

KOLKATA: The Indian Air Force (IAF), on Wednesday, successfully fired the air-version of the supersonic cruise missile BrahMos from its frontline Su-30 MKI aircraft. This was the second live launch of the 2.5-tonne missile from an aircraft. On November 22, 2017, the missile was fired on a sea target. On Wednesday, the target was a patch of land on an uninhabited island in the Andamans.“The launch from the aircraft was smooth and the missile followed the desired trajectory before directly hitting the land target. The integration of the weapon on the aircraft was a very complex process involving mechanical, electrical and software modifications on aircraft. The IAF has been involved in the activity from its inception. The software development of the aircraft was undertaken by the IAF engineers while HAL carried out mechanical and electrical modifications on the aircraft. The dedicated and synergetic efforts of the IAF, DRDO, BAPL and HAL have proven the capability of the nation to undertake such complex integrations,” IAF PRO Wg Cdr Anupam Banerjee said.The air-launched BrahMos has a range of nearly 300 km and was designed and developed by BAPL. The IAF became the first air force in the world to have successfully fired an air-launched 2.8 Mach surface attack missile of this category on a sea target in November 2017.“The BrahMos missile provides IAF a much-desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions. The capability of the missile coupled with the superlative performance of the Su-30MKI aircraft gives the IAF the desired strategic reach. The firing could be successfully undertaken with dedicated support from Indian Navy by way of ensuring availability of a large number of monitoring ships to ensure range safety clearance,” Wg Cdr Banerjee added.
