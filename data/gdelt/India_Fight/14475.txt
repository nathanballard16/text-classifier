He further added that he has no intentions to quit the show and no such decision has been made by him. He also said that he will continue his mission to reveal the real history of Chhatrapati Sambhaji Maharaj through his show.

The news that went viral suggested that Amol will be taking a short break to concentrate on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. It was getting difficult for the actor to manage the shoots of the show and the election work simultaneously, hence he was taking the decision to take a break, stated several news reports.

This news started doing the rounds soon after Amol joined the Nationalist Congress Party recently. The actor has been active in politics for years now.
