Surat mall fire: Gujarat govt report points to lapses

Investigation into Friday's fire at four-storey Takshashila Arcade in Surat's Sarthana area has revealed a string of lapses by the builder as well as the diamond city's fire department and civic authority.



A report by the urban development department, submitted to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani, states the commercial complex had permission for three storeys and the fourth was constructed illegally.



The probe further reveals that before the blaze which killed 22 students broke out, many buildings in the area had been issued notices by the Surat civic body for failing to comply with fire-safety rules. But somehow, this structure had escaped their attention.



The fire, the report states, was caused by a short circuit. The flex banners on the facade aided in spreading the fire to the top floors, it says.



Mukesh Puri, principal secretary, urban development department, said an exit had been blocked on the top floor, and lack of ventilation prevented smoke from escaping.



So far, four people including the building's owners have been arrested and a complaint filed has been against some officials.
