Asked if a Pakistani UAV had been shot down by the Indian armed forces, a police official, on condition of anonymity, said, "Such an incident has happened, we are investigating the matter." The official, however, refused to elaborate further.

Earlier, combat jets of Indian Air Force bombed Jaish terror camp across the Line of Control on the Pakistani side, 12 days after Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group carried out an attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama in Kashmir.

The IAF dropped 1,000 pound bombs in a thickly-forested hilltop that has eliminated a large number of terrorists in Balakot, the biggest camp of the terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed.

The strikes was carried out on the basis of credible intelligence and designed to target the Jaish camp without any civilian casualties, Gokhale announced hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a top security meet to review the cross-border strike.
