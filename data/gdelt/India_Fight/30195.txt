Tiruchi Indian Medical Association doctors demand protection

The Tiruchi branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Friday demanded a law against violence at hospitals and protection of medical practitioners.

R. Gunasekaran, vice-president, IMA, Tiruchi, said that the protest, was meant to condemn the recent attacks on doctors at the NRS Medical College, Kolkata. “Doctors are wearing black badges in solidarity with the doctor who is fighting for his life after attack. The IMA has been demanding a law to protect doctors. Only around 11 states in the country have a Hospital Protection Act but that isn't enough,” he said.

The memorandum of IMA-Tiruchi addressed to the Prime Minister and Home Minister demanded a law that ensures a minimum of seven years of imprisonment for culprits indulging in violence at hospitals . “Hospitals should be declared as special zones and the provision of security should be the responsibility of the State. The increase in violence will adversely affect public health. Institutions will be reluctant to take up risky cases.”
