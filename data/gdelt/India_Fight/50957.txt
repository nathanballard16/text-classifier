Alia Bhatt strikes a cool pose with fans in Los Angeles and wins hearts with her humility; See Pics

After holidaying with beau Ranbir Kapoor in London and spending quality time with sister Shaheen Bhatt, this Raazi actor jetted off to Los Angeles for a mini vacay. Thanks to social media, Alia Bhatt made sure to update her fans with her fashion outings, and from slaying in co-ords, thigh-high boots to pant suit, Alia Bhatt’s LA vacay was high on the fashion bar. From posing on the streets to clicking sun-kissed selfies, to gorging on ‘potato and leeks’ with friends, Alia Bhatt’s LA vacay clearly made us go green envy.

Now, knowing Alia Bhatt and her fan following, it didn’t come as a surprise when she was stopped on the streets for selfies by her fans, and amidst all the fan pictures, Alia Bhatt won hearts when she not just posed for pictures but also engaged in a friendly conversation with her fans. And we say this because when Alia Bhatt posed for pictures with twin brothers, who met her on the streets, Alia quizzed them about their studies. One of the twins told us that Alia was very friendly with them, and that she is a great human being. While they asked the actress about her LA trip, Alia asked them about their studies and complemented them as she said, “You guys look same, you guys are very cute.”

As we speak, Alia Bhatt is back to the bay and she was snapped at the Mumbai airport yesterday, and soon, as per reports, Alia Bhatt will head to Manali to shoot for another schedule of Ayan Mukerji’s Brahmastra opposite Ranbir Kapoor. Besides, Alia recently wrapped up the Ooty schedule of Mahesh Bhatt’s Sadak 2, and soon, she will start shooting for Karan Johar’s Takht.
