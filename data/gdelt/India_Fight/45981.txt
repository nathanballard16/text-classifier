VADODARA: The detection of crime branch (DCB) arrested three more persons, including a minor, for murdering history-sheeter Mayank Tailor in Nava Bazaar last week.Prime conspirator, Samir alias Bunty Pandya, his brother Chirag Pandya and a 17-year-old resident of Ahmedabad were nabbed from the city on Thursday. While their two accomplices were arrested two days ago, another accused named Pradeep Ravat is yet to be nabbed.“We had received information that Samir would visit Mangal Bazaar from where he was caught. He led us to Chirag and the minor,” said Jaydeepsinh Jadeja, deputy commissioner of police (crime).Police said that all the seven accused had made a plan to kill Tailor. “Tailor used to file police complaints against Samir over minor issues. Also, when Samir was in jail, Tailor got into illicit affair with his wife. Samir knew about it and was looking for an opportunity to bump him off,” Jadeja told TOI.Samir then made a plan to murder Tailor and took help of Chirag and five others.Two members of the gang then kept a watch on Tailor’s movements in the old city. Tailor had a shop in Raopura but he used to often hang around in Navabazaar.On the night of September 26, one of the arrested accused Rahul Rathod informed Samir that Tailor was alone.All of them, who were staying in a hotel in Karelibaug, reached there to execute their plan.The Pandya brothers attacked Tailor with sharp weapons and fled from there.Police said that when the arguments ensued, the minor accused caught hold of Tailor and others attacked him.Samir and Chirag used to extort money from traders in Nava Bazaar and so did Tailor.
