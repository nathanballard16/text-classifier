Don’t restrict journos’ entry, says Kapil Sibal

Speaking up for journalists facing “restrictions” in access to finance ministry’s office, Congress leader and former Union minister Kapil Sibal urged the government not to take such decisions when it had been consistently advocating transparency.Participating in the discussion on Union budget in the Rajya Sabha , Sibal said journalists seeking unrestricted entry to finance ministry had due security clearance from the home ministry and press accreditation from the government. “You have always maintained that you want a transparent government. I urge you not to take such decisions (to restrict access of journalists). Journalists have the right to go to the finance ministry,” he said, even as MoS (finance) Anurag Thakur listened to him from the treasury benches. On Wednesday, the Editors Guild had described the finance ministry restrictions as a “gag” on media freedom.
