Christian Leaders in Pakistan Call for Peace Amid Rising Tensions with India

03/03/2019 Pakistan (International Christian Concern) – Christian leaders in Pakistan participated in peace protests across the country calling for a de-escalation in tensions between Pakistan in India following a terrorist attack in Indian-administered Kashmir. The two countries have led airstrikes against each other in the wake of the terrorist attack causing tensions between the countries to run high.

Marching in a rally in Lahore on February 28, members of the Catholic Church’s National Commission for Justice and Peace (NCJP) held placards that read “If we don’t end war, ware will end us.” The activists protested against “war mongering” and called for “sanity to prevail” amid rising tensions.

On February 14, 40 Indian troops were killed in a suicide attack by the Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad. In the days that followed, India and Pakistan led airstrikes on each other’s airspace. On February 27, Pakistan shot down an Indian Air Force pilot, who was captured and saved from a mob by Pakistani troops.

Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has announced that Pakistan will return the pilot to India. Many hope this gesture will help relieve the growing tension between the two countries in the subcontinent.
