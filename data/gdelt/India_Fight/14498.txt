Summoning Mirwaiz, others to Delhi not acceptable: JKLF

Srinagar

The Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) on Tuesday said that if excessive use of force were able to defeat the freedom movements, then the country instead of a sovereign nation would have been a British colony till date. Rulers who dream of defeating Kashmiri resistances by using NIA type agencies are the only day-dreaming which will never come true, the spokesman said in a statement.

The spokesman said that a meeting was organised for taking a stock of the present situation, incarceration of JKLF chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik, slapping draconian PSA on him and putting him in solitary confinement, raids by NIA on Kashmiris, Ban on socio/religious organisation Jamat-I-Islami, unabated arrest spree and especially the summoning of Mirwaiz Muhammad Umar Farooq, Syed Naseem Geelani and others to Delhi by NIA was attended by all JKLF leaders.

The JKLF spokesman termed the recent raids by NIA and summoning of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, Naseem Geelani and others to Delhi, as an act of frustration and revenge.

Terming the prolonging solitary confinement of JKLF chairman Muhammad Yasin Malik as illegal, JKLF vice chairman said that caging Yasin Malik has exposed the freedom of speech. Yasin Malik is a thought, a leader, a soul that cannot be confined by some walls, asserted JKLF vice chairman.
