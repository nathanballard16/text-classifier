Mysuru Police suspect Tanveer sait’s popularity led to attack

Mysuru: Mysuru police suspect that Congress leader Tanveer Sait’s secular ways and his camaraderie with the Hindus in his Narasimharaja constituency led to a conspiracy to attack him by certain organisations. On many occasions, he had also brokered peace between Hindus and the minority community.

The police suspect that the attacker, Farhan Pasha, and the organisation to which he owes his allegiance to were inspired by attacks in Kerala. The Progressive Front of India cadre, the youth phalanx of the Social Democratic Party of India, is said to be trained to carry out attacks on rivals.

In Kerala, it has been accused of attacks on rival parties, including the murder of Muslim Youth League leader Naseerudheen K.P. in Kozhikode, a few years ago. PFI sibling, Campus Front, was the accused in the murder of Students Federation of India activist Abhimanyu, a Dalit, at Maharaja’s Arts and Science College in Kochi last year.

Now, Columbia Asia Hospital authorities have opened Tanveer Sait’s ward and have started allowing his followers to visit him for an hour in the evening from Saturday.
