Recently, Kolkata Metro had been in the news for all the wrong reasons.

Just about two to three days ago, a girl had slammed Kolkata Metro claiming that the train had started moving despite her shoulder being stuck outside the door. However, the incident has been denied by the Metro authorities.

On July 13, Sajal Kanjilal, a resident of Kasba area of Kolkata was killed while trying to board a Kavi Subhash-bound Metro from the Park Street station. His hand had got stuck between the doors and the Metro started moving.

Kolkata Metro, which is operated by Ministry of Railways, faced massive criticism from the ruling TMC government, which claimed such incidents were a fallout of poor maintenance.
