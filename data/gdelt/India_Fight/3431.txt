PM Narendra Modi slams 'EVM hackathon', says Congress and Left crying for democracy 'biggest joke'

PM Modi slammed the Congress and the Left parties, saying they had no respect for institutions, including the Election Commission.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday slammed the Congress and the Left parties, saying they had no respect for institutions, including the Election Commission or other institutions and that their talk about democracy was the "biggest joke".

He said the Congress was even questioning the election commission. "Be it Congress or communists, they have zero regard for any institution. For them every institution, the armed forces, police, CBI, the CAG, everybody is wrong, but they are right," he said.

Modi, who was addressing a huge Yuva Morcha rally here, also referred to the political killings in Kerala and equated it with those in Madhya Pradesh. He said the mindset of the Emergency still lived in the minds of many Congress leaders.
