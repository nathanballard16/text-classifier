“NIA is treating all people from the Muslim community especially youth as terrorist”

AGENCIES / Chennai

The Dravida Munntera Kazhagam DMK has accused BJP-led central Govt of using the NIA for its political advantage. The party also slammed the party for ‘targeting’ innocent Muslims in Tamil Nadu by raiding their houses.

In a statement, DMK president MK Stalin demanded that the searches in Muslims’ houses in Tamil Nadu should be immediately stopped. “NIA is treating all people from the Muslim community especially the youth as terrorist. This should stop immediately. Political parties are against terrorism, but the BJP Govt cannot single out a particular religion,” he added.

He further questioned the need of NIA to investigate these cases when the state police department already has a “Q” branch supervised directly by DGP and monitored by CM. Strongly condemning the searches carried out by NIA in the state, Stalin said his party would raise the issue in Parliament in a democratic manner.

On June 19, NIA conducted search operations at various locations across Tamil Nadu and arrested 14 youths who were deported from UAE.

“Income Tax dept, ED and other investigating agencies should work independently. However, the functioning of the agencies has been politicised to suit BJP Govt,”he said. “BJP is trying to polarise votes by targeting the minorities in the state and AIADMK Govt which should question the act of Centre remains a mute spectator,” he alleged.
