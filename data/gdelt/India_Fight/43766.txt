In a rare legal win, an 18-year-old girl fromhas won a court battle to get ain the name of her mother.Anchal Badwaik, who belongs to Other Backward Caste (OBC) category, had sent aproposal to District Caste Certificate Validation Committee and had attached documents from her mother's side. However, according to amendments of 2012, it was mandatory to submit evidence from her father's side too. The committee, therefore, had asked her to submit the required documents from her father's side to proceed further. But there was one problem.Anchal, who was raised by her mother, Bharati, didn't want to attach her father's name or caste with hers. Though her parents only got a formal divorce in 2017, she has been staying with her mother since her birth. All her key documents, whether Aadhaar card, Pan card or her school leaving certificate, were all issued with only her mother's name .That's what prompted Anchal to file a petition in court to ensure that she could also be allowed to get a caste certificate that does not have her father's reference in it.Anchal who has been staying with her mother Bharati since her birth, stated in court, that she had not even seen her father. Her mother, Bharati had got married in 1997. However, after nearly three years into the marriage, she was convinced that she had been cheated on by her husband and from then on, decided to stay separately. Bharati moved in with her parents to raise her daughter.The court has accepted Anchal's contention and given a verdict in her favour. Anchal has also received a caste certificate in her mother's name.Speaking to Maharashtra Times, Anchal said, "When I was needed the certificate the most, I did not receive it. However, better late than never. I have got a certificate in my mother's name. The verdict will help other girls in the future."
