A positive move?

The UGC has recommended the reintroduction of the four-year undergraduate programmes despite heavy criticism, when it was launched earlier. How will this affect students?

If a four-year UG programme is introduced, then I wish it to be an interdisciplinary education model, thereby making sure students get a fair exposure to this model.

The three-year UG programme is restrictive and does not allow for exploration of other fields. However, one must be wary of the slow-paced administration system, curriculum, and the shortage of professors in government universities.

It is also extremely important that this change is manoeuvred properly for the results to show.

This move will ensure internationalisation of education as students will become eligible for admission into foreign universities. This programme, with multiple entry/exit options, will provide choices to students to conduct research and internships. But the financial burden may also increase, besides loss of time for those who want to prepare for competitive exams. The government should reflect on this before implementing it.

Four years are necessary for a dedicated honours degree. It allows the holistic introduction and integration into all subjects. A three-year degree is crammed with subjects to fulfil credits needed for graduation. The fourth year should strictly be reserved for students who desire to pursue their masters. A separate registration process will allow candidates to be filtered and evaluated.

The major obstacle for an Indian student planning to study abroad is not only the visa but also the dissimilarity of the Indian degree. With the plan proposed by UGC, this problem would be solved to a great extent.

But, the education system may not be prepared for this change as not all students would be financially sound or motivated for such a venture. Therefore, identifying eligible candidates is essential.
