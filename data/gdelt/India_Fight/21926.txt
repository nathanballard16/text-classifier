Saaho arrives in Mumbai

Some of the action sequences of Saaho are being filmed in Mumbai with Shraddha Kapoor and Neil Nitin Mukesh.

It seems like the filmmakers from the South are clearly eyeing up Mumbai as a suitable location for their shoots. Joining the league of other South Indian films that have been shot in a Bollywood-centric Mumbai, the much-hyped film Saaho is the recent entrant in the list. Some of the action sequences of the film are being filmed in Mumbai with heroine Shraddha Kapoor and villain Neil Nitin Mukesh.

“Shraddha has been shooting with Prabhas and others on the sets in Hyderabad and Abu Dhabi earlier. However, the director Sujeeth Reddy wanted to film in the open streets and the current schedule required outdoor sequences in Mumbai. That is the reason why they decided to shoot this portion in the backdrop of Mumbai,” informs a source close to the development of the film.

Giving further details about the movie, which is being produced by Bhushan Kumar of T-Series, the source adds, “Saaho is said to be a story of time travel/reincarnation with two different eras. One portion also has some British actors, the British flag and horses all of which were canned at the Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad. That is the reason a variety of backdrops are being used in the film.”

Meanwhile, Rajinikanth is already in Mumbai shooting with AR Murugadoss and his team for Darbar. Rajini had earlier shot Kaala with Pa Ranjith in Mumbai.
