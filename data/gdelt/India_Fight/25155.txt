Lok Sabha elections 2019: ‘Democracy a casualty in Bengal’: Arun Jaitley attacks Mamata Banerjee over poll violence

Union minister Arun Jaitley has questioned West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee over the political violence in the eastern state and criticised BSP leader Mayawati over her personal attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

In a series of tweets, Arun Jaitley questioned the two regional leaders over several issues, saying “this is what India’s Opposition has to offer to the Nation”.

“Mamata Didi – Democracy has become a casualty in Bengal. Opposition workers are murdered, candidates are attacked, polling booths are captured and Opposition leaders are not entitled to organise rallies,” Jaitley wrote.

Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party have engaged in a war of words after violent clashes that claimed the lives of a number of political workers and have marred all the six phases of polling in the ongoing Lok Sabha election.

Attacking Mayawati, Arun Jaitley wrote that the Bahujan Samal Party chief was not suitable for public life after she launched a scathing personal attack on Prime Minister Modi on Monday.

Mayawati had said Modi could not be expected to respect the sisters and wives of others when he had left his own wife for political gains.

“Behan Mayawati - She is firm on becoming a Prime Minister. Her governance, ethics and discourse stoops to an all-time low. Her personal attack today on the Prime Minister exposes her as unfit for public life,” Jaitley posted.
