Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif's Bharat to not have any recreated tracks, shoot for romantic festive songs

Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif have reunited after Tiger Zinda Hai for Bharat. The movie is being helmed by none other than Sultan director Ali Abbas Zafar and also stars Disha Patani, Nora Fatehi, Sunil Grover among others. The movie had gone on floors last year and is all set to release in Eid this year. The teaser has already left everyone curious, and amidst this, a source close to the project told Mumbai Mirror that the film will feature six songs which will reflect the festive mood.

Out of the six, three songs have been centered around Holi, Diwali and a wedding, while others have a romantic or tragedy fervour. “For the ongoing 40-day schedule, the team has recreated Delhi of the 1950s and ’60s. The music sittings started much before the film went on the floors in July last year and unlike the current trend, the album doesn’t have any recreated numbers,” the source informed the publication. During the Malta schedule last year, the couple shot for a romantic number which is said to be a Diwali song.
