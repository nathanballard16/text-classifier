AAP leader shot at in Punjab

AAP's Patiala (rural) unit president was shot at by unidentified assailants in Punjab's Tarn Taran district on Thursday while he was trying to prevent them from kidnapping a girl, police said.

Some car borne youths tried to kidnap a girl in Patti. Chetan Singh (52) successfully foiled their attempt, Inspector General of Police Surinder Pal Singh Parmar said.

The girl confirmed this in her statement to police.

The assailants fired at Singh and a bullet hit him near the neck, Parmar said.

The AAP leader was shifted to Amritsar hospital where his condition was stated to be stable, he added.

Parmar said a delegation of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) met him and demanded immediate arrest of the kidnappers.

Police said investigation is underway in the case.
