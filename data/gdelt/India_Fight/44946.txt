Jaipur: The Indian Army will be inducting Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology over the next couple of years, in a bid to boost its combat capabilities, a senior Army officer said here on Wednesday. Lt Gen Alok Singh Kler, general officer commanding in chief (GOC-in-C) of South Western Army Command said that the first arm to integrate AI with military hardware would be the mechanised forces. He was speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a seminar on AI at Hisar military station.

"For using AI for military usage and mechanised forces, the Army has to become completely network-centric. Presently, we are very network-enabled," Kler said.

"Very soon in the next 2-3 years, the Army may be inducting AI for constructive and disruptive usage, and the first one to use that will be the mechanised forces," he added.

Commenting on the possibility of AI predicting crashes of fighter jets — such as the MiG- 21 crash on Wednesday — the Army commander said that safety of human beings should be put above the safety of systems.

"Any system can crash, but what is important is that even if we incorporate AI, the safety of humans has to be more important over the safety of machines. And, in today's crash, what is more important is that the two pilots are safe," the Army commander was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.

He also expressed confidence that AI will assist the Indian Army in space, water and air and dictate the future of warfare. Kler, the 10th GOC-in-C of Jaipur-based South Western Command was commissioned in Armoured Corps in 1982.
