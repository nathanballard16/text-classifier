Pragya shows Modi in true colours: Soz

SRINAGAR, May 18: Former union minister Prof Saifuddin Soz today said that BJP Lok Sabha candidate Pragya Thakur shows the Prime Minister Narendra Modi in true colours.

In a statement, Soz said, “The country’s premier investigating agency, NIA, has decisively proved that Pragya Thakur’s involvement in Malegaon blasts in which nine innocent persons were killed".

He added that among other things, she had not denied that her motorcycle was used in hurling the bombs.

"On strong evidence available to NIA, Pragya had to go to jail and now, since it is RSS which is in direct command of today’s India, she is out on bail," Soz said.

The former minister said that to galvanize the electoral scene with intense Hindutva propaganda, the RSS/BJP Sangathan chose Pragya Thakur to contest from Bhopal.

"Pragya’s open and deeply sectarian propaganda in Madhya Pradesh has unleashed forces and situations that have shown Modiji in true colours. After calling Nathu Ram Godse a patriot, she said, the other day, that party line is her line," Soz said.

Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu seems to be content with Kamala Hassan, describing Godse as the first Hindu terrorist, Soz added.
