India’s Top Court Orders Federal Security for Legislator’s Rape Accuser

The accuser, a resident of Unnao in northern Uttar Pradesh has alleged that she was raped two years ago by BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a charge the legislator has denied. She also attempted to set herself on fire outside state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s residence in April 2018 to get his attention after the state police did not act on her complaint.

On 28 July, a truck crashed into the car in which the woman was travelling, with her lawyer and two aunts. While her aunts later succumbed to their injuries, the alleged rape victim and her lawyer were critically injured and underwent treatment in a hospital in the state capital, Lucknow. The accuser’s family claims that they were receiving threats made on behalf of the legislator and the accident could have been orchestrated at his behest.

The issue has also rocked the Indian Parliament, with the opposition parties trying to corner the BJP, which was first forced to suspend the accused legislator and then dismiss him from the party.
