HONG KONG, July 11 (AP)—Tibet is in turmoil again as rival Red Guard factions battle each other and hostility spreads among Army troops, Tibetan leaders, military commanders, revolutionary committees and mass organisations, a Hong Kong newspaper reported yesterday. The anti-Communist Chinese language organ “Tin Tin Yatpo”, attributing its report to “well-informed exclusive sources”, said all signs point to a further deteriortating situation in that vital region bordering India. The paper said two powerful rival Red Guard organisations — the “Great Alliance Headquarters” and the “Lhasa Revolutionary Rebels’ Headquarters’— are battling each other. Both are opposed to the Maoist Tibet Revolutionary Committee. The Lhasa organisation is trying to seize power in Tibet.
