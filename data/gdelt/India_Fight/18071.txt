Mumbai: The flat of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim's sister in South Mumbai was auctioned in Mumbai Friday. Haseena Parkar flat in Nagpada was auctioned for Rs 1.80 crore under the SAFEMA Act (Smuggling And Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act). The flat was sold after Parkar's relatives failed to prove that the property was bought from money acquired through legal sources.

Dawood's mother Ameena and sister Haseena took care of the properties after Dawood fled the country. In 2018, the Supreme Court attached seven Nagpada properties of the notorious don.

Haseena was married to Ismail Parkar after her husband's murder by Dawood's rival Arun Gawli, she turned to a life of crime. She ran the crime syndicate left behind by her brother on her own and was repeatedly worth Rs 5,000 crore. Dawood avenged the murder in the 1995 JJ Hospital shootout in Mumbai.

It is believed that it was in this Nagpada flat in the Gorden Hall building where Parkar, 55, breathed her last in 2014. According to reports, Dawood stayed in the flat before fleeing India after 1993 Mumbai blasts.

Parkar died of a heart attack on June 7, 2014. She was survived by two daughters. Her eldest son Danish had died in a road accident. Parkar was observing the Ramzan fast when she complained of a chest pain. He was immediately rushed to a near-by hospital and breathed her last there.

Parkar was the youngest sister among Dawood's 11 siblings. It is believed she was one of the most investigated aides of Dawood -with intelligence agencies keeping a close watch on her day-to-day activities.
