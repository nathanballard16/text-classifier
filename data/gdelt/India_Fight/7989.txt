The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has registered a case and is launching a fresh probe into the terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 troopers were killed on February 14.

"We have re-registered the Pulwama terror attack case," said an NIA spokesperson, here on Wednesday.

The move comes five days after the worst-ever terror attack on the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy since militancy erupted in 1989 in the state.

The first case in the Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed attack was registered by the Jammu and Kashmir Police on the day of attack.

A day after the terror attack on the CRPF convoy, the counter-terror probe agency officials along with explosive and forensic experts had collected material evidences required for the probe.

A team of senior NIA officers has been camping in Srinagar since the suicide attack on the Jammu-Srinagar highway when an explosive packed SUV rammed a bus carrying the CRPF troopers.
