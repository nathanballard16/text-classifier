The encounter took place in insurgency-hit Sukma district at around 6 pm in a forest near Tadmetla-Mukram nullah which falls under Chintalnar police station area. A team of police’s District Reserve Guard was patrolling the area when the gun-battle ensued, Deputy Inspector General (anti-Naxal operations) Sundarraj P told PTI.

Security forces launched the operation when they received information about naxals digging up a road near Tadmetla, Sudarraj added. A huge cache of arms including one INSAS weapon was also recovered from the spot.

Earlier today, two naxals were gunned down in another encounter with security forces at around 11:30 pm on Friday in a forest near Kutrem village in Dantewada district.
