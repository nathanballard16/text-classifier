Sara Ali Khan goes on bike ride with Kartik Aaryan, gets trolled for not wearing helmet

New Delhi:

Kartik Aaryan and Sara Ali Khan have been grabbing the limelight for quite some time now for all the right reasons. The two will be seen for the first time together in Imtiaz Aliâ€™sÂ Love Aaj Kal 2.Â Sara and Kartik were spotted in New Delhi over the weekend as they shot for their upcoming film. The two were caught on camera as they rode a bike together. The video going viral on the internet shows Kartik driving the bike while Sara sits behind him. While Sara was dressed up in smart casuals, Kartik looked uber-cool as always.

However, it took no time for the netizens to point out that the actress was violating road safety rules and not wearing a helmet. "Always wear your helmet," one fan advised her.Â

In an interview with India Today last year, Sara had said that she does not take trolls too seriously. Â When asked about dealing with criticism, she had said, "I don't know if I'm bad at research or I'm just delusional or if I'm speaking too soon, but I don't think that I have been trolled."

"Everybody has their opinion. The social media age has given rise to a platform where people can voice their opinion. I read comments sometimes, and somebody will say, 'Oh my god, she looked so pretty', and then somebody will say, 'Oh my god, she looked like a clown'. I think both should be taken in the same stride because they are both opinions that deserve a listening ear, but no more than that," she had added.

Meanwhile, a video of Sara and Kartik sharing a passionate kiss went viral on the internet. It is being speculated that the video was leaked from the sets of Love Aajkal 2.

When Kartik was asked about the video, he told Bollywood Life, ''Was that really Sara and me?'' Now, this seems to be enough for the viewers to doubt the credibility of the video.Â
