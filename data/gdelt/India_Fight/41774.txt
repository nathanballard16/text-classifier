Woman held for killing father, disposing of body in Hassan

Hassan, Sep 1: A team of cops from Alur police station in Hassandistrict has arrested a Bengaluru woman after she murdered her father with the help of her male friend and his accomplice, who are also in police custody.

The accused are Vidya, her friend Chidananda, his aide Raghu. All of them are residents of Byadarahalli and nearby areas in Bengaluru. The victim, Muniraju, was a cab driver.

According to Alur police, Muniraju's objection to Vidya's alleged extramarital relationship with her friend Chidananada resulted in the murder. Vidya continued her affair with Chidananda even after her second marriage, and this riled her father.

The breakthrough came a week after Muniraju's body with stab injuries was found in the backwaters of Hemavathi, near Maniganahalli, Kundur Hobli, on August 26. He was murdered on August 23. The body bore stab injuries and ligature marks around the neck. Alur police registered a murder case and began investigation. In the meantime, Vidya lodged a missing complaint in Bengaluru, which helped Alur police in identifying Muniraju's body. She had even identified her father.

Two days after Muniraju's identity was revealed, police tracked call records and picked up Chidananda for questioning. He confessed that Vidya had offered him Rs 15 lakh to murder her father as she felt inconvenienced by her father's demand to end her relationship with Chidananda.
