The fire reportedly broke out due to a short circuit in the building, where construction work was currently going on, reports said. However, an official reason for the cause of the fire was yet to be determined. As the 10-storeyed hospital building was made of glass, firefighters reportedly found it difficult to douse the fire.

Here are a few pictures from the spot:
