Parvathy Thiruvothu recently did a photo shoot with JFW magazine. The actor, whose Uyare was successful at the box-office and also received unanimously positive reviews, can be seen answering fun questions in a video as she gets ready for the photos.

Asked with whom she'd like to get stuck in a lift, Parvathy promptly named the Australian actor and theatre director Cate Blanchett. She revealed that she'd had a chance to meet the actor when she came down to India and that she was the only person with whom she has been starstruck.

Later though, she said she'd like to change her answer to Tatiana Maslany of the Orphan Black series on Netflix.

Parvathy also spoke about her love for conversation, dislike for taking a shower or even brushing her teeth (!!) and the time a friend ruined Avengers: Endgame for her by giving out spoilers.

And if there's one annoying habit about her, it is that she leaves long voice notes (20 minutes long, she said) for her friends when she travels and finds herself feeling lonely. Asked who she'd like to interview, Parvathy named Ratna Pathak Shah, Om Puri, Jameela Jamil and Sam Harris. She also spoke about the time when she ended up hurting herself badly over...pizza!

All this and more in this video:

Parvathy was last seen in Aashiq Abu's multi-starrer Virus where she played a pivotal role. The film was based on the Nipah outbreak in Kerala.
