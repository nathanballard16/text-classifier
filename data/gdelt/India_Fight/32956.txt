Unpaid MC employees continue protest

Ludhiana: A day after zone A office stir, Class IV employees of the Ludhiana municipal corporation too staged a protest at zone D office on Tuesday against non-payment of salaries from the last two months.

They blocked the main entrance of the MC office for almost two hours and moved from there only when municipal commissioner K P Brar assured them of releasing their salaries in the next few days.

The employees sat in protest at the main gate of the office while people were forced to use another entrance from the Suvidha centre side of the office. The employees were furious over the pending salaries of last two months and rued that it was difficult to manage their households. They said there is no clarity when they will get the salary as the third month has started.

They raised slogans against mayor Balkar Sandhu and municipal commissioner K P Brar. Police was deployed inside the office for avoiding any untoward incident. The protesters demanded that the municipal commissioner should come down and listen to their issues. The MC commissioner assured the protesting employees that payment will be done as soon as the government will release the pending GST instalment.

Notably, the salary non-payment issue brought on by the financial crisis in the civic body has resurfaced in two days. Even on Monday, the employees had staged a similar protest at zone A office of MC.

Meanwhile, members of the Sangharsh Committee met the police commissioner on Tuesday with a demand of taking action over the complaints submitted by civic officials for alleged manhandling. They claimed that employees are still waiting for action against the accused including in case of manhandling of a woman building inspector.
