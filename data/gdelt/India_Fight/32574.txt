Several people have been killed so far in the rain-related incidents in Mumbai as the heavy monsoon crippled the financial capital. Several low-lying areas, including Dadar, Sion, Matunga, Parel, Wadala, Mahim, Santacruz, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Malad and Dahisar are submerged in water that halted the all traffic movement. Central Railway has cancelled dozens of long distance and local trains due to safety reasons. The government has declared a public holiday and advised people to stay indoors. According to a fire brigade official, 18 people were killed when a wall crashed down on shanties built on a hill slope in Malad. "Rescue work is still going on," the official added. "So far we have rescued more than two dozen people." In another rain-related incident, three people died when a school wall collapsed in the city of Kalyan, 42 km (26 miles) north of Mumbai. In Pune, six people were killed in a wall collapse incident. Mumbai is the financial capital of India but the city struggles to cope with annual monsoon rains. Every year, a large part of the city turns into a pool, which brings it to a standstill. According to the weather officials, some areas of Mumbai received more than 300 mm (11.8 inches) of rainfall in last 24 hours that flooded streets and railway tracks. In 2005, floods killed more than 500 people in Mumbai. (BCCL)
