5th Phase Lok Sabha elections: 51 seats key to election score as slog overs begin

Narendra Modi's popularity at stake in phase 5 of 2019 Lok Sabha elections

NEW DELHI: Though Monday marks a small phase of the election with just 51 seats at stake, voting in the fifth round of Lok Sabha polls is a critical stage in the 'BJP vs rest' face-off for the Delhi throne with the polls hurtling towards a finish on May 19.The remaining 12 of the 25 seats in Rajasthan and seven more of 29 in Madhya Pradesh will decide if the ruling BJP can minimise its possible losses, having won all the seats in the desert state and all but two in MP in the 2014 saffron wave.The Rajasthan election will close on Monday while MP has one more round to go. A big chunk of east UP seats (which will poll in the fifth, sixth and seventh) phases are witnessing an engrossing battle which can decide whether the SPBSP 'gathbandhan' has stalled BJP or PM Narendra Modi 's Hindutva plus development social engineering has prevailed.Fourteen constituencies in UP, seven (of 42) in West Bengal, five (40) in Bihar, four in Jharkhand, besides Ladakh in J&K, vote on Monday. Rae Bareli of Congress matriarch Sonia Gandhi and Amethi of party chief Rahul Gandhi figure in this batch. SP and BSP have extended support to Congress in the two seats.In these later phases of the seven-round poll spread over 39 days, Rajasthan and MP stand out for multiple reasons.BJP lost both states to a resurgent Congress in the December 2018 state polls but is betting heavy on putting up a good performance in the national polls. On the other hand, Congress is faced with the challenge of reposting the surge it managed just four months ago. The twin battlegrounds, with Congress in power but with a robust saffron organisation, are being watched for the bigger picture.For, these are among the provinces where BJP is in a direct clash with Congress. Whether Congress local leaderships stave off the Modi-powered, presidential style campaign is an interesting dimension and may have a disproportionate influence in the final outcome.Other 'BJP vs Congress' bipolar states include Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Karnataka (where Congress has a minor ally in JD-S), and the hill states of Uttarakhand and Himachal. Together, they account for 129 of the 543-member Lok Sabha.With the SP-BSP combine widely expected to pose a serious challenge to BJP, UP continues to feature in calculations for the size of loss the saffron party could suffer in the state where its alliance swept 73 of the 80 seats in 2014.Conversely, Bengal is the stomping ground of Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee where (besides Odisha) BJP is hoping to make major gains to neutralise some of the losses in other regions.
