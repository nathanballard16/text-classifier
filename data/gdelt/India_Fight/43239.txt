Allahabad: Police on Wednesday worked out the murder case of exorcist Lalta Sharma who was shot by a motorcycle-borne man in Pratapgarh on September 1.According to cops, Anil Kumar Mishra (47) of Balipur allegedly hired contract killers to eliminate the exorcist as he was fed up with his growing demand for money.Superintendent of police (Pratapgarh) Abhishek Singh said a joint team of Fatanpur police and crime branch were asked to work out the case.“Cops came to know that Mishra had earlier contacted Sharma for treatment of his wife who was suffering from some illness for the last six years,” he said.“Mishra claimed that he had paid enough money to the exorcist but he kept on demanding more though his wife’s condition was not improving. He alleged that the exorcist had ill intention towards his wife and kept on visiting his house without calling,” the SP added.During interrogation, Mishra admitted that he hatched the conspiracy to eliminate the exorcist and contacted contract killer Shahzad Alam alias Bhaiya who demanded Rs 2.5 lakh for the murder. Mishra paid Rs 50,000 to him in advance.Police said Alam and his four accomplices had planned to kill Sharma on Rakshabandhan but returned after seeing many visitors at his house.Later, one of the shooters, Gufran, visited Sharma’s house on the pretext of treatment of his ailing brother. However, Lalta refused to come with him claiming that he had to go to Mumbai for some work.On September 1, all the four hired killers again visited Sharma’s house after which Gufran took him on his motorcycle and shot him near a canal.After Mishra’s arrest, police are now looking for remaining accused Sarsoo, Shahzad alias Bhaiya, Shahbaaz, Gufran, Mohd Shadab alias Tooti and Dabboo alias Shadab, all residents of Pratapgarh.
