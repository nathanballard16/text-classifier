BJD govt ‘most corrupt’: Adityanath

Rourkela: Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Monday dubbed the BJD government in Odisha ‘corrupt’ and called upon the people to vote BJP to power both at the Centre and the state for building a new Odisha.

Addressing a massive election meeting in the Steel City, Adityanath said Odisha government was involved in various scams including the chit fund scam.

The BJD government in Odisha had no plan for the youths and development of the state.

Adityanath said a chorus is heard across the country from North to South and East to West to make Narendra Modi Prime Minister again for a strong, developed and ‘Shrestha Bharat’?

The implementation of a number of infrastructure development projects and development works by the BJP government during the last five years will be the voice of the people across the country which will make Modi the Prime Minister again. He said only the BJP can ensure development in the country and in the state and urged the people to elect BJP to power both in the Centre and in the state.

Lashing out at the Congress, Adityanath said during the Congress rule, the government preferred to remain mum when the Chinese were trespassing into the Indian territory and the Pakistan sponsored terrorists were killing people inside India.

But the scenario changed after the BJP came to power at the Centre.

Adityanath said after the Pulwama attack, the Defence personnel gave a befitting reply to Pakistan by attacking the terrorists’ base inside Pakistan.

He said the BJP government during the last five years had given electricity connection to 4.5 crore households, 9.5 crore toilets, six crore gas cylinders, provided assistance of `6,000 per year to 12.5 crore farmers family, `5 lakh health insurance cover to poor and financial assistance to 15 crore youths under the MUDRA yojana which the UP chief minister said could not be possible during the Congress and BJD rule.
