"Congress Responsible For Creation Of Pakistan In 1947", Says PM Modi

Elections 2019: PM Narendra Modi slammed Congress today for "speaking the language of Pakistan"

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today held the Congress responsible for the creation of Pakistan in 1947. Addressing a poll rally in Maharashtra's Latur district, PM Modi also appeared to be treading sensitive ground by asking first-time voters to dedicate their first vote to those who carried out air strike in Balakot.

"Can your first vote be dedicated to those who carried out air strike," PM Modi said, appealing to first-time voters. Pakistan would not have been born had Congress leaders acted wisely in the pre-independence era, PM Modi said, as he stepped up the attack on the Congress.

"Had Congress leaders acted wisely during the pre-independence era, this Pakistan would not have been born," PM Modi said.

PM Modi also said that Congress party's manifesto speaks the same language as that of Pakistan. He accused the Congress and its ally NCP of standing with those who want a separate prime minister for the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

PM Modi was referring to National Conference leader Omar Abdullah's remark in this connection.

Hitting out at NCP chief Sharad Pawar on the issue, PM Modi asked if it behoved the Maratha strongman to join forces with the parties holding such a view.

On the other hand, PM Modi said under the BJP's watch it was the policy of 'New India' that it will kill terrorists in their own dens.

PM Modi also hailed the manifesto of the BJP, released in Delhi yesterday, and said the party was committed to national security and farmers' welfare among other.

"Your trust is my biggest accomplishment in last five years," PM Modi told the crowd. He also said that his objective is to rid India of naxal and Maoist menace.
