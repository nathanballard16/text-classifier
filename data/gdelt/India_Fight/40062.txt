Global community should play its role in stopping India from committing massive human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir:

Dr. Khurram Iqbal (Expert on International Relations):

National security demands continuity of policies of the military leadership. Pakistan Army is leading from the front in combating external and internal challenges. General Bajwa expanded the operation Zarb-e-Azb and eliminated the menace of terrorism from the country. Pakistan pursued an aggressive policy against Indian hostility under the command of General Bajwa. Pakistan army has rendered matchless sacrifices for Motherland. BJP’s abnormal nuclear posture is not unprecedented. Indian politicians are habitual of giving irresponsible statements regarding use of nuclear weapons. Under the Hindutwa influence, India as a nuclear state poses serious threat to regional peace and stability. International community should come forward and take appropriate measures to address the issue before it’s too late.
