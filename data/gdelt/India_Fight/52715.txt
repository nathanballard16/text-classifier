The Malerkotla police have registered a case against eight persons, including two jail inmates, for the murder of gangster Abdul Rashid, alias Ghudu, who was gunned down on Monday night.

Mohammad Yameen alleged his younger brother Ghudu (26), was shot while he was attending his wedding in Malerkotla. Four unidentified youngsters opened fire at him when he was welcoming guests. The accused also fired at Arun Chauhan, an electrician at the wedding palace.

The family took Ghudu to Malerkotla civil hospital, where he was declared brought dead. Chauhan is undergoing treatment.

Sangrur SSP Sandeep Garg said the police had registered a case under Sections 302, 120-B of the IPC and Sections 25/54/59 of the Arms Act.

“Facing around 15 FIRs, Ghudu had an old enmity with the accused. The accused include Bagga Khan Takhar and Gahia Khan of Matoi who are lodged in Amritsar and Bathinda jails, respectively. The third accused is Faraz Ahmed, husband of a local councillor, along with five unidentified persons. We will bring Bagga and Gahia on a production warrant,” said the SSP.

About a Facebook post that claimed responsibility of the murder, the SSP said, “Prima facie, the post seems to be genuine. It’s from Bagga’s handle. The accused has owned up the responsibility of the murder alleging that Ghudu had hit wife of Gaayia, his close friend, in her stomach, leading to miscarriage. But since Bagga is in jail, we are verifying whether he himself uploaded the post or got it done from someone else,” said the SSP.

However, Ghudu’s family has demanded a high-level inquiry. Though the post-mortem examination was conducted, till the filing of report, the family were refusing to take the body with them.
