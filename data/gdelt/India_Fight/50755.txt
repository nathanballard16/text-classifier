BJP shot economy with twin bullets of note ban, GST: Congress

GORAKHPUR: Attacking the central government on the third anniversary of demonetization, Congress national spokesman Gaurav Vallabh on Friday accused the BJP of shooting down the country’s economy, which was running swiftly, with twin bullets of note ban and GST.“After note ban, the country is facing worst level of unemployment. Goods and services tax (GST) was implemented in an unplanned manner which destroyed unorganized sector, construction and manufacturing industry. GDP has dipped to 4.5-5%,” Vallabh said.“With 2% growth rate in agriculture sector, I don’t understand how the government will double the income of farmers. In ‘New India’, farmers are paying taxes for the first time,” Vallabh added. On Ayodhya issue, he said BJP was following the Congress’s stand as his party had been saying that it would respect the court’s verdict.“In New India, police is seeking protection, lawyers are seeking justice and people of Delhi are demanding oxygen to breathe. And PM (Narendra) Modi says in America that all is well.”On PF scam in UPPCL, the Congress leader accused the state government of investing the money of employees in a tainted firm instead of nationalised banks.
