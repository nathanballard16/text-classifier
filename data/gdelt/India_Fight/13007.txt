Gujarat: Gau rakshak who usurped land stages attack on self

RAJKOT: A 42-year-old man who claims to be a gau rakshak, or cow vigilante, was arrested on Tuesday along with his three aides for staging an attack on his own life last month at Mahendranagar Chowkdi in Morbi town.Police said that Dinesh Loriya (42) and his three friends Ibrahim Taraya, his brother Sikandar and one Abdul Taraya were arrested by the Morbi local crime branch (LCB) on Tuesday. Besides Loriya, the accused are from Jaspur Vandh in Bhachau of Kutch.Investigation revealed that Loriya had set up a gaushala (cow shelter) on 5 bigha land in Mahendranagar by allegedly encroaching upon government land. Sources said that 1 bigha land in Morbi costs around Rs 4 crore. So, to avoid any action against him by the district administration, Loriya staged the attack on his own life that he had planned with his aides.Loriya was shot at by two unidentified assailants at Mahendranagar Chowkdi in Morbi on February 12. The attack took place when he was going in his car to have tea.Loriya had told police that he had survived the attack as he was able to dodge the bullets by ducking down. However, police became suspicious after the forensic report concluded that the bullets fired at Loriya were never meant to hit him.During interrogation, Loriya’s driver Ashwin Parmar, who was driving the car when the shots were fired, told police that it was a staged attack planned by Loriya and his friends.Police also conducted a background check on Loriya and found him to be involved in shady dealing with cattle traders on sending animals to slaughter houses. During investigation, they also came to know that the land on which Loriya had set up the cow shelter was government land that was encroached upon.Based on Parmar’s statement, forensic report and other information, the LCB arrested Loriya and three others from their homes late night on Monday for staging the attack.
