Yogi govt lists encounters as part of achievements to be highlighted on R-Day

Meerut: Unfazed by the criticism it has drawn over rising number of encounters in UP, the state government has featured the killings in a list of achievements to be highlighted on Republic Day . An official communication by UP chief secretary Anup Chandra Pandey, which was released on Friday, lists 3,026 encounters that took place in the state between March 2017 and July 2018 among the achievements of the state government. According to the list, 69 criminals were gunned down, 838 sustained injuries and 7,043 were arrested in these encounters.In the letter marked to all district magistrates, the chief secretary said that the common man should be made aware of the achievements of the state government through ‘jan sabhas’ on Republic Day.This comes even as the rise in encounters in India’s most populous state have sparked widespread outrage, prompting the Supreme Court to comment earlier this month that encounter killings of alleged criminals in UP was a “serious issue that requires detailed hearing".The encounters have also drawn attention of several human rights bodies, including United Nations , which recently expressed alarm about allegations of at least 59 extrajudicial killings by police in Uttar Pradesh since March 2017. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has also taken suo motu cognizance of alleged fake encounters in UP. In May 2018, the rights body had directed the UP government to constitute an investigative team for an inquiry into 17 cases of alleged fake encounters.The notices have done little to deter the trigger-happy UP Police. In September last year, TV journalists were invited to “watch and film a real encounter” in Aligarh district where cops gunned down two men on camera.The brass in police department, however, has on several occasions reiterated that encounters are not part of the state policy. While human right organizations term such encounters of suspects with state forces as 'extrajudicial killings', UP Police has been insisting on these encounters to be 'police crackdown'.“Encounters are never a part of the state policy in any civilized society. If a criminal has the audacity to open fire at police, the latter is bound to revert. This is part of the police crackdown against the criminals in the state,” Anand Kumar, ADG (law and order) had said.Chief minister Yogi Adityanath has himself endorsed encounters in the state and reflected similar sentiments during his recent visit to Mumbai to attend an event on UP Pravasi Divas.“If they (suspects) had managed to cross into the UP border, we would have eliminated them then and there,” CM Adityanath had said after Maharashtra ATS apprehended suspected terrorists who were looking to disturb peace at the Kumbh Mela this year.
