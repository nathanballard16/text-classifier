New Delhi: The Indian Air Force (IAF) on Thursday said that it continues to remain in a high state of preparedness, after Pakistan chose not to open the airspace over the Indo-Pak border region. The IAF said it will proactively engage any perceived threat in the highly volatile existing security scenario.

The Air Force further said it is maintaining a strict vigil in the skies to detect and thwart any act of aggression from the Pakistan Air Force.

The IAF statement came after it emerged that Pakistan civil aviation authority notified the opening of the airspace with Oman, Iran, Afghanistan and China but not with India. There are 11 entry/exit points along the Indo-Pakistan airspace boundary.

“As per NOTAM No. A0234/19 issued by CAA Pakistan, it has opened their airspace with Oman, Iran, Afghanistan and China only. The eleven entry/exit points located along Indo-Pak airspace boundary are still closed,” the Pakistani notification said.

It may be noted that Pakistan had closed its airspace on February 27, after its jets violated the Indian airspace and tried to target military installations. A day before on February 26, the Indian Air Force had carried out pre-dawn air strikes inside Pakistan at Balakot, to hit the biggest terrorist training camp of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group.

The air strikes had followed the February 14 terror attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama, in which 40 soldiers were killed. JeM had claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terror attack.

India too had partially closed its airspace for some hours on February 27 in view of the Pakistani Air Force jets move to violate Indian airspace and drop bombs along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir.
