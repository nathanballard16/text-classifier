Drunkard arrested for killing pregnant wife

Ludhiana: The police, on Saturday night, arrested a man for killing his seven-month pregnant wife.

Cops said Rohit Sharma, 26, killed his wife Preet following a verbal spat. The autopsy report confirmed that the woman was strangulated to death. Police said the accused, a habitual drinker, fought with his wife whenever she asked him to shun alcohol. Preet’s father Murari Lal, who resided with the couple, said Rohit would often beat up his daughter in an inebriated condition.

Salem Tabri SHO inspector Kamaljit Singh said the police arrested Rohit when he was trying to escape from the city. “He has confessed to have committed the crime. After strangulating Preet on July 26 night, Rohit slept by her side and left in the morning. Murari Lal woke up in the morning and found Rohit, who ran a juice stall, missing and Preet lying dead,” the SHO added.
