In December 2015, Tank and his associate Gurjant Singh were attacked with sharp weapons at Doda’s farmhouse. Tank’s limbs were chopped off and he later died at a hospital in Amritsar. Gurjant’s limbs were also severed and he sustained serious injuries.

Shiv Lal Doda was considered close to the Akali leadership. He had fought 2012 Punjab assembly polls as an Independent. He lost to Congress’s Sunil Jakhar.

Doda filed nomination in 2017 too as an Independent from Abohar seat but later withdrew it in favour of BJP nominee Arun NaranG who won the election.

The Akali-BJP government faced opposition dire over the murder of Bhim Sain Tank over Doda’s association with the SAD. The Congress had accused the ruling Akalis of patronising the liquor baron. Doda runs a liquor business in the states of Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan.
