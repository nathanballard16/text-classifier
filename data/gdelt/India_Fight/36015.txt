Enough proof of Pakistan hand in Pulwama attack: Army chief on Imran Khan's indigenous remark

Indian Army chief General Bipin Rawat on Thursday hit back at Pakistan PM Imran Khan for saying Pakistan had no role in the Pulwama terror attack and instead it was an "indigenous thing".

Speaking to the media, General Rawat said, "We are aware of the truth. So we don't have to get carried away by any statement. The truth is known to us and our establishment."

He added, "Our intelligence agencies had given ample proof of what had happened in Pulwama and that is all I would like to say."

During his recent US visit, Imran Khan said, "A Kashmiri boy was radicalised after the brutalities of the Indian security forces and he carried out the attack, but suddenly Pakistan came into the limelight."

Khan's justification is that although Jaish is based in Pakistan, it also has presence in Kashmir and thus the attack is an "indigenous thing" that happened in India.

Forty CRPF personnel were killed on February 14 when a CRPF convoy was attacked by a Jaish terrorist who rammed an IED-laden vehicle into one of the trucks.

Jaish-e-Mohammed later released a video of the terrorist who attacked the convoy and claimed responsibility for the attack.

After his meeting with the US President, Imran Khan admitted that successive governments in Pakistan did not tell the truth to the United States, in particular in the last 15 years. Imran Khan said that there were 40 different militant groups operating in his country.

Imran Khan also deflected a question on the latest arrest of Mumbai attack mastermind and Jamaat-ud Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed. Asked about Hafiz Saeed's seventh arrest that came right ahead of his US visit, Imran Khan said "we do not allow any armed militant groups to operate" in our country.

The comments came after Imran Khan held a bilateral meeting with US President Donald Trump at the White House in which the two leaders even broached the Kashmir topic.
