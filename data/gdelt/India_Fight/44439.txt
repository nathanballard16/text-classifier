Ranchi: ABVP-backed students win 65/95 seats

RANCHI: After student leaders backed by Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad ( ABVP ) bagged 65 of the 95 seats in the Ranchi University Students Union polls, BJP's organisational secretary Dharmapal Singh on Friday congratulated the students and said youth power has given a befitting reply to forces promoting regionalism, appeasement and dynastic rule in college campuses.After the counting ended on Friday evening, ABVP-backed students were declared winners in 65 seats, ACS-backed students in 22, Ajsu-backed students in six along with two independent candidates. Elections were cancelled in BS College this year after all the nominations filed from the college were found to be deemed unfit in the scrutiny, bringing down the total number of seats from 100 to 95.Though a meagre 28% students turned up at the colleges on Thursday to elect their candidates, things were charged up on Friday after the counting started at Aryabhatta Auditorium of Ranchi University.While overall the counting day was peaceful, drama unfolded during the counting of votes for the post of secretary for the student union of Post Graduate Department of the university. When news of Rahul Munda leading with 12 votes came in, there were protests demanding a recounting. However, the university did not entertain the demands. Scattered clashes were also reported from across the city, with two groups reportedly from JN College, Dhurwa vandalising two-wheelers in a fight between the two."The other student political parties are listlessly dragging the declaration of results by demanding a recount of votes for Rahul Munda, who is supported by ABVP. We have already registered a huge victory this year with 65 seats and these last minute protests are nothing more than stunts," said ABVP's state organising secretary Gopal Krishna Dubey. Munda eventually was declared a winner amidst widespread protests by other student bodies."It is unfair and we demand a recounting. The university must take cognizance of a victory by such a small margin and the must be declared null and void," said Sanjay Kumar Mahli, a protesting student.Although the university doesn't allow the students union polls to be conducted on party lines, youth political wings like ABVP, National Student Union of India (NSUI), Adivasi Chatra Sangh (ACS) and All Jharkhand Student's Union (Ajsu) extend unofficial support to the candidates and party workers join in the campaigning process.As per the data collected from the student wings of the political parties, ABVP emerged as a front runner with a clean sweep in all five posts of president, vice-president, secretary, joint secretary and deputy secretary in 11 colleges, with a total of 65 seats in their kitty. Out of the remaining 30 seats, ACS had a clean sweep in four colleges and won a total of 22 seats while Ajsu won in six seats. The only college to have two independent candidates - Seema Kumari and Pragati Priyadarshi - as winners is Ranchi Women's College.Speaking to TOI, returning officer for the polls Prabhat Kumar Singh said, "Political parties can back candidates but for us, as per the rules, students have won the elections and not any party."Meanwhile, an ecstatic Divya Pathak, who emerged as the winner for the post of vice-president at PG the department of the university said, "I will work on female issues and ensure that a transparent system is established in the university for the benefit of the students."BJP spokesperson Pratul Shahdeo also congratulated the ABVP team on their victory and said, "The result shows that the youth of the state is ready to push Congress and JVM out of Jharkhand in the upcoming Vidhan Sabha elections.
