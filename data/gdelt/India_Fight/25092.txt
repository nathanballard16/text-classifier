MADURAI

A hotel on TPK Road here, where Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam functionaries were staying for campaign for Tirupparankundram Assembly byelection, was searched by Flying Squad teams on Sunday evening.

Sources from the District Election Office said the search was conducted based on a complaint that cash was stashed at the hotel for distribution to voters in the constituency. However, no cash or other incriminating documents were seized from the hotel.

The AMMK functionaries who stayed at the hotel included party’s propaganda secretary Thanga Tamilselvan, but he was not present there when the search was conducted.

C.R. Saraswathi, party spokesperson, who was present at the hotel during the search, said the officials searched all the rooms, including those where other guests were staying. The search continued for nearly two hours, she told the media.

“The Election Commission of India is unable to control cash distribution by the ruling party. However, the ruling party, through the officials, is trying to intimidate us through such raids,” she said.
