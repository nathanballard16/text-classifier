New Delhi: A total of 963 terrorists have been neutralised in Jammu and Kashmir between 2014 and 2019 — the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said on Tuesday. The Lok Sabha was informed that 413 security personnel lost their lives to counter-insurgency (CI) operations during the same period.

The information was given by Minister of State (MoS) Home Affairs G Kishan Reddy in response to an unstarred question by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor. Reddy said that the security forces are taking proactive action against terrorists and adhering to the Centre's 'zero-tolerance policy' against terrorism.

"Due to concerted and synergized efforts of security forces, 963 terrorists have been neutralised in the state of Jammu and Kashmir since 2014 till June 2019. However, during these operations, 413 security forces personnel have also lost their lives," Reddy's reply read.

Responding to a question on the welfare of martyred Central Armed Police Forces (CAPF) personnel, Reddy said, "Each of the CAPFs has designated Welfare Officers at the Headquarter as well as at unit levels to facilitate the families of CAPFs personnel, who sacrifice their lives in the call of duty, to avail the admissible benefits."

Earlier, in January, the government had revealed that there has been a significant increase in the number of terrorists neutralised every year since 2015. While 108 terrorists were killed in 2015, the number rose to 150 in 2016, 213 in 2017 and 253 in 2018. Besides, 69 terrorists were arrested by the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir during the period.

According to the government records, as of January 2019, 300 terrorists were active in Jammu and Kashmir. The government had also claimed that the terrorists were being 'helped by locals'.

In the aftermath of the February 14 Pulwama attack which resulted in the death of over 40 CRPF personnel, the government has tightened the noose around separatist elements in the state and revoked security covers of separatist leaders in the Valley.

"Central government has followed the policy of ‘zero tolerance’ against terrorism and has acted strongly against terrorists. Securities Forces have been given free hand to deal with terrorism," the government had said in March while declaring Yasin Malik's JKLF an 'unlawful association'.
