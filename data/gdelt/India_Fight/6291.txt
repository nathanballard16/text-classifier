Pulwama attack: L.K. Advani”crime against humanity”

New Delhi: BJP veteran L.K. Advani on Friday dubbed the Pulwama terror attack a “crime against humanity” and sought the support of the entire nation for whatever way India decides to respond to the dastardly act.

A day after 45 CRPF troopers were killed in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district, Advani said in a statement: “The barbaric terrorist attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama is an attack on India and a crime against humanity. I join all my countrymen in this time of outrage, condemnation and mourning.”

He said the terrorists and their sponsors should know that India can neither be divided, nor deterred by their evil designs.

“The entire nation should stand united in firm support of whatever way the government of India decides to respond to this attack,” Advani said while conveying his condolences to the families of the martyred CRPF personnel.
