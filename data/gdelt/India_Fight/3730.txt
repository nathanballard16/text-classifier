DNA Edit: Forged by fire – They don’t make leaders like George Fernandes anymore

Long retired from active politics — he had faded into oblivion after the 2009 elections — it’s a wonder that people still remember George Fernandes with such love and reverence. His death on Tuesday opened up a floodgate of emotions as friends and enemies poured their heart out. In his decades-long political career as a fiery socialist, Fernandes had made some powerful enemies — not out of any personal grudge, but because of his unflinching dedication to his political credo. That rare trait made him a worthy adversary, and deserving of respect. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s tweets were especially heart-warming and summed up what Fernandes was all about. “When we think of Mr George Fernandes, we remember most notably the fiery trade union leader who fought for justice, the leader who could humble the mightiest of politicians at the hustings, a visionary railway minister and a great defence minister who made India safe and strong.”

Fernandes, a disciple of Rammanohar Lohia, who began his political life as a trade union leader, shot into national prominence during the anti-Emergency movement. Having lost its moral compass, the Indira Gandhi-led Congress party had become a symbol of State-sponsored oppression. It was young turks like Fernandes who were at the vanguard of resistance, under the guidance of the legendary social activist and freedom fighter Jai Prakash Narayan. But before that, he had showed his potential as a giant slayer when he defeated heavyweight Congress leader SK Patil in the 1967 Lok Sabha polls. He had served as the industries minister, railways minister and in AB Vajpayee’s government, as defence minister. Perhaps the only blot in his illustrious career was the ‘coffin gate’ when he stepped down as the defence minister in 2004. Fernandes belonged to a class and an era which looked at politics from a different perspective.
