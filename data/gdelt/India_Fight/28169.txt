Woman fails to pick up call, hubby stabs her to death

Coimbatore: A 28-year-old man stabbed his 26-year-old wife to death after she didn’t pick up his calls despite several attempts here on Friday.

Police identified the victim as K Nandhini, wife of R Kanagaraj, a labourer from MGR Nagar at Kolathupalayam near Kovaipudur. She was working in a private firm at Arivozhi Nagar near Madukkarai.

Kanagaraj suspected his wife’s character and often fought with her, police said. “He had warned Nandhini against speaking to others over phone for hours. On Friday afternoon, Kanagaraj tried to reach his wife over phone. But it was engaged. Though he called her several times, she refused to pick up the call. After consuming alcohol, Kanagaraj went to his wife’s workplace and stabbed her with a knife. She sustained injuries on her abdomen, throat and right elbow. Though she was rushed to the Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital, she died without responding to the treatment,” a police officer said.

Madukkarai police registered a murder case and detained Kanagaraj.
