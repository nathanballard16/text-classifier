Indian minister says families with more than two children should not be able to vote

An Indian minister has called for families with more than two children to be stripped of voting rights, as a way to combat the country’s burgeoning population.

Expressing his concern over the alarming “population explosion” in India, junior agricultural minister Giriraj Singh suggested that couples with more than two children should be stripped of their electoral franchise.

The minister from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party made his comments on World Population Day in Delhi.

To back up his argument he shared a graphic on Twitter that showed India’s population had grown by a staggering 366 per cent between independence in 1947 and 2019, whereas the United States witnessed a rise of about 113 per cent.

Mr Singh has made controversial remarks in the past about population control, including suggesting some people should be forcibly sterilised.

He said: "Population explosion is disturbing the balance of economy, social harmony and resources in India.”

In what was seen as targeting Muslims and Christians, he added: “Religious obstacles are one of the main reasons for this.”

Mr Singh also warned that India could face “another Partition in the name of culture” unless all political parties joined hands to bring about a strong birth-control law.
