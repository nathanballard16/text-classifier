Madras Trailer Destroyed by Late Night Fire

MADRAS, OR -- A late-night fire at a Madras trailer park caused about $9,000 in damage, but luckily, no injuries. Jefferson County firefighters responded to the Green Spot Mobile Home Park, on South Highway 97, just after midnight Tuesday.

They found a 29-foot travel trailer nearly fully involved under trees and power lines. No one was home and they quickly extinguished the flames. The trailer was a complete loss, but crews kept the fire from spreading.
