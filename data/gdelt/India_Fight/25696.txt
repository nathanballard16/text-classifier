Bhopal: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate for Bhopal Lok Sabha seat, Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur, on Thursday said that Nathuram Godse, the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi, "is, was and will remain a patriot".

She further said that the people who are calling him (Godse) a terrorist should look within themselves and that the public will give them a befitting reply in this election.

“Nathuram Godse deshbhakt the, hai, aur, rahenge...unko atankwadi kehne wale log swayam ke girebaan mei jhaank ke dekhe. Ab ki chunav mei aese logo ko jawab de diya jaega (Nathuram Godse is, was and will remain a patriot..people calling him a terrorist should look within themselves. In this election, such people will receive a befitting reply),” said Pragya Singh Thakur.

Pragya’s comments come after actor-turned-politician Kamal Haasan stirred controversy in the political circles by calling Godse ‘free India’s first terrorist’. The Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) founder had made the remark on Sunday in a rally ahead of the by-elections in Aravakurichi town in Tamil Nadu.

Though Haasan later clarified that he did not use the word ‘terrorist’ while speaking about Godse, the opposition attacked him fiercely.

Slippers were also thrown at the MNM founder at an event on Wednesday evening. The incident took place while the actor-turned-politician was addressing an election meeting in Tamil Nadu’s Madurai. Though none of the slippers hit Haasan, police have detained one person in connection with the incident.

Aravakurichi goes for bypolls on May 19, which is the seventh and the last phase of the Lok Sabha Elections 2019.
