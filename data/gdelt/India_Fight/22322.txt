Akhilesh Yadav, Mayawati, Congress can’t keep India safe: Amit Shah

Ghazipur | Unnao: BJP President Amit Shah on Thursday claimed opposition leaders cannot look after the country’s security.Addressing a rally in Ghazipur constituency of Uttar Pradesh , he alleged BSP supremo Mayawati and her Samajwadi Party and Congress counterparts, Akhilesh Yadav and Rahul Gandhi , respectively, were upset with the Balakot air strikes.“These ‘mahamilavati’ people talk about the country. Akhilesh, Mayawati and Congress cannot keep the country safe,” he said. Shah said the BJP cannot do "ilu-ilu" with terrorists, an apparent reference to the popular short form of 'I love you.'“Though terrorists of Pakistan were killed (in the Balakot air strikes), there was an atmosphere of mourning in the offices of ‘Bua’ (Mayawati), ‘Bhatija’ (Akhilesh) and ‘Rahul baba’,” he said. “I could not find out as to why they were so sad. Why were they moving about with long faces? Were those terrorists their maternal or paternal cousins?” he said. The BJP chief asserted his party cannot play with the security of the country.“If a bullet is fired from there (Pakistan), a bomb will be sent from here (India)... eent ka jawaab patthar se diya jayega (If someone throws bricks, will respond by throwing rocks),” he said. Shah alleged the Congress want to break the nation with the “tukde-tukde” gang. Pointing to the promise of scrapping sedition law in the Congress manifesto, the BJP leader claimed the move is to prevent those raising “anti-national” slogans from going to jails.
