Hyderabad: A leopard struck near Kothapally village for the fifth time in the last six days on Monday night. The leopard has attacked goats in the village, leaving the locals apprehensive about their safety.

Forest officials have set up two cages to catch the leopard. They have also installed camera traps to try and spot the leopard at Kothapally village.

Late on Monday night, the leopard attacked goats in Kothapally tanda that is located 2 km from Kothapally. The residents of the tanda heard some noise at about 10 pm. On Tuesday morning, they say the carcass of a goat and pug marks of the leopard.

Forest officials have now shifted one of the cages to the Kothapally tanda.

Amangal FDO M. Janakiram said, “Usually leopard come to eat their previous kill. As we are taking away the carcass, it is going for a fresh kill. Wild animals are careful about the surroundings. So, it might have noticed the movement of the forest staff at Kothapally and moved to the tanda. We suspect that it is not comfortable hunting in the rocky terrain in the nearby forest.”
