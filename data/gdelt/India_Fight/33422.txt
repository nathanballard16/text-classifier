Ludhiana, July 6

Inmates of Ludhiana Central Jail clashed during dinner time last night during which three prisoners sustained injuries. They were rushed to the civil hospital.

The injured were identified as Sandeep, Karan and Ravi. An FIR has been registered against them and one Kulwinder (who also suffered minor injuries).

Jail Superintendent Shamsher Singh Boparai said the incident took place around 7.45 pm when food was being given to the inmates in barrack number 6. The accused indulged in arguments over taking food prior to others. “These inmates were not in the queue and were competing with each other to have food. The matter took an ugly turn and they attacked each others with utensils,” Boparai added.

The jail was in news last month due to violence following the death of an inmate, Sonu Sood.
