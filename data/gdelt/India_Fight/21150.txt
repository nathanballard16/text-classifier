Fashion Face-Off: Deepika Padukone or Sonam Kapoor, which heroine rocked this all-white look?

Which icon rocked this monochrome look better?

While we do always take inspiration from Bollywood divas for fashion inspiration, it's the monochrome trend that is the hardest to follow. Whether it's Kareena Kapoor's all yellow look or Priyanka Chopra's yellow look, the stunners can slay monochrome like no one else. Giving us a Monochrome 101 lesson, we spotted Deepika Padukone and Sonam Kapoor rock the all-white look like a total pro. Check the two different yet beautiful looks out.

We first spotted Bollywood's Mastani at the launch of her wax statue at Madame Tussauds in London. The stunner opted for a gorgeous ill-fitted white power suit that she teamed with a white cape. With diamond chandeliers, the hottie opted for dewy skin with a brush of dark eyeshadow and oodles of mascara. With on-fleek highlighter and nude, matte lips, DeePee is a sight to behold. With a low messy bun, this is one look we can't wait to replicate.

For a campaign with Chopard Parfums, Sonam opted for a stunning off-shoulder white button-down shirt dress. With a mid-waist belt and an elaborate train, Sonam looks beautiful. The stunner opted for comfy, kitten heels and drop earrings. With a messy bun, she completed her look with soft, dewy skin. With a thin stroke of eyeliner and a brush of mascara, she finished her look with dewy skin and tinted cheeks. With nude lips, it's the thin stroke of shimmery eyeshadow that can add glam to the most boring look.

On the work front, DeePee was in New Delhi shooting for her next release, Chhappak that is being helmed by Meghna Gulzar. With this project being her first film as a producer, DeePee will be essaying the role of an acid-attack survivor, Laxmi Aggarwal. On the other hand, Sonam will next be seen in The Zoya Factor opposite Malayali superstar Dulquer Salmaan.

Stay tuned for all the updates.
