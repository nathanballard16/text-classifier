A man attempted to assault Congress leader and Bengaluru’s Hebbal MLA Byrathi Suresh on Friday near his residence in Byrathi in north Bengaluru. He escaped unhurt.

A case of attempt to murder was registered in the Kothanur police station against the attacker, Shiva. The accused has been taken into custody.

Speaking to TNM, DCP Bengaluru North East Bheemashankar S Guled said, “Around 12:30 pm, a resident of Byrathi village attacked Hebbal MLA Byrathi Suresh with a knife. His gunmen and others nearby managed to overpower the attacker. The MLA is safe without any injury. We have detained the man on charges of attempt to murder at the Kothanur Police Station.

“We are investigating the background of the accused, a resident of the same village. Byrathi Suresh says he had helped build the accused's house so we are now investigating why he took this action,” the DCP told reporters.

Speaking to Public TV, Suresh said, "There was a man who does coolie work in our area who hit our car with his vehicle around 50 metres from our house. He then went around and hit the car again. He later tried to attack with a knife but my gunman and others nearby restrained him and handed him over to the police. I am perfectly safe. I was at some distance from him.”

Suresh said that he knew the attacker as he lived close to his house and said that the man worked as a carpenter. Media reports suggested that there was a political motive behind the attack, but the police refused to comment on the same.

"We have increased security detail on Byrathi Suresh. We are investigating the background of the accused, a resident of the same village,” DCP Bheemashankar added.
