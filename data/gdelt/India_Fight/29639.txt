Flash Briefing: SA manufacturing growth spurt; Cape Town property plunge; Naspers’ big fintech deal; Deloitte, KPMG face national ban

South Africa’s manufacturing sector has perked up, with more cars, electronics, metal products and furniture produced than expected. This is a ray of sunshine, after the economy shrunk by more than 3% in the first three months of this year. Statistics South Africa released details of manufacturing output, which expanded by more than 4.6% year-on-year in April. This is the biggest growth since June 2016, says Reuters.
