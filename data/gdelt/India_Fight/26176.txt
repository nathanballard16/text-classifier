Deepika Padukone has a witty answer to why she doesn't take Ranveer Singh along with her at Cannes

Deepika Padukone was at French Riveria for Cannes 2019 for two days and the actress slayed with her appearances. Her unconventional and captivating red carpet appearances and her looks were a total delight to watch for everyone. People cannot stop gushing over her dresses and how she is open to experiment and try different looks.

Just like Deepika, her husband Ranveer Singh also has a great and unique taste in fashion. Ranveer's sense of fashion is not limited to trends, he adds his own spark and quirkiness with bright colours and funky outfits. The actor always manages to grab attention with his dressing sense at events or promotions. So it makes their fans wonder why DP didn't take Ranveer along with her for Cannes this year.

As reported by Hindustan Times, when Deepika Padukone was asked why doesn't she bring Ranveer Singh along with her for Cannes, she said that he is a better fit at Met Gala as at Cannes, she would top him. When the Tamasha actress was asked about Cannes, she said that you either come here with a film or you slay on the red carpet.

DP returned to India today and she will now be resuming the shoot of Chhapaak. About the same, she said that as Cannes is now done, she is already moving back into her character for the film.

In Chhapaak, Deepika will be seen as an acid attack survivor. The film is a real-life story based on the life of acid attack survivor Laxmi Agarwal.
