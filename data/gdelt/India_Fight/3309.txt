Sharma, Dhawan fire India to 324 for four against New Zealand

MOUNT MAUNGANUI, New Zealand, Jan 26, 2019 (BSS/AFP) – The prolific Rohit

Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan blasted a century opening stand as India posted 324

for four batting first in the second one-day international at Mount Maunganui

on Saturday.

The pair put on 154 for the first wicket and were backed by a rapid 48 off

33 by MS Dhoni to force the innings over the 300 mark.

Virat Kholi (43) and Ambati Rayudu (47) chimed in at a run a ball.

Sharma and Dhawan gave India a flying start in their bid to go 2-0 up in

the series before Dhawan was out for 66 and Sharma went four overs later for

87.

It was their 14th century stand from 93 innings together.

Only the now retired Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly (21 century

stands), Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden (16) and Gordon Greenidge and

Desmond Haynes (15) have produced more hundred-plus partnerships as openers.

New Zealand new-ball bowler Trent Boult spoke before the match of a need

to put pressure on India from the start but his opening delivery, after India

won the toss and chose to bat, was a juicy half volley which Sharma edged

through the vacant first slip for four.

He finished with nine fours and three sixes and brought up his 38th ODI

half-century lofting Lochie Ferguson over the boundary.

Dhawan completed his 27th fifty with a two off Colin de Grandhomme and

celebrated with boundaries off the next two deliveries.

But he was gone soon after when he edged a wide Boult delivery to

wicketkeeper Tom Latham.

Sharma’s was also a soft dismissal when he jabbed a loose Ferguson delivery

to de Grandhomme at square leg.

Following the dismissals of Kohli and Rayudu India were in danger of not

reaching 300 until Dhoni opened up in partnership with Kedar Jadhav.

The pair put on 35 runs in the last two overs.
