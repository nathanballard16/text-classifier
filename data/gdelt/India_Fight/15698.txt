An IED blast targeted a CRPF area domination team in the Aranpur sector of Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada district on Monday afternoon, with Maoists then opening fire on them. In the attack, one CRPF personnel was killed, and six others were injured.

Police said that a team of CRPF 231st battalion, posted in the Aranpur sector, were out for an area domination exercise. While returning at around 4:30 pm, when they were in the jungles between Kondapara and Kamalpost, an IED exploded, followed immediately by a heavy burst of fire.

A senior police official said, “We also retaliated strongly, and though no bodies have been recovered, the Maoists have suffered injuries or casualties too. However, one of our jawans was killed in the firefight, while others also suffered gun shot injuries.”

The personnel killed has been identified as Head Constable Shashi Kant Tiwari from Uttar Pradesh’s Unnao district.

The area where the encounter took place is considered to be highly sensitive, bordering Dantewada and Sukma. It is evidenced by the fact that successive state governments have been attempting to build a road to Jagargunda, less than fifteen kilometres away from Kamalpost, for over three years but have been unsuccessful so far. Only an untarred road exists now at the area till Kondasawli, eight kilometres shy of Jagargunda.
