Five people have been booked for attempt to murder for allegedly beating and threatening to kill a representative of the Unnao rape survivor's uncle, the police said today.

In his complaint, the 'pairokar' (a representative of an accused person) said he was returning home from an Unnao court on Thursday after meeting the assistant of the advocate in the rape case when he was confronted by five people. Later in the night, they beat him up at his house and also threatened to kill him.

Makhi police station incharge Raj Bahadur said an attempt-to-murder case had been lodged on Friday.

Three people -- Balendra Singh, Rohit Singh and Dharmendra Singh -- and two unknown people have been booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, Mr Bahadur said. He did not reveal the name of the complainant citing security reasons.

The 'pairokar' is the representative of the Unnao rape survivor's uncle, against whom around six cases are lodged. He is currently lodged in Tihar Jail in Delhi.

The rape survivor is battling for life at the AIIMS here after a truck rammed into a car in which she was was travelling along with some family members and her lawyer on July 28. Two of her aunts died in the car-truck collision.

The woman was allegedly raped by expelled BJP legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar and three men in two different incidents in 2017 when she was a minor. Kuldeep Sengar is lodged in jail since April last year.
