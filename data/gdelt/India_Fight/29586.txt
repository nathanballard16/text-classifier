Mumbai: The right-wing activist Sharad Kalaskar who was arrested from Mumbai earlier was produced in a Kohlapur court which sent him to police custody until June 18.

A special team of the Maharashtra Police made a breakthrough in the murder case of Communist leader Govind Pansare after Kalaskar’s arrest.

A Special Investigation Team (SIT) of the state Crime Investigation Department (CID) arrested right-wing activist Sharad Kalaskar in connection with murder case earlier.

Kalaskar’s name has figured in many high-profile cases and was arrested by Maharashtra ATS in Palghar arms haul case in August last year.

His statement was recorded in the Pansare murder case with SIT as the witness. The investigative agency named one Sachin Andure as the other shooter in the case.

Kalaskar stayed for a week in Kohlapur prior to Pansare’s murder in the city in 2015. His name also figured in 2015 murder of journalist-activist
