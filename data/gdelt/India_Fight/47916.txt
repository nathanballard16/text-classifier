1990 IAF personnel killing case: JKLF terrorist Javed Mir 'Nalka' arrested, was first to get arms training in PoK

Twenty nine years after four Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel including Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna were killed by Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) terrorists, the banned outfit's member Javed Mir aka Nalka has been arrested for his role in the killings.

Nalka will be produced in court next week. He is believed to be among the first few terrorists to receive arms training in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK).

Earlier this month, the name of IAF officer Ravi Khanna was included on the National War Memorial in Delhi.

On January 25, 1990, four IAF personnel, including Ravi Khanna, were killed in firing by Yasin Malik-led JKLF terrorists.

Two charge sheets were filed by the CBI against Yasin Malik before the designated Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (TADA) court in Jammu on August 31, 1990. However, the TADA court granted a stay on the trial in 1995 because Srinagar, where the incident happened, does not have a designated TADA court.

This, however, changed last month as a TADA court began the trial against Malik. Malik, who is lodged in Delhi's Tihar Jail in a separate case, could not be produced before the court, following which the hearing was adjourned till October 23.

Ravi Khanna's widow Nirmal Khanna who has been waiting for justice for the last 30 years, has expressed hope that she will now get justice as accused are due to face trial soon.

Malik has been arrested in a terror funding case by the National Investigative Agency (NIA) and is currently lodged in Tihar Jail.
