I am alive and well: Masood Azhar writes in Jaish-e-Mohammed mouthpiece

Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar penned an article in terrorist organisation's mouthpiece and said that he is in perfect health. Writing under his pen name 'Sa'adi', Masood Azhar published the write up in 'Al-Qalam', the mouthpiece of Jaish-e-Mohammed.

Rumours had surfaced earlier this month about Masood Azhar's death. The rumours suggested that Masood Azhar's liver and kidneys were not functioning well. Even Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi had made speculations about Masood Azhar's death. The rumours did rounds on social media but no credible confirmation came.

In his article in Al-Qalam Masood Azhar sought to refute the rumours. Azhar glorified the horrific Pulwama terror attack. He said that the February 14 attack on CRPF convoy in Kashmir was an indication that "great work" is being carried out in Kashmir. Naming Adil Ahmed Dar, the Pulwama attacker, Masood Azhar said that "the fire" started by him will not be extinguished soon.

Adil Ahmed Dar had rammed an explosive-laden SUV on a bus. killing 40 CRPF jawans.

The Indian Air Force had carried out air strikes across the LoC as a retaliation of Pulwama terror attack. The airstrike was called on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp located in Pakistan-Occupied-Kashmir.

In his article, Masood Azhar also said that he was pained by the suffering of people in Afghanistan.

India Today could not independently verify whether the article has been written by Masood Azhar himself or it has been published in his name for propaganda purposes.
