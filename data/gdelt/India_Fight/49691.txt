BJP, AAP workers clash in Delhi over construction of ghat for Chhath puja in Kalkaji

NEW DELHI: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) workers on Thursday clashed over an issue of construction of a ghat in the DDA flats area of Delhi's Kalkaji to celebrate the highly auspicious festival of Chhath, which begins on October 31. A large number of police personnel have been deployed in the area to avert the situation.

AAP workers have claimed that a ghat gets constructed at Ambedkar Park in DDA flats area of Kalkaji every year to celebrate Chhath and are demanding that the ghaat should be constructed at the park for this year as well to carry out the festivities.

However, BJP leader and Corporation Councillor Subhash Bhadana has claimed that Chhath pooja is not held at Ambedkar Park, however, at nearby Janamashtami Park and the permission to hold the pooja has been granted for Janamashtami Park only. Bhadana insisted that Ambedkar Park has been developed as a children's park over the year and it has several swings as well. BJP said that the AAP wants to destroy the children's park.
