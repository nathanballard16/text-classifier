Delhi: Father shot son, reveals probe

The father of the 8-year-old boy, who died after being hit with a bullet during a celebratory firing, has been arrested for allegedly killing his son in north east Delhi's Welcome area.

The duo was at a New Year's celebration party when the incident took place. Reportedly, the minor boy, identified as Rehan Usmanpur, had received a bullet injury on his right cheek. The police, at that time, wasn't able to identify the accused and had filed a FIR against unknown persons. However, after further probe, the cops on Saturday, found out that the boy was accidentally shot at by his father, Yasin Malik, who had carelessly aimed the firearm.

During the interrogation, Malik told the police that he had taken the firearm from a Ravi Kashyap, 21, and had fired in air. However, he accidentally pulled the trigger even before he could take an aim and shot his son.

Both accused, Yasin and Kashyap, have been arrested by cops and further investigation is underway.
