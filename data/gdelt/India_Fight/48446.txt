'If Pak doesn't end terror activities against India, Army will go deep inside, destroy terrorist camps'

If Pakistan does not end terror activities directed against India, the Army will go deep inside and destroy terrorist camps, Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik said on Monday.

His remarks came a day after the Indian Army pounded several terror launch pads and Pakistani military position in PoK after "unprovoked firing" by the neighbouring country.

"Pakistan will have to behave and stop these terror camps. If it does not behave, we will go deep inside and destroy these camps," Malik told reporters on the sidelines of a function here.

The governor said India will take stronger action than Sunday's attacks on terror camps in Pakistan if the neighbouring country did not end terror activities directed towards India.
