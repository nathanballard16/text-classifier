UN/New Delhi, September 11

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has appealed to both India and Pakistan to resolve the Kashmir issue through dialogue to avoid any “potential escalation” as the two countries clashed at the UNHRC over New Delhi revoking Jammu and Kashmir’s special status.

At the 42nd session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva on Tuesday, India defended its “sovereign decision” to revoke Jammu and Kashmir’s special status, which Pakistan said was an illegal act

UN Secretary-General’s spokesperson Stephane Dujarric, at a press briefing here, said Guterres had spoken to the leaders of both countries. “Guterres met PM Narendra Modi on the sidelines of the G7 Summit last month in Biarritz, France, and has also spoken to Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi,” Dujarric said. On Monday, Guterres also met Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN Maleeha Lodhi on her request over the Kashmir issue. “His message to all of them has been the same, that he remains very concerned about any potential escalation between India and Pakistan.”
