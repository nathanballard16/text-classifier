'Just the beginning': PM Modi on UN listing Jaish chief Masood Azhar as global terrorist

The prime minister said it's just the begining and there's more to come.

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday said the listing of Masood Azhar as a "global terrorist" by the United Nations is a major breakthrough in India's fight against terrorism and efforts it has been making to uproot the menace. "The UN Security Council has banned Masood Azhar, chief of terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed. It is a matter of satisfaction that the UN has finally agreed to list Azhar as a global terrorist," Modi said while addressing a gathring in Rajasthan's Jaipur. Taking a dig at the previous UPA regime, Modi said: There was a time when the country had a remote control government, in which even the voice of Prime Minister was not heard. Today, the country has witnessed what happened in the UN. How the voice of 130 crore people has been roaring all over the world."
