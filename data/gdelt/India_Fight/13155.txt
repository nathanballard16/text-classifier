Panchkula, March 6

A special court in the city has said it would pronounce its verdict in the 2007 Samjhauta Express blast case on March 11.

A court that hears National Investigation Agency’s cases is currently trying the case.

An explosion in the train that runs between India and Pakistan on February 18, 2007, near Dewana railway station in Panipat killed 68 people, mostly Pakistanis. The NIA said in its chargesheet that the explosion targeted Pakistani Muslims.

The NIA submitted its chargesheet blaming that blast on Hindu leader Swami Aseemanand and four other people on June 20, 2011. The chargesheet claims Aseemanand, Lokesh Sharma, Sunil Joshi, Sandeep Dange and Ramchandra Kalasangra alias Ramji of conspiracy in the case.

Of 290 witnesses, 30 turned hostile.

Aseemanand and Sharma were accused and acquitted in two other blasts cases—the Malegaon blasts of 2006 and the Mecca Masjid blast of 2007.

Sunil Joshi was shot dead in Madhya Pradesh’s Dewas in 2007—while the case was still being investigated. Police are still unable to trace Dange and Kalasangra.
