As Prakash Raj announces candidature, it will be a three corner fight between him, Congress-JDS and BJP

With actor Prakash Raj announcing his candidature for the Lok Sabha polls as an independent candidate from Bangalore central constituency, the buzz is that it'll be a closely monitored fight between Congress-JDS and BJP and Prakash Raj.

Sources said Rizwan Arshad from Congress garnered support from incumbent MLAs and corporators for his candidature during a preliminary meeting of the party.

"Out of 5 incumbent MLAs in Bangalore central, 4 supported Rizwan to be party's candidate. 26 out of 30 including 2 independent corporators stood by Rizwan," a source said.

Incumbent Shivajinagar MLA Roshan Baig's name was the second one to be brought up at the meeting. "Roshan got support of 4 corporators and he nominated himself," the source said.

Sources in the party's high command said Rahul Gandhi has decentralised the working style. He will consider opinions of all stakeholders and go with the majority's opinion.

"I have been working for the party for the last five years. I've worked on where we failed last time. It's hard for BJP to win this time around as there is no development for urban sector. All the slogans haven't worked. There is anti incumbency in the constituency," Rizwan Arshad said.

While BJP is not planning on changing incumbent MP PC Mohan from Bangalore central, BJP insiders said "Two time MP Mohan will put up a tough fight. People will vote for Modi."

Political commentators observe this as an interesting fight in the run up to the elections. With JDS supporting Congress, the three way fight will be a hard fought battle.

Many contenders like BK Hariprasad and Sangliana tried hard but couldn't gain support during the initial meet with the party high command.
