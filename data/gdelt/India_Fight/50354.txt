Kolkata: Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday announced a compensation of Rs 50,000 each to 133 migrant labourers who have been brought back to the state from Kashmir on Monday. Banerjee said that the financial assistance of Rs 50,000 would be provided to all the labourers under 'Samarthan' scheme. It was learnt that the Chief Minister also instructed her government to set up houses for the migrant labourers under 'Banglar Bari' scheme for their rehabilitation.
