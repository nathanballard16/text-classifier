Pak making mistake if it thinks it can destabilise India: PM

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday said the forces behind the terrorist attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir and those responsible for it, will definitely be punished. He also paid tribute to soldiers who lost their lives in Pulwama attack.

Our security forces have been given full freedom. The blood of the people is boiling. We have full faith in their bravery, he said at the inauguration event of Vande Bharat Express (Train-18).

“I thank all the nations who have supported us and condemned this incident in the strongest of terms. A strong reply will be given to this attack.”

If our neighbour which is totally isolated in the world thinks it can destabilise India through its tactics and conspiracies, then it is making a big mistake.

"Understands the sentiments of those criticising us, want to urge them, it is emotional time, stay away from political one-upmanship," he added.
