“I met local MLAs, office bearers of Congress, elected representatives of local bodies, social activists and common people during my visit to Karera. They have brought to my notice to the halt in developmental works in their areas due to discontinuance of many welfare schemes,” the letter written in Hindi said.

Mr Scindia also highlighted miseries of local farmers caused by damage to their standing crops due to heavy rains and floods and said the affected-peasants were yet to receive compensation for their crop loss.
