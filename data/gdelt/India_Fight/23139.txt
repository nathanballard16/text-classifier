Karnataka: In a major crackdown on the rampant determination of sex in the state of Karnataka, the government is now considering the option of conducting sting operations on doctors. The Health Department wishes to conduct the sting operations with the help of media houses.

The sting operations will be an attempt to track radiologists and gynaecologists who are involved in the illegal determination of sex. The initiative intends to use pregnant women as decoy for erring doctors.

While talking to Mirror Now, Dr Prabhakar, Director of State Health and Family Welfare Department urged media houses in the state to help them in the crackdown. Dr Prabhakar stated that in turn for their support, the department will give Rs 50,000 to the media houses for every successful raid.

While the department intends on conducting raids all across the state, the doctors have a contrary opinion. Dr Raviraj, the RMO of Lakeside Medical Centre and Hospital stated that while he welcomed the initiative, he questioned the implementation of the same. He further stated that doctors should be given a set of guidelines so that they can act accordingly.

A similar initiative was started in 2016 where the health department had put out a newspaper advertisement asking women to volunteer for a sting operation. The advertisement tanked as no one volunteered to be a part of the operation.

Sex determination was made illegal in India in 1994. The ban was passed under the Pre-conception and prenatal diagnostic techniques (Prohibition of sex selection) Act.
