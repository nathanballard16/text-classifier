Kolkata: A Trinamool Congress worker was on Tuesday shot dead by miscreants from a point blank range in North Kolkata’s Dum Dum area. The worker of the state’s ruling party has been identified as Nirmal Kundu.

Nirmal Kundu was the president of Ward 6 that falls under the Dum Dum Municipality area. Bike-borne assailants shot at his head from a point blank Range. He was immediately rushed to the nearby hospital where he was declared brought dead.

The TMC has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party was behind the incident. Dum Dum had seen a very close fight in the recently-concluded Lok Sabha elections where TMC candidate Sougata Roy edged past BJP’s Samik Bhattacharya by a faint margin.

Reports had earlier come out of a TMC leader being shot at by miscreants in Nimta, North 24 Parganas. Kundu was rushed to a private hospital with bullet injuries to his head. The area is tensed, according to reports.

The political tussle between the Trinamool Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party had escalated months ahead of the parliamentary elections, with West Bengal Chief Minister and TMC supremo Mamata Banerjee locking horns with then-BJP president and present Union Home Minister Amit Shah over several issues, including infiltration from the Bangladesh border and other communcal issues.
