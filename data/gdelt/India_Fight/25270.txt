Major fire breaks out at glass processing unit in Sardar Estate

VADODARA: A major fire broke out at a glass processing unit located at Sardar Estate on Ajwa Road on Monday morning.According to fire department , fire broke out in the storage area of Super Scientific Works Pvt Ltd around 11 am. The company had stored finished products like glass lab vessels and apparatus in the storage area on the first floor of the shed. The fire spread quickly due to packaging materials lying along with the glass products.“The products were wrapped in papers and dry grass and packed in wooden and cardboard boxes due to which the flames spread quickly across the storage area,” said Panigate fire officer Manish Mod. Since the storage space was spread across a huge area, five fire engines from Panigate, Gajrawadi and GIDC fire stations were pressed in controlling the fire. Mod added that it took around three hours to completely douse the fire. “The company’s processing unit was right under the storage area and there was another godown behind the processing unit which were saved by fire brigade personnel,” he said adding that the fire could have been caused due to welding work that was taking place in a neighbouring unit.Another fire took place in the afternoon at Subway restaurant located on Old Padra Road. Short-circuit in the restaurant’s air-conditioners resulted in fire due to which it was filled with smoke.
