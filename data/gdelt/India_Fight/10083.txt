School punishment leads to firing in Sidhwan Bet

Ludhiana: A teacher reprimanding a student led to violence in Gag Kalan village of Sidhwan Bet on Tuesday. A Moga man was injured as an unidentified man opened fire during a clash between two groups — one supporting the teacher and the other the student.

It all started when the teacher asked the student to leave his classroom a few days ago.

A cop said, “Jasvir Singh, who teaches at Senior Secondary School, Gag Kalan, had scolded the Class XII student and asked him to leave his class. As the matter snowballed into a controversy, the education department sent an official to the school to sort it out.”

On Tuesday, the education department official was holding a meeting with the village panchayat, the student’s family and the school teachers on the campus when the two groups, who were waiting outside, had heated arguments.

“Soon, tempers frayed and the two groups came to blows. Manjeet Singh of Khurshidpoora in Sidhwan Bet was hit on head with a rod. In the melee, a man took out a pistol and fired three to four shots at the gathering. One of the shots hit Daljeet Sigh of Tudyad in Dharmkot, Moga,” the cop added.

As panic spread, the onlookers called up an ambulance and the police. The injured were taken to a Sidhwan Bet hospital. As their condition worsened, doctors referred them to a Ludhiana hospital.

Ludhiana senior superintendent of police Varinder Singh Brar said, “The man who opened fire is yet to be identified. We have registered a cross FIR.”

Sources in police said, “The condition of Daljeet is stated to be serious. Manjeet is out of danger. We have recovered the weapon. It is yet to be ascertained if it is a licensed one.”
