ISB 7th on Forbes' 'Best Business School 2019' list globally

New Delhi, Sep 18 : The Indian School of Business (ISB) which has two campuses in Hyderabad and Mohali has secured seventh position globally in the Forbes' "Best Business Schools 2019" rankings, the ISB said on Wednesday.

The annual Forbes' list ranks the schools solely on their "5-year MBA gain." "We are delighted to be a part of the Forbes Best Business School 2019 rankings, and it is a pleasure to see ISB's Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) gaining more and more recognition globally," Professor Rajendra Srivastava, Dean, ISB, said in a statement.

The ISB participated in Forbes rankings for the first time this year.

The Forbes' rankings represent the net cumulative amount the typical alumni would have earned after five years by getting their MBA versus staying in their pre-MBA career.

This year, Forbes looked at more than 100 schools and surveyed 17,500 alumni regarding their pre- and post-MBA compensation, career choice and location.

"We look forward to working hard and keep moving up the ladder in the right direction with the ISB family together," Professor Srivastava added.

The Post Graduate Programme in Management (PGP) of the ISB is currently ranked 24 worldwide as per the Financial Times' "Global MBA Rankings 2019".
