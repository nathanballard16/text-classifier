Terrorist attacks bring end of innocence for houses of worship

Killinger said they asked Bettendorf Police for more patrols.

Last Sunday, a vigil was held at the Muslim Community of the Quad-Cities, with attendees of all religions condemning hate.

"The Muslim community is such that if one mosque suffers, the whole global community feels their sorrow," Killinger said.

Matlub Ahmad, Islamic Center of Quad-Cities Board of Trustees member, said when they saw the news about the events in Christchurch, the community felt anxiety, vulnerability and concern for safety.

"We felt that it is time we come together as a community and reaffirm our denouncement for terrorism as well as make bonds which already exist and take a new pledge to eliminate such acts, or at least to stand together to express our views."

As part of the interfaith activity in the community, Ahmad says they're already connected with many faith groups. "Our goal remains that we come together and create an action plan," he said, saying they would like to highlight the peaceful nature of Islam in the Quad-Cities.
