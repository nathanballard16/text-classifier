Pankaj Tripathi to play Janhvi Kapoor’s on-screen father in the Gunjan Saxena biopic

Gunjan Saxena biopic: Pankaj to play Janhvi’s father

The supremely talented Pankaj Tripathi has been on a roll lately. Thanks to his endearing performances in films such as Newton, Bareilly Ki Barfi and the last year’s Stree, the National Award-winning actor has grabbed the attention of filmmakers in Bollywood like never before.

Pankaj, these days, is an extremely busy man with his kitty full with work. After bagging an important role in Kabir Khan’s ’83, he has now earned himself a part in the Gunjan Saxena biopic that has Janhvi Kapoor playing the subject. The ace actor is currently in Lucknow for the shooting of the Dharma Productions venture. He will be seen playing Janhvi’s father in the film.

Talking about the film and his role, Pankaj said, “I liked the character very much. I have developed a great bonding with Janhvi while shooting for the film. Janhvi is a very sincere and well-behaved actress. She respects me a lot and I, too, respect her for the sincerity and commitment that she has towards her work.”

“Sharan is a very talented director and is well versed with his craft. It’s an opportunity working under Dharma Productions. They leave no stone unturned to get the right things on board,” he added.

Pankaj will shoot with Janhvi until the first week of March.

Gunjan Saxena, the first woman Indian Air Force combat pilot, played an important role during the Kargil War in 1999. For her daredevilry, she was conferred the Shaurya Chakra by the Government of India.

The yet-untitled film is being directed by Sharan Sharma.
