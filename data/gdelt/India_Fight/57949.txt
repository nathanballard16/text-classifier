The petition said that even though the forensic report states that semen from two persons were detected on the victim, the police had arrested only one person.On Friday when the case came for hearing, the state government appointed special public prosecutor U Sankaranarayanan argued that the case should be considered as a rarest of rare case and capital punishment should be given to the accused.The defence council, S Kingsley , an advocate from legal aid argued that capital punishment should be given only when the offense was proved without reasonable doubts. “In this case, as the involvement of another person is evident in the experts’ opinion, it would not fit into the rarest of rare cases. If any capital punishment is imposed, then it would be a police trail and not a judicial trail,” he added.The judge also ordered an enquiry into the petitioned filed by the victim's mother.
