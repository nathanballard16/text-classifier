Meanwhile, Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) president and Delhi MLA Manjinder Singh Sirsa also visited Badsui. Villagers demanded a probe into Saini's role in creating tension in the village. They alleged that two attackers from the village have not been arrested, and the names were noted by Sirsa.Talking to TOI, Sirsa called the incident "unfortunate" and said the MP's role should be probed. "While not even a single penny from MPLAD funds has been allocated from the entire area of Gulha and Cheeka, the MP gave Rs 5 lakh for the development of a piece of land that was disputed," he said.
