Love Island final RECAP: Results from the villa as Amber Gill is Geordie winner

It has been a huge part of our lives for the past eight weeks but Love Island is now over for another year!!!

There's been ups and downs in the 2019 series of the popular ITV2 show, with new couplings, shock dumpings and hilarious challenges.

Last night's episode saw five couples become four as original 2019 cast member Anton was eliminated with his partner Belle at the final hurdle after being one of the couples voted the least compatible by their fellow Islanders.

Only four couples remained on Monday night: Curtis and Maura, Greg and Amber, Ovie and India, and Tommy and Molly-Mae.

Amber - the only original islander remaining - is of course a Geordie so threw our support behind her, as did a number of places in Newcastle.

Here is a RECAP of the live final and reaction to the result
