New Delhi: A woman, who identified herself as Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s niece was mugged by two bike-borne miscreants in North Delhi’s Civil Lines area on Saturday morning.

As per reports, Damyanti Ben Modi was travelling in an auto when two men snatched her handbag that had Rs 56,000 cash, mobile phone and some important documents. The incident took place at around 7 am when she was on her way to Samaj Bhavan in Civil Lines.

The incident comes amid a rise in incidents of snatching in the national capital in recent days. Last month, Asian News International (ANI) journalist Joymala Bagchi was attacked by bike-borne assailants who tried to snatch her phone.

The woman had lodged a complaint at the Civil Lines Police Station following which the police filed an FIR and initiated an investigation.

The police said that they were scanning CCTV footage of the area to nab the miscreants who fled the scene after snatching Damyanti’s bag.
