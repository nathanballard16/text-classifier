Sonsodo fire: Goa govt consults Maharashtra fire official

The Goa government has consulted director of Maharashtra Fire Services Prabhat Rahangdale for bringing the fire at Sonsodo garbage dump in South Goa district under control, it said Friday.

Rahangdale, who had experience of dealing with a similar fire at Deonar garbage dump in Mumbai, recommended that a similar course of action be adopted, Deputy Chief Minister Vijai Sardesai said here.

Fire started at Sonsodo garbage dump near Margao, the oldest garbage dump in the state, four days ago.

Chief Minister Pramod Sawant and Sardesai reviewed the situation at a meeting at the CM's residence Friday. It was also attended by former chief minister Digambar Kamat and Congress MLA Aleixo Reginaldo Lourenco.

Air pollution levels have shot up around Margao because of the fire. The Congress has warned of an agitation if the fire is not doused at the earliest.

Though the flames have been largely put out, the dump is still smouldering.

"My office contacted Rahangdale who has experience of dousing a (similar) fire at Deonar. He visited Sonsodo," Sardesai told reporters after the meeting.

Rahangdale recommended that Goa government take similar steps (as taken at Deonar), he said.

The dousing operation will be supervised by the district collector while the Public Works Department will assist the authorities, Sardesai said.

The fire is smouldering in the middle of the dump which is inaccessible (for fire-fighting vehicles), he said.

Water and debris will be used for dousing, he said, expressing confidence that the fire will be brought under control completely in the next three to four days.
