Man injured in spat with colleague

Ludhiana: Panic gripped Basant Avenue on Thursday night, when a rumour was spread that a group of miscreants had opened fire in the air. However, later the police identified that the weapon used by the accused was a blank gun, which is basically used to start a field race.

The police on Friday received a complaint from Gurwinder Singh (32) of Basant Avenue, who works with a production house. He alleged that he had a monetary dispute with his colleague, JC Saini, following which they both met at the Basant Avenue market, where the latter had come with some accomplices. Following a verbal spat there, one of the accomplices opened fired in the air. Gurwinder sustained a minor injury on his lower lip, after which he went to Civil Hospital for medical examination, and later lodged a complaint with Dugri police.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-2) Jaskiranjit Singh said during initial inquiry, the police identified that the weapon used was a blank firing firearm, also called a starting gun, used in film shootings and for races. It only contains gunpowder and creates a bullet sound, but does not harm.

The ADCP added: “It has been identified that broken glass pieces had caused injury on Gurwinder’s lower lip, as the miscreants had also smashed soda bottles on the spot. The police registered a case on Gurwinder’s complaint against Saini and his unidentified accomplices under Section 336 (act endangering the life or personal safety of others) of the IPC. Further investigation is on.”
