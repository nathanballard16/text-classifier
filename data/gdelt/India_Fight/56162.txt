Rasika Dugal wraps shoot of Mira Nair's 'Suitable Boy'

Actor Rasika Dugal has wrapped shooting for Mira Nair's "A Suitable Boy."



Rasika started filming for the project in September and finally concluded it on December 12 in Maheshwar.

"I have always been an ardent follower of Mira's work. I am always amazed by how she can rework a seemingly ordinary scene and infuse it with so much fun. It has been an incredible experience shooting with a bunch of very talented actors coming together to make a very interesting and warm ensemble and a delight to work with an extremely skilled crew. This one was a unique journey and one to remember," Rasika said in a statement here.

"A Suitable Boy" is the screen adaptation of Vikram Seth's popular novel by the same name. Set around the post-independence period, the six-part series focusses on four families in the fictional town of Brahmapur, located between Varanasi and Patna.

A BBC One adaptation, the series also features Tabu, Ishaan Khatter, debutante Tanya Maniktala and Vijay Varma.

Rasika will next be seen in "Lootcase", which will hit the theatres on April 10, next year.
