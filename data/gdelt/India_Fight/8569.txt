Indian Beggar's $9,300 Wealth Gifted to Families of Victims in India - Reports

The trustees of the temple took a decision to donate Nandini's savings to the families of Indian victims through the Chief Minister's Relief Fund.

"The elderly woman named Nandini Sharma used to beg outside the temple and her life savings were deposited through us in a bank. She had passed away six months back and she wished that her savings should be used for a good cause. Hence we have donated it to CM relief fund for CRPF soldiers who died in the terror attack", said a temple trustee Sandeep Gaur.

The trustees handed over the cheque to Ajmer district collector Vishwa Mohan Sharma earlier this week.
