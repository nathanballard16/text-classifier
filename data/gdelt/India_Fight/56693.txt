Fire breaks out at house near Aarti Chowk, none hurt

Ludhiana: A fire was reported in a house near Aarti Chowk on Thursday in which household goods were completely gutted. A family of four was living in a small room constructed at the backyard of a house where the incident took place. Before the arrival of the fire brigade, the neighbours reached the site and controlled the fire with the help of buckets. The neighbours informed the fire brigade about the incident.

Rickshaw puller Dhani Ram was living in that room on rent with his wife and two daughters. On Thursday, both children had gone to school, while Dhani Ram and his wife Meena were also away for their work. At around 12noon, neighbours witnessed black smoke and flames coming out of that room. The neighbours raised an alarm, and also informed the fire brigade and police about the incident. They rushed to control the fire, and after dousing the flames, neighbours were also helping them find if anything was left there.

Fire officials claimed that before they could reach the spot, nearby people had controlled the situation, and they went back after checking things. They claimed that short circuit might be the reason for the fire. Meanwhile, Dhani Ram said, “All the belongings, furniture, clothes, some cash, and gold were burnt in the incident. I am not aware of the reason behind the fire, as I was out for my work, and my neighbours had called me up.” He said luckily nobody was at home, otherwise it could have resulted in a major incident.
