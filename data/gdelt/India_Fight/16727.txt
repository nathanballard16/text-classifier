Pulwama attack meant for political gains, says Vaiko

Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) general secretary Vaiko on Sunday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) used the terrorist attack in Pulwama in Jammu and Kashmir, in which 40 soldiers were killed, for political gains.

Stressing he had extremely high regards for the armed forces and the sacrifice of the martyred soldiers, Mr. Vaiko, who was addressing an election rally here, argued that the electoral fortunes of the BJP, which was on a downward spiral, went up after the Pulwama attack.

Highlighting that BJP leader and former Chief Minister of Karnataka B.S. Yeddyurappa issued a statement that the attack will help the party in winning more seats in the Lok Sabha elections, Mr. Vaiko questioned if it was the view of just Mr. Yeddyurappa or that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well.

He said that the BJP had no rights to project itself as the champion of national security since it compromised on the capability of Indian Air Force by awarding the contract to businessman Anil Ambani’s company that had zero experience in aviation sector.

Thoothukudi issue

He blamed the Union government for betraying Tamil Nadu on all aspects. Terming the killing of 13 anti-Sterlite protesters in police firing in Thoothukudi last May as a massacre, he urged the people to vote against the BJP-led government at the Centre and the AIADMK government in the State to ensure justice for the victims. “I am blaming the AIADMK government and the BJP, which is close to Vedantha that runs Sterlite Copper, for committing murder,” he said.

He lauded Su. Venkatesan, writer from Communist Party of India (Marxist), who is contesting in Madurai constituency as the candidate of the DMK-led Secular Progressive Alliance. Stating that the writer will be a voice of Tamil Nadu in the parliament if he gets elected, he appealed to the voters to elect him.
