16, including 15 QRT commandos killed in IED blast triggered by Naxals in Maharashtra

Mumbai: At least 16 persons, including 15 security personnel, were killed in an IED blast triggered by Naxals in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district Wednesday, police said.

The blast followed Naxals torching 25 vehicles belonging to a road construction contractor earlier in the day, police informed.

Those killed were commandos of the Quick Response Team (QRT) of Gadchiroli police station, which was on way to inspect the torched vehicles, an official said. The blast took place as the vehicle reached Lendhari nallah in Kurkheda area, the official said. Police teams are reaching the spot for evacuation operation, he said.

Sources said that the Naxals had probably laid the trap knowing that security forces would arrive in the area to investigate after the vehicles were torched in the morning. Accordingly the explosive had been placed on the route.

Meanwhile Home Minister Rajnath Singh assured all help to the Maharashtra government in the wake of a Naxal attack. He termed the attack an act of cowardice and desperation. The home minister also spoke to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who briefed him about the incident.

“Attack on Maharashtra Police personnel in Gadchiroli is an act of cowardice and desperation. We are providing all assistance needed by the state government. The Home Ministry is in constant touch with the state administration,” Singh said in a statement.

The Home Minister said the country was extremely proud of the valour of police personnel and their supreme sacrifice while serving the nation will not go in vain.

“I have spoken to the Maharashtra Chief Minister regarding the tragic incident in Gadchiroli and expressed my grief at the loss of brave police personnel,” said Singh.
