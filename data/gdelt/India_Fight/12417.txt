Indian army can last only ten days if war breaks out: NYT

Indian army can last only ten days if war breaks out, reports NYT.

(Web Desk) – India’s military strength got exposed once again when the New York Times reported that its forces cannot last for more than ten days in case of intense warfare.

NYT revealed that Indian armed forces are in alarming shape at the moment, and if intense warfare breaks out tomorrow, India can supply ammunition to its troops for only ten days.

It has been told that 68 percent of the army’s equipment is so old, it is officially considered “vintage.”

“Our troops lack modern equipment, but they have to conduct 21st-century military operations,” said Gaurav Gogoi, Indian lawmaker and member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Defense.

The New York Times reported that the United States banks on Indian military to help keep an expanding China in check, and it was an inauspicious moment when an Indian Air Force pilot ended up as a prisoner of Pakistan after losing a dogfight with a warplane of the Pakistan Air Force (PAF).

“The pilot made it home in one piece, however bruised and shaken, but the plane, an aging Soviet-era MiG-21, was less lucky.”

“The aerial clash, the first by the South Asian rivals in nearly five decades, was a rare test for the Indian military — and it left observers a bit dumbfounded. While the challenges faced by the India’s armed forces are no secret, its loss of a plane last week to a country whose military is about half the size and receives a quarter of the funding was still telling.”
