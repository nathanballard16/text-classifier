Trump hints at 'reasonably attractive news' from India and Pakistan

President Trump Donald TrumpDeputy AG: DOJ investigating fake Trump electors Former Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz elected to Baseball Hall of Fame Overnight Health Care — Senators unveil pandemic prep overhaul MORE said Thursday that he had "reasonably attractive news" regarding tensions between Pakistan and India, which have exchanged airstrikes this week.

“We’ve been involved in trying to have them stop,” Trump said at a news conference in Vietnam, according to The Washington Post.

“We’ve been in the middle trying to help them both out, see if we can get some organization and peace, and I think probably that’s going to be happening,” he said.

Trump was in Hanoi, Vietnam, for a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, which ended early Thursday without an agreement between the two nations.

Hours after Trump's comments, Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said his country planned to release an Indian pilot it captured Wednesday, according to media reports.

“In our desire of peace, I announce that tomorrow, and as a first step to open negotiations, Pakistan will be releasing the Indian Air Force officer in our custody,” Khan said, according to The New York Times.

Tensions between India and Pakistan have risen since Tuesday, when India ordered an airstrike over the disputed Kashmir region. That was in response to a car combing earlier this month that killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police in Kashmir.

On Wednesday, Pakistan and India each said they had shot down each other's warplanes and Pakistan captured the Indian pilot.

In addition to the U.S., China, Britain and a number of other countries have urged India and Pakistan in recent days to ease tensions, according to the Times.
