'Modi is a terrorist': Kashmiris protest in front of UN headquarters

A group of Kashmiris led by Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider staged a protest in front of the United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York on Sunday.The demonstrators waved Kashmiri flags as they raised anti-India slogans and placards with inscriptions such as "Modi - the face of Indian terrorism".In an address to the gathering, AJK PM Haider called on the UN to play its due role to restore normalcy in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK).“The UN Security Council must ensure the implementation of its own resolutions and protect Kashmiris from India's plans of genocide,” he said.“India is committing crimes against humanity in occupied Kashmir. It is planning a genocide while making sure the world remains blind to the plight of millions of Kashmiris."The AJK premier said India was also killing innocent Kashmiris along the Line of Control (LoC) and was actively trying to hide its human rights abuses from the world.He warned New Delhi to stay clear of AJK and said any sort of attack on the Pakistani side of Kashmir would lead to full-scale war.Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States Dr Asad Majeed Khan has said the conditions created by India's brutal actions in Occupied Kashmir pose a major threat to peace and stability in the region and the world.Speaking at the Pakistan Independence Day Festival in Virginia on Saturday, Ambassador Khan said Pakistan was gravely concerned over the humanitarian crisis created by India in the occupied valley.He said the issue had already been raised at the UN Security Council and the world was closely observing New Delhi's actions in Occupied Kashmir.Khan said the chairman of the US House Intelligence Committee had also raised concerns over India's actions, while US President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to mediate on the matter.The ambassador said global efforts were essential to pressure India to stop its brutalities in IOK as the situation could otherwise spiral out of control.Last week, UN human rights experts on called on India to lift the lockdown and communication blockade it had imposed on Occupied Kashmir as a global advocacy group focusing on genocide issued an alert for the disputed region.In a strongly-worded statement released by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the experts urged India to end what it termed a form of ‘collective punishment’ on Kashmiris.“The shutdown of the internet and telecommunication networks, without justification from the government [of India], are inconsistent with the fundamental norms of necessity and proportionality,” the statement quoted the experts as saying.“The blackout is a form of collective punishment of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, without even a pretext of a precipitating offence.”
