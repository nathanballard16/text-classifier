Long time, no see, Anjali!

Telugu and Tamil cinema actress Anjali is currently shooting in Visakhapatnam for a Telugu film. According to a source, Balaji is directing the movie, and an upcoming actor, Adith Arun, is going to play the male lead opposite Anjali in this

film.

“The unit has been in Vishakhapatnam for the past few days. They’ve already shot a few key scenes there,” reports a source. This film could be the sequel to Anjali’s earlier film Geethanjali, added the source.” But who knows? The makers have also roped in the versatile character artiste, Brahmaji, for a key role.

“Perhaps Brahmaji will be playing a cameo in this film. He did participate in its shooting in Vizag for two days,” added the source.

Anjali

Anjali’s last Telugu film, Chitrangadha (directed by Ashok) released a couple of years ago, after which she got busy with her subsequent Tamil projects. We await Anjali’s performance in this breezy entertainer.
