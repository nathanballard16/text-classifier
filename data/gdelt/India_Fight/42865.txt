One of the most awaited Japanese brand Uniqlo finally comes to India. Besides Japan, they have more than 2,000 stores in 22 markets, including in markets such as the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Russia and China. They will be launching three separate stores in India; one of their stores in Ambience Mall (Gurugram) will be spread over 35,000 sq ft. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said that the 30 per cent local sourcing norms in single-brand retail would be relaxed as she sought to make India an attractive destination for foreign players. Retail industry sources had said Uniqlo would be among the first to launch outlets this year in a bid to capitalise on the environment. Tadashi Yanai, Uniqlo founder and chairman, said the three stores would be located in the Delhi-NCR region and the first outlet would open its doors to consumers in October. “The opening of our first store in Ambience Mall, Vasant Kunj, followed by a second and third store in DLF, Saket, and DLF Cyberhub, Gurugram, represents a significant step in our company’s global strategy. We will offer affordable apparel wear, targeting men, women and kids,” he said. Uniqlo has already begun hiring staff for its first store in Delhi and is also in the process of putting its backend in place. The company may also push its presence into other cities once the Delhi store launches happen, persons in the know said. Hennes & Mauritz (H&M) is their competitor globally and now also includes India. Uniqlo is the world’s third-largest fashion retailer after Spain’s Inditex, which owns Zara and Sweden’s H&M.
