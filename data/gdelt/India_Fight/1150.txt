Gujarat: SIT to probe former MLA Jayanti Bhanushali murder case, kin blames political rival

Hours after the shocking killing of BJP leader and former MLA Jayanti Bhanushali, the police announced that a Special Investigation Team (SIT) would probe the case.

Bhanushali was killed in cold blood by unidentified assailants while he was travelling in the Sayaji Nagari Express from Bhuj to Ahmedabad last night.

Gautam Parmar, DIG of Railways, will head the seven-member SIT, which will also comprise officials from the Railway Police, CID, and Ahmedabad Crime Branch.

DGP Ashish Bhatia said Bhanushali was shot at twice from a close range.

“Forensic experts have recovered two empty bullet cases and three live 7.65 mm calibre cartridges. It shows the bullets were fired at close range from a country-made pistol,” said Bhatia.

While searching the compartment of the train in which Bhanushali was shot dead, police recovered his licensed revolver and three live cartridges.

At the time of the incident, there were three other passengers in the compartment, of whom one was in the same couple as Bhanushali. The co-passenger, identified as Pavan Moriya, told police that he had gone to the toilet when the former MLA was killed, and found him lying in a pool of blood on his return to the couple a few minutes later.

“No one saw the assailants,” said Bhatia.

While police were tight-lipped about the potential motive of the gruesome murder, his family put Bhanushali’s political rival Chhabil Patel in the dock.

“When Patel lost in the last Assembly elections, he circulated a video in which he can be heard saying that he will shoot his political rivals. Patel is behind the murder of my brother,” Bhanushali’s brother Shambhu alleged.
