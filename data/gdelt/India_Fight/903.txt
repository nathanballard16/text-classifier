NEW DELHI, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- Five members of a dance troupe were killed and one critically injured early Monday when a vehicle carrying them rammed into a stationary truck amid dense fog in eastern Indian state of Odisha, police said.

The accident took place near Aaanlabanka Chowk in Kendrapara district, about 115 km northeast of Bhubaneswar, the capital city of Odisha.

The victims were members of a dance troupe who were on the way to adjacent Jajpur district.

Officials said the impact of the accident was so severe that the front portion of the vehicle was completely mangled.

"We had to cut the metal parts of the vehicle to take out the bodies," a police officer said.
