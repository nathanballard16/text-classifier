Congress, Shiv Sena Question Centre Over European Union Delegation's Visit To Jammu And Kashmir

On Tuesday, Congress leader and Rajya Sabha member Ghulam Nabi Azad also slammed the government for allowing EU parliamentarians to visit Jammu and Kashmir, but not the country's opposition leaders.

A political slugfest has started over the visit of European Union Parliament Delegation to Jammu and Kashmir as the Congress and BJP's ally in Maharashtra Shiv Sena launched attacks on the BJP-led Central government. Sena raised questions over the international delegation's Kashmir visit and has attacked the Centre asking if the situation is normal in Kashmir then what is the reason behind EU delegation visit? “If the Centre has an objection to UN interference, then how is the presence of EU delegation in Kashmir acceptable to it? Is their inspection, not an external attack?” the party questioned in its mouthpiece Saamna.
