On July 16, twelve people were killed when a four-storey building collapsed in Dongri area of Mumbai. The accident site being located inside a narrow lane caused difficulty for the rescue teams. The officials carrying out rescue operations had to remove debris by bare hands. The accident had brought to light the state of infrastructure across the state. The building in Dongri was over 100 years old. As many as 499 buildings in Mumbai have been identified as similarly vulnerable. In September 2017, 33 people had died when seven-storey Husaini building collapsed in Bhendi Bazar area, which is close to the building that collapsed in Dongri. Underworld don Dawood Ibrahim once owned properties in Bhendi Bazaar.
