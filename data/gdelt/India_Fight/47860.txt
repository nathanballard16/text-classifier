Actors develop a great rapport with each other while working together. While fans of Sara Ali Khan and Kartik Aaryan cannot wait to see the young couple together on screen in Imtiaz Ali’s Aaj Kal, we have some bad news. Even though the release of the movie is far, often Sara and Kartik were seen hanging out with each other. This led to speculations about them dating. The fuel to the fire was added by Sara’s frequent trips to Lucknow during Kartik’s shoot of Pati Patni Aur Woh. Now, it seems that Sara and Kartik have decided to go their separate ways due to professional reasons.
