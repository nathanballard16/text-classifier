NEW DELHI, Feb. 5 (Xinhua) -- Two border guards of India's Border Security Force (BSF) were wounded Tuesday after their fellow colleague using his service rifle fired upon them in western Indian state of Rajasthan, police said.

The incident took place at an outpost in Serwa village of Barmer district, about 630 km west of Jaipur, the capital city of Rajasthan.

"A BSF constable fired upon his two colleagues using service rifle and wounded them," a police official said. "The investigations revealed that he took the extreme step following an argument after getting annoyed with one of his superiors."

The wounded BSF men were removed to hospital and the erring border guard was immediately arrested.

Authorities have ordered an inquiry into the incident.
