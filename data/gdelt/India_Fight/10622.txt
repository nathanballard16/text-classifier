Pakistan, dangerous for the entire world: Shiv Sena

A day after Indian fighter jets bombed the biggest camp of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) in Pakistan, the Shiv Sena on Wednesday demanded continuous operations, dubbing the neighbouring country “dangerous” for the entire world.

The Sena, in an editorial in party mouthpiece ‘ Saamana ’, said:

“There cannot be world peace until Pakistan is eliminated from the global map. Countries like Pakistan are dangerous not only for India, but for the entire world. There is no democracy in Pakistan, so their army chief misuses power in the name of Prime Minister and the government.”

In a pinpointed and swift air strike, India pounded Jaish-e-Mohammed’s biggest training camp in Pakistan early on Tuesday, killing up to 350 terrorists and trainers who were moved there for their protection after the Pulwama attack, said officials.

It said the way the US gunned down al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden on Pakistan’s soil; JeM chief Masood Azhar needs to be eliminated in the same way to avenge the killing of 40 CRPF jawans.

Recalling that former prime minister Indira Gandhi had showed the Indian Army’s might in 1971 by dividing Pakistan into two, the Sena expressed hope that a similar operation would be conducted against the neighbouring country under Narendra Modi’s rule.
