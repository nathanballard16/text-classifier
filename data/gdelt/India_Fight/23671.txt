NIA summons Geelani’s grandson to Delhi for questioning - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

SRINAGAR: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday summoned the grandson of hardline Hurriyat Conference chairman Syed Ali Geelani to New Delhi for questioning in a terror funding case.

Official sources said that the national probe agency has issued a notice to Anees-ul-Islam, directing him to appear before NIA at its headquarters in New Delhi on May 6, 2019.

Anees is the son of Altaf Ahmad Shah, who is currently lodged at Tihar jail in New Delhi, in an alleged funding case.

The NIA last month questioned moderate Hurriyat Conference chairman Mirwaiz Molvi Omar Farooq, Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation (KTMF) president Mohammad Yasin and Geelani’s elder son Dr Naeem Geelani at its New Delhi headquarters in the funding case.

The NIA and Enforcement Directorate have already arrested about two dozen separatists and businessmen and lodged them in Delhi’s Tihar jail, for their involvement in alleged terror funding.

They included Democratic Freedom Party (DFP) chief Shabir Ahmad Shah and Spokespersons of both the factions of the HC- Aiyaz Akbar, Advocate Shahidul Islam and Naeem Khan.

The list further included sons of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK)-based Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) Syed Salahuuddin, apart from son and son-in-law of Geelani.

The security forces, during raids after Pulwama attack, had arrested about 200 leaders of HC, Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and Jamait-ul-Ahalhadees (JuA) from different parts of the valley.
