Height of delusion: Pakistan wants Nobel Peace Prize for PM Imran Khan, Indian Twitter erupts in laughter

In what can only be called the height of delusion, a minister in Pakistan has called for Prime Minister Imran Khan to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for "de-escalating tensions" between India and Pakistan even as Islamabad is yet to take any action against Jaish-e-Mohammed, terror group responsible for Pulwama attack which triggered the tension in the first place.

A motion was submitted on Saturday in the National Assembly Secretariat of Pakistan calling for Imran Khan to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. The motion was submitted by Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry, Geo News reported. This comes a day after Pakistan returned Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman in what it claimed was a "peace gesture".

While Pakistan tried to score brownie points by this so-called "peace gesture" by Imran Khan, the Pakistan government is yet to take any action against Jaish-e-Mohammad which has claimed the terrorist attack in Pulwama district of Jammu and Kashmir on February 14. Forty CRPF personnel were killed in the attack by a suicide bomber of the group headed by Masood Azhar.
