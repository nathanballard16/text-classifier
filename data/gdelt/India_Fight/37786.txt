Let's get PoK next: Sena, BJD's wish-list for Shah-Modi after Section 370 consigned to history

Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Monday said that the Central government will also reclaim Balochistan and Pakistan occupied Kashmir (PoK) the way it has done in Jammu and Kashmir by scrapping Article 370.

A similar sentiment was expressed by BJD Rajya Sabha MP Prasanna Acharya who hoped that one day the entire Pok would return to India.

"Today, we have reclaimed Jammu and Kashmir. Tomorrow, we will take Baluchistan, PoK and I have trust that this government will fulfil the dream of undivided India," said in the Rajya Sabha.

Shiv Sena is one of BJP's key allies at the Centre and has cosied up with BJP once again from before the Lok Sabha elections.



The people of Balochistan are fighting a decades-long war over their rights with Pakistan, but are being labelled as traitors and extremists.
