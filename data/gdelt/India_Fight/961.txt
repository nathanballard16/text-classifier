VARANASI: Students and teachers of Dr Akhtar Hasan Rizvi Shia Degree College in Jaunpur on Monday carried out a signature campaign in support of vice-chancellor of Veer Bahadur Singh Purvanchal University who recently kicked up a storm by allegedly calling upon the students “not to hesitate in murdering someone who indulges in a fight”. The college comes under the jurisdiction of the university.Defending Professor Raja Ram Yadav , the students said his intention was not wrong as “he was encouraging the students to fight for a just cause”. “The meaning and essence of his remarks could be understood by viewing the entire video clipping,” they said and condemned those who were criticising the VC for his statement.Principal of Shia degree college Dr Sadiq Rizvi said: “The students today organised a signature campaign on the campus. The V-C has said nothing of the sort for which he is being criticised,” he said.In a video clipping that went viral on social media recently, the VC could be seen calling upon the students not to hesitate in murdering someone who indulged in a fight with them.“Agar aap Purvanchal Vishwavidyalaya ke chhatra ho to rote huye kabhi mere paas mat aana. Agar kisi se jhagda ho jaye to uski pitayee karke aana, agar tumhara bas chale to uska murder karke aana, baad mein hum dekh lenge (If you are a student of Purvanchal University, never come to me crying. If you get into a fight with someone, beat him, even kill him if you can, and then come, we will handle the matter),” Yadav could be heard saying in the clipping.He was speeking at a function held in Satyadev College in Ghazipur district.
