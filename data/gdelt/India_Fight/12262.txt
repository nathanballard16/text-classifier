One Rank One Pension: Retired personnel protest for justice in Delhi

Hundreds of retired paramilitary personnel from across the country on Sunday held a protest at Delhi's Jantar Mantar to press for their demands, one of which is One Rank One Pension (OROP) for all servicemen that will provide the same pension for the same rank, for the same length of service, irrespective of the date of retirement.

The protest comes just weeks after 40 CRPF troopers were killed in a suicide attack on a convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14. "If an Army man dies, his family gets his salary till the time he would have ideally served and his full pension also after that. But the family of a CRPF soldier who loses his life doesn't get that. Paramilitary forces are dying everyday, but our men are always given stepchildren-like treatment", 65-year-old Mohammad Sher of Jammu and Kashmir's Poonch, who served as a constable in the CRPF for 26 years, told India Today TV.

"We should also get martyr status. That's the least PM can do for us," he added. Earlier on Sunday, a CRPF soldier died due to injuries that he suffered in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir's Kupwara.
