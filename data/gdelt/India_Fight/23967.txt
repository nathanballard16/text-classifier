155 conches seized from stalls on Chennai's Marina Beach

CHENNAI: A day after the wildlife officials seized corals from a few private aquarium units in Kolathur, police along with the wild life officials on Friday raided makeshift shops on the Marina Beach, and seized conches, which are banned for sale under the Wild Life Protection Act. There are a few species that are not banned.Police who raided the stalls arrested S Amjad Khan, 39, of Old Washermenpet, P Durariraj, 41, of Medavakkam and V Manoch, 20, a native of Odisha. Police personnel have launched a hunt for the shop owner R Rajasekar, 35.Police seized at least eight horned helmet ( Cassis cornuta ), 136 spider conches (Lambis) and 11 queen conches (Lobatus gigas) from a few shops. The seized items were handed over to the wildlife officials. They also handed over the arrested suspects to the wildlife officials who booked them under the appropriate provisions.Former Zoological Survey of India director K Venkataraman said across the world 80,000 to 1 lakh species of mollusca are found. “In India 3,670 species are found in the marine ecosystems. Oysters, mussels, clams, pearl oysters and chank, used for religious puposes, are the important molluscs exploited for centuries,” he said.Commercial exploitation of mollusca accounts for the greater reduction of their population from the marine ecosystem. Pollution and habitat destruction also cause their depletion in the wild, he said. The species is found in Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep . Population status of many of these protected species is unknown. Due to this the International Union for Conservation of Natural Flora and Fauna’s red list had categorized them as ‘ data deficient ’, he added.
