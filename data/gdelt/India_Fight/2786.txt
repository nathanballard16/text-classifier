EVM hacking: Hyderabad police officer rejects ‘cyber expert’ Syed Shuja’s claims

Communal clashes not linked to hacking of EVMs, says Hyderabad police officer.

The Hyderabad police on Tuesday refuted the claims made by self-styled cyber expert Syed Shuja.

Mr. Shuja had linked the hacking of EVMs with the communal clashes reported in May of 2014 in Kishanbagh of Rajendranagar abutting Hyderabad's Old City.

‘No records’

The police said they did not find any basis for such claims in police records. “Yes. There were clashes between groups of Sikhs and Muslims in Kishanbagh in May 2014 but the main reason and trigger point were completely different from what the so-called expert claimed,” police officer Kushalkar told The Hindu over phone.

He was Inspector of Rajendranagar police station in Cyberabad Commissionerate and Investigating Officer of the violence-related cases.

Presently, he is working as Assistant Commissioner of Police in Hyderabad.

The religious flag of the Sikh community got burnt when a person burnt iron scrap. This resulted in tension and persons belonging to two communities indulging in clashes. That was election time and para-military forces deployed for election arrangements were pressed into service to control the clashes.

“As the situation was going out of control, police opened fire resulting in the death of three persons. Nothing beyond this was found during the subsequent investigation,” Mr. Kushalkar said.
