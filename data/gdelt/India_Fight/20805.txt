Kangana Ranaut proves that she rocks the six yards better than anyone else in this pretty green sari

Check out Kangana Ranaut's latest airport look

Kangana Ranaut is one of the most phenomenal heroines we've ever seen. Whether it's her powerful expressions in Queen or her versatility in Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi, Kangana is effortless and fabulous. Earlier this morning, the makers of Mental Hai Kya released the first look of the movie that is being lauded by fans on social media. Amidst the controversies surrounding the hottie, our lenses just spotted the heroine at the airport as she returns from Kolkata after shooting for Panga.

The heroine oped for a chic mint green sari with a strappy green blouse. The stunner opted for a pretty tan bag and white strapped kitten heels. Pulling her fab curly tresses into a comfy bun, Kangana completed her look with oversized shades. No one can do airport fashion better than Kangana and her versatile sari collection is proof. Check her look out.

Over the last 24 hours, Kangana seems to have found herself amidst yet another controversy. After Kangana labelled Alia Bhatt as a mediocre and Karan Johar's puppet. Yesterday, Kangana's sister Rangoli wrote on Twitter, "Mahesh Bhatt is the man who has given her a break … she goes on to attack his wife and daughter. Daughter over and over again. What is left to be said then about abusing and hatred I wonder. Apart from character of course. Agenda ? What’s hers ?"

While we wonder what Kangana has to say about it, she will next be seen in Mental Hai Kya and Panga. Stay tuned for all the updates on the hottie.
