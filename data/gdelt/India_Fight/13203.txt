NIA arrests key accused in Jalandhar grenade attack

New Delhi, March 6 : The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested a man from Jammu and Kashmir for his involvement in a grenade attack on a police station in Punjab's Jalandhar last year, claiming he was acting on the direction of Ansar Ghazawat-ul-Hind chief Zakir Musa.

Amir Nazir, a resident of Awantipora in Pulwama district, was said to be among over half-a-dozen suspects, who had in September 2018 hurled four grenades at Maksudan police station, injuring a policeman.

He is the third accused arrested so far in the case.

Two other accused arrested in the case are Fazil Bashir Pinchoo and Shahid Qayoom, both also hailing from Awantipora and pursuing their B.Tech (Civil) from St. Soldier Group of Colleges in Jalandhar.

An NIA statement said that Nazir was a key accused as he procured and facilitated delivery of the grenades used in the attack on the directions of Musa. "He was the active link between Musa and two other persons who were arrested in the case earlier."

Nazir has been taken on transit remand to be produced before the Special NIA court in Mohali for obtaining his custody for interrogation, said the statement.

The NIA took over the investigation of the case from Punjab Police following the government's orders and filed an FIR on December 20.

In its investigation, the NIA said it has found that the attack was handiwork of Ansar Ghazawat-ul-Hind.

Two other accused involved in the attack, identified as Rauf Ahmed Mir and Umar Ramzan were killed in an encounter with security forces in south Kashmir on December 22, 2018, said the statement.
