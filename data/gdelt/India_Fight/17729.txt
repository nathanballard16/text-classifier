Ishq Mein Marjawan March 29, 2019 Written Update: Tara fails to kill Netra

In the previous episode, we see how Mohini and Tara joins hands to kill both their enemies, Chakor and Netra respectively. Later, Deep frantically wished to find Aarohi and kill her. Deep finds Jatin worried and asks him about his worries. Their conversation was interrupted by Chakor. Here, Mohini, Tara and Poonam had successfully trapped Chakor in the room with Jammy and next in their target was Netra. Vasundhara had fallen sick in the holi party that Jatin had organised. Deep and Shera brought her home and waited for the doctors to come and find the reason of her recurring illness. The doctor comes in and Deep gets shocked to feel Aarohi in the room. He holds the nurse and takes her to be Aarohi.

Deep lashes out at her while the nurse leaves feeling uncomfortable with Deep’s behaviour. Later, while speaking to her mother, Netra accidently drops her phone which slides under the bed. While trying to get her phone back, she finds a chit with the name Aarohi written on it and gets shocked. Deep was in doubt as he could recognise Aarohi’s presence well and wondered what was so different about the nurse that gave him a feeling of Aarohi being around. Earlier, Tara along with Poonam had managed to get hold of Netra while she was unconscious, but had missed attacking her as she regained consciousness by the time they came to take her.

Repeatedly, Tara was witnessing failure to kill Netra which was getting on her nerves. In the meantime, Aarohi was making her side strong, to match Deep’s level and avenged to put an end to his evil intentions.
