Kulgam terror attack: For Tipu, the errand he hated helped him cheat death

Fetching dinner from his employer’s house was a task that he used to hate. Yet, it was this chore that kept Basheer-ul- Sarkar alias Tipu alive, while his fellow workers from Murshidabad district were gunned down by militants at Kulgam in Kashmir on Tuesday.

Along with six others — all residents of Bahalnagar village — Sarkar used to work at the apple orchard of Ghulam Rasool.

“After work, it was my turn that day to bring dinner for everyone from the owner’s house. I used to hate doing this after a long day of hard work. However, I went to bring food. After returning, I found the house empty. Before I could understand anything, a shopkeeper screamed and asked me to leave immediately. I rushed back to the owner’s house. As soon as I reached there, I heard gunshots. The owners didn’t allow me to leave the place. I can’t believe my fellow workers were shot dead,” said Sarkar.

Sarkar was traumatised after the incident and has been brought to Kolkata from Srinagar on Wednesday night. He has been admitted to SSKM hospital.

According to doctors, he will be shifted to the Institute of Psychiatry and will be kept under observation. He is yet to recover from the shock following the tragedy.

Among the seven labourers, five of them — Naimuddin Sheikh, Murshalim Sheikh, Rafikul Sheikh, Rafique Sheikh and Kamaruddin Sheikh — were shot dead, while another worker Jahiruddin was injured in the attack. He is currently undergoing treatment at a hospital in Srinagar.

“I am still unable to grasp what happened. After this incident, I will probably never leave home to earn a livelihood. I don’t know whether I should thank God for giving me another life or complain that so many innocent lives have been lost,” Sarkar said.
