Pakistan’s Navy fires domestically-made cruise missile in ‘impressive fire power display’

Pakistan showed off its newest domestically-built anti-ship and land-attack cruise missile during a test in the Indian Ocean. The test is part of Islamabad’s ongoing efforts to acquire more “indigenous” weapons.

The missile, launched from a fast attack craft in the northern Indian Ocean, successfully hit a target on the shore, the Pakistani Navy said.

Calling Tuesday’s test “an impressive fire power display,” the navy said it demonstrates “the impeccable level of indigenization in high-tech weaponry,” referring to the nation’s push to become self-reliant in terms of arms.

The officials didn’t specify the model used, but said it can strike sea-based targets as well.

In January 2018, Pakistan’s PNS Himmat fast attack craft successfully fired a domestically-built Harbah anti-ship cruise missile. Several months later, a submarine carried out an underwater launch of the nation’s nuclear-capable Babur cruise missile.
