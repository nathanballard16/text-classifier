A guest lecturer of St Stephen's College was found dead on railway tracks and his mother was found hanging at their house in north Delhi's Pitampura, the police said.

The police said the 55-year-old woman's mouth was stuffed with cloth. Her 27-year-old son was a guest lecturer of Philosophy in the top college under Delhi University. Both were from Kottayam in Kerala.

The guest lecturer allegedly killed himself on the tracks at Sarai Rohilla railway station.

The police said a criminal case was pending against them and they were under protection from arrest.

According to the police, people who were close to the guest lecturer said he was under depression and had even tried to persuade his mother to kill herself five days ago.

The police said they found a wallet, a wristwatch and a driving licence on the railway tracks where the body of the guest lecturer was found.

The police said they have found a suicide note at the house. The woman's son wrote that they were depressed over the police case against them. The woman has a son from her first husband, who has died, the police said. She married again in 2018; however, her second husband also died, after which the man's family members filed a police case against her.

The Delhi Police are in touch with the Kerala Police to investigate the case.
