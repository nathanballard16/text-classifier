Couple murders Uber driver for money in Delhi

New Delhi: A couple in a live-in relationship was arrested for robbing and killing an Uber driver, a police officer said here late Monday evening.

“The accused, Farhat Ali, 34 and his partner Seema Sharma, 30, were arrested Sunday after they were seen in CCTV footage around the cab of the deceased who was identified as Ram Govind,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Vijayanta Arya said.

The incident was reported to police January 29 when the victim’s wife, a resident of Shakarpur area of east Delhi, filed a missing complaint of her husband who drove a Uber cab.

“During investigation, we found it was a blind case as there were no witnesses. The last ride of the cab was booked from Madangir to Kapashera border and thereafter the GPS device was found to have stopped working,” Arya said.

“With the help of technical surveillance, the mobile phone of Govind was recovered and the police teams found a couple hiring the cab on the Mehrauli-Gurugram road,” added the officer.

The police team zeroed in the couple and identified them as Ali and Sharma. They were picked up for questioning and subsequently arrested.

“During interrogation, the accused disclosed that they had hired Govind’s cab early January 29. On the way, they hatched a plan to rob the deceased and as per the plan, took him to their home and offered him tea laced with sedative,” informed Arya.

“They later killed Govind by strangling him. Next day, they arranged a cutter and blades in order to cut the body into small pieces and wrapped it three separates bundles. They later threw the bundles in a drain at Greater Noida,” added Arya.

She further stated that the Hyundai Xcent car and Govind’s mobile phones were recovered from the possession of the duo adding that the motive for the crime was the accused’s dire need of money.
