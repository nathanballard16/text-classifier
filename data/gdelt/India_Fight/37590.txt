Border Guard Bangladesh yesterday recovered body of a Bangladeshi, who was allegedly shot dead by Indian Border Security Force, from Daulatpur border in Kushtia.

Robiul Hossain Robi, 30, was the son of Janu Mondol from Haider Char in the district’s Daulatpur upazila.

Local people claimed that Robi was killed in BSF firing, however, BGB officials did not confirm the claim.

Informed by locals, a BGB team recovered the body from Charpara border point inside the Bangladesh territory around 8:30am, said Subedar Jahangir Alam, commander of BGB’s Mahiskundi Border Observation Post.

Quoting locals, Seraj Uddin Mondol, chairman of Chilmary union parishad, said a BSF team of Murshidabad’s Bausmari camp opened fire on a group of Bangladeshi men while they were bringing in cattle from India early yesterday.

Jahangir said none of the BSF camps of the concerned areas had confirmed their involvement in the incident when contacted.

“We are looking into the matter,” he said.
