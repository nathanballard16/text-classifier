Russian Defence Minister calls up Nirmala Sitharaman to strengthen military cooperation

Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoygu called up Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and emphasised on the determination to strengthen Indo-Russian military cooperation.

He also expressed his condolences over the Pulwama terror attack in Kashmir, in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed.

"Russian Defence Minister General Sergei Shoygu called Smt @nsitharaman. Over the telecon, he expressed condolences for the Pulwama attack and emphasized on the determination to strengthen Indo-Russian military cooperation (sic)," the defence minister's official Twitter handle posted.

The development comes in the backdrop of recent escalating tensions between India and Pakistan. It all started with the sucide bombing attack on Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) paramilitary personnel in south Kashmir's Pulwama.

At least 40 paramilitary troopers were killed in the attack, following which Indian Air Force launched a counter and attacked Jaish training camps across the Line of Control (LoC) in Pakistan.

Pakistan, too, responded by intruding Indian airspace but were chased away by IAF fighter jets which immediately scrambled. However, an IAF pilot was captured during the mission after his jet was shot down on the Pakistani side of the LoC.

IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was released after three days on Friday after mounting diplomatic pressure on Pakistan.

However, tensions between the two nations continue to remain on the edge with almost daily cross border violations, resulting in civillian injuries.
