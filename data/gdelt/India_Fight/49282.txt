Kerala: Three Maoists killed in police encounter

Kerala Thunderbolts, the command force of Kerala Police, have gunned down three Maoists including a woman in an encounter in the Attapadi Hills of Palakkad early Monday morning. The police team was patrolling the hills when a seven-member group of Maoists opened fire at them.

Two out of the three slain Maoists have been identified by the police. One was Karthick from Tamil Nadu and the woman member was Jyoti from Karnataka.

Thunderbolts continues the operation for the missing four Maoists who escaped.

We have been combing the area for long and have now reached a breakthrough. Due to rain and darkness, we have abandoned the operation," a senior commando police officer told India Today TV.

The Thunderbolts received information that Maoists camping in the tribal areas were demanding food materials from the tribes.

On surveillance, the team found Maoists movements in the area and searched all homes, the officer added

Maoists have been frequenting Attapadi hills and adjoining forest areas for long .

In 2018, the Union government listed Palakkad district as most vulnerable to Maoist activities and strengthened intelligence in the area.
