IAF bombs ‘Tiger Hill’ again on Kargil’s 20th anniv

Gwalior: Commemorating 20 years of the Kargil War, the IAF on Monday turned the Gwalior air base virtually into a theatre of conflict with a dramatic reenactment of some milestones of the 1999 operation.

In a symbolic recreation of the Tiger Hill attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Drass-Kargil area, the air force used the Mirage 2000 aircraft and explosives were blown up on a ‘model hill’ to recreate the crucial events of the war.

The IAF has planned several activities at the air base to commemorate the 20 years of the war and the symbolic recreation of the Tiger Hill attack was one of them.

Five Mirage 2000, two MiG 21s and one Sukoi 30 MKI were on static display at the base. One of the Mirage 2000 aircraft showcased the Spice bomb carrier. The bomb was used in the Balakot airstrike in February.

“The Kargil conflict offers an exemplary experience in the use of air power in warfare in high mountains conditions and is key to full understanding of India’s emerging posture,” a senior IAF official said.

Several gallantry award winners, both serving and retired, who participated in ‘Operation Vijay’ are attending the event.

The Indian armed forces displayed exceptional valour while successfully dislodging the enemy from the strategic hill in the Drass-Kargil area, an official said.

The Mirage-2000 played a crucial role in the battles fought during the war and also hit enemy targets bunkered in at the Tiger Hill.

The anniversary celebrations for this year will be spread over three days from July 25-27.

“The Kargil War will always be remembered for its strategic and tactical surprises, the self-imposed national strategy of restraint in keeping the war limited to Kargil-Siachen sectors, and the swiftly executed tri-services military strategy and plans,” the Army had said. (Agencies)
