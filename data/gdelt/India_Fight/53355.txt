The city is set to undertake a new project which would make the general public more aware regarding the need to reject plastic usage.

It is now common knowledge that the whole world is concerned about the fast deteriorating conditions of the environment and progressive regimes everywhere are intent on taking steps in the right direction. One of those steps is getting rid of plastic. In India, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has urged citizens to reject single-use plastic and opt for more eco-friendly alternatives, so as to keep the environment healthy. The government continues to sensitize the populace against the use of plastics, which is a tough battle to fight because plastic usage has been ingrained into the lives of the common people.

In this regard, the Kolkata Municipal Corporation has taken a commendable step in the right direction. Under its mayor, Firhad Hakim, the city is set to undertake a new project which would make the general public more aware regarding the need to reject plastic usage.
