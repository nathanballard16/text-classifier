Hyderabad, Dec 05: In the wake of the horrific Hyderabad gang-rape and murder, the Hyderabad Metro Rail (HMR) authorities on Wednesday directed that women passengers will henceforth be allowed to carry pepper spray with them for self-defence.

In a statement, HMR managing director N V S Reddy said that instructions have been issued to security personnel to allow women passengers to carry pepper spray with them.

"Queries have been raised regarding allowing female passengers to carry pepper spray in Hyderabad Metro trains for self-defence, as is in the case of Bengaluru's Namma Metro. Instructions have been issued to security personnel to let in women carrying pepper spray."
