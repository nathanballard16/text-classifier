Woman arrested in connection with police shooting in Hilo

Hawaii island police have arrested a 24-year-old woman who was wanted in connection with a getaway that resulted in two officers discharging their weapons in Hilo.

Tearon Pacheco-Fernandez was arrested Sunday morning in the Puna area, police said.

Pacheco-Fernandez was also wanted in connection with a similar incident in which she rammed an unmarked police vehicle, police said.

The most recent incident began about noon Nov. 27 when an off-duty police officer saw a Toyota Tacoma wanted by police being driven in a parking lot at 50 E. Puainako Ave.

The officer notified other officers who arrived at the parking lot and attempted to stop the driver, but the driver continued towards an officer who fired his weapon. The driver drove past the officer and hit a parked vehicle, then began reversing, nearly hitting another officer who also fired his weapon, police said.

The driver drove away towards Kilauea Avenue, then struck a passenger car stopped in traffic.

No injuries were reported in the incident. The police department’s Office of Professional Standards was investigating the shooting.

Police opened a first-degree attempted murder investigation.

Police said the truck involved in the incident is believed to have been stolen from a Hilo business in early November.
