RIP Kaustubh Nirmal, EY Senior Advisor Who Died In California Dive Boat Fire

Two of the 34 victims of the horrible California dive boat fire on Labor Day were Kaustubh Nirmal, a senior advisor at EY, and his wife, Sanjeeri Deopujari, a dentist.

The couple, who married in 2016, were from Stamford, CT, the New York Post reported.

Authorities confirmed that Nirmal and Deopujari were aboard Conception during a three-day Labor Day weekend scuba diving excursion off the coast of Santa Barbara when it caught fire during the early morning of Sept. 2, trapping the passengers who were asleep on the bottom deck of the boat.

According to his LinkedIn profile, Nirmal, 44, described himself as a “strategic business technologist” who has more than six years of experience “driving enterprise-wide transformation using information systems as a tool to solve complex business problems.”

He joined EY in September 2014 after working for several years at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, now known as BoA Securities, and Bank of America.

He received his Bachelor of Engineering degree in computer sciences from the University of Mumbai and his master’s degree in management information systems and services from NYU Stern School of Business.

Nirmal’s cousin, Rajul Sharma, told the Los Angeles Times that Kaustubh was an avid animal lover who was a sweet and sensitive guy who never wanted to hurt anyone’s feelings. Nirmal and Deopujari, 31, had a dog named Bebe that they adored.

Nirmal grew up in Jaipur, and Deopujari was from Nagpur, according to the Times of India. She is the daughter of well-known Nagpur-based pediatrician Dr. Satish Deopujari.
