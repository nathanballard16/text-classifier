The last year was no less than a nightmare for the Khans of Bollywood. While Salman Khan’s Race 3 failed to work its magic at the box-office, Aamir Khan and Shah Rukh Khan delivered box-office duds in the form of Thugs of Hindostan and Zero, respectively.

Unfazed, Salman is looking forward to the release of Bharat while simultaneously shooting for Dabangg 3. He also has Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Inshallah in his kitty, among other projects.

Aamir, on the other hand, will begin work on Laal Singh Chaddha, an official adaptation of Tom Hanks’s 1994 hit film Forrest Gump, which will be helmed by Secret Superstar director Advait Chandan. But Shah Rukh, it appears, is yet to decide what he is going to do next. As of now, there has been no formal announcement by the superstar in this regard.

If a report in Mumbai Mirror is to be believed, the Khan trio recently met at SRK’s Bandra Bandstand home. It was reportedly a quiet conversation that revolved around their respective careers. The meeting went on till 8 pm and by then, most of their common friends had left for the day. Since the gathering happened at SRK’s place, there is high possibility that he would have arranged it to seek career advice from his Khan friends. It gives fans hope that the superstar would soon zero in on course of action in his career.

According to recent reports, Shah Rukh will be seen next in Tamil director Atlee’s Thalapathy 63. The superstar will reportedly play a prominent role in the Vijay-starrer. Earlier, when SRK was spotted watching an IPL match with Atlee, it had sparked rumours of a potential collaboration between the two.
