PUCL condemns raid on DU professor’s residence

‘Such actions amount to state terrorism’

The People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL) condemned Pune Police’s action in raiding Delhi University professor Hany Babu’s residence on Tuesday, saying such actions and tactics on the part of the State amounted to state terrorism.

On Tuesday, a contingent of the Pune Police raided Prof. Babu’s house in Noida, New Delhi, in connection with the Bhima-Koregaon case. Pointing out that no search warrant was produced by the police, PUCL officebearers said: “The range of charges and the nature of the materials seized suggest that the State is on a fishing expedition. The aim is to send a chilling warning to others, who may want to question the arbitrary and vindictive action of the Pune/Maharashtra Police.”

Expressing shock over the seizure of Prof. Babu’s family members’ phones to prevent them from calling lawyers and friends throughout the raid, the human rights body said it was blatant abuse of law.

Prof. Babu is a social justice activist academic of Delhi University. He has raised several issues related to Dalits and other socially marginalised groups in the University. He has been campaigning for the release of Delhi University professor G. N. Saibaba. Prof. Saibaba’s controversial arrest was preceded by similar illegal and intimidatory actions, the statement said.
