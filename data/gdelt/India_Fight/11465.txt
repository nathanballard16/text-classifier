Families of murdered Youth Congress workers demand CBI probe

Kasargode : March 1 (IANS) The families of the two murdered Youth Congress workers in Kerala's Kasargode district, on Friday approached the police chief and the state home secretary seeking a CBI probe into the killings.

In a letter to the two senior officials, the families expressed doubts about the ongoing probe by the Crime Branch. They demanded that the conspiracy angle should also be probed, and since CPI-M leaders are involved in the murder, only a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation will bring out the truth.

Youth Congress workers Krupesh, 19, and Joshy, 24, were attacked on February 17 by three men. Krupesh died at the hospital and Joshy succumbed to injuries on his way to the medical facility.

Police have so far arrested five people in the case including a local CPI-M leader A. Peethamabaran, who had said that he committed the crime under the influence of a drug. He, however, changed his statement in the court on Monday.

Peethamabaran told the judge that he has no role in the murder and the police forced him to confess to the crime.

The Congress has demanded a CBI probe, while Communist Party of India (Marxist) state Secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan on a few occasions dismissed the need for it as he feels that the Kerala Police will have no job left if all cases will be probed by the CBI.
