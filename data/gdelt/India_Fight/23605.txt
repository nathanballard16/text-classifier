Three unidentified militants were killed in an exchange of fire with the security forces in Jammu and Kashmir’s Shopian district on Friday morning, the army said. Security forces had launched a cordon and search operation in the Imam Sahib area of Shopian district this morning following information about the presence of militants.

“Three militants have been killed in the operation which was going on when last reports came in. Warlike stores and weapons have been recovered from the scene of the encounter,” the official said.

Clashes between protestors and law enforcing personnel broke out near the encounter site after some people pelted stones at the security forces engaged in the anti-militancy operation, a police official told PTI. He said two persons sustained minor pellet injuries in the security forces’ action to chase away the miscreants.

According to preliminary information, the militants were affiliated to Hizbul Mujahideen. One of the slain militants is believed to be Lateef ‘Tiger’, the last surviving militant of the 10 associates of HM commander Burhan Wani who was killed in an encounter in July 2016, the official said.

An official confirmation to this effect can only be made after proper identification process is completed, he added.

On April 25, two Hizbul Mujahideen militants were killed in a pre-dawn gunbattle at Bijbehara area in south Kashmir’s Anantnag district. Till last week’s encounter, the number of militant deaths stood at 71 this year.
