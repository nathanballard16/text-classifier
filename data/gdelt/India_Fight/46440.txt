Expansion of Mumbai underground halted over pollution fears

The Indian Supreme court has ruled a 35-kilometre expansion to the Mumbai Metro must be halted over fears it would exacerbate hazardous levels of air pollution.

‘Line 3’ is slated to open in December 2021 and officials claim it will reduce the number of vehicles on the city’s roads – thought to be the most congested in the world - by around 650,000.

However, plans to construct a car park in the densely forested Aarey Colony suburb for those using the metro has been met with opposition from environmentalists after authorities revealed they would cut down 2,000 trees in the process.

“Mumbai is one of the most densely populated cities in the world and also highly polluted,” said Debi Goenka, Executive Trustee at the Conservation Action Trust, a Mumbai-based NGO working to protect the environment.

“We cannot afford to lose thousands of trees that form part of one of the green lungs of Mumbai, particularly since there are alternative sites available for the car shed.”

On Friday, the Mumbai High Court dismissed all petitions lodged in opposition to the deforestation.

That evening hundreds of activists hugged trees in Aarey Colony to try to stop the authorities from further felling.

Clashes between protesters and police led to 68 arrests.
