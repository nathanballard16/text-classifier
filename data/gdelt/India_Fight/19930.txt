Indian elections open as 900 million voters give their verdict on Narendra Modi

India begins the biggest election of all time as around 140 million vote across 18 states in the first phase of the polls set to last around six weeks.

Ninety-one seats will be decided today, out of a total of 543 in the Lok Sabha, the lower house of parliament, with all results due on May 23, after the final phase of voting finishes. In total 900 million people will vote.

Violence was reported in several states, with one person dead, after clashes and explosions were evident round the states of Maharashtra in the west, and Andhra Pradesh in the south.

Electronic voting machines were also said to be not working in several areas, leading to outbursts of anger.

The victim of the clash was a supporter of the ruling Telugu Desam Party in Andhra Pradesh and was reportedly killed during a brawl with rival party supporters.
