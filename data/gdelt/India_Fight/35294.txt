No reset for Imran Khan if Pakistan does not deliver on terrorist groups

WASHINGTON - The United States is under no illusions on the history of the Pakistan military's support for terrorist groups, a senior administration official told journalists in Washington ahead of a visit to the White House by Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan on Monday (July 22).

The remarks came a day after President Donald Trump drew withering criticism for tweeting that the arrest in Pakistan this week of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, leader of the Lashkar e Taiba (LeT) terrorist organisation, had come after a "ten-year search" and "great pressure has been exerted over the last two years to find him".

"This is the seventh time that Hafiz Muhammad Saeed has been arrested," the senior official said. "That is why we are very clear eyed… he has been arrested and released in the past."

"We will look to see Pakistan take sustained action in terms of actually prosecuting these people, that these arrests are actually contributing to reducing groups like LeT's field (operations)… because quite frankly previous arrests of Hafiz Muhammad Saeed haven't made a difference, the LeT has been able to operate."

The LeT carried out the 2008 Mumbai terror attack which killed 164 people. The US has designated the LET a foreign terrorist organisation and put a price of US$10 million on Hafiz Muhammad Saeed's head. Yet between arrests by the authorities in Pakistan, Saeed has widely been known and seen to live openly in Pakistan's second-largest city, Lahore, and freely meeting followers.

The US also wants Pakistan to crack down on the Haqqani Network which, based in Pakistan, carries out cross-border attacks on US and its allied forces in Afghanistan. The US has also designated the Haqqani Network a foreign terrorist organisation.

The US was waiting to see if initial steps taken thus far, are made "irreversible and sustainable", the official said.
