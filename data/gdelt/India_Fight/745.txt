Now, CBI plans to question Akhilesh Yadav

New Delhi: Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav seems to be heading for trouble ahead of Lok Sabha polls as the CBI plans to examine him in connection with a case of illegal sand mining dating back to 2012-13 when he held the additional portfolio of mining in Uttar Pradesh.

On Saturday the investigating agency conducted raids at 14 places in Uttar Pradesh, including Jalaun, Hamirpur, Noida, Lucknow and Kanpur, and Delhi as part of the probe while CBI sources hinted that they may question Akhilesh Yadav and all his former ministers, including former mining minister Gayatri Prasad Prajapati who was also arrested in 2017 following a complaint of rape by a woman residing in Chitrakoot.

In the afternoon, the central investigative agency also conducted raids on the premises of IAS officers and former Hamirpur district magistrate B. Chandrakala.

She had come into limelight, particularly on the social media, in connection with her anti-corruption campaigns which earned her the title of being a “Lady Dabang” — a reference made to an honest cop’s role essayed by Salman Khan in Dabang.

The CBI initiated investigations into the sand mining scam following a directive from the Allahabad high court and filed seven preliminary enquiries in 2016.
