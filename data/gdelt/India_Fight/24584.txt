Vigil held for Buffalo shooting victim

The family of a Buffalo man shot and killed is searching for answers.

BUFFALO, N.Y. — A vigil was held Wednesday night for a Buffalo man found dead inside his home on Minnesota Avenue last month.

As the family of Joseph Sullivan mourns his death, they want more answers about what happened to him.

They say whatever happened to him was unprovoked and they just want justice.

"He was a good guy, he was a loving guy he was like a big teddy bear," said Sullivan's daughters, India, Brittany and Brionna. "He was intelligent, funny, he was very smart, like as she said intelligent... that was his vest quality ever."
