Happy Birthday Mohanlal: Five moments that explain why Mohanlal is a complete actor

Diligence is one of the most striking features of actor Mohanlal. While speaking on a show, actor and producer Maniyanpilla Raju said that one cannot find an artist as dedicated as Mohanlal. He said, "If you ask why people conquer heights, I remember an incident. During the shoot of the film 'Adhipan.' A day Mohanlal was very ill and I took him to the hospital. The doctor suggested that he should take complete rest(bed rest) for three days, as he is having a really bad sore throat. He can't even swallow saliva, so taking rest was so important. So after visiting the doctor, we came back and he was changing into his costume and getting ready for the shoot. This day he had to shoot for a fight sequence. But he chose to go because he can't deny the fact that stunt artists and the whole crew have come from Madras for the shoot, so not shooting this day might cost them an additional day, payment, accommodation and all. So he shot for the action sequence till 3 or 4 in the morning. And in midst of these takes he would come back and gargle some hot water. He cried as he wasn't able to contain the pain of his sore throat and then return back to the shoot. " Actor Mohanlal was a great star then, he could have chosen to not shoot, but dedication is all you need to heap success.
