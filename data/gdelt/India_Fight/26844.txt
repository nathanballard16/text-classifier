Lok Sabha results: Smriti Irani ahead of RaGa in Amethi, and Twitter can't handle it

Scindia siblings Madhavarao, Yashodhara and Vasundhra Raje were born to Gwalior's last ruling king. They followed in their mother's footsteps to becoming political leaders. Ironically, the trio opted for different paths when it came to politics. While Madhavarao joined the Congress, Yashodhara and Vadundhara continued on the same path and chose BJP.



One of the greatest leaders of the Congress, Madhavarao's stint with politics was a short-lived one after he died in a plane crash in 2001. His son Jyotiraditya Scindia, the current MP from Guna, carried forward his father's political legacy. This year, the 48-year-old will be contesting elections from the same constituency.



Vasundhara, the second-eldest sibling, served as Rajasthan's CM twice - from 2003-2008 and 2013-2018. Her political career began in 1985 when she won a seat in the Rajasthan state legislative assembly. In 1989, she moved to national politics and won a Lok Sabha seat. In 2003, she returned to Rajasthan politics and led a bright term for BJP in the state.



Yashodhara, the youngest of all three, joined politics in 1994. She kicked off her political career in 1998 by contesting the Madhya Pradesh Assembly elections on a BJP ticket. She was re-elected to the seat in 2003. Last year, she defeated Congress's Siddharth Ladha in the Assembly polls from the Shivpuri constituency.
