Piya Rangrezz: "It feels like a miracle!" says Gaurav Bajaj on becoming a father

Television actor Gaurav Bajaj and wife Sakshi became proud parents of a baby boy on Wednesday. The baby was born to the couple in his hometown Indore . The actor, who is currently shooting for his new show in Mumbai is on cloud nine for becoming a real life dad too. “It feels like a miracle, in that moment when you realise that you have brought another life into this world. We feel blessed,” he expresses happily.Although it’s been three days, the Meri Gudiya actor has already started collecting toys for his child who they call ‘junior Bajaj’ as of now. “I get attracted by toy stores everywhere now, be it airports, malls or nearby toy stores. Ever since the feeling of approaching fatherhood sunk in, I have been taking out time to visit toy stores in different cities that I travel to for shoots,”states Bajaj.As the actor has to manage his time between Mumbai and Indore now due to his shoot schedules, he has devised a new plan to keep a record of the precious moments of the newborn. “I have made sure to record the weekly journey with my kid for the first six months – the time when every kid changes very frequently.” Of course, he is not too happy to be flying back to Mumbai so soon. “I have a lot of responsibility on both shoulders now. There I have Meri Gudiya to look after and in Indore I have mera gudda to come back to. Luckily, my set is in filmcity and it’s very close to the airport, so I’ll plan well and keep coming soon to say hi to junior!” says the Piya Rangrezz actor.
