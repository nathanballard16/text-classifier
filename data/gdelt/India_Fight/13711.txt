Two-day calm shattered by heavy firing on LoC

The two days of calm on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir was shattered on Friday as the Pakistani and Indian armies clashed again in Poonch district.

Defence Ministry spokesman Lt Col Devender Anand said that Pakistan initiated the "unprovoked ceasefire violation" by firing mortar shells and small arms in Shahpur and Kerni sectors.

"The ceasefire violation started around 6 p.m. Indian positions retaliated strongly and effectively," he said.

Police said a special police officer (SPO), Syed Shah, was injured in the Pakistani firing. He was shifted to a hospital.

Friday's border clash occurred after two days of uneasy calm on the LoC, which divides Jammu and Kashmir between India and Pakistan.
