‘Friendship with Imran Khan comes first for him’, Kejriwal jabs at Sidhu

New Delhi: Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal claimed that Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu was more concerned about his friendship with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan than the well-being of India.

Kejriwal said Sidhu’s statement had “hurt the sentiments.” His remarks came after the Punjab cabinet Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu sounded a discordant note on Friday saying the dialogue with Islamabad should continue.

Following the deadliest attack carried out on the CRPF personnel, Sidhu had said that an entire nation could not be blamed for the actions of “a handful of people”.

Arvind Kejriwal, who was attending the marriage reception of Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Baljinder Kaur told media persons that “Sidhu’s statement has hurt the sentiments of the entire nation.”

As he condemned Sidhu for the “irresponsible” statement, Kejriwal stated that “It seems for Sidhu, friendship (with Khan) comes first and then the nation.”

In the deadliest terror attack on security forces in Kashmir, 49 CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday when their convoy was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway.
