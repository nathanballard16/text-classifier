While India has a long way to go before it can claim to be a superpower, it is a success for the country to have joined the elite club of the three most powerful nations in the world—US, Russia and China—by successfully test firing Anti Satellite (A-Sat) missile on Wednesday.

The test-firing has now ensured that it can ‘blind and deafen’ an adversary’s military forces by shooting down out satellites vital for surveillance and other warfare technologies.

The three-minute precision operation developed indigenously has established deterrence against rapid military advances made by India’s biggest rival, China, in outer space. It is in India’s national security interests to have a firewall against threats to its space-based assets from China’s long range missiles and other weapons.

Though Beijing is already far ahead in space capabilities, New Delhi’s debut in the arena marks an important milestone in the future balance of power in the region. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s decision to give a go ahead to the test firing was therefore the right one.

Both the ruling party and the opposition should refrain from politicizing the issue and treat the A-Sat testing as a collective accomplishment of the nation. A great deal of work and effort of hundreds of scientists, especially those of the DRDO and several leaders including Modi has gone into strengthening India’s defence and space projects.
