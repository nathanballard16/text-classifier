Srinagar/Anantnag, July 30

Even as Indian and Pakistani troops exchanged heavy artillery fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Tangdhar and Keran sectors in Kupwara district, for the first time after 2003, two militants, including a top commander of the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and co-conspirator in the Pulwama attack, were killed in an encounter in Bijbehara area of Anantnag district today.

The slain militants were identified as JeM commander Fayaz Ahmad Thokar of Panzoo Tral in Pulwama district and Shan Showkat Bhat of Kanelwan area in Bijbehara. A senior police official said Panzoo’s killing was a huge achievement in the anti-militancy operations.

The gunfight took place at Katoo village in Bijbehara area of Anantnag around 4 pm. “The area was cordoned off following specific inputs regarding presence of militants,” a police official said. The holed-up militants opened fire on the forces, thus triggering a gunfight.

“During the exchange of fire, the militants kept shifting base from one place to another. But persistent attack with precision led to the killing of both,” he said.

On the LoC, India and Pakistan exchanged heavy artillery fire in Kupwara district for the first time in last 16 year.

At least five civilians were injured in the shelling that started around 1 pm at multiple places in Tangdhar and Keran sectors. Shells landed in many residential areas.

“Unprovoked ceasefire violation, including calibre escalation (artillery fire) by Pakistan in Tangdhar sector, was on since 1 pm. Our troops retaliated strongly, resulting in heavy casualties on the enemy side,” Srinagar-based defence spokesman Col Rajesh Kalia said. — TNS
