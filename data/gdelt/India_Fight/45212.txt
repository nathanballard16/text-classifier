Can’t rule out terror hit on west coast: Rajnath Singh

Pakistan may target India via coastline: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh

KOLLAM: Defence minister Rajnath Singh said here on Friday that a terrorist attack along the western coast cannot be ruled out. Without naming Pakistan, he said: “There is a possibility that a neighbouring country’s terrorists might carry out a major attack on our coastline which extends from Kutch to Kerala. But the country’s maritime forces are fully prepared to deal with any eventuality. Any kind of adventurism from the enemy would be answered with a massive reciprocal action.”While speaking at the 66th birthday celebrations of Mata Amritanandamayi Devi, Singh referred to PM Narendra Modi ’s statement that India would not attack any country without provocation but an attack by anyone would not be tolerated.The minister pointed out that the armed forces had bombed the terror camps at Balakot within a few days of the Pulwama suicide bombing. Distributing the financial assistance instituted by the Amritanandamayi Matt of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the 40 CRPF jawans who were killed in the Pulwama attack, Singh said after the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai, the enemies could not breach the maritime security of the country as the Indian Navy and Coast Guard had made all efforts to thwart any repeat of such attacks.“We are completely committed to coastal and maritime security,” he said, while emphasising that everybody living in the coastal areas also had the responsibility to maintain vigil against any potential threat from the enemy. Paying tributes to the jawans who were killed in conflict zones, Singh said: “We should stand with the families and honour their sacrifices”.
