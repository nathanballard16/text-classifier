Ram Charan is Salman Khan’s voice in Telugu version of Bharat

Bharat, Salman Khan’s big Eid release this year, is a film cinegoers are eagerly waiting for. The period drama, directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, is backed by strong pre-release buzz, thanks to its mass-appealing subject, terrific star cast and most importantly, the presence of Salman in it. With the film nearing its release, the craze and excitement surrounding it is increasing by the day.

To ensure a wide release for the mega spectacle, the makers will also be offering its dubbed Telugu and Tamil versions. In the Telugu version, recent reports claim, Tollywood star Ram Charan has lent his voice for Salman’s character. Ram enjoys a huge fan base down South and the makers, it appears, want to milk his popularity. The film’s Telugu trailer is expected to be out soon.

For the uninitiated, the RRR star had previously dubbed for Salman in Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, his 2015 Diwali release. Who is the superstar’s voice in the Tamil version of the film is yet to be known.

Bharat, an official adaptation of the 2014 South Korean drama Ode To My Father, also features Katrina Kaif, Disha Patani, Jackie Shroff, Sunil Grover and Tabu in important roles, among others. India’s post independence history has been traced in the film through the eyes of Salman’s character.

Bharat is directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. Ali has earlier collaborated with Salman for Sultan (2016) and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017), both of which went on to cross the Rs 300 crore-mark at the domestic box-office. The latter, in fact, is the biggest success the superstar has ever seen in his career of nearly three decades.

A joint production venture between Reel Life Productions, Salman Khan Films and T-Series, Bharat has been shot across Abu Dhabi, Spain, Malta, Punjab, Delhi and Mumbai. The film is scheduled to arrive in cinemas on June 5.
