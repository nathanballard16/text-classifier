European Union MPs Visit Kashmir: Mission Unaccomplished and How

In 2004, when militancy and human rights abuse by security forces had remarkably faded out, a European Union diplomatic delegation at the end of its high-profile visit to the Valley described Kashmir as the world’s largest jail.

Fifteen years later, when the situation is arguably far worse despite zero civilian killings by the armed forces, nobody here seems to expect anything uncharitable, anything unpalatable to the Government of India, from the delegation of 28 European Union parliamentarians.

Apparently under the pressure of a massive propaganda campaign in the international diplomatic circles and media, the Centre on Tuesday, 29 October, flew a 46-member-strong troupe of the European parliamentarians and staff from some foreign missions and Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) to assess the situation in Kashmir — for the first time after stripping Jammu and Kashmir of its special status on 5 August.
