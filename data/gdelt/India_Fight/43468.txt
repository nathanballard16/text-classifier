Over 190 nations agree to restore degraded land through national targets

NEW DELHI: Identifying land degradation as a serious global threat, over 190 countries on Friday agreed to achieve ‘land degradation neutrality’ by 2030 through a “national target for action” and vowed to ensure that the efforts in this direction do not affect land tenure rights of local population, including forest dwellers and women, anywhere in the world.The countries also adopted a ‘New Delhi Declaration’, identifying multiple measures to restore degraded land globally, on the concluding day of the UN conference (COP14) on combating desertification in Greater Noida.The countries will, however, have to mobilise a huge sum of $300 billion to step up the restoration exercise - a task which may not be possible without involving small and medium private enterprises for commercially viable sustainable land management.“There is need to incentivise investments in land restoration,” said Ibrahim Thiaw, executive secretary of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), while listing out his four takeaways from the COP14.Investing in land to bring carbon back to the soil, countries’ seriousness towards the issue of drought preparedness and putting “people first” to make the task of land restoration successful are the other three takeaways of the UNCCD chief.Since the countries during the conference discussed the issue of land tenure security in the context of land restoration, India’s environment minister Prakash Javadekar insisted on his country’s commitment to give land titles to all “legitimate” forest dwellers.“The government believes and is committed to give land titles to all legitimate forest dwellers. In the strategy for forest development, tribals and dwellers are a part of it as they live and protect the forest. We have allotted in last five years millions of land titles,” said Javadekar, president of the COP (Conference of Parties) under the UNCCD.He was responding to a question on India’s Supreme Court order that in February directed eviction of more than a million tribal families and traditional forest dwellers from forestlands.“When the first decision of the Supreme Court came, we immediately filed the affidavit in favour of forest rights and that decision was stayed by the court itself. So, our position is very clear. Tribals and forest dwellers are part of the forest development strategy as they protect and nurture the forests,” said Javadekar while addressing a concluding press conference on COP14.The 12-point ‘New Delhi Declaration’ took note of India’s seven initiatives undertaken for sustainable use of land. These initiatives include central schemes like national afforestation programme, Har Khet Ko Pani (water for irrigation to every farm), More Crop Per Drop (water use efficiency in agriculture), rural employment guarantee and Soil Health Cards among others.The outcome of the 12-day COP14 will get traction in the upcoming UN climate action summit in New York on September 23 as it emphasised on “land-based solutions for climate action and biodiversity conservation and the mutually supportive implementation of the three Rio conventions”.The three conventions - climate change , land and biodiversity - originated as an outcome of the 1992 Earth Summit at Rio de Janeiro.
