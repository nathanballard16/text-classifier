Modi's Party Claims Pakistan Behind Time's Article Calling PM 'Divider-in-Chief'

While berating Indian Congress president Rahul Gandhi for retweeting the article, Patra praised the “reforming, performing and transforming” agenda of the Modi government.

The BJP spokesman’s remarks come after Time magazine’s yet-to-be-released international edition featured the “India's Divider-in-Chief” headline on its cover, where Prime Minister Modi was also depicted; a secondary headline on the cover reads “Modi the Reformer”.

The article's author is Aatish Taseer, the son of late Pakistani politician and businessman Salmaan Taseer and Indian journalist Tavleen Singh.
