India's Defence Minister Warns Pakistan After Taking Part in Yoga Session with Naval Personnel

He said everyone across the world knows what will happen to terrorists should they choose to strike.

"Not only in India, the whole world knows what will happen to terrorists", the defence minister said.

Sharing the excitement of participating in a yoga session on board the aircraft carrier on Sunday morning, Singh credited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for giving an ancient physical, mental, and spiritual practice like yoga international recognition.

"He [Narendra Modi] presented this resolution (on Yoga) at the United Nations, and it received the support of 177 countries. In almost all countries, there is a substantial population which practices yoga", Singh said.

Commissioning the Indian Naval Ship (INS) Khandheri, a Scorpene-class attack submarine, off the coast of Mumbai city on Saturday, Singh said Pakistan needs to be aware of India's greater defence preparedness and abstain from making nuclear war threats.

He was responding to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan's vitriolic and Pakistan-centric address at the 74the UN General Assembly session on 27 September.

"Pakistan needs to understand that the Indian Navy has become much stronger with the commissioning of the INS Khanderi. They should know our capabilities, and [that] we can use them if required", Singh stated.

He said the Indian Navy wants to build a "sense of confidence and mutual trust with all big and small nations in the Indian Ocean Region".

Tensions between India and Pakistan have been high over the last seven months following a suicide bomb attack on a security convoy in the Kashmir Valley, that claimed the lives of 40 Indian troopers.
