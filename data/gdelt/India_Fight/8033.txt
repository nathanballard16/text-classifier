#MeToo: Kriti Sanon on Sajid Khan's replacement for Housefull 4: Didn't want it to affect final product

Last year, several Bollywood celebs were called out for their sexual misconduct towards women. It led to the beginning of #MeToo movement in India. Names like Sajid Khan, Nana Patekar, Kailash Kher, Rajat Kapoor, Vikas Bahl, Alok Nath and many others were exposed in the Me Too movement. At that time, Sajid Khan was shooting for Housefull 4 which starred Akshay Kumar and Kriti Sanon in the lead roles. The film also had Nana Patekar in a pivotal role.

However, after the Me Too allegations on them, Sajid Khan was replaced by Farhad Samji as the director and Nana Patekar was replaced by Rana Daggubati. In an interview with PTI, Kriti Sanon was asked about the allegations on Nana and Sajid and how they shot the film. The Dilwale actress answered, "It was weird to be on set with all that going on. Someone else directing us suddenly in the middle of the film. But I give it to producer Sajid Nadiadwala sir, he took certain decisions and handled it very well. We didn’t stop shooting for more than two days."

She added, "We finished our schedule a day before we were supposed to finish. That way, we all just wanted to make the film in a good manner and make sure all of this doesn’t affect the final product. A film once made is out forever. We were together in it."

Kriti also shared that they shot major sequences including the interval and climax again. "These sequences are usually crazy because the entire star cast is together. Our producer took the call of spending that extra money, to reshoot scenes, with no fault of his," stated Sanon.
