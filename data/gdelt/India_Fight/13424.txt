The Economic Pressures Behind the Latest India-Pakistan Clash

This latest Kashmir crisis has shined a spotlight on the outfits that have mostly escaped the crackdown, such as Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba (Army of the Pure). These groups are the products of the CIA-funded mujahideen, who fought the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan four decades ago and firmed up Pakistan’s use of proxy forces. After Russian troops departed, the jihadis turned their attention toward Kashmir, intensifying the long-standing conflict. New Delhi and Washington say the leaders of both organizations live openly in Pakistan. Despite multiple arrests since 2001, Hafiz Saeed, the alleged planner of the 2008 Mumbai attacks and co-founder of Lashkar-e-Taiba, goes about his business in Lahore. Pakistan’s government says it has no concrete evidence with which to charge him, prompting disbelief in India. The Financial Action Task Force, a global watchdog in Paris, criticized Pakistan in February for making “limited progress” on a plan to combat terrorism financing eight months after the country was placed on a watchlist that could lead to serious consequences for the nation’s banks to do business abroad.
