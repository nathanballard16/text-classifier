On the sidelines

The sweets that Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj offered to her Pakistani counterpart must have sweetened the tone and tenor of Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi during their informal meeting on the sidelines of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation’s (SCO) Council of Foreign Ministers meeting in Kyrgyzstan’s capital Bishkek on Wednesday. But had Sushma cared for a bite from the sweets she had brought, she probably would not have refused to stand next to Shah Mehmood Qureshi for a formal group photo at the end of the moot. Her conduct was uncalled for and in bad taste.It is, therefore, unreasonable optimism to take the handshake between the two representatives of the traditional South Asian foes to mean the melting of ice or as a sign of de-escalation of tensions between the two neighbours. However, Qureshi really conducted himself well during the meeting.According to a note issued by the Foreign Office of Pakistan, both the foreign ministers ‘discussed matters of mutual interests’ and Qureshi is reported to have said that “we’ve however reiterated our desire for peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues between the two countries.” However, the Indian media, quoting their ministry of external affairs, said that “there was no meeting between them” and the two leaders only exchanged pleasantries.The recent escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India came in the wake of the terrorist attack in the Pulwama area of India-occupied Kashmir on February 14 which left 40 personnel of India’s Central Reserve Police Force dead. India blamed Pakistan-based outfits for the attack, and tried some failed air strikes inside Pakistan on February 26. The Pakistan Air Force retaliated and shot down an Indian MIG-21 and captured the Indian pilot who was later handed over to India on March 1.With the BJP set to secure a second term following Thursday’s election results, it is difficult to predict what directions the Pakistan-India relations may take in the future. However, many in Pakistan believe that it is easier to settle issues with New Delhi if there is a hardliner at the helm there, and Narendra Modi is one such person.Published in The Express Tribune, May 24, 2019.Like Opinion & Editorial on Facebook , follow @ETOpEd on Twitter to receive all updates on all our daily pieces.
