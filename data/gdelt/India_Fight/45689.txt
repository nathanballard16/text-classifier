Two accused in toll plaza case get bail

MADURAI

The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday granted bail to two accused in the Tirumangalam toll plaza gun fire incident. A man had opened fire at the toll plaza in Kappalur, following an altercation between his group and toll plaza employees on August 29.

Justice G.R. Swaminathan granted bail to K. Karthikeyan and K. Ragupathi, arrayed as accused number 4 and 6 in the case. The petitioners, in their plea, refuted the allegations levelled against them. Earlier, their bail petitions filed before the Principal Sessions Judge were dismissed.

The Madurai district police arrested six persons in connection with the case after one of them opened fire at the toll plaza in Kappalur near Tirumangalam. The police had seized four pistols, 15 live rounds and an SUV from them.

It was said that one C. Dhanasekaran and others were returning to Madurai from Tirunelveli, when they picked a quarrel with employees at the toll plaza. One from the group, P. Sasikumar, is said to have opened fire in the air.

The police nabbed the accused when they were trying to get away. Dhanasekaran, Sasikumar, Ragupathi, Karthikeyan, Harikrishnan and Raja were arrested and remanded in judicial custody.
