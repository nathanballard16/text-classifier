A question of side effects

The Chennai City Traffic Police (CCTP) blocked the intersection of Grand Southern Trunk Road and Station Road at Tambaram Sanatorium to reduce congestion. Though the move brought about the desired result, some road users were not happy.

The arrangement

As per the traffic plan, motorists coming from Station Road and heading towards Chennai International Airport have to drive through GST Road and take a U-turn at the MEPZ. And motorists coming from MEPZ and heading towards Sanatorium have to take the MIT Flyover.

The violation

However, to avoid taking a detour, some motorists come in the wrong direction by entering the service lane of the foot overbridge (near MEPZ) and proceed towards Station Road. Similarly, motorists coming from Tambaram Sanatoriumn proceed through the lane to go to West Tambaram. They should proceed through the MEPZ signal.

Route numbers M18G and 500A from Hasthinapuram bus terminus ply through Rajendra Prasad Road, Chitlapakkam Main Road, Chitlapakkam Second Main Road, Tambaram Sanatorium Flyover, and Grand Southern Trunk Road to go to Guduvancherry and Chengalpattu.

After the intersection of GST Road and Station Road was closed by placing barricades, drivers of these route numbers proceed towards the terminus through Madras Institute of Technology Flyover, Chitlapakkam Main Road and Rajendra Prasad Road. The buses should go to the terminus through Station Road, Tambaram Sanatorium Flyover, Chitlapakkam Second Main Road, Chitlapakkam Main Road and Rajendra Prasad Road.

As a result, commuters and residents of Chitlapakkam and Tambaram Sanatorium are put to lot of inconvenience.

“Commuters have to depend on their own mode of transport from Hasthinapuram bus terminus to Chitlapakkam and Tambaram Sanatorium. It is a waste of time and money for them,” says L. Sundararaman, president, Chitlapakkam Muthulakshmi Nagar Welfare Association.
