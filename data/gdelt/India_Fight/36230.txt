Kareena Kapoor Khan poses with the 'Buooooyyyz' on the sets of Dance India Dance & she is truly a diva

Kareena Kapoor Khan has been going places, quite literally, for her upcoming television debut show, Dance India Dance. She has been constantly torn between her movie in London and shoots here in Mumbai, however, she has indeed been balancing both just fine. For two episodes, she also found guest judges for the show in the form of actors Karisma Kapoor and Malaika Arora, and while the episode with Karisma was a total hit, upcoming episode with Malaika looks fun as well.

Now, host Karan Wahit shared a picture on his social media which features Kareena, judges Bosco Marti and Raftaar along with himself and well, it has us waiting up for the upcoming episode of the show. Karan captioned the picture as "BUOOooyyyyZZZ with The DIVA," and while the we totally get the buoyz concept, we also agree on the DIVA part because she is truly one.
