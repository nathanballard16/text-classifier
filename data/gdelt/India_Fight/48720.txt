Haryana ranks third (next only to Kerala, Delhi) as regards crime rate across all states and union territories, says the recent report of National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB).

Edit: Short on expectation

Crime rate means the number of crime cases per lakh of population. Offences under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), special and local laws are taken into account for calculating the crime rate. Kerala recorded a crime rate of 1,818.4 in 2017 (1.84 lakh crime cases), while it was 1,107.1 in case of Delhi (2.44 lakh cases). Haryana recorded a crime rate of 802.9 (2.24 lakh cases), an increase of 57.1 per cent over the numbers for 2016.

Nagaland had the lowest crime rate of 64.4, while the all-India rate stood at 388.6.

In 2017, Haryana recorded 1,072 murders and 1,099 rapes. The state registered 2,408 cases of rioting, 26,234 thefts, 1,277 robberies, 196 dacoities, 4,169 cases of crime against children and 2,200 cases under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. In 2016, Haryana ranked fifth on the crime rate table. As regards crime against women, Haryana ranked fifth in the country with 88.7 such cases per lakh of women population. Assam (143.3), Delhi (133.3), Telangana (94.7) and Odisha (94.5) ranked ahead of Haryana on the list.

In 2017, Haryana reported 11,370 cases of crime against women—an increase of 15.56 per cent over 2016 figures. In 2016, the state had ranked sixth. Nagaland was the safest for women.
