Army jawan martyred, 3 others injured as Pakistan violates ceasefire in J-K's Rajouri

An Army soldier was killed and three others injured as Pakistan violated the ceasefire for the second consecutive day along the LoC in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district on Monday, officials said.

The incident occurred in Keri Battal forward area and further details are awaited, they said.

The martyred jawan was identified as rifleman Karamjeet Singh.

Around 5.30 am, the Pakistani Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by resorting to shelling mortars bombs and firing of small arms along the LoC in Sunderbani Sector of Rajouri district Monday, a defence spokesman said.

He said the Indian Army retaliated effectively. The firing which began at about 5:30 a.m stopped at about 7:15 am.

Border skirmishes witnessed a spurt after India's preemptive air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp in Pakistan's Balakot on February 26 following the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.

Four civilians, including three members of a family, were killed and several others injured as Pakistan targeted dozens of villages in over 100 incidents of ceasefire violations along the LoC in the state, especially in the twin districts of Poonch and Rajouri, since then.

Earlier, on 6:30 pm on Sunday Pakistan violated ceasefire here evoking an effective reply from the Indian Army. This comes after Pakistan on Wednesday violated ceasefire in Poonch sector of the state. Earlier, Pakistani Rangers also initiated an unprovoked ceasefire violation in Chakkan da Bagh crossing point where the Line of Control trade centre is located.
