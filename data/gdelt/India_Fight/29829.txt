2 held for slitting man’s throat at Grain Market

Ludhiana: The police on Wednesday claimed to have solved the June 10 murder of a labourer in Grain Market with the arrest of two.

Jatin Malhotra, 23, a resident of Bhora village, and Rishavpreet Singh, 30, of Bhagwan Das Colony were nabbed near Jalandhar Bypass while they were trying to flee.

The two have confessed to have killed 50-year-old Vishnu Yadav, a resident of Salem Tabri.

Vishnu was talking on phone outside his rented accommodation when the two, who were driving recklessly, suddenly slammed on their bike brakes close to him. After Vishnu had a close shave, he told off the duo, which angered them. “When Vishnu told the recklessly-driving duo to go slow, they slit his throat with a knife and fled,” said commissioner of police Sukhchain Singh Gill.

The accused earlier worked at the parking lot of Grain Market. Two months ago, they quit their job and had been unemployed since then. Both of them are school dropouts.

Vishnu worked as a labourer at the Grain Market and lived in a one-room rented accommodation nearby.

Salem Tabri police station SHO inspector Vijay Kumar said, “Jatin was lodged in jail for stealing a motorcycle. He came out on bail a few months ago. We suspect Jatin and Rishavpreet are involved in snatching and theft cases, else why would they roam around the city armed with knives. We are checking their criminal record.”
