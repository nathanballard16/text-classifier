CBI raids on Hooda: Congress warns officials of accountability in next govt

Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma on Friday issued a veiled warning to government officials by insinuating that those working at the behest of their "political masters" would be held accountable in next government.

Reacting on the CBI raids at former chief minister BS Hooda's residence, Sharma said: "Officials must hear this. Governments do not have any permanency. There are few weeks left for the general elections to begin. It is certain that this government is rattled, the Prime Minister is staring at an imminent defeat, that's why these actions."

"When the new government resumes office, all such actions which have been at the behest of the political masters of today to harass, intimidate, frame and defame, even the charges, they will be held to account and they will have to answer," Sharma said while addressing a press conference here.

Emphasising that the government wants to silence the Opposition through these raids, Sharma added, "We realise the timing and intent behind this action. People will also see through it. Today is the last working day before Jind by-elections. Today former Chief Minister Hooda was scheduled to address a rally there in support of Congress candidate Randeep Surjewala. We demand the government to reveal what new facts have come to light which led to these raids."

The CBI today carried out raids at the residence of Hooda and other officials, and also lodged a fresh case against the former Haryana Chief Minister in connection with the alleged irregularities in the acquisition of land in Haryana.

The investigating agency conducted raids in over 20 places including in Chandigarh, Rohtak, New Delhi, Gurgaon and Mohali with respect to the land acquisition irregularities.
