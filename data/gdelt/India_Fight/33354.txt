Ahmedabad: Ex-BJP MP, 6 others held guilty in RTI activist's murder

AHMEDABAD: A special CBI court on Friday held former BJP MP Dinu Bogha Solanki and six others guilty of killing RTI activist Amit Jethava in July 2010 in front of the Gujarat high court campus.The court recorded conviction under sections 302 and 120B of the IPC, murder and criminal conspiracy, amid hostility from most of the witnesses whose statements before the CBI had some bearing on the case. Looking at the string of hostile witnesses and allegations of threat from Solanki, the high court had ordered fresh trial when the CBI court was on the verge of completion of the trial. 105 witnesses had turned hostile.The Supreme Court intervened and ordered the trial court for fresh examination of eye witnesses. The witnesses turned hostile again.The special judge K M Dave has based his conclusion that Solanki and six others are guilty mainly on the Test Identification parade and the reason to identify the accused during the parade. Moreover, the testimony of witness Rama Haja proved vital for the case, who had earlier given a statement under section 164 of the CrPC before judicial magistrate. He stood firm to his version, while all others chose to retract their statements upon entering the witness box, said special prosecutor Mukesh Kapadia.Amidst hostility of witnesses, the high court changed the judicial officer in this case. At the fag end of the trial, the judge recalled six witnesses from telecom companies. The court ascertained the location of callers. The accused legally fought hard against the court’s decision to recall witnesses.The case has always been controversial with local police appearing reluctant to take action against Solanki. Inaction against Solanki was the reason that the high court transferred the case to CBI.A month before his murder, Jethava had filed a PIL in the high court alleging Solanki of illegal mining inside the protected Gir sanctuary.The judge has posted the matter on July 11 for sentencing the convicts.
