4 of Sikh family shot dead at Ohio home; ‘not hate crime’, says Sushma Swaraj

Four members of a Sikh family, including a relative visiting from Punjab were found shot dead at their home in West Chester, Ohio state Sunday night, police said.

West Chester Police Chief Joel Herzog told reporters the victims were found by another relative who called the police. “My wife and my family are bleeding ... they’re on the ground and they’re bleeding,” the family member said on the 911 call that was released by the police.

External affairs minister Sushma Swaraj said one of the deceased was an Indian national on a visit to US while others were persons of Indian origin.

“The matter is under investigation by the Police but it is not a hate crime. Our Consul General in New York is coordinating with the concerned authorities and will keep me informed,” Sushma Swaraj tweeted.

West Chester police had not identified the victims, but a local news publication, The Enquirer, reported they were Hakikat Singh Panag, his wife Paramjit Kaur, their adult daughter Shalinder Kaur and his sister-in-law Amarjit Kaur. The 911 call is believed to have been made by Panag’s son-in-law.

Police have not given details or the motive of the crime. There were no indications if it was hate crime. No suspect has been identified.

An official of the local Guru Nanak Society of Greater Cincinnati, which held a prayer service Monday, said that the victims had been shot in the head. The official also said one of the victims was a relative visiting from Punjab, India, probably Amarjit Kaur.
