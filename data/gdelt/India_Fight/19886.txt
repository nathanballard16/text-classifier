Thunderstorm likely today

Ludhiana: Residents continue to grapple with hot weather, as both day and night temperature in the city remained above normal. However, the good news is that the Met department predicts weather disturbance in the next two days. As per the department, the maximum temperature on Wednesday was recorded at 37 degrees Celsius (4 degrees above normal), while the maximum temperature on Tuesday was 34.5 degrees (a degree above normal). The minimum temperature in the city on Wednesday was also witnessed on the higher side at 21.6 degrees (five degrees above normal) and 3.3 degrees more than on Tuesday.

Even as hot weather prevailed in the city on Wednesday, the Met department predicts weather disturbance in the next two days. “There are chances of intermittent thunderstorm in the next two days, and it may drizzle as well on Thursday. During this time, the day as well as night temperatures are expected to increase slightly,” said Chandigarh Met department director Surender Paul. The department website predicts a gradual rise in maximum temperature up to 38 degrees until Sunday, and the minimum temperature is also expected to rise to 24 degrees until the same day.

With the temperatures increasing, residents were seen battling the warm conditions. “It is getting hot with every passing day. The way the temperatures are rising, we fear the day temperature may rise up to 40 degrees in April itself. Though we are yet to use air conditioners, we might have to use them soon, as it is getting uncomfortably hot,” said Suresh Kumar, a trader of Civil Lines.

Elderly people also are bearing the brunt of the weather in the city. “We cannot even think of going out after 10am in the morning, as by then the sun has already heated up the atmosphere, and one can suffer sunburn. I go to market in the evening, as it is boring to sit at home throughout the day,” said Surjeet Singh, an elderly person from Pakhowal Road.
