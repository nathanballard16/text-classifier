On Thursday, Akshay Kumar and Katrina Kaif headed to Hyderabad for a month-long schedule of their upcoming film, Sooryavanshi directed by Rohit Shetty. A Mumbai Mirror report suggested that the Hyderabad schedule kickstarted with a romantic song shot between the leads. Moreover, they will also be shooting for high-octane action sequences at the popular Ramoji Film City. Talking about it, a source had said to the tabloid, "This one is the film’s longest schedule. Rohit plans to wrap it up before he leaves for Bulgaria."

Now as per reports in PeepingMoon.com, the romantic song picturised on Akshay and Katrina are not going to be an original song. Yes, it's set to be the recreated version of Akshay's sizzling hot song with Raveena Tandon 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani' from their 1994 hit film Mohra. An interesting fact is that like 'Tip Tip Barsa Paani', Akshay and Katrina also did a hot song 'Gale Lag Ja' in the film De Dana Dan.
