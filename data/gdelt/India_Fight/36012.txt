Allu Arjun slapped with fine by Cyberabad police for violating rules

Allu Arjun has always urged his fans to follow the traffic rules. However, he was caught by the Cyberabad police officials for violating one of the traffic rules. In 2012, the Supreme Court of India had banned the use of tinted glass on vehicles under the Motor Vehicle Act.

The S/O Satyamurthy star recently flaunted his swanky new caravan worth Rs 7 crore. On July 16, the caravan was spotted by a citizen named Mohammad Abdul Azam near Himayat Nagar in Hyderabad. He took photos of the caravan and had alerted the Cyberabad police about the use of tinted glass.

Allu Arjun's vanity van named Falcon is completely covered with black tinted glass to block visibility from outside. The Cyberabad police investigated the issue and with the help of the vehicle registration number TS 09 FG 6666, found that it belonged to Allu Arjun.

The Cyberabad police issued a challan of Rs 735, which the actor could pay using their web portal. The incident took place nearly 10 days ago, but it has made it to the headlines only recently.

Allu Arjun spent a fortune in designing his dream caravan, which is tailor-made for him. When he released photos of the interiors, its grandeur caught everyone's attention.
