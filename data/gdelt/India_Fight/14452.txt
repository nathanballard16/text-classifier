Christian Michel, an alleged middleman in the controversial AgustaWestland chopper deal, says a top former CBI officer warned him his life would be made hell if he returned to India.

That officer, Michel told a Delhi court on Tuesday, was former Special Director Rakesh Asthana -- who was sent on forced leave by the government last year after his public feud with Alok Verma, the former CBI director.

Michel said Rakesh Asthana spoke to him last May in Dubai. (Asthana was handling Christian Michel's extradition and supervising the AgustaWestland investigation.)

The British national was explaining why, as a man accused of a white collar crime, he should not be jailed with murderers and terrorists.

But authorities in Tihar jail said terror suspects from Kashmir and Pakistan were not in the block were Christian Michel was imprisoned.

The Patiala House Court has asked the jail authorities to submit records of Michel's stay in prison and his transfers between barracks, as well as CCTV footage. Michel has alleged he was tortured and harassed.

Christian Michel was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate on December 22 last year after his extradition from Dubai.

He is among the three alleged middlemen being probed in the scam by the ED and the CBI.
