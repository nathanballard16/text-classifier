In a scripted answer, the minister also informed the House that the government is also taking necessary diplomatic steps in this regard.

“BSF also agreed to bring down the border killing at zero level. The killing of Bangladeshis by BSF has reduced largely comparing to the last year,” Kamal also added.

Responding to a query by treasury bench MP Ashim Kumar Ukil (Netrokona-3), the minister said BGB has taken various steps for confidence building among the bordering people and the border guards of the two countries which is helping easing tension along the border.

Besides, the minister also informed the House that the BGB has identified 328 kilometres as “sensitive areas” for setting up the surveillance system in the border areas.

“Modern cameras and surveillance system will be set up in those sensitive areas gradually,” he also said.
