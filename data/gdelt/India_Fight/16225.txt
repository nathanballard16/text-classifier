Pakistani troops have allegedly violated the ceasefire over 110 times along the Line of Control since January, PTI reported. The border skirmishes increased after India claimed to have launched an air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammed terror camp in Balakot, Pakistan, on February 26 in response to the February 14 Pulwama attack that killed 40 personnel of the Central Reserve Police Force.
