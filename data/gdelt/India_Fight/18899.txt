Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon are each other’s wardrobe critics during Luka Chuppi promotions

Luka Chuppi effortlessly managed to create a huge buzz amongst the audiences and in a blink of an eye the film was tagged a big hit! Guddu and Rashmi’s chemistry was impeccable in the film, touching up on concepts like modern-day relationships, family and more. Kriti Sanon and Kartik Aaryan had a well-curated wardrobe for each promotional event of Luka Chuppi. While Kriti went experimental with her wardrobe channelling boho-chic vibes, florals and statement wears, Kartik played it safe with casuals.

Kriti Sanon sported some really stunning ensembles which totally gave us major summer outfit inspirations! From floor-length maxis to conceptual dresses to donning a pair of denims and t-shirt, Kriti totally nailed all her looks. On the other hand, Kartik looked super cool with casuals denims, shirts and some pop of colours. Prints and jackets seemed to be his go-to fashion choices.

After the success of Luka Chuppi, the actors have moved on with their upcoming projects. While Kriti Sanon has her next film, Arjun Patiala with Diljit Dosanjh, Kartik Aaryan is shooting for Aaj Kal with Sara Ali Khan.
