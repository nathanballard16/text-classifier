LUDHIANA: A 20-year-old man was found brutally murdered at Sundar Nagar Chowk in Mundiya on Sunday morning.Rajinder Singh, 20, a drug addict, was undergoing de-addiction treatment at a Hoshiarpur centre. He had been missing from his house since Saturday.Police said Rajinder’s right ear and nose were chopped off and throat slit. “His face was covered with a handkerchief and froth was coming out of his mouth,” a cop added.Rajinder’s father Deepak Kumar, 53, a resident of Beant Colony in Mundiya, said in his police complaint, “I have three children, including two sons and a daughter. As both my sons were drug addicts, I got them admitted to a de-addiction centre at our native place, Hoshiarpur’s Mahalpur village, eight months ago.”On August 8, Rajinder, a Class XII pass-out, came home to meet his family. “He left house for some work on Saturday afternoon and when he did not return till late night, we called him up on his cellphone many a time, but it was switched off. We looked for him everywhere, but our search bore no result. On Sunday morning, a neighbour told that a body was found at Sundar Nagar Chowk near a liquor vend and that it bore resemblance to my younger son Rajinder.”The family rushed to the spot and identified the body as that of Rajinder.Mundiya police post in-charge assistant sub-inspector Harbhajan Singh said, “It seems rivalry led to the man’s brutal murder. His family has given names of some suspects. They are residents of Ganpati Nagar, where the family lived earlier. It is suspected that the man was murdered somewhere else and his body dumped here. We are scrutinising the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area.”A case under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC has been registered.
