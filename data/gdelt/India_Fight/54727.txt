Kudos Telangana police for quick justice in Disha rape-murder case

Dear Editor,

It was indeed heartening to witness school-girls from school-buses cheering Telangana Police for quick justice done in recent horrible rape-cum-murder case of vet-doctor in Hyderabad. BSP supremo Mayawati deserves all compliments for echoing public-voice in demanding UP Police to follow Telangana Police hinting at recent Unnao episode where rape-accused released on bail tried to burn alive the rape-victim.

Chief Justice of India should order probe in role of magistrate, police-lawyers and police-persons involved in recent Unnao-case case where rape-accused were given easy bail to make them burn alive the rape-victim who is now battling for life. All these persons should be suspended till probe is over with strict-most action and punishment, to be a lesson for others. Our poor-most justice-delivery-system is responsible when time may not be far when people may start taking law in hands when rapist Akku Yadav was lynched to death by about 200 women on 13.08.2004 outside court-room in Nagpur because of poor justice-delivery-system which grants easy bail to rapists.

President of India should wake up to immediately reject mercy-petitions of infamous Nirbhaya rape-accused so that countrymen may celebrate their hanging on coming 16th December, the date on which heinous crime was committed.
