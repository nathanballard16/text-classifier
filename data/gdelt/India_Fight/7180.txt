New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday refused to allow reopening of Vedanta's Sterlite plant in Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu but granted it liberty to approach the high court.

A bench headed by Justice R F Nariman said it allowing Tamil Nadu's appeal against the National Green Tribunal (NGT) order only on grounds of maintainability.

It said NGT has no jurisdiction to order reopening of the plant.

The court was hearing a plea by Vedanta group seeking a direction to Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board to implement the NGT order which had set aside the government's decision to close the plant.

There were violent protests in May 2018 against the closure of the Sterlite unit.

At least 13 protesters were killed when the police opened fire on a demonstration against the copper smelter.
