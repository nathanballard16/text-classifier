Congress Demands Amit Shah's Resignation Over Yediyurappaâ€™s Leaked Karnataka Revolt Audio

New Delhi:

The Congress has upped the ante and demanded Union Home Minister Amit Shah’s resignation over the leaked audio clip of Karnataka Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa, in which he is heard saying that it was the BJP president who supervised the Karnataka lawmakers' revolt that led to the collapse of Congress-JD(S) government earlier this year.

The Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee (KPCC) has submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind through Governor of Karnataka demanding dismissal of Yediyurappa government and Home Minister Amit Shah from council of ministers "in the interest of democracy".

Speaking to reporters about the purported audio clip, senior Congress leader and former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah said that Amit Shah and Yediyurappa hatched a conspiracy to kill the democracy and have not right to remain on their respective posts.

"What he and Amit Shah did was conspiracy to murder democracy & a violation of the Constitution. Both the Chief Minister and Home Minister have no right to hold a constitutional post,” Siddaramaiah told reporters in Bangalore.

In the said audio clip, Yediyurappa is heard saying that it BJP national president Amit Shah who "supervised and made all arrangements" for the 17 Karnataka lawmakers, who carried out a mutiny against their own government led by HD Kumaraswamy.

"You do know, don't you, that it wasn't Yediyurappa who made them take this decision. The national president was aware of this and supervised this and made all arrangements. You do know this? You do know, don't you, about the decision of 17 people - they were away in Mumbai for two-three months and were not able to go to their constituencies or see their families. You do know that, don't you?" the Chief Minister is heard saying in the audio clip.

"Unusually, they helped us, who should have been on the opposition for the rest of the term. They helped us become the ruling party. They gave their resignation as MLAs, went to the Supreme Court. Knowing all this - we should stand by them, come what may," he said.

"But none of you has said this. I did not expect this from you. I am sorry. I didn't need to become CM (Chief Minister). I have been CM three or four times. I have seen this. I now feel I have committed a crime by becoming CM after making them have faith in me," Yediyurappa said.

According to NDTV, when asked about the audio clip, Yediyurappa didn't question its authenticity and said that he was speaking to BJP workers "in the interest of the party".
