HC tells lower court to ensure no delay in trial of 2010 case

Move comes after victim’s father sought speedy trial

The Delhi High Court has directed a local court here to ensure that the trial in a 2010 murder case, in which a 22-year-old man was killed, is not unnecessarily delayed.

Justice A.K. Chawla also asked the trial court Judge to ensure that no unnecessary adjournments are granted in the case.

The High Court’s order came on a plea by the father of the victim Umesh Singh, seeking a speedy trial in his son’s murder case in which the chargesheet was filed eight years ago.

The father’s counsel submitted that the case was listed 37 times before the trial court and it was being delayed due to non-availability of either the accused persons’ counsel or the Special Public Prosecutor.

Additional status report

The High Court also asked the police to file an additional status report regarding the execution of a non-bailable warrant issued by the trial court against an accused who had failed to appear before it. It also directed the investigating officer/ Station House Officer to remain present before the court on May 30, the next date of hearing.

The police said all the prosecution witnesses in the case have already been examined by the trial court. A status report submitted by the trial court Judge stated that one of the accused, Praveen Nagar, absented on the last hearing and NBW has been issued against him.

According to the petition, Kamal, a Delhi University student, was murdered by five persons near a gurudwara in Sonia Vihar in north-east Delhi on July 12, 2010. The victim was taken to GTB Hospital where he was declared brought dead.

The police had said 76 injuries were inflicted on the victim’s head, legs and hands with a sharp and blunt object.

The plea said due to non-conclusion of the trial and adjournments being sought by parties, the rights of the victim’s father have been greatly prejudiced and have caused a miscarriage of justice.
