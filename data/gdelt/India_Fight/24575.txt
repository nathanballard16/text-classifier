Swara Bhasker's befitting reply to Modi bhakt who sneakily recorded video with her

Mumbai: Bollywood actor Swara Bhasker, who is known for her outspoken nature and political views, has recently given a befitting reply to a Modi bhakt. The 'Veere Di Wedding' actor showed the mirror to Modi supporter who sneakily shot a video with her by saying "Aayega toh Modi hi."

Apparently, a man who turned out to be a Modi bhakt took a selfie video with Swara and passed a comment to criticise her. He titled the video, 'epic beizzati' and posted it on Twitter.

However, Swara Bhasker, who has been disliking Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) gave him a befitting reply on Twitter. She wrote, "A guy asks for a selfie @ airport; I oblige ‘coz I don’t discriminate people who want selfies based on their politics. He sneakily shoots a video. Tacky & underhand tactics r trademarks of bhakts. I’m unsurprised. But always glad 2 make bhakts feel like their lives are worthwhile".

Well, this is indeed a strong move from Swara's side. After all, the actress has been campaigning against BJP candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur who is accused in Malegaon blasts case.
