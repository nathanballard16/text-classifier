SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Unidentified gunmen on Saturday evening shot dead an off-duty trooper in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.

The trooper belonging to army was attacked at Warpora village of Sopore town, about 50 km west of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"This evening unidentified gunmen fired upon Muhammad Rafeeq Yatoo, a trooper from a point-blank range at his residence at Warpora here," a police official posted in Sopore told Xinhua.

"Though he was immediately removed to hospital, the doctors there declared him brought dead."

According to police, the trooper was at home on leave.

Following the incident, contingents of police and troopers rushed to the spot and launched a manhunt to nab the attackers.

Police suspect involvement of militants in the killing.

Militants in the region usually target families and individuals for their possible links with police and defense agencies. Even people having associations with pro-India political parties and police are targeted at times.

A guerilla war is going on between militants and Indian troops stationed in the region since 1989.

Kashmir, divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their Independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.
