Capt giving memorial instead of justice to families of Sikh martyred in Bargari shooting case: Dharmavira Gandhi

PATIALA: Member Parliament and the Punjab Democratic Alliance candidate from Patiala Dr Dharmavira Gandhi trained his guns towards Captain Amarinder and Rahul Gandhi who had recently held a rally in Bargari. He blamed that both are doing politics in the name of martyrs instead of punishing the culprits of the Bargari firing In a reference to the announcement made by Capt Amarinder Singh to create a memorial for the youths who were killed in the Bargari firing during the Congress rally, Dr Gandhi said that the families of the Sikh soldiers who were martyred in the Bargari firing case should not only be remembered but they should have justice.Dr Gandhi said that the memory of those killed or injured in the shooting at Bargari will always remain in the hearts of families as well as the entire Sikh and Punjabi community . He said that Amarinder Singh shared the stage with Rahul Gandhi and mentioned all the things like the big Ghallughara, Chhota Ghalughara and Nankana Sahib Saka, but he conveniently forgot the attack of Indira Gandhi on Sri Darbar Sahib and Sri Akal Takht as well as the Sikh genocide in Delhi in the very presence of the scion of the same family responsible for those unforgettable incidents.“Amarinder in his speech claimed that the state head is responsible for any incident of shooting or event taking place in his reign. Now that he himself has been the head of the state for the last two years, he has failed to punish the culprits of Bargari. Both Captain and Badal are playing friendly matches in Punjab. He sent a weak candidate for the purpose of winning of Harsimrat Kaur Badal in Bathinda while Akali Dal fielded a weak candidate against Parneet Kaur in Patiala”, said Dr. Gandhi, adding that the Capt. Was the most failed CM of Punjab since he has not been able to curb drugs, sand mafia and not even gambling.“CM did a survey on illegal mining in Punjab via helicopter but he did not take any action against it since his very own blue eyed MLAs are indulged in the illegal trade. The plunder and loot of Punjab done by Congress has crossed the records created by Akalis and Congress is setting new milestone of Mafia Raj”, he said.
