Hong Kong Court Favours Extradition of Indian Jailbreak Mastermind

A Hong Kong court has given the nod to the extradition of Indian jailbreak mastermind Ramanjit Singh, alias Romi - a key conspirator in the Nabha City jailbreak in the Punjab state.

"With the coordinated efforts of the Punjab Police and the Indian government, a Hong Kong court on Tuesday ruled in favour of the extradition of fugitive Ramanjit Singh alias Romi, the key conspirator in the Nabha Jail break, as well as several other major crimes," the government of Punjab stated late Tuesday night.

The government said that Romi, who was arrested in June 2016 in a weapons recovery and fake credit card case, got bail in August 2016. He later fled to Hong Kong in violation of the bail order conditions, it added.

The extradition proceedings against Ramanjit were initiated in 2018 after he was arrested by Hong Kong police in a robbery case. An Indian team of police officials visited Hong Kong and secured the provisional arrest of the fugitive, the statement said.
