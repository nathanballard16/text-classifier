Will contest from Varanasi if Congress president asks: Priyanka Gandhi

WAYANAD: Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi on Sunday said she will contest the Lok Sabha elections from Varanasi if asked by her brother and party president Rahul Gandhi.She said this just before departing from Wayanad in Kerala on a helicopter after winding up her two-day trip to the Lok Sabha constituency from where Rahul Gandhi is contesting, apart from his Amethi seat in Uttar Pradesh."I am ready to contest and will contest from Varanasi if Rahul Gandhi asks me," said Priyanka Gandhi, just before departing from here.Congress leadership has so far remained tight-lipped about speculation over Priyanka’s candidature.“Any decision in this regard will be communicated once it is finalised,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.Party sources said internal surveys have been conducted in Varanasi to assess the Congress’ strength in the seat.Priyanka formally entered party politics earlier this year and was appointed AICC general secretary in charge of UP East. Party sources said she was keen to take the field against Prime Minister in 2014 too.She is seen to be the most effective candidate to contest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi , who is seeking a second term from Varanasi.Even though a section of the Congress believes that this may be a losing battle for Priyanka — a risk the debutante should not be exposed to— others hope that her entry might pin PM Modi down in Varanasi, hamstringing BJP’s campaign.Much, however, will depend on how the UP gathbandhan reacts to the possibility of Priyanka’s candidature and whether it is agreeable to conceding the seat to Congress, should she decide to contest. In the division of seats between the gathbandhan partners, Varanasi is to be contested by Samajwadi Party, where it is yet to announce a candidate.Sources said this may not pose a major hurdle as Priyanka and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav have had a good working rapport since 2017, when Congress and SP entered into an alliance to contest the assembly polls in UP, and Priyanka’s candidature, if it comes through, may be seen as a means to sharpen the opposition onslaught on BJP.
