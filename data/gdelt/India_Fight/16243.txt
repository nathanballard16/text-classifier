Bollywood stars love to celebrate the festival of Holi with their friends and loved ones. Some like to throw big parties where the who’s who of Bollywood are invited while some like to keep it private with their loved ones. Speaking of this, seems like Varun Dhawan kept his Holi private with his ladylove, Natasha Dalal. The two celebrated the festival of colours with each other. Varun, who was in London for quite some time due to shoot of Street Dancer 3D, came back a few days ago.

Today, on the festival of Holi, Varun took to his Instagram story to wish his fans a happy Holi. However, he shared an adorable photo with Natasha in which the two can be seen posing holding hands. Natasha and Varun can be seen with colour all over their faces and look absolutely cute. Varun can be seen dressed casually in a white ganji with blue shorts and a pair of flip flops.

On the other hand, Natasha can be seen dressed in a white tank top with a striped trouser. The lovebirds celebrated Holi by smearing colour on each other’s faces.
