Ranveer Singh not in Meghna’s next, yet

After Chhapaak, Meghna to direct a film on Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw.

Rumours doing the rounds over the past few days in the trade have it that Ranveer has been approached by Meghna to star in her next film after Chhapaak starring Deepika Padukone.

Meghna has been signed on to direct a film on Field Marshal Sam Manekshaw. It will be bankrolled by Ronnie Screwvala. The trade claims that Ranveer has already heard the script and has given his nod to the biopic.

Known as Sam Bahadur for his work during the India-Pakistan war of 1971, he was the first Indian Army officer to be promoted to the rank of Field Marshal.

“The film has been written by Gulzaarsaab along with Bhavani Iyer and Shantanu Srivastava. The casting will be done only when Meghana completes her film with Deepika,” says a trade source.

However, another source close to the development of the film rubbishes the claims that Ranveer was doing the film. “Just because Ranveer is Deepika’s husband does not mean that all her producers will cast him in the same projects or other films that they are doing. These are just speculations and not true,” informs the source.

Meanwhile, the trade says that it is a matter of time now. “Both parties are busy now. Once Ranveer and Deepika return from their London event, things may be finalised. Deepika will be proceeding to Delhi to shoot with Meghna as well,” adds our trade source.

We will wait!
