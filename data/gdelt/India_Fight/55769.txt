Maldives Govt Denies Entry to Controversial Islamic Preacher Zakir Nair

New Delhi: The controversial Islamic preacher Zakir Naik tried to go to Maldives, but he could not succeed. The Maldives government did not allow him to enter his country. Maldives Parliament speaker M Nasheed has given information about this. It has been told in media reports that he said, in 2009 we had allowed Zakir Naik to come, at that time there was no dispute about him.

He said that, recently he tried to get a visa again, but the government refused to give him admission. We like preachers who teach good Islam, but if you spread hatred, we cannot allow it. Let me tell you that Zakir Naik was declared wanted in India in connection with serious charges related to terrorism after the name of the terrorist attack in Holi Artisan Bakery in Dhaka in July 2016. Naik is a fugitive and has taken refuge in Malaysia.

The 53-year-old Naik, the founder of the controversial Peace TV, was born in Mumbai. He has been living in Malaysia since 2017 after fleeing here and the previous government of Malaysia has also made Zakir a permanent resident. The current Malaysian government has not yet decided to send him back to India, but has stopped him from giving his public speeches.
