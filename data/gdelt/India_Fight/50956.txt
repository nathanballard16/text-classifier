Jammu And Kashmir: 2 Terrorists Killed In Bandipora Encounter, Arms And Ammunition Recovered

New Delhi:

At least two terrorists were killed in an encounter on Monday in Jammu and Kashmir’s Bandipora district. The gunfight started when security forces launched a search operation in Lawdara village following specific information about the presence of some terrorists. Officials say, the hiding ultras opened fire on the security personnel who retaliated. Police came to have recovered arms and ammunitions from the terrorists.

Last month, Abdul Hamid Lelhari, Al-Qaeda Kashmir unit chief and Zakir Musa's successor along with two other terrorists, were killed in an encounter with security forces in Anantnag district.

In June 2019, around two weeks after Zakir Musa was gunned down by security forces, al-Qaida affiliate Ansar Ghazwat-ul-Hind (AGH) had named Hamid Lelhari as its local commander. Lelhari was a native of Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama.

In July 2019, Lelhari had released a nearly six-minute-long video laying down principles for a proposed militant "shura". He had called for cooperation among various militant outfits operating in the state and a new representative militant council to take consensus decisions regarding military actions against India.
