Qureshi: Pakistan ready to consider returning Indian pilot if it leads to de-escalation

ISLAMABAD: In an unprecedented call for peace, Pakistan said it is ready to hand over captured Indian Air Force pilot, Wing Commander Abhinandan, to India.

Reiterating the message of peace, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said on Thursday:"If returning Wing Commander Abhinandan brings peace, we are definitely ready for it."

FM Qureshi also said Prime Minister Imran Khan is ready to hold talks with India. However, is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi ready, he questioned.

Regarding Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj attending the meeting of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) next month, Qureshi said, "India is neither a member of OIC nor an observer."

Qureshi stressed, "I will not hesitate to meet but OIC is not the forum for talks with Swaraj."

The foreign minister added that war is not a solution.

"After destruction, you also have to sit down for talks. Civilised dialogue is the only way forward.”

“India’s policy is not beneficial anymore. We are losing Kahsmiris,” he added.

The foreign minister continued, “India cannot solve the Kashmir issue through strength. We are ready to talk on the issues of Kashmir and terrorism with India. They can come and sit down and we will have a dialogue."

On Wednesday, Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was taken in custody as two fighter jets from India were shot down by Pakistan after they violated the Line of Control (LoC).
