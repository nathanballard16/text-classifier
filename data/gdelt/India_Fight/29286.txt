Nine-year-old Meerut girl raped and strangled to death, dumped in sewer

Meerut: Close on the heels of the gruesome murder of Aligarh girl which shook the nation’s conscience, another horrific rape and murder has come to light in west UP.

A nine-year-old girl was raped, strangled to death and her body dumped in a sewer in Madhavpuram area of Meerut. The body of the girl, who went missing on June 4, was recovered two days later.

On Saturday, police claimed to have arrested a man named Shadab who had allegedly abducted the minor. The accused – who lives in the same locality – was in Tihar jail for four years after his name had cropped up in an earlier murder case in Delhi’s Kamla Market area in 2008.

According to police, the accused lured the minor girl on the pretext of giving chocolates and took her to a desolate spot and raped her. “Later, when the victim tried to raise alarm, the accused strangled her to death,” Meerut SSP Nitin Tiwari said.

The body of the girl – wrapped in a bedsheet and a stole hanging around her neck – was recovered from the city’s Brahmapuri area after a local resident alerted the police on June 6.

A case of kidnapping under IPC’s section 363 (punishment for kidnapping) was lodged at Kharkhauda police station based on the initial complaint of the family. Later, additional sections of 302 (murder), 376 (rape) and 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) of IPC and relevant sections of the POCSO Act was included in the FIR.

The victim's family alleged police inaction, claiming that “she might have been saved if the cops had acted in time to look for the missing girl”.
