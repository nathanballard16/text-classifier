: In order to ensure women's safety, women commuters travelling in Hyderabad Metro Rail are now allowed to carryfor their self-defence.TheMetro Rail has already implemented this but the Hyderabad hitherto disallowed it on grounds of fire safety. However, in the wake of theand murder of the 26-year-old veterinary doctor, the officials changed their mind.HMR managing director NVS Reddy said in a communique instructions have been issued to the security personnel to allow women to carry pepper spray for their safety.“Queries are being raised by some media friends regarding allowing girls/ladies to carry pepper spray in Hyderabad metro as a self defence mechanism as in Bengaluru metro etc. Instructions have been issued to our security personnel to permit this in our metro trains”, Reddy said.Meanwhile, a group of ministers and officials discussed the measures to be taken for safety of women and children in. They directed the police stations to register any complaint of missing women and children immediately on receipt, without bothering about jurisdictions (zero FIR). The cops should immediately swing into action to trace the missing ones.The meeting decided to strengthen the various police helplines including control room, 181, 1098 Hawk Eye and carry out vigorous awareness campaign on the ways to use those facilities when needed. These helpline numbers will be prominently displayed in all educational institutions from primary schools to colleges, all government offices, public transport vehicles, autos, cabs and the like.The government also decided to evolve a system for inculcating moral values and ethics among the children about respecting a girl/woman from the primary school level itself by bringing a special/extra curriculum on moral values in coordination with She-Teams (dedicated teams for protection of women from harassment). Students participating in these classes will be given certificates.
