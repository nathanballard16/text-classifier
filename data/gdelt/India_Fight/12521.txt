Pilot Shot Down By Pakistan Returns To India

An Indian pilot captured by Pakistani forces on February 27 after his warplane was shot down in the disputed region of Kashmir has returned to India after being freed by Islamabad in a "peace gesture." Pakistani PTV television footage showed Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman crossing into India at the Wagah crossing point on March 1. The aerial confrontation came after India on February 26 struck what it said was a militant camp in northeastern Pakistan in retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 41 Indian troops in the India-controlled part of Kashmir.
