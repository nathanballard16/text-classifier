In a first for the new Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh, the National Security Act (NSA), a law used to detain suspects who threaten the country's security, was invoked on Tuesday against three persons accused of illegal cow slaughter in the communally sensitive Khandwa town.

Reacting to the controversy, CPI leader D Raja said, "Fighting BJP is one thing, but how can Congress justify such actions? Rahul Gandhi must explain what his party's governments are doing in their respective states."

The trio, identified as Shakeel, Nadeem, and Azam, were sent to prison by a local court. "Acting on a tip-off that a few persons were allegedly involved in an illegal act of slaughtering a cow, police raided a place at Kharkali village near here last Friday and seized a large knife and beef from the spot," Moghat police station in-charge, Mohan Singore said.

The accused escaped under the cover of darkness but police arrested them on Saturday from their different hideouts in Khandwa city. District collector, Vishesh Garhpale, slapped provisions of the NSA against them.

"On Monday, they were produced before a local court, which sentenced them to jail under the NSA and other relevant sections of the IPC," Singore added. According to police, Nadeem was earlier also involved in the slaughtering of cows and was wanted in the case.

Between 2007 and 2016, the BJP government under Shivraj Singh Chouhan had invoked the NSA on cow-slaughter charges against at least 22 persons, including an office-bearer of the party's minority cell.

The National Security Act empowers the government to detain people for up to a year if they suspect that they could disrupt public order, endanger the security of India or its ties with foreign countries.
