UPDATE: Berrien Co. commissioner's husband found dead in apparent Baroda Twp. farm accident

A man was found dead in a Baroda Township barn, and police believe he was killed in a farm accident.

A farm worker reportedly found 45-year-old Patrick Freehling in a barn in the 11500 block of Cleveland Avenue about 7 a.m. Thursday, according to a release from the Baroda-Lake Township Police Department. Freehling was pronounced dead at the scene.

Freehling is the husband of Berrien County Commissioner Teri Freehling. The Berrien County Board of Commissioners had a meeting scheduled for 6 p.m. Thursday that has been canceled "due to unforeseen circumstances."

Police say Patrick Freehling's death "appears to be a tragic farm incident. There are no signs of foul play."

An autopsy is scheduled to be performed, but police did not specify when.
