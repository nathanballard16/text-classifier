3 alleged cow slaughterers charged under National Security Act: Here’s how Kapil Sibal reacts

New Delhi: Taking a dig at the BJP-led Uttar Pradesh government over the invoking of the National Security Act against three people arrested in connection with an alleged cow-slaughter incident, senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal on Tuesday asked why there was no action against those accused of killing a policeman.

It must be noted that Bulandshahr administration on Monday invoked the National Security Act against three people arrested in connection with an alleged cow-slaughter incident. On December 3, the mob went on a rampage after cattle carcasses were found strewn in the fields outside Mahaw village in Siyana. Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh was killed in the violence.

Kapil Sibal tweeted “Wah Yogi ji (Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath)…NSA for those accused of killing cows. Freedom for those involved in killing Inspector Subodh Kant Singh.”

NDTV has quoted the former union minister as saying, “When law is allowed to be obstructive, agendas become destructive.”

It must be noted that seven people were arrested in the cow-slaughter case, three of whom were charged under the National Security Act.
