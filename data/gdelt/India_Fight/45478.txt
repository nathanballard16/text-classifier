Farman Ali, son of Bahujan Samaj Party's (BSP) UP President and Rajya Sabha MP Munquad Ali, has been booked for power theft.

The case was registered after a vigilance team raided a college in Meerut's Kithor area.

The team led by the Power Department's Vigilance Inspector Bharat Kumar Rathi and Executive Engineer Dhirendra Kumar raided the college on Meerut-Garh road and found an illegal connection drawing 15 KV directly from the transmission line.

According to a senior Power Department official, the institution has a sanctioned load of 20 KV but an additional cable which was bypassing the electronic meter was illegally drawing a separate load of 15 KV.

Farman Ali is the chairman of the college and a case under section 135 of the Electricity Act was lodged against him at anti-power theft police station here.

To expedite cases of power theft in the region, nine such anti-power theft police stations have been set up under Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited (PVVNL) in Meerut, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bulandshahr, Moradabad, Rampur, Hapur, Bijnore and Muzaffarnagar.
