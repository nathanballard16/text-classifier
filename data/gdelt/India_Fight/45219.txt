First arrest after 3 yrs, sect sees ray of hope

Ludhiana: After the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) made the first arrest in the assassination of the Namdhari Sect matriarch Mata Chand Kaur, wife of former sect head, late Satguru Jagjeet Singh, followers of the sect are hopeful of the case getting solved as after over three years of the killing, there is a development in the case.

Mata Chand Kaur was gunned down by motorcycle-borne two assailants on April 4, 2016, outside the Namdhari Headquarter Gurdwara Complex at Bhaini Sahib.

The investigating agencies could not find a breakthrough during these three years. However, the CBI on Thursday brought Palwinder Singh Dimpa, who has been lodged in Patiala central jail in connection with the Jalandhar tiffin car bomb blast, the sect followers are now hoping to get justice.

Sooba Balwinder Singh Jhall, manager at the headquarters, said: “The sect followers were already suspecting the accused of tiffin car bomb blast behind the assassination of Mata Chand Kaur. Dimpa, who has been a close associate of Thakur Dalip Singh, has revealed in the polygraph test that he knew about the assailants who shot Mata Chand Kaur dead. Now, Dimpa has been arrested in the case. The entire sect is now waiting for the revelation about the assailants and the mastermind behind the killing.”

When asked if they find justice getting detailed, Lakhvir Singh Baddowal, spokesperson of the Namdhari Sect at Bhaini Sahib, said earlier, the police and the CBI were making efforts to solve the case. Recently also the CBI visited the city and questioned a few people.

When contacted Navtej Singh, secretary of Thakur Dalip Singh, head of the other Namdhari Sect, said their sect would release official statement by Saturday.
