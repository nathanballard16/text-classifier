Body of multiplex staffer found on Noida mall’s roof

Bhuvan’s body was found next to a railing, where a part of the roof was also chipped off, police said.

The body of a 48-year-old multiplex employee was found on the roof of DLF Mall of India in Noida’s Sector 18 Friday morning. Police said the body of Bhuvan Chandra has been sent for a post-mortem and his family is yet to file a complaint.

“We received information around 10.30 am that a body was found on the roof of DLF mall in Sector 18. After questioning people at the spot, we found that the man worked at the PVR multiplex in the mall. There was an injury on the back of his head. The post-mortem will help us ascertain the cause of death and we’ll investigate accordingly,” said Vineet Jaiswal, SP City, Gautam Budh Nagar.

Police said Bhuvan worked as a deputy engineer in PVR’s technical team. He had reported for work around 7.30 am, and was inspecting the auditoriums and other parts of the multiplex. Three hours later, another employee found his body and informed police.

Bhuvan’s body was found next to a railing, where a part of the roof was also chipped off, police said.

The roof of the mall has multiple levels and the body was found on the second level, police said. As per initial information, Bhuvan accessed the roof from the third level. Police are looking into whether he slipped and fell from one level of the roof to another, which allegedly caused the fatal injury.

The injury resembled an internal wound, they added. Police have prima-facie ruled out foul play as CCTV footage did not show anyone else except the victim climbing up to the roof.

Police are also investigating if his death was a suicide or an accident.

According to police, CCTV footage also showed Bhuvan walking around in different parts of the mall hours prior to his death.

Bhuvan had been working with PVR for the past few years, and lived with his family in North East Delhi’s Sonia Vihar.
