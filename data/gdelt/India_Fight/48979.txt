Lovebirds Ranbir Kapoor, Alia Bhatt chill in London





Ranbir Kapoor and Alia Bhatt enjoyed a mini vacation in London. Recently, Ranbir and Alia whisked off to London for a mini vacation and get clicked with their fans. Picture of the couple with their fans are being circulated on net. Since the ‘Raazi’ actor was totally engrossed in the shooting of ‘Sadak 2’, she thought it would be ideal to fly off to the United Kingdom to spend some ‘We’ time with her beau.

Lately, fake wedding card of Ranbir-Alia has gone viral. The card says the sagan ceremony of Alia and Ranbir will take place on 22nd January, 2020. The card is blue in colour and the letters are printed in golden colour.

Alia’s mother Soni Razdan reacted to the fake wedding card of her daughter, she called it non-issue.

Soni told TOI, “It’s a non-issue. Please, don’t give these miscreants more publicity than they deserve.” The card has many mistakes. Alia is misspelt as ‘Aliya’ while her father’s name is mentioned as Mukesh Bhatt. Mukesh Bhatt is Alia’s uncle and Mahesh Bhatt is her father.

Mukesh Bhatt also reacted to the card, the filmmaker said, “Alia is busy shooting for Sadak 2 in Ooty. I have got a call from all over the country inquiring about the same. How can it be real? It’s sad. There are so many mistakes on the card.”

When the 'Raazi' actor was spotted at the Mumbai airport on Monday night, a paparazzo asked her if the ‘news is confirm’. Alia first had a loud laugh and later denied the reports.
