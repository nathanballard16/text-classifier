'Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala' actor Mohit Malik collapses on the sets

Mohit Malik became a household name for his role as Sikandar Singh Gill in the show Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala. The handsome actor has been the lead role on the show from the past year and people have been loving his character so much. However, it's a known fact that television actors have a very hectic schedule and they often fall sick while shooting for their show. The same thing happened with Mohit recently.

As per reports in Bombay Times, Mohit collapses on the sets as the current track is high on an emotional level. Talking about the same, he stated to the daily, "Sometimes when you get into your character and are shooting continuously for eight hours, you are not able to switch off. That’s what happened to me. My character, Sikandar, is very close to my heart and the current track on the show is highly emotional, my daughter needs a bone marrow transplant. Any father’s world would be distraught if he gets to know that his daughter’s life is in danger."

"Every time you do a scene, you connect with your emotions. You end up crying often during such scenes. It takes a toll on you. Even meditation doesn’t help. I have not been able to sleep for many weeks because all this keeps going on at the back of my mind. Also, when I cry a lot, my nose gets blocked and I am unable to breathe. So, I had to take a break. I am also trying to take up some sport that can help me feel better," said Mohit.

The handsome actor was also quizzed if he will have a double role on Kullfi Kumarr Bajewala. To which he replied, "My role will be different now. Currently, I am focussing on my health and I am thankful to the makers that they have always given me leave whenever I have needed it."
