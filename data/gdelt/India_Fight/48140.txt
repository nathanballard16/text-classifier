Kamlesh Tiwari murder: Son demands NIA probe, says cannot trust anyone

The son of Hindu Samaj Party leader Kamlesh Tiwari, who was shot dead by assailants in Lucknow on Friday, has sought a National Investigation Agency-(NIA) led probe into the case.

Satyam Tiwari while talking to reporters, said that he wanted the NIA to investigate the case, adding to it he said he does not trust anyone. “My father was killed although he had security guards, how can we possibly trust the administration then?” Satyam added.

Kamlesh Tiwari was killed at his house in Lucknow, on Friday. His throat was slit, and he was shot multiple times.

Earlier in the day, the Uttar Pradesh Police claimed to have cracked the murder case, detaining three people for their involvement.

Uttar Pradesh DGP OP Singh said there is a possibility of terror angle. Prime facie it seems that Tiwari was murdered due to the defamatory comments he made in 2015.

However, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath today termed the murder an act of mischief to create terror.

Adityanath said a Special Investigation Team (SIT) has been set up to probe 45-year-old Tiwari’s murder.

The accused would not be spared, he said.

The chief minister had also sought a detailed report on the incident.
