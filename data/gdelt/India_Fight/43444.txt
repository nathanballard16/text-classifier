Meet The 1980s Costume Jewellery Icon Designing For The Duchess Of Cambridge And Rihanna

Over the last 50 years, London’s Fulham Road has changed; shops, fashions and people have all come and gone, with one exception – Butler & Wilson. The iconic small store crammed with glitz as big as the Ritz endures, as busy as ever, attracting new generations of fashion editors and loyal customers from around the world to their bold and glamorous crystal jewels. Celebrations for their 50th anniversary this month include a greatest hits compilation of bestsellers including a dancing couples brooch; glittering lizards that slithered up the lapels of the best-dressed list during the 1980s; as well as bright Byzantine-inspired necklaces. And Vogue was entranced from the very beginning.

“In 1972, Grace Coddington borrowed jewels for a beauty shoot with the model Ingrid Boulting,” the youthful Glasgow-born septuagenarian Simon Wilson recalls. “Three months later, we were featured over five pages [of British Vogue] and were inundated with customers.” Since that time, Wilson’s dizzying array of original designs has been a regular fixture on the fashion pages – from show-stopping diamante chokers to marcasite drop earrings inspired by Art-Deco pieces. It wasn’t long before Catherine Deneuve and Faye Dunaway found their way to the shop and were so taken by the jewellery that they appeared on Butler & Wilson's life-size billboards overlooking the Fulham Road, just for fun. Those were the days, as Wilson points out, before hefty financial celebrity endorsement deals were the norm.
