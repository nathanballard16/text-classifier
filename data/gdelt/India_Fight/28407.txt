cement cartelisation: Builders demand cement regulator to tackle 'cartelisation' in sector, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

The Builders’ Association of India , which represents more than 90,000 builders and contractors, has demanded that the Central government set up a cement regulatory authority to prevent ‘cartelisation’ of cement manufacturing.“Cement manufacturing is controlled by a group of 20 business houses, who create artificial shortages, shooting up cement prices.Cartelisation impacts not just construction companies, but also home buyers by increasing their cost by Rs 60 to Rs 70 per sq ft, according to our estimates. Cement is costing over Rs 100 per bag, and this revenue is not going to government but some business houses,” said Anand Gupta , spokesperson of BAI , adding that the association has filed cases which are pending before the Supreme Court.The BAI also wants the government to make it mandatory for engineering graduates to do internship with the industry to improve productivity of unskilled workers in the sector.The association also wants the government to implement discard contract policy governed by Indian Contract Act 1892, and bring in a unified standard contract cleared by the Niti Aayog
