World urged to help stop Indian oppression in IOK

Islamabad, October 03, 2019 (PPI-OT): The Convener of AJK chapter of Mirwaiz Umar Farooq-led Hurriyat forum, Syed Faiz Naqshbandi, has urged the international community to impress upon India to stop its state terrorism in occupied Kashmir. Syed Faiz Naqshbandi in a statement issued in Islamabad said that India had unleashed a reign of terror in the occupied territory and Indian forces’ personnel were treating people like animals. He said that the Kashmiri people were also being stopped to offer Friday prayers in historical Jamia Masjid and Dargah Hazrat Bal in Srinagar for last two months.

Condemning the continued house arrest of Hurriyat forum Chairman, Mirwaiz Umar Farooq, he said that the leader had not been allowed to meet people since August 5 when Narendra Modi-led communal government in New Delhi repealed special status of occupied Kashmir. Syed Faiz Naqshbandi strongly denounced the brutal torture on the people by Indian troops during house raids in the occupied territory. He said that huge deployment of the troops had destroyed economy, daily life and education of children in Kashmir.

He urged India to lift repressive lockdown, release all political prisoners and end its illegal occupation over Jammu and Kashmir. He appealed to the United Nations to take steps to resolve the Kashmir dispute as per its resolutions and aspirations of the Kashmiri people. Meanwhile, Syed Faiz Naqshbandi appreciated all people around the globe for their concern on human rights abuses in occupied Kashmir and expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of the territory.
