Three Maoists killed inencounter in Vizag Agency

Extremists were holding meet; several members injured

Three Maoists, including two women cadres, were killed in an exchange of fire (EoF) with security forces comprising the elite anti-Naxal force Greyhounds and Special Police Party, near the Madigamallu-Kondajartha forest area in Gummarevula Panchayat in GK Veedhi mandal in Visakhapatnam district on Sunday.

The identity of the slain Maoists was yet to be ascertained. Several Maoists are suspected to have been injured in the incident. The security forces seized one Self-Loading Rifle (SLR), two .303 rifles, one 12 bore rifle, six kit bags and one landmine from the scene. Sources said the male Maoist could be Gemmela Kamesh alias Hari, a Galikonda Area Committee member (ACM), but there was no confirmation from the police side.

A coincidence

The exchange of fire comes at a time when the banned CPI (Maoist) Party was celebrating its formation week from September 21 to 27. Interestingly, the then Araku Valley MLA Kidari Sarveswara Rao and former MLA Siveri Soma were killed by the Maoists near Livitputtu village under Dumbriguda police station limits in the district on September 23, 2018.

According to sources, the extremists led by senior woman leader Aruna were conducting a meeting in the Madigamallu area. Based on credible information, the police forces rushed to the area. When the Maoists opened fire, the security forces retaliated. Many Maoists managed to escape into the forest. None of the policemen were injured in the gunfight.

According to Superintendent of Police (Visakhapatnam Rural) Attada Babujee, the exchange of fire took place at around 2 pm. Greyhounds, Special Police Party and the Central Reserve Police Force intensified combing in the Agency following the encounter, he said.
