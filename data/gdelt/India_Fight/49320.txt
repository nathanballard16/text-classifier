The Zirakpur police booked a man who allegedly duped some women, including his wife. The accused was arrested and sent to judicial custody. He was in a live-in relationship at present.

According to the police, the accused, identified as Deepinder Sidana, a resident of Sector 80, married a Zirakpur-based woman, Preeti Sharma, in 2015 but later, it was discovered that Deepinder was already married and had a nine-year-old daughter.

Preet told Newsline that she met Deepinder in 2014 in Amritsar through a common friend and they got married in 2015 at Chandigarh district courts. Last year, she came to know that Deepinder was cheating on her as he had an affair with a woman.

“He started quarrelling with me, then he left me in July 2018 and started living with another woman in Mohali. I came to know about it. He had not given me formal divorce and he continued to dupe women. He also presented wrong facts in the court by hiding that he was married,” Preeti said.

Preeti said that three more women approached her recently, who claimed that the accused was asking them to marry him.

“One of the women is only 19 years old. He was threatening the woman. I have sent all the documents to the police. One of the women also told me that Deepinder was in a live-in relationship with her,” Preeti said.

Acting on the complaint, the police booked Deepinder under sections 494 (marrying again during lifetime of husband or wife) and 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code. Before he left Preeti, Deepinder worked as a property consultant at Zirakpur.
