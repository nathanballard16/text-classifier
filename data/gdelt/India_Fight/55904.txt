Students from educational institutions across India have lent support to their counterparts in Jamia Millia Islamia University (JMI, New Delhi) and Aligarh Muslim University (AMU, Uttar Pradesh) following the police crackdown on protests in the campuses. Monday will witness a number of student protests from educational institutes across the country to condemn the police brutality.

This comes after students of JMI staged protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019, in and around the university campus on Sunday. However, violence erupted after protesters clashed with police personnel, who resorted to lathicharge and firing teargas shells. Several students and some police personnel were injured in the clashes. Protests, however, continued late on Sunday night after the police detained around 50 students from JMI. The students were later released in the early hours of Monday morning.

Following the police action in New Delhi, students of AMU protested in solidarity with the students of JMI on Sunday evening. Clashes erupted between the police and the students. Around 60 students were injured and the university administration declared the university closed till January 5, 2020.

Here is a list of all protests happening in educational institutions across the country, in solidarity with the students of JMI and AMU and against the Citizenship Amendment Act.
