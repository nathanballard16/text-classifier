First look of Akshay Kumar’s ‘Bachchan Pandey’ released

The film is reported to be loosely inspired from Ajith Kumar’s ‘Veeram’

The first look of Akshay Kumar’s upcoming Bachchan Pandey was released on Friday. Bachchan Pandey is being reported to be a remake of the Tamil film Veeram that released in 2014, starring Ajith Kumar and Tamannaah. It was directed by ‘Siruthai’ Siva and went on to be a blockbuster. Akshay Kumar has earlier enjoyed success with his remakes of south Indian movies.

Akshay sports a black lungi with golden borders, as well as gold chains around his neck with a nunchak in his hand. The movie is directed by Farhad Samji and produced by Sajid Nadiadwala, who has collaborated with Akshay on several hits earlier, such as Heyy Babyy and Housefull. The film is supposed to release sometime in late 2020. Bachchan Pandey will also clash with Aamir Khan’s Laal Singh Chadha.

Akshay was last seen in Kesari, and is next awaiting the release of Mission Mangal which celebrates India’s Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM).
