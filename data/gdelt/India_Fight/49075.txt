Kanpur teacher shoots Class 8 student for rejecting his advances, angry village demands justice

A Class 8 student was shot dead by her school teacher for rejecting his advances in Kanpur Dehat district of Uttar Pradesh on Thursday.

The teacher fired three bullets at the minor when she was returning home after school. One of the bullets hit the minor's neck causing her to fall on the ground. She died on Thursday night while receiving treatment at a district hospital.

The accused, identified as Shailendra Rajput, had been harassing the student for a long time, due to which the school had suspended him for three months. Reportedly, he was angry with his suspension.

After the incident, angry villagers created a ruckus at the school and blocked roads. They are not even talking to the media.

Family members of the girl have demanded death sentence for the accused.

According to SP Kanpur Dehat, Anurag Vats, "The girl was shot dead by her school teacher. She died while getting treated at a hospital late Thursday.

One eye witness Nikhil Yadav told India Today TV, "The villagers rushed the injured girl to the hospital in the evening where she succumbed to her injuries late in the night. After her death, the angry villagers have now blocked roads. We will not open the roads until the accused teacher is nabbed."

An FIR has been registered against the accused who is at large and an investigation is on.
