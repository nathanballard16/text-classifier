Khalsa Aid Is Providing Food To Homeless Cyclone Victims In Odisha, Respect!

While Cyclone Fani may be over with the minimal loss of life, due to a timely mass evacuation of nearly 10 lakh people by the Odisha government, the trail of destruction it left behind is massive.

As Odisha limps back to normalcy post the cyclone, the magnitude of devastation caused is still emerging. Lakhs of people who were evacuated to safer places have no place to go back to as their homes along with life savings have been destroyed in the cyclone.

Most of them are living in temporary shelters and camps where it is a struggle to survive.

As Odisha is still picking itself up from natures' wrath, volunteers of international Sikh charity Khalsa Aid is doing their bit to provide some relief.

Khalsa Aid which has displayed exemplary service to those in distress, not just in India, but also around the world in Bangladesh, Iraq, and Syria are providing assistance to the victims of Fani too.
