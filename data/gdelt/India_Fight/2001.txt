Karnataka: Cong, BJP in heated battle after 2 MLAs withdraw support from Kumaraswamy govt

The political battle between the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition and BJP in Karnataka has got more intense after two independent MLAs withdrew their support from the HD Kumaraswamy government amid the ongoing poaching charges levied by both parties at each other.

Karnataka Chief Minister HD Kumaraswamy on Wednesday played down media speculations in the political circles that his government was facing any threat amid the ongoing poaching battle being fought between the ruling Congress-JD(S) coalition and the BJP. Responding to a question on the Congress MLAs who are staying in a Mumbai hotel, the Karnataka CM said that he was in touch with everybody. "MLAs(Congress MLAs in Mumbai hotel) are unreachable to the media, not to me, I am in touch with everybody and I am speaking to everybody, they will come back. Our coalition is going on smoothly. I was relaxed and I am relaxed. Don't worry, be happy," Kumaraswamy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.
