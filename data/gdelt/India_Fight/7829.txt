PAKISTAN EXPOSED: 35 Edits In Pak PM Imran Khan's Statement, 17 Jump Cuts In 362 Seconds

Pakistan PM Imran Khan on Tuesday issued his first statement in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack which was orchestrated by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad.

Imran, in a video briefing, backed away from claiming any role of his country behind the attack, and dismissed the inevitable truth that the terror outfit had any association with Pakistan.

While the Pakistan side has claimed it to be as an "emergency broadcast", Republic TV, after investigating his video, has found out that it was not an impromptu video message, but one which was planned and edited accordingly, most likely on the instructions of the ISI.
