Delhi Metro blocks exits at 4 central Delhi stations

The Delhi Metro on Tuesday blocked exits with immediate effect at four of its stations in central part of the city upon request by the Delhi Police.

The exits for commuters at Pragati Maidan, Central Secretariat, Udyog Bhawan and Mandi House were blocked with immediate effect till further notice.

Although no reason was given for the restriction, it is apparent that authorities decided to block exits at these stations in order to ensure that there would be no heavy rush of people in Central Delhi.

The Delhi Traffic Police had on New Year's eve issued an advisory blocking movement of commuters at many roads in central Delhi.
