Pakistan reopens airspace to all civilian traffic

The Pakistani Government has reopened the country's airspace to all civilian traffic, foreign and local, for the first time since clashes with India on February 27 of this year.

A Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan (CAAP) NOTAM issued at 1908L (1408Z) on Monday, July 15, said only that "with immediate effect Pakistan airspace is open for[sic] all type of civil traffic on published ATS routes".

While certain air corridors were reopened to domestic traffic since February's escalation in tensions, the country's airspace has, for the most part, been off-limits to international operators. Aside from regional Asian flights, the closure also impacted flights between Europe and Asia and v.v.

"After cancellation of NOTAMS by Pakistan and India in the early hours today [July 16], there are no restrictions on airspaces of both countries, flights have started using the closed air routes, bringing a significant relief for airlines," India's Ministry of Civil Aviation said in a tweet.

Indian carriers have been hard hit by the closure of its neighbour's airspace. Minister of Civil Aviation, Hardeep Singh Puri, told NDTV that the overall cost to India's airlines - Air India, IndiGo Airlines, SpiceJet, and GoAir - totalled INR5.6 billion rupees (USD81.66 million).
