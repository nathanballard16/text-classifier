JSW Group: Steel industry seeing green shoots, demand coming back: Sajjan Jindal, JSW Group

Globally steel prices have started moving up. We hope that India will also follow suit, says, chairman,. Excerpts from an interview withofSteel prices are quite benign and going forward we see global steel prices moving up a bit. If you have seen the results of ArcelorMittal and other steel companies, globally everyone has had a very bad quarter. I think there is only one way steel prices could go and that is up. Globally steel prices have started moving up. We hope that India will also follow suit.Absolutely not.No, we are already seeing the green shoots and things are looking better and demand is coming back. The auto sector is also looking good. It is only the heavy commercial vehicles which are not moving up yet because of various reforms that the government took. Increasing the axle load as well as the GST has made the same trucks more efficient and that has reduced the sale of new commercial vehicles. But that should get corrected now.We are not yet ready for RCEP, As a country, as an industry, we need to start walking before we start running. The FTA that was done in the previous regime was an ill-timed step. The imports into India or the trade deficit between the FTA countries and India, which used to be $10-12 billion has gone up to $60 billion. It was absolutely ill-timed and therefore I am very thankful to honourable prime minister who has taken this very bold initiative.In fact, it was very difficult when the heads of states together signed an agreement and our honourable prime minister took the opposite stance.
