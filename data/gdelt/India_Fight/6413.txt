Attacked paramilitary force is a poor cousin to India's army - former officers

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The 44 Indian paramilitary police killed by a suicide attack in Kashmir on Thursday were part of a force that is little appreciated, poorly paid and under resourced when compared with the army, according to former senior officers.

The dead came from towns and villages across India, from Assam in the remote northeast to Tamil Nadu in the south.
