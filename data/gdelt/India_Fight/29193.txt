Post-Election Violence in Bengal: MHA expresses ‘deep concern’, asks Mamata govt to maintain law and order

The Centre has expressed ‘deep concern’ over the situation in Bengal which has continued unabated after the conclusion of the Lok Sabha Elections. The Centre has issued an advisory to the West Bengal state government.

The latest reports indicated that four people were killed on 8th June in post-poll clashes in Bhangipara, Hatgacha in North 24 Parganas district. There were various reports of violence across West Bengal.

The Ministry of Home Affairs advisory stated: “The unabated violence over the past weeks appear to be a failure on the part of the law enforcement machinery of the state to maintain the rule of law and inspire confidence among people. It is strongly advised to ensure that all necessary measures are taken to maintain law and order, peace and public tranquillity. It is also requested to take strict action against officials found delinquent in discharge of their duty"

The Home Minister had earlier sought a report from the West Bengal government.

"Union Home Minister has asked for a report from the state government and I am sure Centre will take this up seriously. There is a lot of anger among the people over the incident," said Kailash Vijayvargiya, BJP National General Secretary.

Four workers of the BJP were shot dead by members of the TMC in Basirhat's Sandeshkhali, BJP leader Mukul Roy has alleged.
