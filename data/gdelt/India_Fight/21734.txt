Rahul Gandhi's speech will come with disclaimer: CM Devendra Fadnavis

Making a last-gasp effort to sway voters in favour of his party, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis promised to make Kalyan free of dumping grounds. These will be replaced by waste processing units, he said. While canvassing for his party candidate Kapil Patil who is contesting from Bhiwandi constituency on Monday, he said, "Kalyan will not have any dumping ground as we will process this waste under our smart city scheme."

On Monday evening at around 4.30 pm, over 2000 residents had gathered at Vasudev Balwant Phadke Ground, Lal Chowki defying the scorching summer heat to attend the rally. However, Fadnavis made an appearance only at 7 pm. The rally was attended by Thane's guardian minister Eknath Shinde, RPI chief Ramdas Athawale, among others.

Apart from lauding his party workers and leaders for their dedication, he attacked the opposition who asked proof of Balakot strike. "While US, Russia, China and everyone in the world believed that we have shot down the terrorist camp in Balakot, only two people in the world did not believe it. One was Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan and the other was Congress party," he said.

Taking a dig at Congress president for his 'chowkidar is chor' remark, he also said that in future Rahul Gandhi's speeches will come with a disclaimer. "Rahulji said he said chowkidar is chor in zest. In future whatever Rahulji says will come with a disclaimer that the news channel telecasting his speech will not be held responsible for what he says," said Fadnavis tongue-in-cheek.
