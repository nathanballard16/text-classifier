Fishermen lost in storm, claims Pakistan

AHMEDABAD: While Kutch police is looking for answers about the bag containing Pakistani identification cards and 26 copies of a holy book found on the Sindhori coast near Jakhau, Indian intelligence agencies have received information that some Pakistani fishermen , who left Karachi a week ago, have gone missing after their vessel was hit by a storm.This new information, from official communications between Indian and Pakistan agencies, coincides with the find of two bodies on the coast near Dwarka. An investigation is under way to ascertain if there is a connection between the bodies and the missing fishermen.Police say they are looking into the possibility that the fishermen were killed in the storm and their bodies were swept to the Dwarka coast and while the bag washed ashore near Sindhori.Indian investigating agencies are still not ruling out the possibility of an attempted intrusion in the Kutch border area."The Border Security Force (BSF) found an abandoned boat near Haraminala in Kutch. The boat does not have any fishing equipment," said a top police official.On May 2, BSF apprehended a Pakistani national in Kutch for entering India illegally. The arrested man has been identified as Mohammad Shan, a resident of Multan district in Pakistan, according to a press statement issued by BSF Gujarat earlier this week.After the Pulwama attack on February 14, the border and coastal areas of Gujarat have been put on high alert.The Gujarat Anti-Terrorism Squad is also part of the present operation, according to a senior police official.On March 27, the Gujarat ATS in a joint operation with the Indian Coast Guard and the marine task force had arrested nine Iran nationals and seized 100kg of heroin.In April, Gujarat ATS arrested a man from Delhi who confessed to receiving a drug consignment from Pakistan, which had been landed on the Kutch coast in March.
