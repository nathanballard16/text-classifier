Third clean chit to Modi: 'Nuclear button for Diwali' remark not MCC violation, says EC

Earlier, the poll body concluded that the prime minister's speech in Latur last month in which he had urged first time voters to dedicate their votes in the name of the Balakot air strike heroes and the soldiers killed in the Pulwama attack, is not violative of its instructions on invoking armed forces in poll campaigns.

Following the Congress\' complaint, the EC had sought a report on the address of the prime minister in Barmer from the district poll authorities.

Senior Congress leader Anand Sharma and Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh criticised Modi\'s remark as \"irresponsible\".

Earlier, the Congress expressed disappointment over the Election Commission\'s clean chit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his speech in Wardha, saying it has become \"crystal clear\" that the model code of conduct has become the \"Modi Code of Conduct\".
