Jammu and Kashmir has been under an unprecedented security lockdown for nearly a month since before the centre announced its decision to scrap its special status and bifurcate the state into two union territories.

There are severe restrictions on the people's movement and telephone and internet connections have been snapped.

Some landline telephone connections were restored last week. The government has said the restrictions were necessary to maintain law and order, but residents have expressed frustration and anger over the lockdown.
