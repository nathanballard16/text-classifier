Ram temple not narrative for Lok Sabha polls: Rahul

Congress President Rahul Gandhi on Friday said the narrative for upcoming Lok Sabha elections will not revolve around the Ram temple but issues such as jobs, farmers problems and "corruption in the Rafale deal".

"The narrative is very simple for 2019 elections. Jobs for India's youth. What will set the narrative is destruction of economy by (Prime Minister) Narendra Modi," Gandhi said.

"The third narrative is education and healthcare for India's people. And the last is immense corruption done by Mr. Narendra Modi where he stole Rs 30,000 crore from the nation in the Rafale deal and gave it to his friend," he added.

The Congress President's remarks came in response to a media query outside Parliament as to whether the Ram Mandir issue at Ayodhya would affect the upcoming general elections.

Gandhi said that the Ayodhya issue is being heard by the Supreme Court. "Let's see what Supreme Court will do on Ram temple," he said.

Union Minister Smriti Irani, who was on Friday visiting Amethi in Uttar Pradesh, the parliamentary constituency of Rahul Gandhi, attacked the Congress President over his remarks.

"Rahul Gandhi has made it clear today that he has no connection with Ram lalla, he has nothing to do with Mandir," Irani said.
