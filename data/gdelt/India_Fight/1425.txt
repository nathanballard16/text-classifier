Delhi: Three years after he ‘killed, buried nephew in balcony’, man arrested

On January 6, Delhi Police arrested Maharana, who has been accused of murdering and then burying his 26-year-old nephew, Jai Prakash Maharana, beneath the flowerbed of his rented Dwarka house in 2016. His nephew moved to Delhi from Hyderabad in 2015 and was working at a private firm in Gurgaon. The investigation revealed that Maharana allegedly killed his nephew on February 7, 2016, as he suspected Jai of having an affair with his girlfriend. The three-month-long search spanned Delhi, Noida, Sonipat, Panipat, Vishakhapatnam, and finally Hyderabad, from where police nabbed Maharana. He dragged the body to the balcony and buried it under the soil, which he had arranged for earlier.
