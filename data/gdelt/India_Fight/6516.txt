India blames Pakistan for attack in Kashmir, promising a response

A crowd gathered in Jammu, India, on Friday to protest a suicide bombing attack that killed dozens of soldiers in Kashmir on Friday. The bombing was the worst attack there in decades, and Indian leaders promised an appropriate response. India called on world leaders to isolate Pakistan, its neighbor, which has denied involvement in the attack. At least 40 Indian soldiers were killed when a driver slammed an explosives-packed vehicle into a paramilitary convoy. India has recalled its ambassador to Pakistan for consultations in New Delhi.
