China Positive on Terror Tag for Pak-based JeM Chief Masood Azhar

Masood Azhar, founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), as per the Indian government, is the man behind the 14 February Pulwama attack in Jammu and Kashmir, in which 40 Indian security personnel were killed and many were left wounded.

India reportedly provided some documented proof against Azhar to the global community and urged them to support declaring Azhar an international terrorist at the UN.

The Indian government had shared the evidence against Azhar with China, urging Beijing to remain "sensitive to each other's concerns".

China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi, during his meeting with Indian Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale on 22 April, stressed that as neighbours, China and India must step up their "strategic communication" to shape the global agenda.

On Friday, UK High Commissioner to India Dominic Asquith told reporters in New Delhi that "we are waiting to see whether the country that has so far been resisting, agreeing to the listing will lift that objection. I remain optimistic that we will reach that conclusion".

China has been put on technical hold the attempt to declare Azhar as international terrorist since 2009. In 2009, India was the lone proposer, while in 2016, India's proposal was co-sponsored by the US, France, and UK. In 2017, the US, UK, and France moved the proposal.
