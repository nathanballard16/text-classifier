Maharshi teaser out: Mahesh Babu sizzles in Vamsi Paidipally's action-drama

Prince Mahesh Babu is upbeat about his 25th film of his career, Maharshi. Directed by Vamsi Paidipally, the film also has Pooja Hegde, Allari Naresh, Jagapati Babu and Prakash Raj in prominent roles.

As the film is gearing up for a worldwide release on May 9, the makers have dropped in the teaser of Maharshi, on the occasion of Ugadi (April 6). As expected the teaser went viral within a few minutes.

In the teaser, Mahesh Babu looks dapper in two different looks. While he rocks a checkered suit in the US, his college-boy look is also a sure-shot winner. The teaser indicates that Maharshi is an action-drama with necessary social messages.

Here's the teaser:

Maharshi will trace the story of a CEO of a US-based company, who comes to South India to uplift the farmer's life and put an end to their miseries. In the teaser, Mahesh Babu says, "There are no full stops in success, only commas. I have a problem, sir. If somebody says that I will lose, I would want to prove them wrong."

Jointly produced by Ashwini Dutt, Prasad V Potluri and Dil Raju, Maharshi is said to be produced on a huge budget of Rs 60 crore. In the past, the film's release date has been postponed a couple of times.
