CBI to probe BJP worker Yogesh Gowda’s murder in Karnataka

New Delhi: The CBI has taken over investigation in the killing of BJP worker Yogesh Gowda in Karnataka’s Dharwad in 2016, officials said Wednesday.

Yogesh Gowda, a BJP zilla panchayat member, was killed in his gym June 15, 2016 by unidentified men, the officials stated. The agency has taken over the probe on the recommendation of the Karnataka government, they informed.

It is alleged that Yogesh Gowda was running a gym at Sapthapura in Dharwad. He was friends with Basavaraj Shivappa Muttagi, the prime accused, for the last 10 years with different political inclinations.

Sources said that Gowda came to know about a land purchase deal by Muttagi. He had threatened Muttagi that he should not purchase the land as it was in his custody and if Muttagi still proceeded, he would kill the latter.

The Karnataka police had already completed the probe and filed a chargesheet against six accused, September 9, 2016. It is alleged that Muttagi hatched a criminal conspiracy to kill Gowda.

When Gowda came to his gym accomplices of Muttagi sprinkled chilli powder on his face and hacked him to death. The killers then escaped on three two-wheelers.

The case is currently under trial in the District and Sessions Court of Dharwad. After the change in the Karnataka government, the matter has been handed over to the CBI.
