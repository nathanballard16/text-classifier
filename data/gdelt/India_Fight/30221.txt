Lucknow: A day after the chairperson of Uttar Pradesh Bar Council was shot dead in Agra, Samajwadi Party chief and former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav on Saturday alleged that “jungle raj” was prevailing in the state.

Yadav earlier today met Governor Ram Naik over deteriorating law and order situation in the state and asked him to “wake up” the Yogi Adityanath-led Uttar Pradesh government.

The president of Uttar Pradesh Bar Council Darvesh Singh was allegedly shot dead on Agra court premises by a lawyer on Wednesday.

“Bar council chairperson is being murdered in her chamber. There is murder in jail...How these things are happening? The state government is responsible,” the SP chief told mediapersons after meeting the Governor, news agency PTI reported.

Yadav further said that he has urged the Governor to give direction to the UP government to improve the poor law and order condition in the state.

“The Governor used to intervene on law and order earlier [during SP regime]. It was said that there were only Yadav officers...Now there is hardly any Yadav SP or DM. We have requested him [Governor] to wake up the government and give direction to control the prevailing ‘jungle-raj’,” he added.

Yadav, along with senior party leader Ahmad Hasan, also submitted a memorandum to the Governor over prevailing law and order situation in the state.
