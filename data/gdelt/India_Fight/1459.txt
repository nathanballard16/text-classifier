Girl, 16, beheaded and doused in acid ‘after eloping with boy’

A 16-year-old was found beheaded with her face doused in acid and her chest mutilated.

The teen’s family say she was raped but her parents have been arrested on suspicion of being behind a so-called ‘honour killing.’

The girl has been named on social media as Anjana and her brutal murder has sparked mass protests in the city of Gaya, India.

The teenager’s mutilated body was found days after she returned home having eloped with a boy

Her body was found just a few metres from her home in the holy city.

Gaya police officer Rajiv Mishra said: ‘According to the girl’s elder sister, the victim had eloped with a boy on December 28 but she came back on December 31.

After her return, the father sent her away with one of his friends and she did not return home after that.’

Officers said a missing person’s report was filed on January 4 and her body found two days later.

When they called the family to say she had been found, they refused to come to the police station and prevented their other two daughters from giving any statement.

Officer Mishra added: ‘Circumstantial evidence suggests she was killed by her father’s friends and a few others.’

There have been vigils for the dead teenager, named locally as Anjana

India has an appalling record for violence against women.

On average, more than 100 rapes were reported each day in 2016, according to the most recent official figures.

Rituparna Chatterjee, the leader of India’s #MeToo movement, has demanded action from the Prime Minister Narendra Modi and local politicians.

Anjana’s brutal murder has sparked several candlelit vigils and marches in her hometown.

A post-mortem will be held soon to find out the cause of her death.
