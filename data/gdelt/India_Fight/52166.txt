City police to adopt 20 schools to keep children away from crime

After giving the much-needed facelift to a middle school in Pulainthope, the city police plan to adopt 20 schools in the northern part of the city.

“By adopting schools, we will prevent young children from getting involved in criminal activities in the area. We are also benefiting from the initiative as we present ourselves as people and children-friendly,” said R. Dhinakaran, Additional Commissioner of Police, North.

“Every AC has been asked to identify a school in their range in need of facilities. We are associating with residents’ welfare associations, Rotary clubs and college alumnus to provide facilities to them.”

Setting an example, the Pulianthope police station has adopted a middle school, run by the Chennai Corporation, in Pattalam. A total of 206 students from Pulianthope, Pattalam and adjoining areas, mostly from poor socio-economic background, are studying here.

Earlier, the school premises was used by anti-social elements and as an open defecation area. Now, it has been totally cordoned off with a compound wall. The school building has a fresh coat of paint with police personnel working for more than a week.

In the past, some of the children even walked barefoot. Now, students come to school wearing black shoes, socks and tie, said officials.

The police have spruced up the facilities to make it modern and more attractive to the children and give them a good ambience for learning.

From their own funds and the money collected from people, the police have provided chairs, tables, fans, water purifiers and play materials for students.

K. Krishnamurthy, Pulianthope Inspector said, “People of the area have now started enquiring about the school. The wall has moral lessons on the importance of education and discipline. People usually think police are unfriendly. We want to change the misconception.”
