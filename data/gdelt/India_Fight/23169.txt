`Ready to take Indian journos to Balakote’

ISLAMABAD, Apr 30 (Agencies): Pakistan’s military on Monday contended the Indian air strike in Balakot in February had not resulted in loss of lives or damage to infrastructure even as it warned New Delhi not to test Islamabad’s resolve.

Addressing a news conference at the General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, chief military spokesman Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor repeated his offer to facilitate Indian journalists if they wished to visit Balakot to see the truth.

The Indian government has said it struck a Jaish-e-Mohammed facility at Balakot in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province on February 26 in retaliation for the February 14 suicide bombing by JeM at Pulwama that killed 40 troops.

Pakistan, in turn, retaliated with air strikes along the Line of Control on February 27, which triggered an aerial engagement in which an Indian jet was shot down and its pilot captured.

Ghafoor contended, “India has been repeatedly lying and Pakistan has not responded.” “For the past two months, India has told uncountable lies. As a responsible country, we have not responded to their lies,” he said.

He reiterated that the state of Pakistan wasnot linked to the Pulwama attack and that Prime Minister Imran Khan had called for an investigation based on evidence as well as dialogue. Despite India’s contention that only one of its jets was downed on February 27, Ghafoor again claimed two jets were shot down. He also dismissed India’s contention that a Pakistani F-16 was shot down.
