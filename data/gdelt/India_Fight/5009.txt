Stating the reason behind title change, Rucha Pathak, chief creative officer of Fox Star Studios told Mumbai Mirror, “AR Rahman, who is composing the music, shared a vibrant and fun number, with lyrics penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya. When we heard the song, we found our title in it. It perfectly embodies the theme of our film.”
