SIT to probe woman’s death during police raid

PATIALA: A 55-year-old woman had succumbed to injuries sustained in an alleged torture by a police team. On Friday, the police was conducting a raid in her house looking for one of her sons, Naib Singh, who was booked under section 326 six months ago. According to the husband of the deceased, they refused to believe her when she said she had no idea where her son was and tortured her for his whereabouts.The deceased has been identified as Kulwant Kaur of Madauli Khurd village of Ropar district. On Saturday, Maha Singh , the husband, had met the Ropar senior superintendent of police, Swapan Sharma, and demanded that a case be registered against erring cops under sections of murder. According to him, the police, instead of registering the case against the cops involved, had booked some unidentified men for the crime.Following Maha Singh’s complaint, the police had formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe into the matter. “We have formed a three-member SIT, headed by superintendent of police, headquarter Ropar. The investigation will be done on merit and anyone found guilty will not be spared and action would be taken according to law.”Maha Singh said, “On Friday the police officials had tortured my wife when I was unloading my wheat crop in the grain market. The police had already sent to jail one of my two sons, both who have been booked under section 326 of IPC. The police were harassing us for the last six months by conducting raids in our house to catch my second son. The cops used to insult us and sometimes beat us. Naib had not come to my house since he was booked in the case six months ago and we do not know about his whereabouts. But the cops did not believe my wife and tortured her to death.”
