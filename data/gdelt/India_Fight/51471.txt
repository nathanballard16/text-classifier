Kozhikode: In wake of the recent Maoist encounter in Agali forests of Kerala’s Palakkad district late October, the Vadakara Police Station on Friday received a threat letter against Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, which stated that the death of four Maoists who were killed in the encounter would be avenged.

The letter, signed by Bedar Moosa, vice-president of the Kabinidal Action Committee for the Urban Action team, said that Vijayan would have to deal with the same fate as the killed Maoists, news agency IANS reported.

Maoists are extremely distraught by the Vijayan government following the death of four of their comrades in the dense forests last month, covering Palakkad and Malappuram districts.

As many as seven Maoists have been neutralised in the state of Kerala ever since Vijayan became the CM in 2016.

The letter in Malayalam said that the Kerala CM would have to face an appropriate punishment over the killing of seven of their comrades, while also threatening to kill Perambara Sub-Inspector Harish for allegedly mistreating people.

Top cops in Kozhikode have initiated an investigation into the letter.

The Kerala High Court had earlier this week order the state police to carry out a probe into the events that led to the dealth of two of the suspected Maoists.

The Kerala Thunderbolt squad, and elite and specialised command force in the Kerala Police machinery under the India Reserve Battalion, carried out the offensive against the Maoists.
