Hindutva drives ‘real politics’ of the country: Mehbooba

Former J&K Chief Minister and the PDP leader Mehbooba Mufti said on Wednesday that Hindutva drives the “real politics” in the country. She said there was no difference between the BJP and the Congress in the way the two pursued their politics.

Her comments came after the Madhya Pradesh government slapped National Security Act against three accused of cow slaughter and the BJP Government in Uttar Pradesh withdrew cases against 38 accused in 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots.

“The Yogi government (Uttar Pradesh) withdrew cases against accused in Muzaffarabad riots. The Madhya Pradesh government slapped National Security Act against three accused of cow slaughter. From UP to MP, political lines are getting blurred and it is difficult to differentiate between the Congress and the BJP. Hindutva drives the real politics in modern India,” Mehbooba said in a tweet.

However, responding to her statement, J&K Governor Satya Pal Malik said nobody should take the PDP leader’s statement seriously as her party was breaking up.

“Elections are round the corner, her party is breaking up. Her party is in a bad shape,” Malik said while talking to reporters at a function in Jammu.”She had come to power by stirring anti-India sentiments. Nobody should take her statements seriously.”
