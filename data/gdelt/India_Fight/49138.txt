Six CRPF personnel were injured after “unknown terrorists” lobbed a grenade on Karan Nagar police station in Srinagar on Saturday, officials said.

The 144th battalion of the paramilitary force was manning a checkpoint at the police station when the incident took place at around 6.30 pm, according to CRPF officials. The grenade explosion caused panic in the area, followed by firing which was promptly retaliated by the special forces troops.

The injured personnel were quickly shifted to hospital, they said.

The attack comes in the wake of a number of attacks on the truck drivers in the Valley. On October 24, the day when J&K went to its first-ever local body polls, militants killed two non-Kashmiri truck drivers, who had gone to ferry loads of apples and injured another in Shopian district.

The Thursday attack was third such instance in the last 12 days. A truck driver from Rajasthan was killed in the Valley on October 14, while a migrant labourer from Chhattisgarh and a fruit loader from Punjab was shot in Pulwama and Shopian, respectively, two days later.
