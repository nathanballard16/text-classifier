Zameer fires fresh salvo against police on CAA-NRC protesters

MANGALURU: Former minister BZ Zameer Ahmed Khan on Friday questioned the need for police if they are not able to control ‘300’ persons. Khan’s observation came in the backdrop of what the Congress leadership has been consistently maintaining that the police were faced with a manageable crowd on the day protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act and proposed National Register of Citizens turned violent on December 19.Interacting with media, Khan said role of two persons killed in police firing has not yet been established. There is no need for CID investigation that the government has announced into the incident and it must be carried out by a judge, he said. On the decision of the government to withhold compensation to next of kin of victims of police firing, Zameer said he knew it would resort to such a step and the announcement was to play to the gallery.Questioning the efficacy of compensation that the government provides, Zameer said a life lost can not be brought back even if one gives crore as ex-gratia. Family of the deceased did not seek compensation, he said, adding the government on the other hand has announced it and then decided to put in hold. Accusing the government of carrying out ‘Hitler Rule’ in the state, Zameer said no one wantonly indulges in destruction of private/public property.Asserting that the opposition will not sit quite about the incident, Zameer said they will raise this issue in the forthcoming session of the state legislature. The incident and its aftermath have seen both ruling BJP and opposition Congress and JD(S) counter each other’s stand on reasons that led to the incident, on the type of investigation that needs to be carried out in to the same. Even leaders of Left parties from Kerala have visited the city in this connection.
