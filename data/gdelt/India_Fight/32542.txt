Faridabad, June 29

The police today claimed a breakthrough in the daylight murder case of Congress spokesperson Vikas Chaudhary with the arrest of two persons, including a woman.

Those arrested are Roshni, wife of gangster Kaushal from Naharpur Rupa village of Gurugram district, and Naresh, a domestic help.

The police claimed Roshni had admitted to hatching the conspiracy to kill Chaudhary on the instructions of her husband following a dispute over a financial deal.

The shooting was allegedly carried out by Vikas, alias Bhalle, a resident of Dhanwapur village of Gurugram, and Sachin of Kheri village of Faridabad. Two other unidentified persons are at large.

Haryana DGP Manoj Yadava today announced an SIT to arrest the suspects. It will be headed by Faridabad Commissioner of Police Sanjay Kumar. Sources said Chaudhary was apparently murdered as he failed to pay Rs 1 crore in ransom.

Kaushal, who is at large, is wanted in two dozen cases of extortion and murder and carries a reward of Rs 5 lakh, say police officials.
