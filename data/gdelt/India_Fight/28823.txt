Anantnag: In yet another shocking incident from terror-stricken Jammu and Kashmir, terrorists shot dead a Territorial Army jawan who was on leave in Anantnag district’s Sadoora village.

Manzoor Ahmad Beg was killed when he was unarmed. He was on leave for 12 days from June 4 to celebrate Eid-ul-Fitr with his family.

The murder is reminiscent of a similar incident that occured last year when another soldier Aurangzeb was killed brutally in Pulwama's Kalampora area. Aurangzeb was abducted by militants when he was on his way to home for Eid celebrations. His bullet-ridden body was recovered by a police team later where it was revealed that he was killed in an execution style in which he had bullet wounds on his neck and head. He was later awarded the Shaurya Chakra posthumously for his bravery.

Later, news emerged that his father Haneef joined the BJP. Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman and Army chief General Bipin Rawat had also visited Haneef after his son's death. Haneef belongs to the Bakarwal community which is perceived by terrorists as ‘pro-India’ as the community is known for its cooperation in anti-militancy operations in the Valley.
