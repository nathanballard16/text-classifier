New Delhi: Indian Air Force bases in Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab have been put on high alert after intel inputs have hinted at a fidyeen attack on one of the air force bases in the region.

As per reports, a group of 10 Jaish militants is planning to carry out a terror similar to the 26/11 attack in the country. In this backdrop, the Indian Air Force has sounded an orange alert for Awantipora, Jammu, Pathankot and Hindon airbases and asked senior officers to review security arrangements at their respective locations.

This comes after Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh wrote to the central government that Pakistan has been trying to airdrop weapons, including grenades, in the border areas of Punjab.

Earlier on Monday Army Chief General Bipin Rawat said Pakistan has reactivated the Balakot terror camp very recently and about 500 infiltrators were waiting to sneak into India.

Meanwhile Defence Minister Rajnath Singh today said, “Whatever be the challenges to national security, our jawans are capable of combating and defeating them, be it the Army, the Air Force or the Navy.”
