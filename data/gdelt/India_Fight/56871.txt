Kin of Telangana gang-rape case accused killed in encounter move SC, seek action against cops

NEW DELHI, Dec 19 (Agencies): The families of the four accused of gangraping and murdering a government veterinary doctor, who were killed in an encounter with Telangana Police recently, on Thursday moved the Supreme Court seeking registration of FIR, investigation and criminal action against the police personnel who were involved in the encounter.

According to reports, the families of four slain accused filed a plea in the top court seeking a thorough probe into the Hyderabad encounter. It may be recalled that the Telangana government had on December 6 formed a Special Investigation Team (SIT) to probe the encounter killing of the four gang-rape accused amid much hue and cry over the incident.

The Cyberabad Police had shot dead the four accused when they, as per the police, tried to escape from the crime scene where they were taken by a police team to recreate the sequence of events which led to them rape and murder the 27-year-old government veterinarian after her scooty broke down in Shamshabad, on the outskirts of Hyderabad.

The Telangana Police, on its part, claimed that the accused attacked the police personnel and two of them even snatched weapons and opened fire, forcing the police to retaliate. Cyberabad Police Commissioner VC Sajjanar said all four died in retaliatory fire. Two policemen were also injured, but these were not bullet injuries.

The four slain accused had allegedly gang-raped and killed the veterinarian near the outer Ring Road at Shamshabad on the outskirts of Hyderabad and dumped the body and set it afire near Shadnagar. On September 29, police arrested two truck drivers and two cleaners. The next day they were sent to judicial custody while police took custody of the accused on December 3 for interrogation.
