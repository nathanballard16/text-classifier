It is in interest of Pak that we don't allow any militias: Imran

WASHINGTON: Pakistan Peoples Party , Pakistan's principal opposition and formerly a ruling dispensation, reacted with outrage at Imran Khan's remarks in the US. "Imran Khan should be awarded 'Goebbels award' for the lies he told with confidence. Lying with confidence comes with practice and Imran Khan has been doing this for decades," PPP secretary general Nafisa Shah was quoted saying in the Pakistan media, dubbing the country's PM "Taliban Khan without a beard" because of his past vocal support for the Taliban and other extremists.But in Washington, Khan presented himself as a moderate who was doing what previous Pakistani governments were not and could not - rolling up the terror network that was nurtured by the country's military-intelligence establishment to fight an irregular war with India using terrorists."In 2014, the Pakistani Taliban slaughtered 150 schoolchildren at Army Public School. All the political parties signed the national action plan and we all decided after that, that we will not allow any militant groups to operate inside Pakistan," he said in a questionable claim considering terror groups continued to operate in Pakistan right up to the weeks in which he headed out to the US to reset ties with Washington.But, he added, "It is in the interest of Pakistan that we don't allow any armed militias in our country. We have suffered. The country has suffered sectarian attacks. We have had the worst situation, it has affected our investment. It has destabilized us."
