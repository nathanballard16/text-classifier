Sonia Gandhi endorses Maharashtra deal, puts Shiv Sena in 'secular' bloc

NEW DELHI: Hours before Uddhav Thackeray took oath as chief minister of Maharashtra, Congress president Sonia Gandhi owned up the alliance in public for the first time by saying "we three parties" are united to thwart BJP.The Congress chief opened her address at the parliamentary party meeting with the Maharashtra issue, attacking BJP for "shameless attempt to subvert democracy" and directly accusing PM Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah for dictating the governor's "unprecedented and reprehensible" action to swear in Devendra Fadnavis as CM. She said the Supreme Court battle exposed the "Modi-Shah government" for trying to sabotage the three-party government formation.As she took authorship of the partnership with long-time rival and Hindutva votary Shiv Sena , she even waded into the saffron divorce which made the three-way alliance of disparate ideologies possible. "BJP's pre-poll alliance did not hold because of its own arrogance and over-confidence," she said.However, the Gandhis stayed away from the oath ceremony in Mumbai despite personal requests from the Thackerays. Though Sena heir apparent Aaditya Thackeray visited Sonia to invite her for the ceremony, she and Rahul Gandhi wrote to Uddhav expressing regret.Congress sources have maintained that Rahul kept away from the month-long Maharashtra negotiations, not attending a single meeting on the issue. An aide said he did not want to get involved with the Hindutva party but realised the overwhelming sentiment in Congress, especially the state unit. His no-show in Mumbai was seen as part of the same attitude though his letter to Uddhav expressed hope that the alliance would provide a "stable, secular and pro-poor government".Interestingly, Sonia painted the Sena firmly in the "secular" corner, with her letter saying the country was facing threats from BJP and expressing hope the alliance would fulfil the commitments made in the 'common minimum programme'.
