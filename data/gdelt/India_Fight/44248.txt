But that night, a scuffle ensued betweemn Vasava and the two convicts hearing which Padhiyar and her husband Prakash too rushed out of their house located close to the school. The couple saw Bariya and Tadvi hitting Vasava with an axe and a crowbar, but by the time they could reach Vasava, the duo fled the spot killing Vasava.An FIR of murder was registered at Dabhoi police station based on Padhiyar’s complaint and the duo was arrested. The trial of the case started on November 10 last year during which the additional public prosecutor K P Chavan produced forensic evidence and the two key witnesses – Padhiyar and her husband – were examined.“The blood stains found on the accused’s clothes and the crime spot belonged to Vasava which the forensic department also confirmed. Later the weapons which they had used were also recovered by police and submitted in the court,” Chavan said.Upholding the deposition of the two witnesses and the forensic evidence, the court stated that the presence of blood of deceased victim on the clothes of accused persons proves not only their presence on the spot of incident but their active involvement in commission of crime.The prosecution said that Tadvi was under the misconception that Vasava was having an extra-marital affair with his cousin and so killed him with the assistance of Bariya. However, the motive was not proven in the court.
