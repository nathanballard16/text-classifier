J&K: Army major killed, jawan hurt in Nowshera IED explosion

Major Chitresh Singh Bisht was killed in a mine blast along the LoC in Nowshera sector of Jammu and Kashmir on Saturday.

An Army Major was killed and a soldier was injured in a mine blast along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir’s Nowshera sector of Rajouri district on Saturday. In a separate incident, a jawan was injured during unprovoked firing by Pakistani troops in the area.

Identifying the deceased Army officer as Major Chitresh Singh Bisht, 31, defence ministry spokesperson Lt Colonel Devender Anand said the mines were detected during the sanitisation of track in Naushera Sector around 3 pm. Major Chitresh Singh Bisht, who was leading the Bomb Disposal Team, had managed to defuse one of the mines successfully. However, while neutralizing another mine, the device got activated and the officer suffered grievously and died.

The blast came two days after 40 CRPF jawans were killed in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district when a suicide bomber rammed his explosive-laden into the bus they were travelling in. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad had claimed responsibility for the attack.

Major Bisht, a resident of Dehradun in Uttarakhand, is survived by his parents, the spokesperson said, adding that he was a brave and sincere soldier and the nation will always remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty.

Meanwhile, another Army jawan was injured at nearby Jhanghar area after Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked firing around 4 pm. He was rushed to the hospital, sources said. The Indian Army was “retaliating strongly and effectively”, said a defence ministry spokesperson.
