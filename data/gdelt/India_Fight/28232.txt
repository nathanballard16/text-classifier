CBI Sleuths Raid TDP MP Sujana Chowdary’s Properties

Hyderabad: In connection with allegations of duping banks, officials from the Bangalore unit of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) raided the residences and offices of TDP MP and former Union minister Sujana Chowdary in Hyderabad and Bangalore. The investigating sleuths are believed to be in possession of important documents and several hard disks, and likely to serve fresh set of notices to him instructing him to appear before them.

The TDP MP is accused of deceiving the consortium of banks by taking and defaulting on Rs 364 crore for his various industries. As per details, he had availed a loan of Rs 71 crore from Andhra Bank, Rs 133 core from the Central Bank of India, and Rs 159 crore from the Corporation Bank. These raids are being conducted after he had failed to appear before the CBI officials despite being served notices on April 25. While four other directors of his company are appearing before the CBI officials, he is the only one eluding the police net. The investigating officials are expected to serve another round of notices to him on Saturday.
