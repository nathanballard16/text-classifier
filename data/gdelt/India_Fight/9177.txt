Trump Calls India-Pakistan Standoff ‘Very Dangerous’

US President Donald Trump on Friday alarmed on a “very dangerous situation” between India and Pakistan, saying that New Delhi was considering “very strong” action after an attack in Kashmir.

“It’s very dangerous situation between the two countries. We would like to see it stop,” Trump said, adding that the United States was seeking talks with Pakistan.

India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Feb. 16 promised a strong response to the Kashmir attack that killed at least 40 paramilitary forces.

“Right now there is a lot of problems between India and Pakistan because of what happened,” Trump told reporters as he met a senior Chinese official in the Oval Office.

The attack was the worst in decades and comes just months before Modi’s ruling Hindu nationalists face a tight general election.

“India is looking at something very strong. India just lost almost 50 people with an attack. So I can understand that also,” Trump said.

India has been demanding action against militants from Pakistan, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi under pressure from his Hindu nationalist base to show firmness weeks before he is set to call elections.

The attack was claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed, an Islamist extremist group based in Pakistan, although the suicide attacker came locally from Indian Kashmir.
