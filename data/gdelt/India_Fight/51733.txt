Mamata Banerjee meet with officials lined up on November 20

Mamata is scheduled to hold a closed door meeting with Behrampore district and police officials

According to the sources, the government might announce major sops for the district during the course of the chief minister’s visit.

Chief minister Mamata Banerjee is scheduled to hold two meetings in Murshidabad on November 20, Trinamul sources said on Saturday.

“Murshidabad was never a traditional Trinamul stronghold. But in the general election held in May, we led in 16 out of 22 Assembly seats and our candidates Khalilur Rahman and Abu Taher Khan won the Jangipur and Murshidabad seats, respectively,” said a Trinamul leader.

The chief minister is scheduled to arrive at Dholarpahar in Sagardighi on November 20 morning after attending an administrative meeting in Malda.

From Sagardighi, she will travel 30km to Behrampore where she is scheduled to hold a closed door meeting with district and police officials at the Rabindra Sadan auditorium in the afternoon.

Mamata is slated to leave for Calcutta the following day.

Dholarpahar is just 5km from Bahalnagar, the village of five migrant labourers who were killed in Kashmir recently.

“Knowing Didi, she might express her willingness to visit their homes if she finds some time. So, we are keeping all arrangements in place,” said a source.

The sources said the chief minister might announce a number of developmental projects, like road, waterways and industrial projects, during her meetings.
