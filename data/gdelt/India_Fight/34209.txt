France launches first of Barracuda-class nuclear-powered attack submarine

French President Emanuel Macron on Friday launched the first of the Barracuda-class nuclear-powered attack submarine Suffren at the port city of Cherbourg in France. The boat is the first of its class to be built for the French Navy.

The Barracuda-class submarine is being introduced to replace the existing force of the four SSN Rubis submarines which entered service from 1983 to 1988.

The submarine will have a surface displacement of about 4,100t, which is an increase of 70 per cent compared to the Amethyste Class submarines. The maximum speed will be 25kt and the diving depth more than 350m.

The high level of automation integrated into the submarine’s operational and mission systems will allow the submarine a complement of 60 (in two crews) compared to 78 in the Rubis and Amethyst Classes. The operational cost will be reduced by 30 per cent compared to that of the Rubis Class.

The submarine is being seen with great interest in the strategic circles as the tensions between NATO and the Russians has been growing in the recent past.

French firm Naval Group, which is manufacturing the Scorpene class submarine in India for the Indian Navy, said the Baracudda was the most advanced boat of its time with multiple capabilities.

Nicolas de La Villemarque, Vice President India and Asia Pacific said the French side was working with the Indian side already on the Project 75 and is looking forward to working on the P-75 India under which six conventional submarines are to be built in India for the Indian Navy.
