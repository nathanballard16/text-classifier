A group of students were sent crashing into the middle of the road after a bus suddenly braked while they were travelling on the roof in southern India.

They were celebrating Bus Day in Chennai city, Tamil Nadu state - an annual event which sees students from across the city wreak havoc, according to India Today.

A bunch of around 30 students climbed up on onto the roof of the bus and can be seen waving their arms and cheering in the short clip.

Passengers were precariously clinging onto window bars attached to the bus as well as holding onto the roof of the travelling vehicle.

However moments later the bus had to suddenly brake to avoiding crashing into the motorcycle in front, which sent dozens of people hurtling to the ground below.

It is believed that the students attend Pachayappa'a College and Ambedkar Arts and Science College in Chennai.

Bus Day celebrations occur each year on the first day of student's summer vacation where they cause public nuisance throughout the city.

The authorities have cracked down on the annual event and the Madras High Court has come down heavily on the celebrations, but it hasn't appeared to deter revellers.
