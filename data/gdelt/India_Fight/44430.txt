Narendra Modi’s visit to the U.S.: What will he say about the Kashmir crackdown?

Modi and his government have focused public commentary on how changes to the status of Jammu and Kashmir will bring economic development and good governance to the region. This stance was just reiterated by the Indian ambassador to the United States, Harsh Vardhan Shringla, in an editorial in the New York Times on Thursday. During Modi’s U.S. visit, this official line will probably remain consistent with India’s long-term policy of viewing Kashmir as a purely domestic matter — and not an area that requires foreign mediation or intervention.
