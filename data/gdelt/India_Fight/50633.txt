872 cattle deaths in 2 Patna gaushalas in past 2 years, PMC orders probe

A source at the veterinary college farm said: “Most stray cows and calves do not get the requisite amount of food — seven kg fodder per animal.

The Patna Municipal Corporation (PMC) has ordered a probe into the deaths of 872 heads of cattle in two major cowsheds in the state capital in the past two years.

Some 530 animals died in the last year at the Bihar Veterinary College farm and 342 bovines died at Srikrishna Gaushala in Katra over the last two years.

A source at the veterinary college farm said: “Most stray cows and calves do not get the requisite amount of food — seven kg fodder per animal. The animals would often consume polythene.”

Patna Mayor Sita Sahu said: “We have asked municipal commissioner to look into the matter. Veterinary doctors have been also asked to submit a report.”

While cowsheds are maintained by the PMC, the district administration is responsible for their functioning.
