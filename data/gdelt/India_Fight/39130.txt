Kuldeep Singh Sengar charged with killing survivor’s dad

NEW DELHI: Expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar , being tried for raping a minor, was on Tuesday slapped with the additional charges of murder for conspiring to kill the survivor’s father after framing him in a false case.District judge Dharmesh Sharma clubbed two cases, one related to the alleged murder of the survivor’s father and the other related to allegedly framing him in a case of possession of illegal arms.The court charged Sengar and nine others for offences punishable under IPC Sections 302 (murder), 506 (criminal intimidation), 341 (wrongful restraint), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 193 (false evidence) and under Section 25 of the Arms Act.The court cancelled the bail of three UP policemen — the then Makhi police station in-charge Ashok Singh Bhadauria, sub-inspector Kamta Prasad and constable Amir Khan — and remanded them in judicial custody after charging them with murder.Framing charges in the second case, transferred to it from the Supreme Court, the trial court viewed the murder as a “part of a larger conspiracy to deter, silence and prevent the father from pursuing the complaint” in the rape case of his daughter in 2017.Taking into account Sengar’s defence that he was not even in Unnao but in Delhi when the father was allegedly assaulted and picked up by the police, the court said he hatched the conspriracy with the others to murder the father, and it was on his instructions the victim was picked and beaten up before being thrown in jail where he succumbed to his injuries.By adding murder charges against Sengar, the court has given a big boost to the victim’s plea for justice as the survivor’s counsel had claimed the CBI had “deliberately” not named Sengar and his brother in the murder of the girl’s father.
