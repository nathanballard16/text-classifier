Indian airforce plane crashes in Kashmir killing three people

The latest incident comes amid growing tension with neighbouring Pakistan

An Indian Air Force plane has crashed in the disputed area of Kashmir, killing two pilots and a civilian.

It comes amid heightened tensions with neighboring Pakistan.

Indian airforce jets also intercepted at least three Pakistan warplanes that crossed into the Indian side of Kashmir and forced them to turn tail, an Indian official said.

The Pakistani jets intruded over the Bimber Gali- Noushera sector at the Line of Control, a ceasefire line that serves as the de facto border in the disputed Kashmir region.

Yesterday India said it had launched an air strike inside Pakistan and that its warplanes killed "a very large number" of fighters at a militant training camp, raising the risk of conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours.

Pakistan denied there had been casualties, but has warned that it will respond to Indian aggression.

Tensions have been elevated since a suicide car bombing by Pakistan-based militants in Indian-controlled Kashmir killed at least 40 Indian paramilitary police on February 14, but the risk of conflict rose dramatically after India's air strike on Tuesday.
