The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence Chennai over the weekend intercepted 12kg drugs which included two consignments of methamphetamine and ketamine meant for sale in Sri Lanka, Indian media reported.

DRI on Saturday intercepted a man from Rameswaram at the Vanagaram toll plaza before he boarded a bus on Saturday. He was carrying 10.61kg of methamphetamine disguised as Chinese tea.

The man said he was employed by a resident of north Chennai to deliver the packets to a buyer in Sri Lanka through coastal boats across the Palk Strait.

On Sunday, DRI sleuths raided the north Chennai handler’s property and seized 1.475kg of ketamine from his house.

An SUV and 2.5 million Indian rupees were also seized. All three suspects were arrested, according to a report in the Times of India.

The agency on Monday said it also seized 1.53kg of hashish from a passenger at Chennai airport bound to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia on Wednesday.

The stash was concealed in an alluminium foil amid chocolates. The man, a resident of Chennai, was a carrier and admitted to doing it for a hefty sum.
