Three people were arrested for allegedly killing their 30-year-old neighbour in northeast Delhi's Nand Nagri area, police said Wednesday.

The accused - Sumit (29) and Raj (22) were residents of Nand Nagri while Ajay Tyagi (31) was a resident of Modinagar, they said. The victim has been identified as Vicky.

The trio absconding since Monday were arrested from Loni in Ghaziabad.

Police said three to four men shot Vicky on Monday night outside his house. Vicky was rushed to the GTB Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

Four cases of robbery were registered against Vicky - three in Shahdara district and one at the Nand Nagri police station.
