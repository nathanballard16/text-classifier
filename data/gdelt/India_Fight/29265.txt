Dry Gujarat jailed only one under Prohibition Act in 2016: NCRB

VADODARA: Despite regular raids and arrests on bootleggers and liquor dens, prisons in ‘dry’ Gujarat had only one inmate who was convicted under the prohibition Act in 2016.The interesting detail was revealed in the 2016 statistics of prisons released recently by the National Crime Records Bureau, which said that this was the lowest conviction rate among the states that have Prohibition Act in place. Interestingly, the number of under-trials at 291, booked the under the same law revealed to be the highest in the country!Experts believe that the low rate of conviction can be attributed mainly to cops’ half-hearted investigation in such cases or to witnesses turning hostile during trial.“Police investigation is the most important aspect for conviction. But in such cases, the mechanical investigation, non-availability of independent witnesses and inability to get possession are major reasons why conviction rate is so low,” said Shailesh Patel, a prominent criminal lawyer. He further said that the police also detain the accused under Prevention of Anti-Social Activities (PASA) Act, due to which the accused remains in jail from six months to two years. “Around 90% of detainees under PASA are those who are involved in prohibition cases too,” he added.A public prosecutor too blamed faulty investigation for lesser conviction rate. “Proper punchnama is not done by police and the material witnesses are auto rickshaw drivers or a local food cart or hand cart owners. These people are unaware of the procedures and do not know about law and so they turn hostile,” the prosecutor said.The Gujarat high court had also come down heavily on police over ‘designed FIRs’ in prohibition cases.Earlier this month, the HC had pulled up the state police saying that it has become a ‘custom’ for the cops to file ‘designed FIRs’ in prohibition cases where the accused are shown as having escaped before raids were conducted. This, it said, even when the cops have proper information regarding the movement of liquor, including the exact location and vehicles used for the act.Vadodara-based Rajiv Patel, who has been crusading against prohibition for a long time, said, “The low rate of conviction shows that the entire exercise is a complete waste of time and tax-payers’ money. The courts have to hear the cases since there is a law in place but the law is nothing but a tool of victimization.”While Gujarat had the lowest number of inmates convicted for prohibition, Mizoram which had a similar law since 1997 had highest convicted inmates at 72 followed by 21 in Tamil Nadu , six in Bihar and two in West Bengal.
