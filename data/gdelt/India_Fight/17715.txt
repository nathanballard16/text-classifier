Congress may promise law to curb mob violence, lynchings

NEW DELHI: In a significant initiative, Congress is likely to promise a new law against hate crimes, a likely omnibus measure to deter lynchings , in its 2019 election manifesto The party, it is learnt, has veered towards a clear commitment to curb mob violence and lynchings. The Congress has accused BJP of encouraging attacks by mobs, particularly cow vigilantes which has seen several civil society groups criticise the Modi government.Sources said the carefully crafted manifesto promise would be limited to stating that if voted to power, a Congress government would institute a special law to deal with crimes of hate/mob violence. The party is likely to tread carefully, having itself adopted the "gau raksha" theme in recent state elections.Special laws, with provisions of stringent punishment and fast-track courts, have long been identified as sources of deterrent.The manifesto will steer clear of mentioning cow-lynchings, the single most controversial type of mob violence, and the inspiration behind the Congress poll promise appears to be multi-dimensional.Sources said hate crimes are of communal nature but are also triggered by anti-caste feelings, moral policing and rumours. The last category is important in view of lynchings provoked by fake news on WhatsApp and Facebook about child lifters being on the prowl in a village or town.Either way, the election promise for an anti-hate law would be the Congress way of making an ideological statement in its clash with BJP for the national sweepstakes.Ever since they hit the headlines post-Akhlaq killing in Dadri village in western Uttar Pradesh, lynchings have come to be identified with cows. Most of its victims have been Muslims though Dalits too have been targeted in many cases.As incidents continued, the BJP-led Centre and states came under severe criticism for not doing enough to check vigilantism. It led to widespread allegations that lynchings had become a political tool to effect religious polarisation. Even PM Modi too had in a public function asked CMs to crack down on cow vigilantes.While most of the mob killings like Akhlaq and Pehlu Khan were about beef and cows, Junaid Khan was thrown out of a train in Palwal in Haryana by a group of men in what was reported to be a communal incident.In this specific context, anti-Dalit crimes came to national notice with Una floggings in Gujarat when seven members of a Dalit family were targeted for skinning a dead cow. The perpetrators recorded the atrocities in a video which went viral and triggered national outrage.By general reckoning, "hate crimes" largely constitute crimes against religious minorities. In a way, it may be a repeat of the "anti-communal violence bill" which the UPA government had promised and attempted to craft but without success over its definition of a victim as being a member of a minority group only.The biggest hurdle in such cases is that "law and order" is a "state subject" and the states are loathe to allow any interference on their domain.
