Faridabad, September 3

Sachin Kheri, one of two gangsters wanted in the murder of Congress leader Vikas Chaudhary, was taken into police custody after he was injured in an encounter with the Special Task Force (STF) in Seekri village of the district on Monday night.

Kheri has been admitted in civil hospital under police custody.

He was one of the two assailants who had shot dead Chaudhary on June 27 here. The duo has been absconding since then. The police have arrested a total of 12 accused so far in including Kaushal, a gangster, who was the main conspirator.

Chaudhary, 42, was considered close to HPCC president Ashok Tanwar and was a leading ticket aspirant from the Faridabad Assembly segment. Chaudhary is survived by his parents, wife and two minor daughters, besides his younger brother.

The attack had taken place when Chaudhary, a resident of Sector 9 in Faridabad, arrived at a gym 500 metres from his house around 9 am. Chaudhary was about to step out of his Maruti SX4 car when three youths came out of a Toyota Fortuner and opened fire at him.

The victim had fallen on the ground and the assailantshad pumped a dozen bullets into his chest, abdomen and neck before fleeing in the waiting car. The grievously injured Chaudhary was taken to a Sector 8 hospital, where the doctors had declared him ‘brought dead’.
