Katrina Kaif’s pic is proof that she was a star since birth!

Katrina Kaif was a super private person at one time. Not much about her personal life was known or for that matter even about her personality. But ever since the Bharat beauty joined Instagram, all of our complaints have vanished in a jiffy. The super-hot actress has one of the most popular Insta accounts right now with more than a whopping 20 million followers. The fitness fanatic often shares pictures from her shoots or from her beach vacations, giving us major holiday blues while we sit in our office. Katrina really has all of us glued to her gram to see what she is up to next. In a recent interview, Kalank actor Varun Dhawan jokingly shared how Katrina is not as she appears on her gram which is super relaxed. Rather, she is a workaholic with blinders on.

Anyway, Katrina gave her fans another close look at her life when she shared a throwback picture from her childhood days on her social media page. In her witty, quirky style, Katrina captioned the throwback snap as, “I mean u gotta respect the earnest posing in front of the forest wallpaper #tbt #childhoodmemories.” While we think Kat looks super cute, her long and luscious hair totally stole our hearts. Also, how pretty is that face, right? What may look like a picture taken in the outdoors in a forest is actually Kat’s forest themed wallpaper. She clearly knew how to make the most of it, no?

The Lunchbox actress Nimrat Kaur was quick to comment on Kat’s throwback picture calling it priceless. Even Nimrat jokingly admitted she thought it was a forest in the background until she read her caption. Katrina really does have a handle on her captions too! Sister Isabelle Kaif, who is soon to make her Bollywood debut with Sooraj Pancholi, also commenting on Katrina’s beautiful hair calling it #HairGoals and we definitely agree with her.
