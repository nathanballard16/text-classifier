North Campus accident: friend booked for drunk driving

A day after a 21-year-old medical student died in an accident in Delhi University’s North Campus, the police have booked the deceased’s friend for driving the car under the influence of alcohol, said the police on Monday.

The ‘speeding’ car turned turtle after hitting an electricity pole killing the student and injuring his friend.

During the accident, Himanshu Sharma, who was pursuing medical studies at a private university, and a resident of Sarai Rohilla, was killed and his friend Abhinav Prasad, who was on the wheels suffered minor injuries.

DCP (North) Nupur Prasad said that the medical examination of Abhinav confirmed that he was driving the car in an inebriated state. He was arrested and later released on bail. “The two girls who were also travelling with them in the car had recorded their statement. The case is under investigation,” Ms. Prasad said.

On Saturday, Himanshu had gone to meet Abhinav when they planned to attend a fest at a college in North Campus. After that, the two friends headed for a joyride when the accident happened, the police said, adding that the car, owned by Himanshu, was being driven by Abhinav.
