4-year-old dies in fire at shanty, blaze doused from Mumbai airport premises

In yet another fire incident a four-year-old girl, Anushka died in a shanty near Mumbai International Airport compound. Illegal shanties alongside the airport made it inaccessible for fire engines to carry out fire operation. Thus, they had to douse the fire from inside the Airport compound.

On Thursday evening fire erupted in a shanty in Kranti Nagar, Kurla at around 5.20 pm. The flames spread to adjacent homes burning down seven more homes.

The girl was rushed to a hospital, who declared her dead. Another man, who was injured in the incident is in a situation condition.

Local coporator of MNS, Sanjay Turde said, "More than 1500 families reside in this area. Over 50 per cent of the shanties is illegal. Several times we had asked the BMC to take action but in vain. There is not any access to the fire brigade."
