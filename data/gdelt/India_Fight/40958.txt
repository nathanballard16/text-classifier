Murder Accused Fooled Police By Dressing As Priest & Avoiding Arrest For 35 Years In Uttar Pradesh

Shesh Narain Shastri, now a 55-year-old man, kept dodging arrest for 35 years. How? He dressed as a priest.

Shastri was accused of killing his neighbour in Majra village of Unnao district in 1982 when he was just 20-years-old. He got bail a year later and managed to double-cross police all these years till his cellphone gave away his location.

The police told that Shastri used to dress a priest and regularly changed his locations as well as his mobile numbers, which made it extremely difficult to track him.

“No one could give any specific information about Shesh Narain Shastri as he regularly changed his locations and also his cellphone numbers,” Station House Officer, Ajgain Police Station, Ajay Raj Verma told The Indian Express.

In 1982, Shastri and nine others were booked for the murder of neighbour Babu Singh. Shastri obtained a bail from the High Court in 1983 and went missing thereon.

“In 1984, all other accused in the murder case were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, but Shastri remained absconding and his trial is still pending,” the SHO told IE.

“Meanwhile, while collecting information about him, police came to know that Shastri, who worked as a farmer before his arrest, was booked for murder and rape of a girl in Barra police station of Kanpur district in 2013,” said the report.

The SHO added that Shastri was arrested and sent to jail but after obtaining bail he again went missing. He also said that the Kanour police did not inform them about Shastri’s arrest in 2013.

Police got hang of Shastri by tracking his phone number.
