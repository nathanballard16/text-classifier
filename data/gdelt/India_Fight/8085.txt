India Preparing Dossier to Expose Pakistan’s Role in Terror Attack - Sources

"The US being our strategic ally and considering the strong counter-terrorism cooperation, the government will share the intelligence inputs and other details to the US government related to Pulwama terror attack to show that how Pakistan based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed carried out the attack," a Home Ministry source told Sputnik.

The home minister also met with Indian envoy to Pakistan Ajay Bisaria and discussed India-Pakistan ties following the terror attack. Bisaria was withdrawn from Islamabad after the deadly suicide car bombing in Pulwama.
