Eleven students were killed when their

vehicle skidded off a road into a deep mountain gorge in

India-administered Kashmir on Thursday, local officials said.

At least seven others travelling in the minibus were injured in the

accident in South Kashmir's Shopian district, senior administration

official Mohammad Saleem Malik said.

The condition of two of them was

critical.

The victims, nine of them women, were enrolled in a computer training

institute in Surankote town, Malik said.

They were aged between 20

and 25.

India has the highest number of traffic fatalities in the world. An

average of 135,000 people die on the country's roads each year,

according to government data.

Many accidents are reported in mountainous regions like Kashmir and

are usually caused by reckless driving, bad roads or the poor

condition of vehicles.
