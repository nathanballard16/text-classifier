ISLAMABAD, July 30 (Xinhua) -- A civilian was killed and nine others injured when Indian army opened unprovoked firing with mortars and artillery guns along Line of Control (LOC), the de facto border between both countries in disputed Kashmir region, an army statement said on Tuesday.

The Indian military deliberately targeted the civil population in various sectors of the Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, and the injured people included women and kids who have been shifted to hospital, the Pakistani military's media wing Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.

"Pakistan army troops responded effectively targeting posts undertaking fire. Reports of three Indian soldiers dead, many injured besides damage to Indian posts," ISPR said.

The troops deployed at the forward posts at Indian and Pakistani side of the disputed territory intermittently exchange fire on the border area despite a 2003 agreement to observe a ceasefire in Kashmir.

The territory is the major bone of contention between the two neighboring countries, and they both accuse each other of violation of ceasefire agreements and claim to give befitting response of border intervention to the other side, every time when some border skirmish erupts.
