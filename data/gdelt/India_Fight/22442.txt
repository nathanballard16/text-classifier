PepsiCo offers to settle lawsuit with Indian farmers over their use of patented Lays potatoes

PepsiCo has offered to settle its lawsuit against four Indian farmers who grew the patented potato variety used in its Lays chips without the company’s permission.

The company’s Indian subsidiary sought about 10 million rupees ($143,000) from each of the farmers earlier this month. The farmers grow potatoes in the western state of Gujarat, a major agricultural producer in India. The case sparked outrage from Indian farmers and social activists.

“PepsiCo India has proposed to amicably settle with people who were unlawfully using seeds of its registered variety,” PepsiCo told USA Today in a statement

The company offered to drop the lawsuit if the farmers become part of its collaborative potato farming program. The farmers would have to buy seeds and sell the produce back to the company at predetermined prices.

“In case they do not wish to join this program, they can simply sign an agreement and grow other available varieties of potatoes.” PepsiCo said.

The lawyer for the farmers said they need time to consider the offer. The next hearing is June 12.

PepsiCo is India’s largest processed grade potato buyer. It developed the largest collaborative potato farming operation in India, including thousands of farmers, the company said.

“We have been growing potatoes for a long time and we didn’t face this problem ever, as we’ve mostly been using the seeds saved from one harvest to plant the next year’s crop,” Bipin Patel, one of the four farmers sued by Pepsico, told Reuters. Farmers groups have asked the Indian government to make a court filing on their behalf and take action against PepsiCo.

“The company was compelled to take the judicial recourse as a last resort to safeguard the larger interest of thousands of farmers that are engaged with its collaborative potato farming program,” the PepsiCo statement said. The company plans to double its collaborative farming network over the next five years, including expansion into new regions.
