Four arrested in 2010 murder case

RAJKOT: Following Gujarat high court’s (HC) order in a 2001 case of murder, Wankaner taluka police on Wednesday arrested four persons from their villages in Morbi district . The accused were identified as Rugnath Ghodasara, Tulsi Kasundara and Manish and his brother Ketan Patel, who were arrested from Ravapar, Dhunada and Adepar villages respectively.The accused had allegedly stabbed Bharat Patadia to death on the outskirts of Panchashiya village of Wankaner taluka in Morbi district.On July 9, 2010, Patadia had gone along with Ramesh Rabari to till a disputed plot of land. The land dispute was between Dinesh Patel and Trambak Patel. Dinesh had leased out the land to Rabari for cultivation. When Trambak came to know that his land was being tilled without his permission, he along with Ghodasara, Kasundara, Manish and his brother Ketan arrived at the spot with knives and attacked Rabari. When Patadia intervened, they allegedly stabbed him to death.“At the time of the crime, Rabari had lodged a complaint against Trambak, who was arrested. However, as the police did not arrest the other accused, Rabari moved the HC in January this year, following which the HC ordered Wankaner taluka police station to arrest all the accused involved in the case,” said a source from Wankaner taluka police station.Meanwhile, Trambak was acquitted by Morbi sessions court which gave him the benefit of the doubt on March 25 this year.The four accused arrested in the case were produced before Wankaner chief judicial magistrate court which sent them to one-day remand.
