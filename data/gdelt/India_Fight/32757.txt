SpiceJet Plane Overshoots Runway While Landing In Rain At Mumbai Airport

The Boeing 737-800 plane came from Jaipur, officials said.

A SpiceJet plane overshot the runway while landing in Mumbai airport amid heavy rain just before midnight on Monday, officials said. No one was injured in the incident, officials said.

The Boeing 737-800 plane came from Jaipur, officials said.

In photos taken by passengers, yellow oxygen masks could be seen dangling above the seats and passengers queuing up to exit from the SpiceJet flight SG 6237.

The main runway has been closed after the incident and a secondary one is being used for flight operations. Some international flights are likely to be diverted to other airports like Bengaluru and Ahmedabad, said officials.

"A Korean Air flight KE655 coming from Seoul to Mumbai has been diverted to Ahmedabad due to the incident and bad weather conditions," news agency PTI quoted unnamed sources as saying. A Lufthansa flight LH756, coming from Frankfurt, and an Air India flight AI331, coming from Bangkok, had to be diverted to other airports, the sources said.

Flights are likely to be delayed due to the main runway's closure.

"...SpiceJet Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated flight SG 6237 from Jaipur to Mumbai. There was heavy rain in Mumbai and the aircraft, after landing, overshot the runway. Passengers were deplaned normally. There was no injury to either the passengers or the crew," a SpiceJet spokesperson said.

Mumbai received the highest rainfall in a decade over a two-day period since Sunday, affecting trains and flights, resulting in massive traffic jams and flooding homes in low-lying areas on Monday.
