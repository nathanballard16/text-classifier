Dog saves Pune doctor's life after cardiac arrest, repaying him for his kindness

Dogs are a man's best friend. This is a phrase all of us have heard all our lives and the ones among us who have been dog owners, will surely be able to relate to it.

In another instance of bravery and love shown by man's four-legged friend, a dog actually saved her owner's life.

Ramesh Sancheti, a 65-year-old Pune-based doctor might have died if 'Brownie', his senior dog, would not have alerted his neighbour, Amit Shah.
