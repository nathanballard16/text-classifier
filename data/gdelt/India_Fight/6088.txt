Awantipora terror attack: Rajnath Singh to visit Srinagar, mobile and internet services suspended

Srinagar: In Awantipora in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district, at least 44 security personnel were martyred after Jaish-e- Mohammad (JeM) militants targeted the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy with a car bomb in one of the worst attack on security forces in the state in the last few years. The dastardly attack was strongly condemned by the Indian government, with Home Minister Rajnath Singh vowing that the attack would be given a "strong reply."

Home Minister Singh is also expected to visit Srinagar today. Prime Minister Narendra Modi took to Twitter on Thursday to pledge that the "sacrifices of our brave security personnel shall not go in vain." The Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) in an official statement accused Pakistan for the attack and added that the JeM founder Maulana Masood Azhar had been "given the freedom to target India."
