QBullet: SC To Rule on Ayodhya Case; BJP-Sena Alliance Teeters

Devendra Fadnavis resigned as Maharashtra chief minister on Friday – the first material damage inflicted by the raging war of words between the BJP and the Shiv Sena that has plunged Maharashtra and the pre-poll alliance into uncertainty just two weeks after it got the numbers required to form the next government.

Fadnavis, 49, a surprise pick by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) high-command after the 2014 Assembly polls, handed in his resignation to Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari hours before his term was due to conclude on Friday night.

He then began a press conference in a lighter vein, saying “I am giving a good news,” before launching into a scathing attack in which he accused the Sena of lying about “50-50 formula”, its Chief Uddhav Thackeray of unceremoniously snapping channels of communication, and the party of targeting BJP leaders – including Prime Minister Narendra Modi – in its mouthpiece Saamana.
