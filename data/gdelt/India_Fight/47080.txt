Man dies after 22 days of fight, attacker booked for murder

Ludhiana: Police here on Friday booked a farmer for murder in connection with the death of a man he had gotten into a scuffle with on September 18.

Though Chahar village resident Jagdev Singh did not die of injuries he suffered in the fight and died of a pancreatice disease, police have booked Kanwar Roop (32) of Hussainpura village as the family of the accused protested over the deatha and demanded the addition of the murder charge.

The SHO of Ladhowal police station, sub-inspector Balwinder Singh, confirmed the addition of murder charge in the FIR. He said at the time of the fight, in the evening of September 18, Kanwar had parked his car in the middle of the road near Bagga Khurd village in Ladhowal. When Jagdev was crossing the road with his wife, he asked Kanwar to move the car. Kanwar was drunk and the duo had a fight. That time, commuters intervened and Jagdev left.

However, minutes later, Jagdev returned and fought with Kanwar. He attacked Kanwar with a rod and escaped from there. Kanwar was discharged from hospital within two days. “However, on September 20, Kanwar was again admitted to a hospital for treatment of a pancreas-related disease. While undergoing treatment, Kanwar died on Thursday night. Though doctors at DMCH have said Kanwar was undergoing treatment of the pancreas, not the injuries he suffered in thee scuffle, his kin created a lot of drama and refused to take the body. The postmortem was conducted on Friday and the doctors have sent his viscera for chemical examination at the Kharar-based laboratory. As of now, the murder section has been added to the FIR. The viscera report will confirm the cause of death,” said SI Balwinder Singh.
