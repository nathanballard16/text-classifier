Delhi: Gang that took 100 cars to Manipur busted

Delhi Police claimed to have busted an inter-state vehicle theft racket with the arrest of a 27-year-old who was intercepted with a stolen car on NH-24 last month. Police said that the man, Ajish Khan, was driving a stolen vehicle to Manipur when he was arrested. After a month-long investigation, police recovered 11 luxury cars from Manipur.

DCP (East) Jasmeet Singh said the accused and his associates would fly from Imphal every month and take stolen cars from the capital. “They would take 10-15 cars every month from Delhi to Manipur and then deliver it to a man named Juma Khan in Thoubal, Manipur,” said Singh.

According to police, Juma would tamper with the chassis number of the cars and produce forged documents to get them registered with transport authorities in Manipur and Nagaland. Police are also probing the involvement of transport authorities in the racket.

“After Ajish was arrested, the car he was driving was identified to be stolen from Punjabi Bagh. Later, he told us that he sold the cars to people in other states. The gang has stolen more than 100 cars from Delhi,” an officer said.

Police claimed the stolen cars were sold to insurgent groups in the Northeast. After a police team went to Manipur to recover the cars, they had to drive the cars for more than 200 km out of the city.

“There was an insurgency in the area; underground groups were blocking roads and there was violence. Policemen drove the cars from Thoubal district to Imphal, from where it was brought to Delhi,” said a senior officer from the East district.
