Bengal governor not allowed to enter university for convocation

KOLKATA: The ongoing feud between Jadavpur University and West Bengal governor Jagdeep Dhankhar took an ugly turn on Tuesday when he was prevented by university employees from reaching the venue of the convocation ceremony on the campus, forcing him to return to Raj Bhavan after he spent a “futile” 90 minutes amid students shouting slogans against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a “partisan and divisive governor”. The governor is the chancellor of the university.Dhankhar, who went to the university to preside over Tuesday’s convocation, later convened a meeting of all state university vice-chancellors on January 13 and asked the chief minister to give him an update on the recent events and discuss with him the issue “in the coming fortnight”.CM Mamata Banerjee did not respond to Dhankhar’s “pain at being caught in a political cage” but later, at an anti-CAA rally here, she subtly referred to him as a “banka lok (crooked man)... who keeps commenting about Bengal’s law-and-order situation”.The blockade of Dhankhar’s car at the university was led by employees affiliated to TMC. “He has been making partisan remarks on the anti-CAA and anti-NRC protests, which are not becoming of a chancellor,” university Siksha Bandhu Samiti spokesperson Binay Singh said. Scores of students stood wearing “go-back” badges and shouting anti-Dhankhar slogans, as varsity employees formed the first chain of protesters.Dhankhar called the protests “remote-controlled” and “a politically motivated orchestration”, finding them to be symptoms of a “policy paralysis of a critical nature”. “The V-C informed my aide that he was unable to help without taking any initiative. He should give up if he cannot manage a handful of protesters,” Dhankhar said.VC Suranjan Das later said he did not have sweeping powers under the Jadavpur University Act.Dhankar, however, felt the malaise was much deeper. He cited the new rules issued by the state government, plugging all channels of direct communication between VCs and the chancellor, as an example.
