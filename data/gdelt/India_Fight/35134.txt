Bangalore news July 19 highlights: Session adjourned till 11 am on July 22; IMA Mansoor in ED custody

As high-decibel political debates failed to see a conclusion in Karnataka legislative assembly on Friday, Speaker K R Ramesh Kumar has adjourned the assembly till 11 am on July 22 (Monday). With the chief minister H D Kumaraswamy missing the second deadline set by Governor Vajubhai Vala (6 pm on July 19), debates on the Governor’s power to intervene in assembly proceedings went on for hours as the same was repeatedly questioned by Congress-JD(S) legislators throughout the day.

“The Governor cannot manufacture any business for the House to transact through a so-called message or otherwise,” Congress MLA and RDPR minister Krishna Byre Gowda reads out a Supreme Court Constitutional Bench ruling citing the limits of the Governor’s power.

On the other hand, the opposition continued to raise their demand to hold a floor test constantly, at times, interrupting legislators from the coalition speaking in the Assembly. Reiterating their demand to hold a floor test by end of the day, leader of opposition BS Yeddyurappa said, “Governor’s letter sent today has mentioned that the vote should finish today. People on our side will sit peacefully even if it till late at night. Let it take however long it takes, but we have to respect the Governor’s direction.”
