PM Modi on ABP: Pakistan tweeted themselves to give proof of airstrikes conducted post Pulwama attack

On the airstrikes, he said that if India had targeted the Pakistan army or their citizens, our neighbour would have put up a show to defame India.

Ahead of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave an exclusive interview to ABP News where he talked about airstrike's conducted post-Pulwama terrorist attacks. PM Narendra Modi in the interview to ABP News's Rubika Liyaquat and Sumit Awasthi said that Pakistan should stop sponsoring terrorism from across the border. When the PM was posed with a question over some factions in India asking about evidence on the airstrikes, he said India did not claim anything but it was Pakistan who had tweeted and announced that India conducted air strikes in their territory. He said that Pakistan gave proof about the airstrike through their tweets and those who want to, can dispute over it. Tensions between India and Pakistan escalated after Indian Air Force fighter jets bombed terror group JeM's training camp near Balakot in Pakistan on February 26. The Indian strike on the JeM camp came 12 days after the terror outfit claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on a CRPF convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama in which 40 soldiers were killed. It was the first time since the 1971 war that India has used air power against Pakistan.
