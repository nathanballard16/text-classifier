36 yrs on, combat-ready Tejas wins IAF chief’s nod

BENGALURU: Some 35 years after it was conceived and 25 years after the project was greenlighted, light combat aircraft Tejas received fulsome praise — and approval — from the Indian Air Force chief that it was ‘combat ready’. With this, Tejas officially secured the final operational clearance.Asked if Tejas was combat ready, IAF chief Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa said: “Didn’t you see them perform at Vayu Shakti? That’s the proof.”Three IAF aircraft — Tejas, Su-30 Mki and the Jaguar — flew in the ‘missing man’ formation at the Aero India 2019 inaugural flypast as a tribute to Wing Cdr Sahil Gandhi, who was killed in Surya Kirans’ collision. P 6US firm Lockheed Martin on Wednesday unveiled the F-21, a multi-role fighter jet, which it claimed will be specifically configured for the Indian Air Force. You saw how much the aircraft could fly and the number of sorties it could generate during Gagan Shakti.
