Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2's Erica Fernandes, Parth Samthaan leave for Switzerland. See pics

The one big happy family of Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2 was recently spotted at the Mumbai airport. From Erica Fernandes, Parth Samthaan, Pooja Banerjee to Karan Singh Grover, the entire cast and crew of the popular family drama left the country last night for an outdoor shoot sequence in Switzerland.

Erica and Pooja posted pictures on their social media page, as they waited for their flight to take off. Erica looked stylish in comfortable black-and white t-shirt with metallic tracks. While, Parth chose a maroon track suit.

According to reports, the Switzerland sequence will add a lot of drama and masala to Prerna and Mr. Bajaj's track. After Hina Khan aka Komolika made an exit, the show witnessed a dip in the viewership. To fill the void left by Komolika, the makers introduced Mr Bajaj's character.

Karan Singh Grover has nailed the look from his salt-and-pepper hair to dialogue delivery. Karan's efforts to do justice to Mr. Bajaj's role are visible in the recent episodes. It is to be recalled that Karan Singh Grover in the 2002 show played the role of Sneha's husband Sharad who turned out to be an out-and-out negative character in the later episodes. This time his character is not only meatier but also a significant part of the storyline.

Currently in Kasautii Zindagii Kay, Mr Bajaj is yet to disrupt Prerna and Anurag's love story. His current focus is on destroying Basu Industries and Anurag Basu. Bajaj's motive is still unclear and it looks like there is some hidden agenda that he doesn't want to reveal. In the upcoming episodes, he would force Prerna to marry him and some reports suggest that this track will unfold during the Switzerland schedule.
