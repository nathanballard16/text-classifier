MUMBAI: Owing to the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, the chartered accountants (CA) exams earlier scheduled from May 2 to May 17 now stand postponed. The exams will now be held from May 27 to June 12, 2019.The CA exams falling on May 6 and 12 were clashing with the poll dates, following which the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) postponed the entire set of exams, including the intermediate and the final exams.The ICAI released a press statement announcing the postponement of exams on Monday. Over a lakh students usually appear for the CA finals in the country and around 1.5 lakh appear for the intermediate exam. ICAI holds CA final and intermediate exams twice in year. While exams were clashing only on two days, the ICAI thought it would be ideal to postpone the entire exam.No examination is scheduled on June 5, 2019 (Wednesday) on account of Id-ul-Fitr, being a Gazetted central government holiday.However, it may be noted that there would be no change in the examination schedule in the event of any day of the examination schedule mentioned above, being declared a Public Holiday by the Central Government or any State Government / Local Authority.Last date for submission of exam forms without late fee: March 16, 2019Last date for submission of exam forms with late fee: March 23, 2019The candidates are advised to submit their application forms before the deadline to avoid late fee payment.The Election Commission of India announced the poll dates on Sunday, which hit several exams held across the country. The CA exams were similarly postponed during the last Lok Sabha elections in 2014.
