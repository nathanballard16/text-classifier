MADURAI

Six persons were arrested by Madurai rural district police after one of them opened fire at a toll plaza in Kappalur near Tirumangalam here on Thursday. The police seized four pistols and 15 live rounds and a swanky SUV from them.

The police said that C. Dhanasekaran alias Ennore Dhanasekaran of Chennai was returning with his associates in the SUV after attending a murder case hearing at a court in Tirunelveli. When the SUV was at the National Highways Authority of India toll plaza at Kappalur, the occupants picked a quarrel with the toll plaza staff without paying the toll at around 2.30 p.m.

As the exchange of words heated up, one of Dhanasekaran’s associates, P. Sasikumar of Ariyamangalam in Tiruchi, pulled out a pistol and fired two rounds. However, no one was injured. While the others escaped in the SUV, Sasikumar, who attempted to run away from the scene was overpowered by the staff.

Meanwhile, the police were alerted across the district. A police team intercepted the other five, who were trying to escape in an autorickshaw, at Valandur. When they tried to escape from the police, the local people helped the police nab them at around 3.45 p.m.

The police identified the associates of Dhanasekaran as A.K. Raghupathi, 39, of Keezhakuyilkudi, K. Karthiyekan, 38, of Perambur, Chennai, M. Harikrishnan, 33, of Vysarpadi, Chennai, and A. Raja, 34, of Vellore. They are being interrogated.
