OnePlus 7 Pro camera was used to shoot the cover of Harper’s Bazaar May 2019 issue

The magazine announced on social media that the cover photo of their latest issue featuring actor and activist Jameela Jamil, was shot using the OnePlus 7 Pro.

The OnePlus 7 launch is looming large over us and every few days, a new feature of the upcoming flagship is being disseminated by the brand to create hype leading up to the launch. After announcing that the OnePlus 7 Pro’s display has been rated A+ by DisplayMate, and confirming triple cameras on the back via a newspaper ad, it was revealed the latest cover photo of Harper’s Bazaar magazine was shot using the OnePlus 7 Pro.

The magazine announced on social media that the cover photo of their latest issue featuring actor and activist Jameela Jamil, was shot using the OnePlus 7 Pro. The actor insisted that the photos required no digital retouching or airbrushing.

The photograph was shot with Jameela in Los Angeles, on a rooftop terrace, according to an ANI report.

“It’s a picture-perfect camera, and the output was amazing. I could not believe we had an option to shoot RAW images without having to connect it to an app or computer. We used the photo to capture behind-the-scenes clips and notcied the video was even better,” Harper’s Bazaar’s creative director said in a press release.

This is not the first time OnePlus has collaborated with a fashion magazine to show off its camera prowess. Back when the OnePlus 6 was launching, the company did a similar collaboration with Vogue India magazine where actor Aditi Rao Hyadri’s photograph was taken with the OnePlus 6 for the magazine’s cover photo for the May 2018 issue.

We have asked OnePlus for a comment regarding the use of professional lighting, post-processing and the exif inforrmation of the photo. The article will be updated with more information as and when we receive it.

OnePlus 7 Pro camera specs

The cover photo indicates the OnePlus 7 Pro will come with a better camera sensor that can shoot in RAW format. The phone might even offer new lenses. So far, OnePlus has confirmed that the OnePlus 7 Pro’s camera will offer 3x zoom as well as a triple-camera setup on the back. This was also confirmed by the full-page ad on the New York Times on Tuesday where the company published the schematics of the upcoming flagship. The schematics reveal that the OnePlus 7 Pro will not only come with a triple-camera setup, but also sport a pop-up selfie camera, allowing the display to stretch entirely to the edges.

While we are still awaiting key details of the camera hardware, the photo makes us expect a good improvement in camera performance over the OnePlus 6T. The phone is likely to bring better zoom as well as better low-light shooting capabilities as indicated by an image shared by OnePlus product manager Szymon Kopec on Twitter.

It’s likely that the OnePlus 7 Pro will incorporate the 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor that’s also there on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro and the Honor View20. Furthermore, a 16MP wide-angel camera is also expected as part of the camera stack along with an 8MP telephoto lens offering 3X zoom.

Alongside the OnePlus 7 Pro, the company is also expected to launch the OnePlus 7, marking the first time that the company will launch two phones under one series. The OnePlus 7, based on leaks and rumours, is likely to come with a dual-camera unit.

OnePlus 7 Pro specs

In addition to an upgraded camera, the OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro, like all its predecessor, will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855. Furthermore, the phone is expected to come with a display with a refresh rate of 90Hz which should result in a smoother viewing experience. Apart from this, we expect the upcoming flagships to offer at least 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage, along with an in-display fingerprint sensor and Warp Charging.

The OnePlus 7 and the OnePlus 7 Pro will be announced simultaneously in three cities — Bangalore, New York and London on May 14.
