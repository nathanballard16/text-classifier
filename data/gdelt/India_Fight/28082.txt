A suspected drug trader has been killed in a "gunfight" with Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB) in the Hili border area of Dinajpur.

The deceased is Delwar Hossain, 45, from Nandipur in Hili. The incident occurred in Chengram village, in the early hours of Friday.

Three BGB members have also been injured in the gunfight, Joypurhat 20 BGB battalion Commander Lt Col Rashed Md Anisul Haque said.

Rashed said: "Delwar was detained in Nandipur, of the Hili border area, while trying to enter Bangladesh from India with 958 yaba pills. Later, based upon his information, a BGB platoon conducted a special drive in Chengram area.

"However, upon seeing BGB, a group of drug traders shot at them, prompting BGB to fire back," Rashed added. "Delwar was hit by a bullet in the gunfight. Three BGB members were also injured."

Delwar was pronounced dead after being admitted to Hakimpur Upazila Health Complex. The three injured BGB members are: Delwar, Mamun and Matin. They are receiving treatment at Joypurhat Battalion Hospital.

BGB also recovered 500 bottles of phensedyl and three locally-made weapons from the spot. A case has been filed with the Hakimpur police station.
