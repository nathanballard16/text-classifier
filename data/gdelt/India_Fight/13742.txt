Modi: Oppn playing to Pak gallery on air strike

He said Pakistan is playing upon the statements of Opposition leaders to spread lies against India. Kanpur: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday attacked the Opposition for questioning the airstrikes on terror camps in Balakot in the aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack. Developmental projects took pace after you made Yogi Adityanath the chief minister,” he said. Such irresponsible behaviour demotivates the Army, he said.“The way, the Opposition is demanding proof of airstrikes in Balakot is actually benefiting Pakistan, which has been harbouring terrorism. It’s unfortunate that attempts are being made to demean the valour of Army.
