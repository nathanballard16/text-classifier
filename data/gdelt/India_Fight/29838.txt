Based on a complaint by Ramtek’s family, six people were booked for murder.Police said the arrests of the three persons involved in the crime came on a tip-off. “We were informed about their movement near Bil Akbarpur village in Dadri. A special checkpost was set up. The three men were seen coming in an Alto that was also used in the murder, and we nabbed them at 12.15am,” said SP (rural) Vineet Jaiswal.Apart from Baleshwar, the other two have been identified as Nitesh, a resident of Surajpur and Kapil, a resident of Dadri. “A total of seven men were involved in the crime. While three have been arrested, four others are on the run. We have recovered two revolvers and a country-made pistol used in the murder,” the SP (rural) said.During questioning, Baleshwar told cops his elder brother Ramesh went missing in January and his body was later found in Aligarh. He suspected Ramtek’s role in it and feared that his cousin would also get him killed.
