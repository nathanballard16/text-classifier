Jet Airways’ Lenders Leave Door Open For Naresh Goyal’s Return

The Goyals are the promoters of Jet, at one time India’s largest private sector airline, now third-largest. Also, most indebted. Their failure to run the airline profitably, and an over Rs 8,500 crore pile of debt is what prompted their eventual departure from the 25-year old airline. Evidently, the lenders were convinced that no new investor would consider putting money to work at Jet if the Goyals stayed on. That's a damning indictment of, at best their mismanagement, at worst their lack of bonafide intent.
