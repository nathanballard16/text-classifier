The Delhi High Court will hear in February a plea seeking action against Delhi police officers who staged a rare protest following their November 2 clash with lawyers at the Tis Hazari Courts Complex.

A PIL was filed in the Delhi HC Thursday demanding action against the officers who protested in front of Police Headquarters. The petition, filed by lawyer Rakesh Kumar Lakra, sought directions to the Centre to initiate a departmental inquiry against the officers who sat on “dharna”, “made provocative slogans” and issued “inciting” statements on electronic and social media.

“Personnel of Delhi Police…sat on an unwarranted dharna in contravention of Rule 7 of the Central Civil Services Conduct Rules, 1964… ,” the petition read.

Hundreds of police personnel had gathered outside the Delhi Police headquarters at ITO Tuesday and staged an 11-hour protest against attacks on their colleagues on Tis Hazari and Saket court complexes.

A scuffle broke out between Delhi Police and lawyers at Tis Hazari court on Saturday over a parking issue. As the argument turned ugly, a police vehicle was set ablaze at the premises. Lawyers alleged that two of their colleagues were injured, including one in police firing, but the police denied that it had opened fire.

On Monday, another confrontation followed in which a group of lawyers allegedly assaulted a policeman and two litigants outside Saket court.
