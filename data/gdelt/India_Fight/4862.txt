Christians were horrified to see Pentecostal Church in India’s Telangana state completely engulfed by black smoke when they arrived for worship. On closer inspection much of the inside of the church, including furniture, the pulpit, the sound system, fans, carpets, and lights, were burned to ashes during the attack on February 2 at about 11am. The devastating attack on the church, home to 200 worshippers, has left Christians from ten villages without a place to worship.

Churchgoers had complained about being approached by local radicals who ordered them not to attend the church before the fire. Police have said they will investigate the fire on grounds of religion. Meanwhile, without a church building, members of the Indian Pentecostal Church held their regular Sunday worship service outside of the burned church in open land on Sunday, February 3. The news comes as Christians around the world are facing increasing levels of persecution, with those in Asia most likely to risk imprisonment, torture and even death for practicing the faith.
