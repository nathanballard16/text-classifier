After Pakistan releases Wing Commander Abhinandan, Shah Rukh Khan says ‘Eternally grateful’

Bollywood megastar Shah Rukh Khan on Friday took to his social media pages to express his joy on the return of the Indian Air Force officer, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan.

His social media post read, “There is no better feeling than Coming back Home, for home is the place of love, hope & dreams. Ur bravery makes us stronger.” The superstar concluded with stating, “Eternally grateful.” He, however, did not name Pakistan leaving it to his fans’s imagination on whether he was grateful to the neighbouring country or simply expressing his state of mind after the officer’s release.

Wing Commander Abhinandan was captured by Pakistan after his MiG 21 fell on the other side of the LoC on Wednesday. However, Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan had stunned the world by announcing in his parliament that his country will release the Indian Air Force officer on Friday as a peace gesture.

On Wednesday, the Pakistani Air Force had breached the Indian air space and attacked military installations in Jammu and Kashmir. Indian Air Force officials on Thursday had showed the evidence of the Pakistani Air Force using F-16 to target Indian military installations. Senior Air Force officers displayed the cover of AMRAAM missile fired from Pakistani F-16 aircrafts found near the LoC in India after the press conference concluded.
