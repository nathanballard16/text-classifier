LoC infiltration: What is Pakistan's Border Action Team?

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army successfully foiled a BAT border action team ) operation by the Pakistani army in Jammu & Kashmir's Keran sector this week, killing five to seven terrorists or Special Services Group (SSG) commandos.Cross-border raids by BATs are normally undertaken by a group of six to seven Pakistan army soldiers mixed with a few terrorists after systematic reconnaissance of vulnerable spots and studying the deployment and patrolling patterns of Indian troops along the 778-km long LoC.The raids are planned and conducted by the Pakistani forces to push terrorists across the LoC into the Indian side.Pakistan army's elite Special Services Group (SSG) commandos are often part of the BAT actions.The SSG commandos, or the 'black storks' as they are called due to their uniform colour, were among the first batches of intruders that crossed the LoC into Kargil in 1999 to establish fortified positions.In May 2017, two Indian soldiers were beheaded in Krishna Ghati sector in Poonch district during a BAT attack carried out under the cover of shelling by the Pakistani troops. The mutilation was roundly criticised as barbaric and led to escalation of military tension along the border.In January 2013, Lance Naik Hemraj was killed and his body mutilated by a BAT. It also beheaded Lance Naik Sudhakar Singh. Constable Rajinder Singh of the BSF battalion suffered injuries in the attack.Over the last two years, Pakistan army has attempted over half a dozen BAT raids to push intruders into the Indian side of Jammu & Kashmir and attack forward posts.
