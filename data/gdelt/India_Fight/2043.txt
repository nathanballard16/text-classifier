170 prohibited weapons seized from BJP leader's shop in Mumbai

Thane Police have arrested a local BJP leader and seized 170 prohibited weapons from his shop located in suburban Mumbai area of Dombivali.

Crime branch officials headed by Senior Police Inspector Sanju John raided a shop owned by BJP leader Dhananjay Kulkarni and seized the items.

Police have also found that Kulkarni, who is a BJP vice president from Dombivali, had stored several swords, choppers, knives, steel knuckles, axes, machetes, air rifles and pistols illegally in his shop. The goods were reportedly being sold to customers and Kulkarni never had any permission to store these prohibited and dangerous weapons.

Forty-nine-year-old Kulkarni was arrested on Monday. Kulkarni, in his defence, had said that the seized weapons were just fancy models of real weapons and used as showpieces. He has been sent to judicial custody and is currently lodged in the Aadharwadi central prison.
