After cops’ care, eight-year-old showered with sisterly love

VADODARA: He was upset when his father was arrested for murdering his mother and had nowhere to go. But eight-year-old Bhavesh Devipujak celebrated one of his best Raksha Bandhan ever in the city. The kid, who studies in fourth standard in a government school , got many new sisters who tied rakhi on his wrist.“On the day of Raksha Bandhan, many families turned up at our zone 3 office to meet Bhavesh. The girls accompanying those families tied rakhis on Bhavesh’s wrist. He seemed very happy,” said S G Patil, ACP (E division). “He was enjoying every moment as he also got lot of sweets and some gifts,” Patil told TOI.The lady cops posted in the zone 3 office also tied rakhi on his wrists. “Though Bhavesh has started going to the school but he does miss his friends. On Raksha Bandhan he had company of many kids. We are glad that he is living a normal life again,” Patil said. Bhavesh’s father was arrested by the police last week after their investigations revealed that he had killed his wife.The cops learnt that Bhavesh had no relative to look after him so they decided to become his guardian. He was given a special room in the zone 3 police building at Panigate and a cop was assigned to him round the clock. TOI had reported about the cop’s noble gesture and since then lot of good Samaritans have been flocking the zone 3 office to meet Bhavesh.“Everyday some family turns up at our premises and expresses its wish to keep Bhavesh with them for a day. They take him out for movies and shopping. But to ensure that Bhavesh is safe, a lady cop always accompanies him wherever he goes. He is our responsibility now,” Patil added. The police have been looking for a kids hostel so that they can shift Bhavesh. “Many cops in our office are so much attached to him that they don’t want him to leave,” he said.
