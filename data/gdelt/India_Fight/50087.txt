Two students one from Kashmir and another from Bihar, suffered minor injuries in a scuffle between two groups at the Gulzar Group of Institutes in Khanna Sunday.

Kashmiri students alleged that police detained three of them “illegally” and two of them were “severely beaten” by the other group of students. However, Khanna SSP Gursharandeep Singh told The Indian Express, “No student has been detained. The matter has been sorted out and it was a minor issue between Kashmiri and other students.”

In a tweet sent to Punjab Police, a Kashmir-based photographer posted a video claiming it was taken inside campus, in which students are allegedly seen protesting and shouting slogans against Punjab Police, saying ‘We Want Justice’.

Along with the video, he alleged in a message: “A Kashmiri student was beaten by 40 other students and when other Kashmiri students tried to save him, they too were beaten. College authorities called police who detained some Kashmiri students without any reason…”

Speaking to The Indian Express, Inspector Baljinder Singh, SHO, Sadar Khanna police station, said that the students had an argument in the evening when tea wasn’t served in time. “Some students from Bihar started banging utensils, to which Kashmiri students objected. Soon, two students, one from each group, had a scuffle and they sustained minor injuries. College authorities informed us. We have not detained any student and matter was sorted out through talks between representatives of both groups,” he said.

He added that the Kashmiri students might have protested inside campus but now the situation was peaceful. No FIR was registered till the time of filing of this report. The college’s spokesperson could not be reached for comment.
