Rajkot: The wife of a slain ceramic factory labourer was booked for his murder in Rangpar village of Morbi taluka on Wednesday night. Police said the accused, identified as Kiran Harijan (25), was booked on the complaint of Jitendra Verma (19), nephew of Ramsinh Harijan (25).

Ramsinh’s body was found from the cabin of a ceramic factory in Rangpar village on Wednesday morning.

In his complaint Verma alleged that Kiran had bludgeoned Ramsinh to death. Verma said that it was Kiran's second marriage with Ramsinh. Ramsinh used to be angry with her as she had not stopped talking to her first husband Indul Paswan. The couple used to fight often over this issue.
