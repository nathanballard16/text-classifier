Fire engulfs factory in city area

Ludhiana: A major fire broke out at Sanjeev Fabrics in Veer Nagar at Bahadur K Road . The fire kept officials on their toes since Thursday morning. It was noticed by the labourers in the factory at the first floor and they ran out of the premises to bring it to the note of others around and the owner of the factory about the incident. The fire had spread on the first and second floor of the factory adding to the woes of the fire officials.

The fire brigade was able to take control of the situation after they reached the spot. As many as ten fire tenders had to be stationed at the spot to take control of the situation. Fire brigade officials were informed at 6.05 a.m. It was a difficulty for the fire brigade officials to reach the second floor and the damage was expected to be caused there as all the raw material was stored on the first floor. It was only after the fire officials reached the upper floors from the neighbouring building that they were able to take control of the fire.

It took four hours for the firemen to take control of the situation. Stationed at a week foundation of the building , they had to primarily operate from outside the factory. Station fire officer S N Sharma said, “There were fire extinguishers inside and also some other arrangements were made by the owner of the factory. The exact reason behind the fire is yet to be known.” Sharma said almost 3.5-4 lakh water was consumed to ake control of the situation. The assistant divisional fire officer Bhupinder Sandhu after checking the records said that no NOC was issued by the fire department in the name of this factory. He said the owner of the factory had pegged the loss worth at Rs 4-5 crore as there was ready made material kept inside the unit along with raw material and machinery.
