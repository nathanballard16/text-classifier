I guarantee action on this," Prime Minister Imran Khan said in an address to the nation on Radio Pakistan."It is in our interest that nobody from our soil spreads violence. I want to tell Indian government that we will take action if evidence is found against anyone from Pakistan," Imran said.However, he warned that any adventurism on part of India to threaten sovereignty of Pakistan will be met with assured retaliation. He said that he has come across calls for attack on Pakistan through the Indian media."I know it's a poll season in India. If India will attack us we will surely retaliate. It is easy to start a war but difficult to end. The issue should be solved through dialogue," he said."India has blamed Pakistan without any proof. Pakistan has nothing to gain from this attack. Pakistan is moving towards peace and stability. This is new Pakistan and new thinking that doesn't support terrorism," he added."What would Pakistan gain from this?" he asked.He also said that he didn't respond to the Pulwama attack because of important visit of Saudi Arabia's crown price to Pakistan.Yesterday,had sought the UN's urgent intervention to "defuse tensions" withPakistan has strongly rejected India's allegations and said that the JeM remains a proscribed entity in Pakistan since 2002 and the country was implementing its obligations on sanctions implementation.On February 14, at least 41 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in Kashmir's Pulwama district in a suicide attack claimed by-based Jaish-e-Mohammad terror group.The attack has heightened bilateral tensions with both New Delhi and Islamabad calling back their envoys.In a tit-for-tat action,called back its High Commissioner from India on Monday for "consultations", days after New Delhi asked itsin Islamabad to return.
