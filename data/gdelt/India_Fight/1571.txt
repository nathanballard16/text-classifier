If Modi gets second term BJP will rule Kerala: Shah

New Delhi: BJP President Amit Shah claimed that if Prime Minister Narendra Modi gets a second term in India, BJP would be in power in Kerala and Bengal. Speaking at the BJP National Council meeting, Amit Shah said that BJP will strengthen its root in the southern state when Modi wins the 2019 general elections.

The country requires a strong government which can be provided only by the BJP. The present opposition can form only a weak government. If people stand by Modi BJP will once again be in power in India, opined Amit Shah.

There are different kinds of wars. Some, people will forget easily. But some have long and wide influence. The ‘Battle of Panipat’ under Shivaji was one of that kind. Marathis had won 131 wars fought under Shivaji, but the third Battle of Panipat was lost. With this the British conquered India and pushed the country into 200 years of slavery. The battle was so important that it decided India’s fate.

Just like the third Battle of Panipat, the 2019 general election is also of utmost importance, Shah said.
