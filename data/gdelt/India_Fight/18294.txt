Army veteran, BJP leader join AAP

Former Indian Army Captain Shalini Singh, also wife of late Major Avinash Singh Bhadauria, who was killed in action in September 2001, on Tuesday joined the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) here.

Along with her, the former Vice President of Delhi BJP Purvanchal Morcha, Shailendra Singh, also joined the party.

"We are proud to announce that the country's brave daughter, Captain Shalini Singh, as well as Shailendra Singh are joining the AAP. We welcome both of them," AAP MP Sanjay Singh told the media here.

Shalini Singh, who joined the Army just three months after her husband was killed in Doda in Jammu and Kashmir, said she was joining the party as she believed in the ideology of the AAP and wanted to work for the betterment of the country.

Speaking to the media, she said she joined the AAP as she had "seen how the party has transformed Delhi in the last four years".

Echoing the sentiments, Shailendra Singh, who was part of the BJP for 15 years, said the AAP was doing good work whereas the "BJP has become all about Modi".

"The ideology of the BJP was the country came first, then party and then person. But since 2014, the BJP has become all about Modi and party has taken a backseat," he said.

He accused the BJP of sidelining those who worked for it for years.
