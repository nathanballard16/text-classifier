Alleged plot to kill ‘Hindutva leader’: Arrested man is a BJP leader!

Kasaragod, Jan 16: A man from Kasaragod district who was arrested by the Delhi police recently for alleged plot to “kill a high profile personality”, is in fact an active leader of Bharatiya Janata Party.

CM Muhatasim alias Tasim alias Taslim, a resident of Chembarika in Kasaragod district, was picked up from Chattamchal by Vidyanagar police on January 11 as per the directions of Delhi police. The next day, Delhi police arrived in Kasaragod and took him to their custody. A case was registered against him under Section 120B IPC.

He was taken to Delhi on January 12 after presenting him in a local court in Kasaragod to get a transit warrant issued. Local media reports claimed that he was arrested for plotting to kill Hindutva leaders. Some Kannada TV channels also claimed that he was arrested for plotting to kill RSS veteran Kalladka Prabhakar Bhat.

However, according to the police here, the details of the charges were not revealed to them and a special team directly controlled by the district police chief helped the police team from Delhi. The only information they got was that the case was registered in Delhi last week and Delhi police reached here immediately.

A few years ago Muhatasim was accused of two passport forgery cases and also two murder attempt cases. For several years, he has been an active leader of minority morcha of the BJP. Following his arrest, Muhatasim’s dozens of photographs with BJP leaders from Kasaragod and Dakshina Kannada are doing rounds on social media platforms.
