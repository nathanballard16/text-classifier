Ghaziabad: Law student was throttled to death, says autopsy

GHAZIABAD: The 30-year-law student, whose body was found buried 6ft under the basement room of his landlord in Sahibabad, died because of strangulation, police have said, quoting from the autopsy report.The report also said Pankaj Singh , a fourth-year student of LLB in a private college, died at least five days ago and his body was buried a few hours after his death.On Monday, the decomposed body of Pankaj was found buried 6ft under the concrete floor of one of the rooms his landlord Munna Yadav had built recently in the basement of his three-storey house. Munna is absconding with his family. The student’s father has accused Munna of murdering his son because Pankaj apparently refused to sell his cybercafé to the landlord.“Asphyxiation due to ante-mortem strangulation,” the autopsy report mentioned as the cause of death. Police suspect a piece of cloth was used to strangulate Pankaj.Rakesh Kumar, a medical officer at MMG hospital, where the autopsy was conducted, said, “It is sudden unnatural dead, placed in the category of homicide. Even the body is five days old.”Meanwhile, police are yet to trace the landlord, Munna, and his family. Cops suspect he may have fled to Bihar and two teams have been sent to trace him. “We have put the phone numbers on surveillance. Initial investigation has suggested that Munna sent his family to his native place in Bihar via train or bus and he fled to another place,” said Rakesh Kumar Mishra, the circle officer in Sahibabad.Police have also got five bottles of deodorant and 10 cans of room freshener from the house. Police suspect the perfumes had been kept to hide the smell of the body.Pankaj’s family members said they would stage protests outside the offices of the SSP and the district magistrate if the main accused wasn’t arrested soon.
