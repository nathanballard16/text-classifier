Rape Case Against Alok Nath To Be Closed Due to Lack of Evidence, Claim Reports

The rape case filed against Bollywood actor Alok Nath might get closed by the police due to lack of evidence, claim fresh reports. Just to jog your memory a little, Alok Nath was accused of rape about ten months ago by television screenwriter and producer Vinta Nanda. All of this happened amidst #MeToo spreading like a wildfire in India, with many names coming to the forefront.

Nanda had shared her alleged ordeal on social media in October 2018. Apart from sharing her side of the story, she also filed a case against Alok Nath at the Oshiwara police station.

The details of the witnesses were provided to the police by the survivor after she narrated the entire case and alleged that it happened 20 years ago, when they were shooting popular 1990s' TV serial Tara, in which Alok Nath played the male lead.

In his defence, Alok Nath had lodged a counter defamation suit against the complainant. He demanded a written apology from her and a monetary compensation of Re 1, as well as a restraining order. An FIR was registered against the actor by the Oshiwara Police and the charges were filed under section 376 of IPC (rape).

The actor, who was last seen in De De Pyaar De, was booked for alleged rape a month later. However, due to lack of sufficient evidence against the actor, Oshiwara Police might file a closure report in the case and a charge sheet too can't be filed in the matter.

A Mid-day report quoted an Oshiwara police station officer as saying,

"We have recorded a detailed statement of the victim. Two witnesses were called to the police station a number of times but they haven't yet recorded their statements."

Reacting to the news of the closure of the case, Nanda's lawyer Dhruti Kapadia said,

"Let the police do whatever they are planning, we will take it forward accordingly."
