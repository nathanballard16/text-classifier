India tests anti-satellite weapon

India shot down a low-orbiting live satellite in a missile test that has made it only the fourth country with such capabilities, in a major leap forward for its ambitious space programme.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who triggered much speculation after tweeting he had a major announcement, said in a televised address to the nation yesterday that a missile travelled nearly 300km from earth and hit the satellite within three minutes of its launch from a facility in Odisha, eastern India.

The test put India in an exclusive club of space superpowers that include the United States, Russia and China.

"Today, India has become the fourth country to acquire this status as a space power. There can be no bigger moment of pride for every Indian than this," said Mr Modi, who is in the midst of an election campaign.

The Prime Minister also maintained that the test, called Mission Shakti or strength, was not directed at any country.

"Today, I also want to assure the international community that the new capability we have developed is not directed against anyone. India has no intention to threaten anyone.

"This is an effort to secure a fast-growing India. India has always been opposed to the weaponisation of space and an arms race in outer space, and this test does not in any way change this position," said Mr Modi of the test carried out by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).
