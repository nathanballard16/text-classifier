‘Abrar murder charge sheet by Nov first week’

Investigators will be able to submit the charge sheet in Buet student Abrar Fahad murder case before the concerned court by the first week of November this year.

Masudur Rahman, deputy commissioner (media) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP), told the development to The Daily Star this evening.

“We have found involvement of all the arrestees,” the police official said adding that the investigation is nearing its end.

Masudur also said four accused out of total 19 arrestees have already given their confessional statement before the concerned court.

Abrar, a second-year student of electrical and electronic engineering department of Buet, died after he was brutally beaten allegedly by some Chhatra League men at Sher-e-Bangla hall of the university on early hours of October 7.

The incident triggered a firestorm of protests on campuses across the country. Many took to social media to demand justice for Abrar.

Law enforcers suspect Abrar was attacked because of one of his recent Facebook posts, which seemed critical of some recent deals with India.

Amid protest on the campus, Buet authorities October 11 banned all political activities on the campus and suspended 19 students, mostly leaders of the university’s BCL unit, accused in Abrar Fahad killing case.
