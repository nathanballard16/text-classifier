TRS leader hopes for peace in J&K; CPI leader terms govt move

Noting that monumental change is being made with respect to Jammu and Kashmir's reorganisation, ruling TRS leader K Kavitha on Monday said her prayers are with people of the state and expressed hope peace would prevail.

In this moment of monumental change being made with respect to reorganisation of #JammuAndKashmir & #Article370 my prayers are with the people of J&K. Hope they will be safe & soon peace will prevail over Kashmir, Kavitha, daughter of chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, tweeted.

Former CPI general secretary S Sudhakar Reddy claimed the governments move was a misadventure by Union Home Minister Amit Shah.

It was against democracy, the Constitution and the instrument of accession (of Kashmir with India), he charged.

Rejecting BJP's charge of vote bank behind the continuation of Article 370 and 35 (A) all these years, he said people of Kashmir, under the leadership of National Conference and Sheik Abdullah, preferred Kashmir to be part of secular India than the theocratic state of Pakistan.

He alleged that dividing the state and reducing Jammu and Kashmir to a Union Territory was a misuse of powers of the Union government.

Claiming that the governments move was an insult to the people of Jammu and Kashmir, he said his party condemned it.

The Centre on Monday abolished Article 370 that gives special status to Jammu and Kashmir and moved a separate bill to bifurcate the state into two separate union territories of Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh.

Hailing the abolition of Article 370, firebrand BJP MLA Raja Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has fulfilled his promises, including bringing a bill against triple talaq.

Describing the day as "historic", he claimed it is a "dark day" for the Congressmen.
