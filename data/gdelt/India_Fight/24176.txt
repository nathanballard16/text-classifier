Amitabh Bachchan cancelled Sunday Darshan with fans at Jalsa; says 'in bed & in 'pain'

Mega star Amitabh Bachchan has developed many traditions over the years since he first set foot in the industry. One of them is meeting and greeting his fans without fail every Sunday outside his home Jalsa in Mumbai's Juhu area. People from all over come to witness and catch a fleeting glimpse of Amitabh Bachchan who steps out of his home every Sunday without fail. However, this Sunday the superstar could not make it for the meet and greet.

Taking to Twitter, Amitabh Bachchan revealed that he was not feeling too well and hence won't be stepping out to meet his fans. The 76-year-old actor, who sees his admirers every Sunday at his house since past 36 years, said he might be in pain but fans need not worry.

He tweeted, "All Ef and well wishers .. not doing the Sunday meet at Jalsa Gate this evening." On his blog, Big B further wrote, "..Not doing the Sunday Darshan today... In bed... Pain .. Inform all, nothing to worry, but unable to come out." Take a look at his tweet below:

Reportedly, Amitabh Bachchan will be seen in the remake of Tamil film Kanchana titled Laaxmi Bomb in which he may play the role of a transgender on the big screen. However, no official confirmation regarding Big B’s role has been made yet.
