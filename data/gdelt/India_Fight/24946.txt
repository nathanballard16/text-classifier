Naga Shaurya turns writer

Actor Naga Shaurya, who has been quite successful at charming the audience with his acting skills, is about to unravel another one of his hidden talents to the people.

The actor’s next film Ashwatthama was formally launched in the city on Saturday. With debutant Teja in the director’s seat, the film will feature Mehreen Kaur in the female lead role. Apart from playing the lead role, we have learnt that Shaurya is also the brain behind the script. “I have even co-written Chalo to a major extent. I was part of its script development sessions. And while I couldn’t work on the script for Narthanasala, I realised that Ashwatthama’s concept was in alignment with my thought process and so, I resolved to pen its script by myself,” he explained.

While Shaurya didn’t open up about his role in the movie, he revealed, “It’s fiction, and most of it is set to be shot in Vizag. Conceptually, the film replicates Ashwatthama’s fearless questioning of Draupadi’s Vastraharan, and is essentially about a man who fearlessly questions anything that he might find unjust or inappropriate."
