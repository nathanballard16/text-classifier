Jet Airways down but aviation sector stays afloat with hopes of festive season

Even after the popular and private carrier Jet Airways was grounded earlier this year, the civil aviation sector has managed to stay afloat with no significant decline.

Jet Airways was completely grounded due to lack of funds in early 2019.

Jet Airways had around 110 aircraft in its fleet with both wide body and narrow body planes. The airline also had staff strength of over 1,500-2,000 pilots and 5,000-6,000 cabin crew members. Most of them have been accommodated elsewhere in the industry.

As of August 2018, there were 570 aircraft flying in the Indian skies and as of August 2019 there are 600 aircraft still. This is despite 110 planes of Jet Airways being grounded.

Aviation secretary Pradeep Singh Kharola said, "We have resilience in the aviation sector even after Jet Airways went down. There was 5-6 per cent capacity growth in the sector. Fares are coming down now because competition has picked up. Festive season is coming up and we will see more participation in the next few months."

On the other hand, India's national carrier Air India is battling its own miseries. Air India owes three state-owned oil firms Rs 5,000 crore in unpaid fuel bills. This has prompted oil retailers to stop refuelling Air India planes.

IOC, Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) on Thursday afternoon stopped jet fuel or ATF supplies to Air India at six airports - Kochi, Pune, Patna, Ranchi, Vizag and Mohali, over payment defaults.
