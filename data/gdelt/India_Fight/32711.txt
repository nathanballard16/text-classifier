Alia Bhatt has always been a heroine we look up to. Apart from chasing after her dreams at a very young age, she's relatable, fuss-free and fabulous.

Over the last few days, images from Alia's vacay in New York along with Ranbir Kapoor and his family have been doing the rounds. Whether it's a family dinner or strutting around the streets of New York, Alia has been making the most of her little getaway.

Apart from her pretty pictures, Alia had earlier shared a picture on her Insta handle with a sweet message. She wrote, "We exist in moments, nothing more."
