Row between Chancellor and VC of MANUU takes a grim turn

A+ A-Hyderabad: The row between the Chancellor and Vice Chancellor of Maulana Azad National Urdu University (MANUU) took a grim turn when the Vice Chancellor, Dr. Aslam Parvaiz, who resigned from his post on Sunday, shot off a letter to the President of India, who is also the visitor of the university, complaining against the Chancellor, Mr. Firoz Bakht Ahmed. He stated the Chancellor has sent mails to local journalists falsely claiming that the HRD Ministry has asked the VC to either resign or face an inquiry. Ever since Mr Firoz Bakht was appointed as Chancellor in 2018, he and the VC have been at loggerheads. Based on the complaints, the University Grants Commission (UGC) set up a fact-finding committee under the HRD Ministry, earlier this year. He asserted that finding him guilty of the allegations, the HRD committee asked Dr Parvaiz to either resign or face a departmental inquiry.
