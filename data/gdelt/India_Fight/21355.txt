UN Lists Bhopal Gas Tragedy That Killed Over 15,000 People, Among World's 'Major Industrial Accidents'

The 1984 Bhopal gas tragedy remains one of the darkest episodes in modern Indian history.

The disaster which according to government data, killed over 15,000 people was the result of a gas leak in Union Carbide pesticide plant in Bhopal.

The incident happened on the intervening night of December 2–3 when highly toxic methyl isocyanate (MIC) gas leaked from the plant and affected more than 600,000 workers and nearby inhabitants.

It is considered one of the biggest industrial mishaps anywhere in the world.

Now the United Nations have officially recognized it as one of the world's "major industrial accidents" of the 20th century.

The report released by the UN labour agency International Labour Organization (ILO) has listed Bhopal gas tragedy among the likes of Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters as well as the Rana Plaza building collapse in Dhaka.

The Chernobyl disaster happened in April 1986, when one of four nuclear reactors at the Chernobyl power station in Ukraine exploded, releasing at least 100 times more radiation than the atom bombs dropped on Nagasaki and Hiroshima and killed 31 people immediately and thousands of people in the aftermath.

Fukushima nuclear power plant in Japan was hit by a major 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 resulting in equipment failures which caused a series of explosions, fires and radiation releases, causing injuries to plant workers and emergency responders.

The Rana Plaza collapse happened in April 2013, when a building, which housed five garment factories, killed at least 1,132 people and injured more than 2,500.
