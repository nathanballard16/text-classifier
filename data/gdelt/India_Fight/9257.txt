Fire breaks out in Ahmedabad, Rs 25 lakh turn to ashes as blaze engulfs Indian Bankâ€™s ATM

New Delhi:

A massive fire broke out at a market in Gujarat’s Ahmedabad. As the firefighters tried to douse the blaze, Rs 25 lakh turned to ashes after the fire engulfed an ATM of the Indian Bank. According to latest reports, the fire broke out at the ATM located in Memnagar’s Rudra Arcade on Sunday. The fire soon spread out in adjacent shops in the area. A dental clinic was also gutted in the blaze. "The financial loss in the blaze is estimated to be around Rs 2.50 crore," a fire official was quoted as saying by Times of India.

On Sunday, more than 100 cars were gutted in a major fire at a parking lot in a ground opposite to Ramachandra Medical College in Chennai’s Porur. Fire engines had to battle for more than two hours to douse the fire. The cause of the fire is yet to be determined. Of the total 208 parked cars, 176 were gutted and 32 were "saved from the fire," he said. The cars were parked "bumper to bumper" in close proximity and is suspected to have been one of the reasons for the blaze having spread so quickly. The parking lot is situated bang opposite a large private sector medical college and hospital at suburban Porur. Several road users and local residents said huge coloumns of smoke billowed out of the facility, causing anxiety and inconvenience. The impact of the fire could have been much more if the parked vehicles had petrol in fuel tanks, the fire official said.

The incident came a day after 300 cars were gutted in a fire at a parking lot at the Aero India show in Bengaluru.

Worst of all these incident was Karol Bagh fire in the National Capital. Seventeen people were killed and several injured in a massive fire that broke out in Delhi’s Karol Bagh area in the early morning hours on February 12. The blaze was reported from Hotel Arpit Palace in Karol Bagh, which was doused somewhere around 11 am. “Fire has been doused. Bodies are being taken out now. Rescue operation underway,” Sunil Choudhary, Deputy Chief Fire Officer was quoted as saying. Initial probe suggests short circuit to be the reason for the blaze.
