Priyanka Gandhi Not a Factor in LS Polls: Prashant Kishor

Patna: Janata Dal – U national vice president Prashant Kishor, at a press conference in Patna on Monday, downplayed the arrival of Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi on the political scene saying while she was a well-known name, she would have little or no impact on the upcoming Lok Sabha elections.

Kishor, who was inducting former independent politician Ashok Kumar Chowdhary into the party at the JD-U office, said that while Congress was strongly pushing the grand-daughter of former Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi into the political arena, her presence on the campaign trail would have no impact on the prospect of the NDA.

“In politics, there is no such thing as an ‘instant formula’ for success. Priyanka Gandhi has, by and large, remained outside the political corridors of Delhi for much of her life and it would be very difficult to imagine she has some sort of miraculous trick that would somehow change the already defined landscape of the Indian politics,” the JD-U leader said.

Narrating his experience from his short stint as a Congress consultant, Kishor said that during the last election he had suggested Congress leaders to make Priyanka Gandhi the face of the party but the Congress turned down his suggestion.

“Time has changed since then. I doubt if her presence will make any difference in UP polls,” he said.

About his recent meeting with Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackrey, Kishor defended his action saying his friendship with Sena leaders went back a long time and he did not see any harm in meeting with his old acquaintances in Mumbai.
