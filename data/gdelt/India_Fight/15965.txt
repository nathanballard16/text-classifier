Pulwama attack: Country will not forget their supreme sacrifice, says Ajit Doval

The country will never forget the "supreme sacrifice" of the 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel who were killed on February 14 in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama attack, National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval said on Tuesday.

Doval was the chief guest at the 80th Raising Day in Gurugram as Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh or Prime Minister Narendra Modi could not attend the event because of the Model Code of Conduct.

He also said that the "country's leadership is very capable to effectively respond" to terrorist attacks.

"I want to pay tribute to the brave 40 CRPF jawans who sacrificed their lives in Pulwama for the country. The country has not forgotten and will never forget...If your morale is high, the country's future is safe...Maintain this credibility, capability, and professionalism as India is looking up to you," Doval said, adding, "Whenever we have meetings and discuss which force to send, we say send the CRPF. It is a credible force."
