The fate of Home Minister Rajnath Singh, Congress president Rahul Gandhi, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi and Union Minister Smriti Irani was sealed as polling for the fifth phase of General Election concluded today. Fifty-one parliamentary constituencies across seven states recorded 63.5 per cent voter turnout.

With the completion of the fifth phase of polling, voting for 424 of the 543 parliamentary seats has concluded. Barring a few incidents of violence reported from West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir, “voting was largely peaceful and no loss of human life was reported from anywhere”, Election Commission official Sandeep Saxena said. Election is being held on 542 seats. Polling for the Vellore Lok Sabha seat in Tamil Nadu was cancelled due to excessive use of money.
