Will West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee be the Prime Ministerial face of opposition?

In a few days, soon after the Budget Session of Parliament ends, Mamata is expected to bring her battle to New Delhi. After her ‘successful’ January 19 rally with opposition leaders, followed by her sit-in demonstration against 'Centre harassing Kolkata police chief' drawing regional leaders to Kolkata in support, musings have grown.

Many pollsters have predicted a hung Parliament. Following the Karnataka experiment, there is a buzz that Congress may give outside support to a non-BJP coalition majority. That they have done earlier too.

The conglomerate of about 23 parties knows that any party winning near about 35 seats will be a contender for the chair. Thus, the statement of Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu – while asking Mamata to withdraw her sit-in protest – that she will win all 42 Lok Sabha seats in her state and will be the “deciding factor” in 2019 polls, is significant.

Mamata wants her to be seen as the adhesive binding the conglomerate.

However, parties like the Left, Biju Janata Dal, Telangana Rashtra Samithi and YSR Congress Party may not join. When pointed out, a Trinamool leader dismissed it by saying that altogether, they will not get more than 30/40 seats.

So the answer lies in a number of ‘ifs’. If NDA loses the majority... If conglomerate comes close to the magic figure... If the Congress can cobble enough seats... offers support...

While her path to South Block is very tough, this feisty lady is known never to give up...
