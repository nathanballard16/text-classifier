#DareToLeapChallenge

Celebrating the response to the launch of Realme 5 Pro, Madhav Sheth, CEO of Realme India, initiated #DareToLeapChallenge. To give you a quick background, the brand pushed #real5squadchallenge, urging users to participate through their official TikTok challenge. Emphasizing on the cool factor of being a part of the #RealSquad, Sheth decided to battle his acrophobia (fear of heights) by skydiving – a decision taken by Realme fans.

Since childhood have acrophobia(fear of heights) and I want to overcome this fear. I want to #DareToLeap like a true member of #realSquad. Guys, How about I skydive :) Your vote will decide whether I take this #DareToLeapChallenge? RT if u are excited as I will reveal more soon. — Madhav '5'Quad (@MadhavSheth1) September 2, 2019

Further, the brand leveraged the momentum by organizing an additional sale, with Sheth sharing that he wanted to make #DareToLeapchallenge more exciting, and will increase the height of his skydive by 1 ft for every 10 units sold.

Thank you guys for making me skydive from a daring height but I want to make the #DareToLeapChallenge more exciting by jumping from a much higher height so we have #realme5Pro sale at 4PM and 8PM to make it more daring.

RT & spread the news, I will give 10 #realmeBuds2 today. pic.twitter.com/i1ohLoGACX — Madhav '5'Quad (@MadhavSheth1) September 4, 2019

Soon enough, Realme India sold 130k+ units of Realme 5 and a video of Madhav Sheth skydiving from a height of 13,000 ft was released. The video is heavily laced with tones of exhilaration and excitement experienced by Sheth, true to the brand’s philosophy as well.

As promised, I conquered my fear and took the #DareToLeap challenge by skydiving from 13,000ft! Take a look at this exciting adventure. Kudos to all #realme fans for the love and support! pic.twitter.com/lfmbPauX22 — Madhav '5'Quad (@MadhavSheth1) September 10, 2019

Strengthening #DareToLeap further, the brand has roped in Ayushmann Khurrana as their brand ambassador.

#100MillionXiaomi

Xiaomi India, on the other hand, crossed the 100 million smartphones sold mark in a span of 5 years. Celebrating the achievement, the brand launched a video showing Manu Jain, (Managing Director, Indian Subcontinent – India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Sri Lanka) of Xiaomi Technology celebrating with the length and breadth of the entire team.

As a pre-buzz to the 100 million smartphone announcement and the campaign launch, fans & followers were given a chance to guess what the BIG announcement is.

Xiaomi’s social media game has been strengthened with its latest initiative, #MiFans. Essentially, #MiFans is a loyal & engaged community consisting of young, passionate tech geeks who give advice on the best phones in the industry. For the launch of their flagship phones, Redmi K20, and Redmi K20 Pro, the brand launched a campaign asking fans to add #MiFan in their display name on their social media handles. In a recent media report, Jain claimed that over 10k fans added the prefix to their social media name.

While Realme takes a more campaign-based approach, hitting all the pillars of communication, including a celebrity brand ambassador, a Twitter challenge, and people-first approach, Xiaomi India focuses on engaging with fans & community while acknowledging and appreciating the team effort.

The timing of both the campaigns and the mirroring approaches puts both the brands right in the competitive marketing league. The battle of Me & Mi continues to rage.
