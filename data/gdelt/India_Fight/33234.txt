Islamabad: Pakistan has denied the presence of underworld don Dawood Ibrahim in the country, days after the US told a London court that the gangster was indeed currently in exile in Pakistan and operates from Karachi. The revelation has corroborated India's stand that the D-company operates and carries out anti-India activities from Pakistan.

"Dawood Ibrahim is not in Pakistan," Pakistan Foreign Office Spokesperson Muhammad Faisal told reporters in response to a question during his weekly press conference.

The US admission came on June 3 during an extradition trial of a top Dawood aide - Jabir Moti - from the UK. The US during the trial also listed illegal operations being carried out by the D-company and its links with terror outfit Al-Qaeda.

"The head of D company is Dawood Ibrahim, an Indian Muslim currently in exile in Pakistan. Dawood Ibrahim and his brother and top lieutenant, Anis Ibrahim, have been fugitives from India since 1993 when D-company was implicated in coordinated bombings in Mumbai that killed more than 200 people," John Hardy, appearing on behalf of the US government stated in UK court.

The US is trying to extradite Moti on charges of money laundering, extortion, and conspiracy to import unlawful substances such as heroin. According to the US, Moti is a top lieutenant in D-company and reports directly to Dawood. He was arrested by Scotland Yard officers from a London hotel in August 2018 in connection with a US grand jury indictment following an extensive FBI investigation.
