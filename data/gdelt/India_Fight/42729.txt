NEW DELHI: Union minister Prakash Javadekar on Sunday hit back at Rahul Gandhi 's dig that no development took place in the first 100 days of the Narendra Modi-led government, saying that he won't react to statements of people who are not seen on 90 out of 100 days.Earlier, the Congress had launched an all out attack on the Modi government, alleging that there had been "no development" in the first 100 days of its second term. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said there was a "glaring lack" of leadership, direction and plans where it is needed the most - to turnaround a "ravaged economy".Responding to the criticism, Javadekar said the whole world knows about the work done by the government. "Those who are not to be seen in 90 out of 100 days, how can I react on their comment," he said.The Prime Minister's Independence Day speech, his speech to the Motion of Thanks to the President's Address in Parliament, laws which have been passed, the way things have changed and decisions that have been implemented show the government's positive intent, he said."This speed, the Congress had never witnessed. Therefore, I don't have anything to say to their comment," Javadekar said.
