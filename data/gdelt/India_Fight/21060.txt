Vice chief of Army staff visits strategic East Sikkim and interacts with troops

KOLKATA: Lt Gen Devraj Anbu, vice chief of Army staff (VCOAS), is on a three day visit to the Trishakti Corps and forward areas of Sikkim. The VCOAS reached Sukna on Wednesday and was briefed by Lt Gen C P Mohanty, GOC, Trishakti Corps on operational preparedness and the prevailing situation along the borders. Lt Gen Anbu then proceeded to East Sikkim to visit key forward posts, where he interacted with troops.The Doklam or Dolam Plateau, where troops of the Indian Army were engaged in a stand-off with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is located in Bhutan across the East Sikkim border. Though tension has eased considerably at Doklam, China has not given up its plans to create better infrastructure, including a road cutting across the valley. India had reacted to this construction that would have allowed the PLA quicker access to the strategic chicken neck corridor that connects the northeastern states to the rest of the country.Though it is not known whether Lt Gen Anbu actually went to Doklam where Indian troops are still in position, he certainly visited border posts. “The VCOAS’s visit will send across a strong message that India is extremely serious about protecting her sovereignty. While interacting with troops, the general officer complimented them on their professionalism, commitment and dedication for maintaining round-the-clock vigil along sensitive border areas,” a senior officer said.
