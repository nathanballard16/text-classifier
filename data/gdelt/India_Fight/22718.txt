COIMBATORE: The city police on Saturday arrested a 43-year-old man for allegedly murdering his mother and elder sister at his house on Avinashi Road in 2015.I Saravanakumar told police that he killed his mother and sister at his residence located adjacent to the HDFC Bank after they refused to give him money.Police had recovered the skeletal remains of his mother Pappathi, 67, wife of Irudhayaraj and his sister I Geetha, 43, from the house on February 24, 2016. “The family has a property on Avinashi Road worth Rs 7crore and Rs 32lakh in a bank. Pappathi’s husband had died decade ago. She believed that he was a victim of black magic and kept away from her relatives, whom she felt was responsible for his death. She also forbade her children from having contacts with outsiders. Over the years, all of them suffered from mental health problems. They were surviving on the food provided by their neighbours. After the remains of the mother and daughter were recovered, police suspected that Saravanakumar also might have been murdered by someone for the property,” a police officer said.Saravanakumar visited a relative’s house at Palayakottai near Kangeyam in Tirupur district on Saturday night and the relatives informed Race Course police. “He told police that while his mother and sister used to take money from the bank account, they never gave him any. It prompted him to kill them. He stayed in the house for four months and later became a beggar. He visited many temples in Tamil Nadu and neighbouring states for begging. His health condition has deteriorated,” the officer added.
