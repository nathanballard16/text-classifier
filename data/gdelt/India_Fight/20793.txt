Vishnupriya Nair Becomes The New TikTok Sensation Just After The App Gets Banned!

TikTok has many viral and crazy videos, and while you can hate them or love them, you can’t ignore them. With millions of followers on the app, people can become overnight sensations

From fake Alia Bhatt to Gareebo ka Ranveer Singh, TikTok has turned many commoners onto big celebrities. The latest star on the block is 19-year-old, Vishnupriya Nair. Hailing from Aurangabad, Maharashtra, the new celebrity already has 2.6 million fans.

Her latest video in which she can be seen lip syncing the famous song ‘Khuda ki Inayat’ made her a star overnight as the video bagged her 3.6 million likes.

Here is the video:





In other videos, she can be seen lip syncing some other famous Bollywood songs such as ‘Tere Liye’ and ‘Naino Wale Ne’. These videos also have likes in millions.





According to a report, Vishnupriya is pursuing B.Com, and her father works in a 5-star hotel in Aurangabad.

While people are becoming overnight sensation thanks to this app, it has also proved to be a nuisance in more than one way. Google and Apple app stores have removed the app after the Madras High Court said that TikTok encourages 'pornography' and is bad for children. A couple of days ago a Delhi man was shot while making a video on the app.
