The residences of senior officers, including IAS officer B Chandrakala, who is famous on social media for her anti-corruption crusade, were also raided in connection with the case, officials said.

The searches were spread across multiple districts including Jalaun, Hamirpur, Lucknow and also in the national capital, they added.

The agency had taken up the case on the instructions of Allahabad High Court.
