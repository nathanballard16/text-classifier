Kolkata: Trinamool Congress supremo and West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Monday launched a veiled attack at Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bharatiya Janata Party at the Centre and said that “they cannot wash off their sins merely by wearing saffron”.

Speaking to her party members in Kolkata, Mamata said, “BJP is destroying the communal harmony. The first thing they do after waking up in the morning is tilak. Now, they are doing aarti, wearing saffron. They can’t wash off their sins… They are mired in sin from head to toe.”

Her remarks came a day after PM Modi took a holy dip in Sangam at Prayagraj during the ongoing Kumbh Mela, following which he washed the feet of sanitation workers in Uttar Pradesh.

Attacking the Modi government, she said, "We will remove 'dictatorial' Modi government from power."

Mamata also set an agenda for her party members in the state and said that the TMC should win all 42 Lok Sabha seats in West Bengal in the upcoming general elections. “When I am saying we need 42 out of 42, I mean it. You have to translate that into the action. Let the Left (CPIM) do what it wants to do. Let the Congress do whatever they want in the state. There are places where last time all 3 had conspired together against us. Don’t bother. Let Congress chose what it wants in the state. TMC will have to work for 42 seats, we need all of them.”
