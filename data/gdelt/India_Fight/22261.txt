Wadala man who fled after killing wife held in Delhi

Accused had been on the run for three days

Three days after a 37-year-old Wadala resident allegedly murdered his wife in the heat of a domestic argument, the Wadala TT police arrested the accused from Delhi on Wednesday.

Faizul Rehman Qureshi had fled after allegedly slitting his wife’s throat on April 20 and the police had registered a case of murder against him.

The police said Mr. Qureshi was arrested based on human intelligence and cellular location mapping. “We first tracked him to Vikhroli on the day of the murder, but missed him by a few minutes. Based on information from local informants, we sent teams to various locations like Thane, Diva and Vikhroli,” according to senior police inspector Rajendra Sangle of the Wadala TT police station.

Meanwhile, based on the suspicion that the accused could seek refuge in his home town in Uttar Pradesh or Delhi, where he has some relatives, the police also started tracking his cellular location for leads.

“Our team acquired detailed information about the accused from his relatives in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh and visited a number of locations in both the states. He kept giving us the slip every time,” Mr. Sangle said.

Sources said that the accused also kept changing his SIM card several times, making it all the more difficult for the police to track him.

Following a tip-off that Mr. Qureshi was going to be in Chandbaugh, Bhajanpura in Delhi, the team reached there and nabbed him after a three-kilometre chase and brought him to Mumbai, said Mr. Sangle.
