Popular Bollywood actor Salman Khan will promote tourism for the state of Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Kamal Nath told mediapersons on Thursday.

"I spoke to Salman Khan who hails from Indore in MP and he has agreed to lend his name to promote the state. He [Salman Khan] will help out with the brand promotion of the state. He will promote tourism in the state," Kamal Nath said.

The chief minister further said he was sure the Congress party would win more that 25 seats in the upcoming Lok Sabha polls. The grand old party currently hold only three of the 29 constituencies in the state.

When asked for his opinion on the issue of the airstrike in Pakistan's Balakot by the Indian Air Force (IAF), Nath said there was nothing wrong with asking for details.

"Earlier too, similar strikes have been carried out but no one doubted them. Now everyone, including the international media, is questioning the efficacy of the strike. In such a scenario, what is the harm in sharing details? Why keep it a secret and from whom?" he said.

The IAF carried out an airstrike in Balakot in retaliation to Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed's February 14 suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, on February 26.

Meanwhile, Kamal Nath added the current dispensation has fulfilled a total of 83 points in the Congress manifesto in a mere 76 days in office. He also defended the frequent and large-scale transfers of government employees and officers.

Nath said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ruled the state for 15 years and a few officials had become the card-carrying members of the party -- who needed to be moved out.

"More transfers will take place in the coming days too," he added.
