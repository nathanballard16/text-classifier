Szafnauer: Racing Point planning factory move in 2021

Racing Point team boss Otmar Szafnauer says that the team intend on moving into their new factory over the summer break in 2021.

With Racing Point now under new ownership by the RP consortium after a decade of being Force India, the team’s financial situation has improved to the point where big changes are being planned as investment into the team has increased.

“There are many things that are different.” said Szafnauer at the team’s press conference on Friday at Spa-Francorchamps when asked about what has changed under new ownership. “The one significant thing is that we don’t suffer with the financial instability that we used to have, at all. That means we can plan our developments on the car, we can plan when we bring upgrades and they actually happen. We can plan our salary payments, which is helpful for everybody in the team.”

With Racing Point currently using the same factory facility that Force India used, as well as Midland/Spyker and Jordan before them, Szafnauer confirmed the team’s plans for a new factory are going ahead with construction expected to being in around six months time: “There’s a new factory coming; we should get planning permission for that in October, probably start, have ground-breaking in the first quarter of next year. The plan is to actually move into the new factory in the break of 2021. So, although that won’t come to fruition for another 18 months, or so, those plans are happening today.”

The team have also made new hires as they bolster their team size: “We’ve added about 40 employees: we were at 405 a year ago; we’re at 445.” said Szafnauer. And if there are good people on the market, we’re interested for good people. We’re adding, we’re growing and we want to be more competitive. So, those are our plans going forwards – but it takes time. It doesn’t happen overnight.”
