CM BS Yediyurappa defends Mangaluru firing, says cops reined in mob

Bengaluru, Dec 23: Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Sunday defended the Mangaluru police firing incident that left two persons dead during a protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), saying the men in khaki were carrying out their duty to protect the innocent people and prevent a mob from running amok.

The CM told reporters: “Police opened fire when the mob tried to storm a police station in Mangaluru and loot arms in its custody on Thursday. Should police keep quiet if a mob tries to disturb peace and indulges in arson? Aren’t police duty bound to protect the innocent people and their property?”

The CM’s statement comes hours after former chief minister and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy blamed the BJP government for Mangaluru unrest, and demanded the removal of officers behind the police firing and home minister Basavaraj Bommai. After 48 hours of curfew and suspension of mobile internet services, Mangaluru is limping back to normal.

The CM directed Dakshina Kannada district administration to give a compensation of Rs 10 lakh each to the families of two persons killed in police firing. Kumaraswamy handed over Rs 5 lakh compensation to the bereaved families.

Bengaluru witnessed two rallies — one for and the other against the controversial law — on Sunday. A 31-year-old man who was on his way home after a pro-CAA rally was stabbed allegedly by four miscreants in the afternoon.
