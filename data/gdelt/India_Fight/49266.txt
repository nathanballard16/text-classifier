The grenade attack took place near a bus stand in Sopore.

At least 19 civilians were injured in a grenade attack near a bus stand in Sopore district on Monday, Jammu and Kashmir Police said. Security forces have cordoned off the area and a search is underway to nab the attackers.

At least six persons sustained serious injuries and were referred to a hospital in Srinagar, officials said. The remaining are undergoing treatment at a local hospital, they added.

The attack comes two days after “unknown terrorists” lobbed a grenade on Karan Nagar police station in Srinagar, thereby injuring six CRPF personnel.

The 144th battalion of the paramilitary force was manning a checkpoint at the police station when the incident took place at around 6.30 pm, according to CRPF officials. The grenade explosion caused panic in the area, followed by firing which was promptly retaliated by the special forces troops.
