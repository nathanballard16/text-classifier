Arjun Kapoor to light up Bandra-Worli Sea Link in red

Arjun Kapoor has been lending his name to important causes like the ‘Girl Rising’ initiative, where he promoted a campaign for the education of young girls, or conserving the environment by becoming the face of the World Wide Nature Fund four years ago. He is especially all-heart when it comes to the cause of cancer, as he lost his mother Mona Shourie Kapoor to the dreaded disease. Now, the actor has come forward to support children who are battling the ailment.

September 22 is World Rose Day, which is observed worldwide as a gesture to bring happiness to the lives of cancer patients, the India’s Most Wanted star will make it special by illuminating Mumbai’s iconic Bandra-Worli Sea Link in red, that is, the entire stretch will beam with crimson lights. This is in collaboration with the Cancer Patients Aid Association, where he will spend time with young patients. As part of the event, he will hand over roses and gifts to the kids who will join him for this occasion.

“It is a cause that’s extremely close to me for very personal reasons. I will do whatever it takes to create awareness about cancer, support as many who are affected by it and try and tell as many that only our spirit can make us fight this disease. I’m looking forward to meeting these little bravehearts who are battling cancer with a smile. Their courage is inspiring and heartbreaking,” says Arjun.
