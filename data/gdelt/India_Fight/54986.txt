‘Murder’ charge on BJP govt

“This year Swahid Divas has turned into a ‘black day’ as the BJP has shown complete disrespect towards the Assamese people,” he said.

All Assam Students’ Union (AASU) general secretary Lurinjyoti Gogoi on Tuesday accused the central and state governments of “murdering” the 855 martyrs of Assam Movement for the “second time” by pushing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill in Parliament.

Gogoi said, “The basic objective of the Assam Accord was to identify and deport illegal migrants irrespective of religion. However, the BJP is attempting to subjugate the voices of the people of Assam by settling illegal migrants through CAB and providing them privileges on a par with the indigenous people, violating the Accord. The separate cut-off years will not be accepted.”

While the Accord fixed March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for detection and deportation of illegal migrants, CAB envisages citizenship for non-Muslim refugees who entered India from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh till December 31, 2014.

He asserted the BJP was trying to reduce and confine the indigenous people by settling “Hindu foreigners”. “We will not succumb to the BJP’s conspiracy. We don’t understand how CAB is bad for ILP and Sixth Schedule areas and good for areas outside these restrictions in the same state and region,” Gogoi said.

Reiterating the demand to scrap the bill, he said, “Not only the AASU, the people of Assam, from youths to the elderly, have realised the danger of the bill. Therefore, the movement against CAB from now on will be a fight between the people and the BJP.”
