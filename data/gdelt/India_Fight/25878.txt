After Pragya Singh Thakur called Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse a patriot, BJP MP from Karnataka Nalin Kumar Kateel compared Godse with former PM Rajiv Gandhi.

In a tweet, Nalin Kumar Kateel said, "Godse killed one, Kasab killed 72, Rajiv Gandhi killed 17,000. You judge who is more cruel in this??" The tweet has now been deleted.

Ajmal Kasab was involved in 26/11 terrorist attack and was executed in 2012.

Nalin Kateel, a two-time BJP parliamentarian, is contesting the election from Dakshina Kannada Lok Sabha constituency.

The BJP has time and again brought Rajiv Gandhi, the father of Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, to fore while targeting the opposition party over the 1984 anti-Sikh riots following Indira Gandhi's assassination by her Sikh bodyguards. Nearly 3,000 were killed in the three-day carnage.

Earlier, BJP candidate from Bhopal Sadhvi Pragya, in a roadshow, said, "Nathuram Godse was a deshbhakt (patriot), is a 'deshbhakt' and will remain a 'deshbhakt'. People calling him a terrorist should instead look within, such people will be given a fitting reply in the election."

Union Minister Anantkumar Hegde also batted for Godse and said that Nathuram Godse would have felt happy with the ongoing debate.

In a tweet which has now been deleted, Anantkumar Hegde said, "Am glad that 7 decades later today's generation debates in a changed perceptional environment and gives good scope for the condemned to be heard upon. Nathuram Godse would have finally felt happy with this debate!"

Also, BJP spokesman Anil Saumitra fueled the fire to Nathuram Godse controversy and said that Mahatma Gandhi was the father of the nation of Pakistan.
