New Delhi, May 8

With polling for two more phases of the Lok Sabha polls left, Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said the time for change had come and that “time was up” for Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

Gandhi claimed that the young and the old are voting in large numbers for NYAY, the Congress’ ‘Nyuntam Aay Yojana (minimum income guarantee scheme) to eradicate poverty, noting it showed how powerful the idea was.

The Congress has announced that under the scheme, the party, if voted to power, would give Rs 72,000 per year to 20 per cent poorest families in the country.

“Across India, it’s not just young people who are coming out in large numbers to vote for NYAY; older and experienced voters have also understood how powerful the idea is.

“Modi Ji, your time is up. The time for change has come,” he said on Twitter.

The Congress last month had announced ‘Ab Hoga Nyay’ as its battle cry for the Lok Sabha polls and launched a campaign centred around the theme of ‘justice’ while alluding to the party’s proposed minimum income scheme. PTI
