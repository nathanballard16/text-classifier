5 criminals arrested in Delhi

Five criminals from Haryana were arrested here before dawn on Monday after a brief shootout that left three of them wounded.

The shooting occurred at 5 a.m. after a Special Cell team was tipped off that the criminals would be headed towards Rohini's Sector 10.

"When the team spotted a car, it signalled them to stop but its occupants opened fire. The police retaliated," Deputy Commissioner of Police Sanjeev Yadav said.

Three of the accused were injured in the "encounter", Yadav added. Five weapons were seized from them.

According to Yadav, the five criminals are affiliated to the gangster Neeraj Bawana.

"During interrogation, it was found that the accused were involved in the February 2 murder of a driver in Rohini over personal enmity," the officer added.
