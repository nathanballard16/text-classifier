The Indian Police on Monday reported that no fewer than 15 people died and 35 others injured when a huge tent collapsed in north-western India amid heavy rain and strong winds.

The accident occurred in the grounds of a school in Rajasthan state’s Barmer district on Sunday evening when more than 1,000 people had gathered for a Hindu religious event.

15 people, several among them senior citizens, died in the accident, district police chief, Rashi Dogra Dudi, confirmed.

Thirty-five more injured were hospitalised but their condition was said to be “out of danger’’ by doctors, she added.
