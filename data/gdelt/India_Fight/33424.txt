Amritsar, July 6

The Amritsar (rural) police have started tightening the grip around the suspects whose names figured during the interrogation of Tariq Ahmad Lone, a Handwara-based trader nabbed by the Customs Department with regard to the recovery of 550-kg heroin. Lone is now in police custody of four days.

During his interrogation, the police found out that a charted accountant was also involved in import of rock salt from across the border. He has not been arrested yet as the police were still ascertaining his role.

A senior police official said the name of Jasbir Singh, at present in the custody of Customs Department, also figured during the chartered accountant’s questioning. Therefore, the Punjab Police are now contemplating bringing him on production warrant.

The Customs Department had zeroed in on Jasbir Singh and his son Harpreet Singh, besides notorious drug peddler Ranjit Singh Rana, during the investigation related to the seizure of 550-kg heroin and other narcotic material from the Integrated Check Post here a few days ago. Rana and Harpreet are still absconding.

It is believed that Jasbir and his son Harpreet were to pick up the narcotics, concealed in a consignment of rock salt, from Gurpinder’s godown and deliver it at Rana’s place.

It has been learnt that police teams have picked up around half a dozen persons from Hussainpura Chowk, where Gurpinder Singh lives, for interrogation. Police teams also raided various places in Pathankot. The police also scrutinised phone calls of Lone and are checking antecedents of the people whom he called during the period.
