Chennai: Tamil Nadu Minister KT Rajendra Balaji stirred a row by making derogatory remarks against Manickam Tagore, the Member of Parliament. During a meeting to celebrate the birth anniversary of Arignar Anna in Sattur on September 21, Balaji reportedly said that Tagore 'an ungrateful dog', should be hit with a broken slipper if he comes asking for votes for the Nanguneri bye-election. He added that Tagore is a 'pig' and should be 'shot with rubber bullets'.

"For Nanguneri (bye-election) candidate I think Congress is deciding its candidate sitting in Delhi. A waste person Manickam Tagore is the Member of Parliament now. If he comes and asks you for your votes beat him with a broken slipper," Balaji was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

"Neither he (Manickam Tagore) came to you asking for votes during Lok Sabha elections nor did he thank you after getting elected. He is an ungrateful dog who is sitting in Delhi. His family is also sitting in Delhi," he further added.

Balaji alleged that Tagore 'keeps on releasing press statements sitting in Delhi'. "If that pig comes here, shoot him. We generally use rubber bullets to shoot pigs, you also use same pig shooting rubber bullets to shoot this pig," he said.

Meanwhile, the district Congress committee submitted a petition to SP M Rangarajan against Balaji for instigating violence against Tagore. According to reports, a copy of the said video was submitted to the concerned authorities. Tagore has threatened legal action if a case is not registered against the minister.
