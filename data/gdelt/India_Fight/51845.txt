A 47-year-old man was arrested on Monday for allegedly slitting his 22-year-old daughter’s throat over her purported relationship with a youth belonging to a different caste at Salempur Khutiyana village in Firozabad district.

Harivansh has been sent to jail after being produced before the magistrate.

Pooja was killed in the wee hours when she was asleep, said police. “The father killed her when everyone in the house was asleep. He first gave electric shocks to her. When she resisted, he slit her throat with a knife. The father wanted her to get married to a person from their caste and had been trying to convince her to end her relationship with a youth, who is from the OBC category. Even Pooja’s family belongs to the same category but from other caste. They are financially more stable than the youth’s,” said senior sub-inspector Yogesh Kumar, posted at Jasrana police station. Harivansh has been booked under IPC section 302 (murder).

“We have lodged an FIR based on the complaint of the son of the accused. We got a call on our helpline number 112 and someone reported the murder. We think that the father made the call and then fled. We arrested him later from a hideout in the village,” the SSI said.

“The accused told us that he had killed the daughter because he did not want her to continue her relationship. He also told us that his family’s honour was at stake,” he added.
