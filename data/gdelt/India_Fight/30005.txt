Kareena Kapoor Khan to come on board for Aamir Khan's Lal Singh Chaddha?

If there is one actor in Bollywood who is known as the Mr Perfectionist, then only one name comes to mind and it is Aamir Khan. The star of films like 3 Idiots, Talaash, Dil Chahta Hai and many more is known for his ability to choose subjects which will not just entertain the audience but will also connect with them. On his birthday this year, Aamir had announced his next film which was an official adaptation of Tom Hanks’ film, Forrest Gump. Aamir titled the film, Lal Singh Chaddha.

Amidst this, the buzz is doing rounds that Kareena Kapoor Khan might be seen with Aamir in Lal Singh Chaddha. As per a report in Mid-Day, Kareena, who is in London shooting for Angrezi Medium, will come back to India to shoot her dance reality show and then decide whether or not she will take up Lal Singh Chaddha. As per the report, if Kareena comes on board, she will be seen playing Aamir’s love interest in the film.

As per Mid-Day, “The chemistry between the characters must be effortless. Aamir wants Kareena to play the part. She is in London till August, shooting for Angrezi Medium. She will make a pit stop in Mumbai next month for her TV commitments. The final call on the casting will be taken then.” Kareena and Aamir have done many films together including 3 Idiots and Talaash. Now, it will be interesting to see if Bebo takes on Lal Singh Chaddha as well. The film is being helmed by Advait Chandan and will start rolling by October.
