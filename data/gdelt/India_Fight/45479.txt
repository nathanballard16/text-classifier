Regulators can’t rejig bid-based tariffs: Aptel

NEW DELHI: The electricity tribunal has ruled that state regulators cannot alter tariffs determined through competitive bidding, which would have implications for the Andhra Pradesh government’s efforts to review power purchase agreements signed by the previous regime.Experts said the order, pronounced by the Appellate Tribunal for Electricity ( Aptel ) in a case filed by Resurgent Power Ventures related to 1980 MW Prayagraj Power plant, will also help stressed assets resolution. Prayagraj Power was the first stressed asset to be resolved outside insolvency court by lenders and has been stuck in regulatory hurdles for 11 months.The tribunal cited a previous ruling where it was held that in case of competitive bidding held under section 63, the state commissions need to merely verify that it was transparently conducted and “should not go beyond that as it is neither an Enquiry Commission nor a Vigilance Commission”.“The change in the PPA tariff, which being the fundamental basis for arriving at the bid amount by the bidders, any subsequent reduction in the PPA tariff, post conclusion of the bid process by lenders of the project, would amount to change in the fundamental basis of the bid. This is well settled law laid down by the honourable Supreme Court in several cases,” the tribunal said in an order on Friday.Himanshu Mishra, vice president, SunSource Energy said Uttar Pradesh regulator acted beyond the prayers of petition. “Such action, if admitted would-’ve given belief to open the legal precedence for other such competitive bidding PPAs creating regulatory uncertainty. Aptel upheld the sanctity of the contract and this was mandated specially under prevailing regulatory uncertainty created by the government and thus will act as boosting investor confidence in law of land.”The order can be useful in deciding fate of renewable energy contracts in Andhra Pradesh. The new state government has sought downward revision of 139 solar and wind contracts, where tariffs were mostly determined through competitive bidding. The Andhra Pradesh high court had last week transferred the cases to the state regulatory commission.and ICICI Venturesbacked Resurgent Power Ventures had approached Aptel against Uttar Pradesh power regulator’s demand to reduce power tariff from Prayagraj Power Corporation that was acquired by the company under a debt resolution scheme carried by the lenders to the project.The tariff of Rs 3.02 per unit for Prayagraj power plant, owned erstwhile by Jaiprakash Associates, was determined through a tariff-based competitive bidding in 2010 specified under section 63 of the Electricity Act and was adopted by the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission. The state power regulator had asked Resurgent Power to reduce the tariff of the plant by Rs 0.14 per unit. The matter was taken to Allahabad high court which transferred it to Aptel.The tribunal said about 40 GW of thermal power assets with a project cost of Rs 2.91 lakh crore are facing financial stress. If debt resolution by adopting accepted and admitted debt resolution mechanism is not allowed in time it would definitely lead to disastrous situation on account of road blocks and obstacles of this nature.Aptel has also struck down Uttar Pradesh regulator’s arguments that Resurgent Power saved Rs 200 crore per annum in interest cost.
