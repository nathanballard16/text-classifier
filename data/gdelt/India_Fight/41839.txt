Bhavnagar cop slaughters his three young sons

RAJKOT: Shock waves ran through Bhavnagar police after a constable allegedly murdered his three young sons at his house on Sunday.Constable Sukhdev Shiyal, who was posted in the police headquarters, slit the throats of the boys using a big sickle at his house in Vidyanagar police lines.Preliminary investigation suggested that Shiyal resorted to the gruesome crime due to nagging quarrels with his wife Jigna.Sources said that Shiyal had a bitter fight with Jigna in the afternoon after which he locked her in the room. He then shut the main door of the house and allegedly murdered the three sons. After committing the crime, he went and sat outside the house. After sometime, Shiyal himself called up the police control room informing that he had killed his sons.Shiyal's eldest son Khushal (7) studied in class II in Dakshinamurti School and the second son Uddhav, who was five years old, also studied in the same school. The youngest son Manonit was just two-and-a-half-years old.Bhavnagar superintendent of police (SP), Jaypalsinh Rathod, told TOI: “I interrogated Shiyal and his wife too. There were frequent quarrels between them and this looks to be the trigger behind the crime.”Rathod said Shiyal broke down and cried profusely during interrogation. “He confessed to the crime and claims that it was in a fit of rage that committed the murders,” the SP added.Sources said that during last year’s Navratri, Jigna had left the house after a quarrel with Shiyal and gone away to stay at her parents house in Loyanga village of Talaja taluka. However, the couple struck truce and she returned to his house later.Shiyal had been serving the police department for the past 10 years and was posted in the applications handling department at the headquarters.Bhavnagar range inspector general of police (IG) Ashok Yadav also reached the police lines.
