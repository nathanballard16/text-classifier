Srinagar: Two Jaish-e-Mohammed militants were killed in an encounter that broke out early on Wednesday morning in Jammu and Kashmir’s Shopian.

Security forces launched a cordon and search operation in Shopian’s Meemendar area after getting information about presence of terrorists there.

Police officials said the search operation turned into an encounter after terrorists opened fire towards the security forces.

The exchange of fire comes a day after India bombed and destroyed Jaish-e-Mohammed’s (JeM) biggest training camp in Balakot in Pakistan’s restive Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, about 80-km from the Line of Control (LoC), killing a “very large number” of terrorists, trainers and senior commanders.

The strike was the first by the Indian Air Force (IAF) inside Pakistan after the 1971 war.
