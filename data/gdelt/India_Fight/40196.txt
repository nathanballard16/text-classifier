Spokesman for the Pakistani Armed Forces Major General Asif Ghafoor stated that the army responded in a manner "befitting" the ceasefire violations in the Tatta Pani Sector, near the Line of Control, allegedly carried out by Indian forces. According to Ghafoor, six Indian soldiers, including an officer, were killed and two bunkers destroyed in the Pakistani response.

The Pakistani military spokesman also alleged that the alleged ceasefire violation by New Delhi's forces had claimed the lives of three civilians, including a 7-year-old boy. India has not responded to the claims yet.
