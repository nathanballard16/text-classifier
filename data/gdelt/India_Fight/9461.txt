Pakistan says Indian fighter jets crossed into its territory and carried out limited airstrike

NEW DELHI - Pakistan said Tuesday that India launched a limited airstrike in Pakistani territory, an apparent act of retaliation for a terrorist attack that killed 40 Indian soldiers this month.

According to Pakistan's military spokesperson, the Indian fighter jets crossed the line that divides much of Kashmir between India and Pakistan, a boundary that neither country considers an international border.
