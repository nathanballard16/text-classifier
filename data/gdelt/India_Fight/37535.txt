It comes after plastic was banned by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) in 2016.

Earlier in July, BS Yediyurappa was sworn in as the 19th chief minister of Karnataka -- his fourth shot at the top job.

It followed after 14-month-old Congress-JD(S) coalition government fell apart as HD Kumaraswamy failed to prove his majority in the state assembly.

Capping a three-week long high-voltage intense power struggle triggered by a raft of resignations by rebel lawmakers, that pushed the government to the brink of collapse, the motion was defeated with 99 members voting for the motion and 105 against it.
