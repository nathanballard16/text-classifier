Five labourers of West Bengal shot dead in Kulgam district

In Occupied Kashmir, unidentified gunmen have shot dead five migrant labourers of Murshidabad city of west Bengal in Kulgam district.

The incident occurred as India allowed a group of mostly far-right European Union parliamentarians to visit the region where tensions have soared since New Delhi began a clampdown on August 5th.

New Delhi has barred opposition politicians and a US senator from visiting valley since clampdown.

Authorities have claimed that things have gradually returned to normal but many residents refused to go to work.
