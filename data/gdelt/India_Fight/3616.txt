Earlier this year, the I-T Department conducted raids at popular cafe and restaurant chains, including Grand Sweets, Hot Breads, Saravana Bhavan and Anjappar group, across Chennai.

Residences and offices of the directors of these food-joint chains were also raided by a team of over 100 I-T sleuths.

Tax sleuths added that the department is looking into allegations of under-reporting and suppressing their income through several means and hence decided to conduct searches and obtain further evidence.
