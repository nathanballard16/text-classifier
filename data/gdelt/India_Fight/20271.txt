Varanasi, April 13

A wanted criminal, who was on the run after allegedly killing a BHU student, has been arrested following an exchange of fire with police.

A sub-inspector was also injured in the exchange of fire with the gangster, the police said.

Acting on a tip-off, the police had cordoned off the Lanka area here on Friday night.

The notorious criminal, Rupesh Verma alias Sunny alias Professor, a native of Buxar in Bihar, was nabbed when he tried to flee by opening fire at the police team, Senior Superintendent of Police Anand Kulkarni said.

Verma, who carried a reward of Rs 25,000, received bullet injuries in the leg and fell off the motorcycle which he had looted a few days ago from a man on the national highway, the SSP added.

One of his companions, Raja Dubey alias Ravan, who was riding pillion, gave a slip to the police.

Both Verma and Dubey were wanted in the murder case of Banaras Hindu University (BHU) student Gaurav Singh.

Verma was admitted to a government hospital in Ramnagar, while sub-inspector Ishwar Dayal, who received bullet injuries in his hands, was admitted to BHU’s Trauma Centre, where his health condition was stated to be stable, the police said.

A hunt was on to nab Dubey, they added. PTI
