Murder in school: Teen seeks bail from sessions court

Vadodara: The 17-year-old boy, lodged in remand home for allegedly murdering his junior at Shri Bharti Vidyalaya at Wadi last year, has for the first time sought bail from sessions court under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act.

The teenager has filed for bail through his father on the grounds that being a juvenile, he should be given a chance for improvement and released on bail. Police submitted a strongly-worded affidavit opposing his application.

Police told the court in their reply that the boy was hot-headed and irreverent and may commit a heinous crime again. “Witnesses in this case are his friends from school and neighbourhood so if he is granted bail he may threaten them and hamper legal procedures,” the affidavit states.

“Based on his mental health test, it is evident that the boy is hot-headed and may hamper trial or could threaten others. Thus, we have requested the court to turn down his plea,” said district government pleader Anil Desai.

The court is likely to pronounce its order on Tuesday.

The boy had allegedly killed a class IX student Dev Tadvi on June 22 in the washroom as he wanted the school to shut down. He is facing trial for the murder.
