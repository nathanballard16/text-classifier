First India-bound flight passes through Pakistani airspace since conflict earlier this year

A flight from Abu Dhabi to New Delhi is the first to pass through Pakistan in the last three months, local media says. Entry points for flights on the Indian-Pakistani border had been closed following their conflict in February.
