Crisis is the result of an internalcrisis; it is the making of ambitious Congress minister DK Shivkumar and thehas nothing to do with it, according to BJP national general secretary P. "The crisis is a direct consequence of an arrangement where the bigger party with 80 MLAs- the Congress- is supporting a smaller party of 38 MLAs -- the Janata Dal(Secular) to lead the Government . It is ambition of DK (to become Chief Minister) that has led to clash within the Congress,” Rao told Mirror.The BJP leader was referring to the political crisis triggered in the state after Belgaum strongman and Gokak MLAwas dropped from the cabinet and his brother Satish was inducted last month at DK Shivkumar’s behest. Jarkiholi is reportedly close to former CM Siddaramaiah. A section of the Congress is apparently not keen on continuing playing second-fiddle to the JD-S after the party's win in three states in December.“The BJP has no role in the crisis. As of now all that we are doing is to hold on to our 104 MLAs. We had to do this when we heard Chief Minister Kumaraswamy say some four or five BJP MLAs are in touch with him. We had to protect our flock. Our MLAs will be in Haryana for another day or two more. We have just become wise, we do no want to lose them to poaching,” he said.Is the BJP talking to Ramesh Jarkiholi, has it been helping him in Mumbai? "Jarkiholi does not need our help, he’s quite capable of taking care of Congress-JD(S) MLAs backing him. As for talking to him, do you know, he has one more brother –Balachandra- who is a BJP MLA?” Rao told MirrorWhat does the withdrawal of support of two independent MLAs—H Nagesh and R Shankar— mean to the BJP? “As of now it means nothing to us. We are studying the situation. We will respond as the situation unfolds," said Rao.
