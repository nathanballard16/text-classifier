Post Ethiopia crash, Jet, SpiceJet to be asked for details on plane model

New Delhi: The Directorate General of Civil Aviation, India’s aviation watchdog is expected to examine concerns about the use of Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft after the Ethiopian Airlines crash on Sunday. DGCA is likely to speak both Boeing and airlines like Jet Airways and SpiceJet.

A Boeing 737 MAX plane operated Ethiopian Airlines crashed soon after take-off from Addis Ababa around 8:30 am on Sunday morning, killing all 157 on board.

However, the cause of the crash is still not clear.

China's aviation authorities have grounded their Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets after the crash.

Jet Airways and SpiceJet are the two Indian carriers that operate the Boeing 737 MAX 8 aircraft.

The 737 MAX 8 is a new model from the US aircraft manufacturer's best-selling 737, which has been operating since 1967.

Boeing has been criticised for not informing airlines in detail about how to override problematic software on the flight control system of the 737 Max aircraft.

The new software is part of an automatic system designed to ensure that the aircraft does not stall; in other words, lose it ability to remain flying.

Boeing was quoted by reports as saying that the 737 MAX 8 was "as safe as any airplane that has ever flown the skies."
