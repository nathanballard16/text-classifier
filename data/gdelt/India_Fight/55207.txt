Telangana encounter deaths: SC orders judicial inquiry under former SC judge VS Sirpurkar

3-member SC panel to probe in Hyderabad encounter

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Thursday appointed a three-member inquiry commission headed by former SC judge V S Sirpurkar to conduct probe into alleged encounter killings of the four men accused in the gang-rape and murder of a veterinarian in Telangana.The four men, accused in the rape and murder of the woman veterinarian, were killed in an alleged exchange of fire with police on December 6.Other two members of the inquiry commission are former Bombay HC judge Rekha Baldota and former CBI director D R Karthikeyan.The SC has asked the commission to complete probe within six months and file a report before the court.The apex court also stayed all proceedings initiated by Telangana HC and NHRC into Hyderabad encounter killing and directed that no other courts should entertain any plea pertaining to the case.The apex court bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was hearing two public interest litigations seeking an independent probe into the deaths last week.The Telangana government justified the encounter, saying the accused snatched two firearms and shot at a police party."We are of the considered view that there should be impartial inquiry into the encounter deaths of the four people accused in the gangrape and murder of a veterinarian in Telangana," the bench, also comprising Justices S A Nazeer and Sanjiv Khanna, said.There are "aspects of your (Telangana) version which needed an inquiry", it observed.The four men were arrested on November 29 on charges of kidnapping the woman and killing her after sexually assaulting her.They were gunned down by police on December 6 morning at Chattanpalli when they were taken to the scene of crime near the culvert, under which the charred remains of the 25-year-old veterinarian were found on November 28, to recover her phone, wrist-watch and others pertaining to the case.The Cyberabad police had said its personnel resorted to "retaliatory" firing after two of the accused opened fire at police after snatching their weapons besides attacking the latter with stones and sticks, resulting in injuries to two policemen.(With inputs from agencies)
