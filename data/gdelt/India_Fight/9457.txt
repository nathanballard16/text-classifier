Whitetopping

By SameenResidents move against white topping work; write to MLA for ‘holistic plan’On Saturday, the residents of Indiranagar shot off an open letter to, about the problems they face due to the allegedly unnecessary white topping on, 100 Feet Road and 80 Feet Road in Indiranagar.Swarna Venkataraman, a member of I Change Indiranagar (ICI) says, “Instead of this shortsighted planning, we want a holistic plan in place.” The letter addressed numerous issues that the people of Indiranagar have with the hurried Phase II of white topping procedure proposed for the area. Since the utilities run underneath the asphalt road, pipelines need to be relocated to the side of the roads. Pedestrian mobility is a problem in the area, thanks to congestion and lack of footpaths.The current roads are pretty narrow and if white topping is to be done, there needs to be a proper traffic diversion plan. The work should be done with precision and efficiency so that it lasts for years to come. And lastly, basement parking is part of the project and there are many establishments which have violated theregulations for basement parking. If these issues are not addressed beforehand, instead of being a solution, white topping will create another nuisance for traffic and pedestrians in the area.”As per news reports, BBMP began floating tenders for Phase-II of converting roads into concrete stretches in December 2018 for eight packages, which include 41 roads of 63.24 km length. This was done even before Phase-I of the plan had seen fruition.Reacting to this, a BBMP official said thatwas taken up to give longetivity of roads. The officials will soon meet residents to take their concerns into account.
