Imran Khan Warns Against Breaching LoC

SRINAGAR: Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned his citizens against breaching the Line of Control (LoC). His warming came as some protesters are panning crossing over the LoC.

Pakistani newspaper Dawn quoted Khan telling the people in PaK who wanted to cross the LoC will “play into the hands of the Indian narrative” on Kashmir. Khan had earlier told a public meeting in Muzaffarabad not to cross the border.

International media did report a few thousand people actually moving towards the Chakothi – on the other side of Uri on Jhelum Valley Road, on the call by JKLF.

American news agency AP quoted Arshad Naqvi, a police officer, saying that “no one would be allowed to get to the Line of Control due to security concerns”.

An American broadcasting agency said the marchers, mostly youngsters, spent a night at Garhi Dupatta and were moving towards the LoC.

In Delhi, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said Khan’s comments do not behove the post he holds. “I think he is not unaware of how international relations are conducted,” Kumar said. “On that basis, he gives such statements. He had given an open call for Jihad against India. This is not a normal behavior.”

Voice of America reported that the local police have placed roadblocks just a few kilometers from the LoC, to prevent the rally from reaching the de facto border.

The attempt to cross the LoC is not a first one. Earlier, JKLF in 1992 made first attempt in which 12 of them were killed in clashes with police.
