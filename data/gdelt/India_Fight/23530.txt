Masood Azhar’s designation as global terrorist is not a very big win – Here’s why Asaduddin Owaisi thinks so

Hyderabad: A day after the United Nations Security Council listed Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist, president of All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday refused to call it a big success. Notably, China had been blocking the UN from doing so for around 10 years.

“What compromises did you make with China? In 2008, Hafiz Saeed (Lashkar-e-Toiba chief) was blacklisted, but has that stopped him from conducting public meetings? Did his party not contest elections?”

“Indeed, he (Azhar) has been blacklisted. But if you are claiming that it is a big victory, then it is not,” said Owaisi.

The UNSC's 1267 Sanctions Committee's decision came around two-and-a-half months after the JeM carried out a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district in which 40 Central Reserve Police Force personnel were killed.

In a briefing held earlier today, the Ministry of External Affairs said that the attack in Pulwama played a role in the designation of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN.

When asked if India offered something to China for the purpose of Azhar's listing, Ministry of External Affairs spokesperon Raveesh Kumar asserted that India does not negotiate on national security-related matters.

"Our objective was to ensure the designation of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist," he said.
