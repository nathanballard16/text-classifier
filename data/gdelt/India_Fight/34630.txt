Moments after Pakistan lifted ban on its airspace imposed in the aftermath of Balakot airstrike on February 26, India has also lifted the ban on Pakistani airlines using India airspace. With the two orders, normal air traffic has been resumed over South Asia.

"Consequent to Pakistan issuing Notam [A notice to airmen] to lift airspace restrictions, relevant authorities have informed that India has also issued revised Notam immediately thereafter," news agency ANI said quoting government sources.

Pakistan lifted the ban on its airspace 140 days after Indian Air Force jets struck terror camps in Pakistan's Balakot region. The attack was carried out a fortnite after the deadly Pulwama terror attack, which claimed the lives of more than 40 CRPF jawans in Srinagar-Jammu highway in Kashmir.

The move is expected to give a major relief to Air India, which suffered a huge financial loss of around Rs 491 crore as it had to re-route its various international flights due to the closure of the Pakistan airspace.
