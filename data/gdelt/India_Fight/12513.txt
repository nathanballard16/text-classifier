Jammu and Kashmir: Two Hizbul militants killed in Tral encounter

In the ensuing encounter, two militants were killed and their bodies were recovered from the site on Tuesday.

TWO HIZBUL Mujahideen militants were killed in an overnight gunbattle between militants and security forces at Tral in South Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Tuesday. Both militants were locals, said police.

A police spokesperson said in a statement that based on an input about presence of militants in Reshipora area of Tral, a cordon-and-search operation was launched Monday evening. “As the searches were going on, the search party was fired upon by the terrorists. The fire was retaliated leading to a gunfight,” the police said.

In the ensuing encounter, two militants were killed and their bodies were recovered from the site on Tuesday.

The police said that a civilian, identified as Farooq Ahmad Malik, a resident of Tral, was injured in the operation. “He was shifted to hospital for medical treatment and stated to be stable,” the police said.

The police spokesperson said the two slain militants were identified as Adfar Fayaz Parray and Irfan Ahmad Rather, both residents of Tral. “They were involved in conspiring and executing several terrorist attacks and were wanted by the law for their complicity in a series of terror crimes…,” the police said.

Police sources said while Rather joined militant ranks in 2017, Adfar became a militant last year. During the gunfight, one residential house was completely damaged.

Meanwhile, a complete shutdown was observed in the valley on Tuesday following a call by trade bodies against the ban on Jamaat-e-Islami and attempts to “tinker” with Article 35A.
