Salman Khan reveals what made him do Bharat

While Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif’s much-hyped Bharat is on the verge of release, its trailer and songs are already a huge hit with the audiences. Through the years, as we know, Salman has grown selective about the films he signs. Bharat, as we know, entailed a long gruelling schedule and shooting on several locations like Abu Dhabi, Spain, Malta, Punjab, and Delhi.





What was it about the film that excited the superstar? Apart from the huge canvas and the regular dash of thrills, comedy, and romance, there was something else that got Bhai hooked to the idea. “It’s the plot of the film,” informs Salman adding, “A nine-year-old boy is assigned the responsibility of looking after his mother and three siblings. His father assures that he will return someday. From the age of 9 to 72, the boy does everything to keep the family together. They nag him to settle down…The film is about the protagonist honouring his promise to his father despite all odds,” shares Salman, for whom family comes first too.

Based on the 2014 South Korean melodrama Ode To My Father, Bharat traces India’s post-independence history from the perspective of a common man.





It’s written and directed by Ali Abbas Zafar and jointly produced by Salman Khan, Atul Agnihotri, Alvira Khan Agnihotri, and Bhushan Kumar among others. Bharat is set for an Eid release on June 5.
