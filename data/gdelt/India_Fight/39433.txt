It has been a good month for Gujarat as far as rain is concerned. Short spells of weather activity have been happening in the state since the start of August. And this is exactly the state of the weather in Gujarat at the moment.

Light rain is being observed in some parts of Gujarat for the last 24 to 48 hours particularly in the northern and the central parts of the state. For instance, Ahmedabad and Deesa in a span of 24 hours from 8.30 am on Wednesday have recorded 5.6 mm and 2.7 mm of rain, respectively.

However, in the next 24 hours, the intensity and spread of rain will increase. Moderate intensity rain may be observed in Gandhinagar, Baroda, Patan, Banaskantha along with Ahmedabad and Deesa.

These rains will be an outcome of the Low-Pressure Area in West Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan extending upto Gujarat. In the next 24 hours, this system will move deeper into Gujarat giving moderate rains in north and central parts of the state. Thereafter, the activity will become feeble though light rain will continue to be observed for the next couple of days.

On the other hand, the weather in Saurashtra and Kutch will be almost dry. Not much is expected in the region during this period. However, very light rain can be witnessed in some places.

Monsoon rains have overall performed very well for Gujarat so far. If we look at the rainfall data available with Skymet, the state is in excess of 22%.
