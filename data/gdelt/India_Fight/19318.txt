'No one knows who's in his family': Sharad Pawar hits back at PM Modi's 'family feud' remark

Addressing party workers in Pune, Sharad Pawar said, "Don't make personal comments at all. When the PM himself has taken the responsibility to make personal comments, why do you need to do it?"

Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar launched a scathing attack at Prime Minister Narendra Modi for making personal comments on his family. Mentioning that PM gets 'hysterical' when elections are around the corner, Sharad Pawar reverted back to PM saying no one knows who is in his family.

Addressing party workers in Pune, Sharad Pawar said, "Don't make personal comments at all. When the PM himself has taken the responsibility to make personal comments, why do you need to do it? He's coming to Baramati on 10th, you can watch on TV what he says."

"He had passed a remark in Wardha recently, that there's dispute in my (Pawar's) family. Where's the dispute? We work in different areas but live together amicably. While my house is full, no one knows who's in his family. He shouldn't talk about other's houses."
