Janhvi Kapoor is among the most popular young stars to hit the silver screen in 2018. Her mischievous and endearing persona in Dhadak ensured that the nation gave her a thumbs up. Thanks to her appealing ways, Janhvi has two major films in her kitty — Takht and an unnamed film where she plays an IAF pilot (both with Karan Johar).

Not just films, she has also been signed on for advertisements. Janhvi is currently in Barcelona to shoot an advertisement. She shared a number of pictures of herself and her sister Khushi from the Spanish city.
