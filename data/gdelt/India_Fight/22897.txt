Violence mars Phase-4 polls in West Bengal, 1 killed in Odisha

The intensity of violent clashes kept pace with the increasing heatwave conditions in the fourth phase of the Lok Sabha elections, especially in West Bengal on Monday. Uttar Pradesh also witnessed incidents of clashes and complaints against EVM malfunctioning in several pockets.



A BJP delegation met the Election Commission with the demand to augment central police presence in several polling booths in West Bengal alleging that Trinamool goons were playing mischief by preventing voting. However, Trinamool chief Mamata Banerjee countered it accusing the BJP of misusing central forces for its gains. She also said they fired "inside" a polling booth in Birbhum district.



The Election Commission registered an FIR against Union minister Babul Supriyo for barging inside a polling booth while his vehicle came under attack along with a reporter.



Opposition parties and individuals complained of proxy voting and missing names in the voter list at several places in Maharashtra including Nashik and Mumbai.



In Uttar Pradesh, the Samajwadi Party complained to polls observers that state officials forcibly prevented their party leaders and workers to come out of their homes. It also alleged heavy deployment of security personnel outside the houses of SP leaders before the start of polling and EVM malfunctioning in their strongholds.



Madhya Pradesh also reported glitches in EVMs during the mock poll just before the voting, leading to replacement of machines in 207 booths and again in 106 booths after the voting began.
