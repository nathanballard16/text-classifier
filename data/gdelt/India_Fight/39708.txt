10 patients complain of blurred vision after cataract surgery

Ten persons complained of blurred vision following a cataract surgery conducted on them at a private hospital here last week, prompting the government to order a probe into it.

The operation theatre of the Indore Eye Hospital, where the surgery was conducted on August 8, has been sealed following the complaints, officials said on Saturday.

They said the patients suffered from blurred vision possibly a result of some infection after the surgery.

"Total 13 patients underwent cataract surgery on August 8 under the National Programme for Control of Blindness at Indore Eye Hospital. Of them, 10 people complained of blurred vision, while three others were discharged," Chief Medical and Health Officer Praveen Jadiya told PTI.

"It appears that an infection has harmed the eyesight of these 10 people. The reason behind this infection is being probed and we are mulling to revoke the licence of the hospital," Jadiya said.

The victims are in the age group of 45 and 85, the officer said.

Rami Bai (50), one of the patients who suffered blurred vision, said in a choked voice, "I can't see anything."



District Collector Lokesh Kumar Jatav said the operation theatre of the private hospital has been sealed following the complaints.

He said the victims have been sent to another private hospital for further treatment and the Red Cross Society was helping them.

Calling the incident as "unfortunate", Health Minister Tulsiram Silawat said a seven-member committee headed by Indore Divisional Commissioner will probe it.

Those found guilty will be punished as per the law, he added.
