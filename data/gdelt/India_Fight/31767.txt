UP Police Set Priorities For Investigation: Cow Carcass First, Cop's Lynching Later

Days after the violence in Bulandshahr over alleged cow slaughter, which resulted in the alleged murder of two people including SHO Subodh Kumar Singh, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath had made it clear that he wanted the cow killers to be arrested and was reportedly silent on the murder of the police officer, the cops to have set their priorities.

The Bulandshahr Police has reportedly decided to probe the case of alleged cow slaughter first and not the killing of one of their own. According to Additional Superintendent of Police (Bulandshahr) Rayees Akhtar the cops are currently working on to find out who killed those cows.

Speaking to Indian Express, Akhtar said that it was the killing of the cows that led to the protest, which resulted in Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh’s murder. So solving it will throw light on how the murder occurred.

Right from the beginning, CM Yogi and top cops including director general of police, OP Singh and Meerut inspector general (IG) of police Ram Singh had hinted that there was a“larger conspiracy” behind Monday’s violence in Bulandshahr and their priority was to find the people behind.

So far, four people – identified as Chaman, Devendra, Ashish Chauhan and Satish have been arrested by the police. However, the main accused, Bajrang Dal leader Yogesh Raj, who also made the cow slaughter complaint is yet to be arrested.

Based on Yogesh's complaint, police had booked seven Muslims, including two children for cow slaughter.

According to the statement Yogesh gave to the police, he saw seven Muslims slaughtering cows while he was out for a walk.

Yogesh, who has gone underground since the violence broke out, in a later video contradicted his own claim and said that he went to the spot only after receiving information about cow slaughter.
