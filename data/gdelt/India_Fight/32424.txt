Sharpshooter wanted in over a dozen criminal cases nabbed by Noida police

The Noida police on Thursday arrested 27-year-old Maya Tyagi known as the "best sharpshooter", of the dreaded Randip Bhati-Amit Kasana gang during a gunfight in the Phase II area.

The police recovered a national emblem-embossed revolver from him and suspect it to be government property.

Maya Tyagi has over 14 criminal cases against him, including murder loot, extortion and dacoity. He is known for his filmy style in executing crimes and has been arrested twice before in the past two years, by the Greater Noida and Ghaziabad police. However, Maya Tyagi managed to get out on bail.

Both Maya Tyagi and Randeep Bhati uploaded several videos on YouTube, flaunting their acts and glorifying it.

However on Thursday, acting on a tip-off, police formed four teams and intercepted their bike around 9:10 pm near Advant building. On seeing the police, the duo opened fire.

The police team also retaliated. "Maya sustained two bullet injuries on his legs in the gunfight and was arrested. However, he was accompanied by another sharpshooter who managed to flee the spot. Maya has been admitted to the district hospital," Dinesh Yadav, inspector of Star 2 team, told the Times of India.

Apart from the revolver, police also recovered a Yamaha FZ bike and four live cartridges.
