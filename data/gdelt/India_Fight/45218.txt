Shahid Kapoor’s wife Mira Rajput raises powerful question after fans troll her for wearing mini skirt

Mumbai: Shahid Kapoor’s wife, Mira Rajput was recently trolled for sporting a mini skirt. The star-wife was spotted rocking a cute printed skirt which did not go well with many netizens.

Many trolled her mercilessly for wearing excess short skirts. Twitteratis felt the skirt was ‘to short’ and trolled her saying she ‘stole her daughter Misha’s skirt.’

Taking the criticism seriously, the beauty showed remarkable grace while shutting down trolls. The beauty took to her Instagram handle and posted an important question.

Her post showed how society passes judgements against a woman based on the length of their skirt. She raised a powerful question that read, “If women judge other women by the length of their skirt, does it justify the empowerment we’re seeking?”

Mira is no stranger to social media trolls and has often found herself battling people passing lewd comments ranging from her fashion choices to her decision of being a homemaker apart from other aspects.
