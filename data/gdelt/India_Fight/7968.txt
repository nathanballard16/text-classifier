Pakistani prisoner murdered inside Indian jail

A Pakistani man being held at India’s Jaipur Central Jail in Rajasthan was killed by three fellow inmates, the police said on Wednesday.

The deceased has been identified as Shakirullah Ilyas. He is believed to be arrested on charges of espionage, reported India Today.

The police said that Ilyas was beaten to death.

He belonged to Sialkot’s Jaiserwala. Arif Ilyas, his uncle, told SAMAA TV that he suffered from mental disabilities. He crossed the border by mistake in 2003 and was wrongfully detained by the Indian authorities, the uncle said.

Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi has raised the issue with the Indian authorities, according to the foreign office.

“Pakistan is gravely concerned at media reports regarding the brutal killing of a Pakistani Prisoner, Mr Shakir Ullah, imprisoned in Jaipur Central Jail. He was beaten to death by a group of Indian inmates in retaliation of the Pulwama incident,” the foreign office said in a statement.

Pakistan has called upon the Indian government to fulfill its obligations and ensure the provision of foolproof security to all Pakistani prisoners in Indian jails, as well as Pakistani visitors.

The tensions between India and Pakistan have aggravated after 40 Indian soldiers were killed in an attack in Indian-Administered Kashmir on February 14. The Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility.

Indian media and government officials were quick to assign blame to Pakistan for what they said was supporting the Maulana Masood Azhar-led group, the JeM.

Pakistan refuted allegations that its government was linked to the Pulwama attack.
