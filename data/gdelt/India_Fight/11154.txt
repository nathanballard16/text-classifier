Dalit groom visits Ram temple under police protection in M.P.

Upper caste ‘ban’ on their entry; no untoward incident

A Dalit bridegroom visited a Ram temple at a village in Indore district of Madhya Pradesh under police protection on Thursday in the face of an unwritten ‘ban’.

Members of upper castes allegedly do not allow the Balais, a Dalit community, to enter the Ram temple at Aurangpura village.

The marriage procession of Ajay Malviya (22) was taken out under police protection on Thursday, and security was also provided when he visited the temple, a police officer said.

Sub-Divisional Officer of Police Ram Kumar Rai said, “We had made adequate security arrangements for the marriage procession and his temple visit.”

There was no untoward incident, he said.

Plea to police

The Akhil Bhartiya Balai Mahasabha had submitted an application to the Betma police station on Wednesday, alleging that Dalits were not allowed to enter the Ram temple at Aurangpura. It also alleged that caste-based discrimination was prevalent in the village.

Alleging that there had been trouble during the marriage procession of another Dalit man in the past, the organisation demanded security for Mr. Malviya’s wedding procession.

Dharmendra Malviya (32), the groom’s elder brother, said, “I have not seen in my entire life any person belonging to my community entering the Ram temple. So this time we decided that my younger brother must visit the temple.”

He also said that when he rode a horse during his marriage procession in 2009, stones were pelted at them.
