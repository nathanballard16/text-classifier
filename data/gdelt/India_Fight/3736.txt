FIR against BJP Leader Giriraj Singh, Opposition Demands Resignation

Patna: Firebrand Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Union Minister Giriraj Singh is in hot water after police in Bihar lodged a case against him and 32 others in a case involving illegal capture of 2.56-acre of land owned by a man in Danapur.

The FIR, lodged with the Danapur police station back in September last year, alleges that Singh, the Union Minister for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises, along with 32 other men, had illegally captured land of one Ram Narayan Prasad, age 68, in Asopur village near Danapur.

However, after failing to get any response from the police, Prasad knocked the door of the Special Scheduled Caste/Scheduled Tribe court in Patna last week that directed the Danapur police to re-open the case.

As expected, Singh, an MP from Nawada, denied allegations saying he found out about the FIR through a tweet by Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) de facto President Tejaswi Yadav.

"I know Tejaswi Yadav is behind this smear campaign against me but I have nothing to hide and I will cooperate with the investigation to prove my innocence.

Seizing the moment, Yadav, who faces a host of corruption charges himself involving illegal acquisition of properties to the tune of several crore rupees, demanded Singh's resignation saying the BJP minister should be sacked and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who walked out of the Grand Alliance to show his moral high ground on corruption issues, should also resign from his post on the same moral high ground.

"Giriraj Singh is the same man who was caught with several crore rupees in unaccounted money a few years ago. If Nitish Kumar can break alliance with the RJD and Congress following charges of corruption against some members of the coalition then he should also resign from the NDA government after the revelation of case against the BJP minister," the former Deputy Chief Minister said adding Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi, who has a history of holding press conferences to accuse others of corruption, was yet to make any comment on charges against the Nawada MP.
