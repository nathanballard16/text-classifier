Srinagar: The Jammu and Kashmir government will lift the remaining restrictions on civilian traffic between Srinagar and Baramulla on the National Highway (NH-44) connecting Jammu from May 27 in the wake of Amarnath Yatra, Governor Satyapal Malik said on Tuesday.

"After a detailed review today with all security agencies, civil and police administration in connection with the preparations for the Shri Amarnathji Yatra, the Governor directed that there should be no restriction on civilian movement on NH 44 from Monday, May 27," the release said.

The state administration had earlier imposed a ban on highway travel by civilians on every Sunday and Wednesday from 4 am to 5 pm to ensure the smooth and safe passage of convoys of the security forces. The decision was also taken to ward off any similar attacks like Pulwama suicide bombing on Jammu-Srinagar highway in February that killed 40 CRPF personnel.

However, after facing huge backlash, the state administration restricted the civilian movement on the Jammu-Srinagar highway only on Sundays.

The decision to ban the civilian traffic on the highway invited a huge criticism of the Opposition leaders, with many of them dubbing the move a “Tughlaqi Farmaan' or dictatorial order.

Several leaders including PDP chief Mehbooba Mufti, National Conference (NC) Farooq Abdullah, former chief minister Omar Abdullah slammed the government for the closing of the 300-kilometres long highway which connects the Kashmir valley with the rest of India.

“This is wrong. We would like to tell the government that you can't suppress Kashmiris like this. This is our state, these are our roads, we have the right to use them whenever we want,” Mufti had said.
