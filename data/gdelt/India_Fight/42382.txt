Green Way Forward: 92-Acre Land Along Yamuna Expressway To Be Made Into A Forest Area

Uttar Pradesh government is talking some concrete measures towards afforestation and increasing the green cover in urban and semi-urban areas.

In its latest move, a 92-acre land along the Yamuna Expressway adjoining Delhi is set to be turned into a forest area with the Gautam Buddh Nagar administration roping in private partners for a massive afforestation programme.

A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the administration, Haldiram Education Society (HES) and Jaypee Infratech Limited (JIL), reported the PTI.

HES has collaborated with JES for mass afforestation and rainwater harvesting activities in the 92 acre-area in Jewar.

The MoU states that the local administration will look after all the quick clearances and necessary permission. Private parties have chipped in for the effort as part of their corporate social responsibility (CSR) plans.

The organisations involved will look into the kind of plants and trees to be planted.

HES, according to the pact, will plant and maintain native species of trees suitable to the soil and environmental conditions on the provided land.

"It will also document the overall change to the best possible extent through quantitative and qualitative data and report it to district administration in a periodic manner," it stated.

The UP government has also decided to give “heritage” status to trees that are over 100 years old.

Recently, the Gautam Buddh Nagar administration transferred another tranche of 34 hectares of land to the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEDIA) for the proposed Jewar airport.

The Jewar airport is expected to be ready by 2024.
