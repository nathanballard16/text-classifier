Current govt believes that one idea should be imposed on country: Rahul Gandhi

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday stressed that “There is currently an ideological battle going in India.”

“There is currently an ideological battle going in India. It's sharply divided between two ideologies. One ideology is a unifying ideology which says that all people of the country should live together and shouldn't be dominated by one idea. The other ideology represented by the current govt and PM where they believe that one idea should be imposed on our country,” ANI quoted Rahul Gandhi at Stella Maris College, Chennai, as saying.

“They have a particular view about role of women in our society, different languages and cultures are inferior to one centralising culture and idea,” he added.

Further pointing his guns at PM, Gandhi said, “How many of you have had the opportunity to ask him 'Mr Prime Minister what do you think about education? What do you think about this? What do you think about that?' Why doesn't Prime Minister have the guts to stand in front of 3000 women & be questioned by them?”

Congress president’s recent attack on the government has come with a few days of the announcement of the Lok Sabha elections 2019 dates by the Election Commission of India.
