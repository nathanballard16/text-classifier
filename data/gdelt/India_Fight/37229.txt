AGENCIES /LUCKNOW

Hours after the Supreme Court’s direction, the Uttar Pradesh government gave 25 lakh rupees as compensation to the Unnao rape survivor last night.

Lucknow District Magistrate (DM) Kaushal Raj Sharma handed over a cheque of 25 lakh rupees to the mother of the rape survivor. The cheque was sent by Unnao DM Devendra Pandey to the DM of Lucknow.

The rape survivor is being treated at King George Medical College in Lucknow. After meeting the victim family, Mr Sharma said, there is an improvement in the health condition of the survivor and her lawyer. He said the family is satisfied with the treatment being provided to them.

A car in which the rape victim, her advocate and relatives were travelling was hit by a truck in Rae Bareli, killing the victim’s two aunts and critically injuring her and the lawyer.

Earlier on Thursday, the Supreme Court also directed the transfer of all five cases registered in connection with the Unnao rape incident from a court in Uttar Pradesh to a competent court in the national capital.

The bench directed that the trial in the main case relating to the rape of the survivor will have to be completed within 45 days from its commencement.

The hearing of the case will continue today during which the Apex Court will also hear a plea moved on behalf of the survivor’s uncle who has been lodged in a jail in Rae Bareilly, to be shifted to a jail in the capital. His wife had died in the Sunday accident.

CBI, which has taken over the investigation into Sunday’s road accident, booked 10 people for murder, including expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar.
