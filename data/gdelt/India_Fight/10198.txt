Balakot Fallout: After Snapping Tea and Tomato Ties, Paan Traders Say No More Supply To Pakistan

Since the ghastly attack on Pulwama took place on February 14, killing over 40 CRPF personnel, the nation has united in solidarity. Even farmers whose livelihood depends on their produce are willing to give up their profits and bear losses by snapping their trade ties with Pakistan. India gave a befitting reply after launching pre-emptive air strikes across the border in Balakot by the Indian Air Force on Tuesday.

A day after the air attack, paan (betel leaf) farmers in Madhya Pradesh have decided to cut trade ties for the time being with Pakistan, News18 reported. This development comes days after tea exporters and tomato farmers in Madhya Pradesh also took a similar decision.

Maharajpur, Garhimalahra, Pipat and Panagar in MP's Chhatarpur district are famous for its variety of paan. The Mahoba paan is quite popular in Pakistan and it reaches the country through Meerut and Saharanpur. The growers have now decided to not send it to these two Indian cities so that it doesn't reach Pakistan.

The farmers could lose around Rs 13-15 lakh but they are not worried about the impending losses. "If the central government could decide to disrupt supplies of water to Pakistan, why can’t we cease supplies of our crop?" a farmer from Chhatarpur said.
