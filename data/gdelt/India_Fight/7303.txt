Pulwama attack: PM Modi hints at strong action against Pakistan, says ‘time for talks is now over’

In his comments, Macri also called for united action to deal with terrorism.

NEW DELHI: In a stern warning to Pakistan over the Pulwama attack which claimed lives of 40 CRPF jawans, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday said the time for dialogue with the neighbouring country is over and strong actions are required to fight the menace of terrorism and its supporters. After talks with Argentine President Mauricio Macri at Hyderabad House here, Modi said dithering to take action against terrorists and their supporters will be like encouraging terrorism. "I and President Macri agree with the view that terrorism is a serious danger to world's peace and stability. The cruel attack in Pulwama shows that the time for talks has passed. Now, it is required that the world unites against terrorism and those who support it,"Modi said during a joint press conference with Macri. "Hesitation to take action against terrorism and those who support it is akin to encouraging terrorism. Being part of G20 countries, it is also important that we implement the 11-point agenda of Hamburg Leaders Statement," he said adding that India and Argentina will issue a special declaration on terrorism on Monday.
