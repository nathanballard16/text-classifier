Docs express solidarity with Kolkata fraternity

Coimbatore: The members of Indian Medical Association took out a dharna and a black badge protest in front of Coimbatore Medical College Hospital as part of IMA’s nationwide protest against the assault on doctors in Bengal.

The doctors were protesting the brutal attack on a Kolkata-based doctor by a mob at NRS Medical College, after the death of a patient. The association said they had been demanding a national law against hospital violence for several years now.

Close to 100 doctors including house surgeons and post graduate doctors assembled in front of CMCH and said it was part of the IMA’s national dharna. Earlier senior IMA members also submitted a petition regarding the same at the collector’s camp office on Race Course. The petition said that the national law against violence on hospitals has to be brought in urgently.
