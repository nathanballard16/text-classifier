CBFC orders 3 cuts in Ajay Devgn’s De De Pyaar De

With just a day to the release of the film, the Ajay Devgn, Tabu, Rakul Preet Singh-starrer De De Pyaar De, the film finally got a U/A certificate as well. While this is definitely good news, we would like to inform you that the filmmakers had to make minor changes in the screenplay. The CBFC (Central Board of Film Certification) asked for three visual cuts in the film. Of the three cuts, this one very big change was made in the film.

According to the CBFC board, the first cut comes at just 10 minutes into the film. The visual of the heroine holding an alcohol bottle has been substituted with those of her holding a flower bouquet. Similar visuals in the song Vaddi Sharaban that comes around three minutes later, have also been altered.

Apart from that, the dialogue ‘performance better hoti hai’ has been deleted and the third change is the visuals and dialogue “Manju ji ke aalu O ho ho …wahi achche hain..” , “ki yeh sab jhoot hain,” have been removed.

Directed by debutant Akiv Ali, the film is to hit the theatres today (May 16). Stay tuned to CineBlitz for more such updates and news.
