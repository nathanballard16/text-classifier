IndiGo Passenger Taken Off Flight For Creating Bomb Scare In The Aircraft

At a time when tensions between India and its neighbour are rife following the Pulwama terror attack, airports and metro security staff are vigilant than ever before. After the air strike conducted by Pakistan, a red alert was also sounded at all Delhi and Mumbai airports.

A Pakistan military drone was also shot down on Monday by a Sukhoi-30 fighter jet of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Amid all of this, a passenger aboard an IndiGo flight was offloaded after he protested against the tightened security system.

ANI reported that the passenger was deboarded following the word ‘bomb’ to the airline staff. The flyer was identified as Alex Mathew from Pathanamthitta, Kerala who said, “Am I carrying a bomb in my bag?”

The incident took place at Chennai airport on Tuesday at around 7:30 pm during ‘Second Ladder Point Security’ (SLPC) of the IndiGo flight 6E-582 from Cochin to Bhubaneswar.

Once the mandatory checks by the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) are completed, the passengers are required to go through SLPC as well. This is security check conducted by the airlines just when the passengers are about to board the aircraft.

A quick response team, a dog squad, bomb detection team as well as the disposal squad were rushed to the spot to carry out an inspection of the passenger. Nothing suspicious was founded and as per security protocol the passenger was offloaded and handed over to the local police for further action.

IndiGo has often been in headlines either for its technical glitches or passenger misbehaviour. In January this year, IndiGo flight between Delhi-Ahmedabad had to make a priority landing on Tuesday Ahmedabad after the crew noticed ‘unusual smell’.

In December last year, the parliamentary panel on civil aviation chairman Derek O’Brien said that IndiGo airlines has been voted as “worst performing” carrier for consumers.
