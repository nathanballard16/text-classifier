Santhosh Sivan’s song update goes viral

Santhosh Sivan’s tweet giving out the details of a dance sequence featuring Nayan in Rajinikanth’s Darbar, taking place in Jaipur, is going viral.

After completing a major chunk of Darbar in Mumbai, the team, including Superstar Rajini, Nayanthara and director AR Murugadoss, recently flew to Jaipur, Rajasthan for a song shoot. Fans who are excited to see Thalaivar in khaki shared the locale pictures ever since the shoot started.

Now a picture of Rajinikanth posing along with one of the background dancers on locale is going viral. This was shared on the fan page of Superstar with a caption, “Here is the latest photo of Superstar #Rajinikanth with @ArulChristiano who is one of the background dancers.. The next viral hit song is on the way!.”

Commenting on his fan page somewhat surprisingly, ace cinematographer Santhosh Sivan, teaming up with Rajini after a long gap, accidentally revealed about a single shot dance choreography done by Brindha master. He said, ‘The single long take with Nayan and Rajini Sir is a highlight. End of song. Superb choreography by Brinda.”
