Bihar floods: Situation to remain grim for another week as more rains to lash Patna and Gaya

Weather News and Analysis

As predicted by Skymet Weather, after a short breather, light to moderate rains have returned to the state of Bihar. And the reason can be attributed to Cyclonic Circulation over Jharkhand and adjoining Bihar along with a Trough extending from East Uttar Pradesh to Northeast India across Bihar. Both these systems are likely to stay for another two to three days, thus bringing in more on and off rains for the state.

These showers would mostly be scattered and light to moderate in intensity and continue for the next three to four days. As of now, heavy to very heavy spells are ruled out.

The floodwaters due to recent heavy rains have not receded yet and the upcoming showers may worsen this situation, thus posing a great threat to already waterlogged areas. And we expect the situation to remain grim in the state for another week or so.

The capital city of Patna along with many others might have to battle moderate spells of rain yet again. All these weather activities would be coupled with cloudy to partly cloudy sky conditions.

‘The river Ganga had already breached its banks and the water level is expected to rise further, considering chances of more rains’, predict our meteorologists.
