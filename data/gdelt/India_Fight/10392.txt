SPOTTED: Kareena Kapoor Khan with a baby bump on the sets of 'Good News'

Kareena Kapoor Khan is currently busy with the shoot of her upcoming film, Good News. The movie is based on the subject of surrogacy and it stars Akshay Kumar as the male lead. Along with these two stars, Good News also has Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani in pivotal roles. These actors are extensively shooting for the film at a popular studio in Mumbai. Several times, Bebo is clicked by the paparazzi while making her way towards the sets.

On Wednesday morning, the paparazzi got a huge surprise as Kareena was seen sporting a heavy baby bump while heading for the shoot of Good News. As the film is based on surrogacy, looks like, Kareena is shooting for an important sequence wherein she is shown pregnant. An interesting fact is that, after almost three years, we are seeing the talented actor flaunting her baby bump (though it's fake).
