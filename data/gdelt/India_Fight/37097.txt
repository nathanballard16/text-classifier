Stringent action to ensure elderly couples safety Mamata

Kolkata: In the wake of twin murders of old couples in the city, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday promised a thorough investigation in both cases and stringent action to ensure the safety of the elderly. "Thorough investigation will be done of both the murders in Netajinagar and Narendrapur. I think that it is everyone's responsibility to see that no one is able to touch elderly couples' property," Banerjee told reporters. "Only if we take some stringent action, these people will learn some lesson. Also, police will see who all are behind the murder of the caretakers in Kheyada (Narendrapur)," she said.
