India Hunts for Night Sights for Detecting Enemy Tanks 1000m Away in the Dark

The Carl Gustaf rocket launcher has been a crucial part of the Indian Army's inventory since 1974 and it has been used to destroy enemy posts along the western border. The launcher was also used by India's special forces during the much-touted surgical strike on terrorist camps inside Pakistan in 2016. India's Ordnance Factories are currently producing the latest version of the rocket launcher.

"Since modern tanks now have night fighting capability, the movement of mechanized forces (tanks and infantry combat vehicles) will be more and more during the night. To overcome this lacuna in the anti-tank capability of front line units i.e. infantry deployed or moving ahead night fighting capability is required for anti-tank weapons", Brigadier Rumel Dahiya (retired), a defense analyst, told Sputnik.

The Indian Army also wants the night sights to be capable of facilitating the firing of other in-service ammunition, such as 84mm high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) 551 rockets, high-explosive armor penetrating rockets, as well as smoke and illumination shells.

In the past, India has imported thermal imaging (TI) sights for T-72 tanks from Poland. These are also available in some other countries like France, Israel, Russia, Ukraine, USA etc.
