A family in Rajasthan has left for Umarkot city in Pakistan for wedding celebrations which were earlier delayed due to tensions between the two countries after the Pulwama terror attack on February 14 which left 40 CRPF personnel dead.

A groom from Rajasthan's Barmar finally left for his wedding in Pakistan's Umarkot on Friday.

His wedding was earlier scheduled to take place on March 8. It was postponed due to the strained relationship between India and Pakistan after the Pulwama suicide attack. The terror attack was orchestrated by Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM).

"My wedding was fixed for March 8 but because of the tensions between the two nations, post the Pulwama attack, it was postponed. Now that there is peace again, I'm going there, I'm happy," the groom was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.

Earlier in March, a Pakistani girl tied the knot with an Indian man in Patiala after her wedding which was scheduled to take place in February got delayed due to Pulwama attack.

Kiran Sarjeet Kaur (27) married Parvinder Singh (33) of Tepla village in Ambala district of Haryana at Gurudwara Shri Khel Sahib according to Sikh traditions.

Kaur's plan to reach Patiala on February 23 got delayed due to heightened tension between India and Pakistan following the terror attack in Pulwama.

She reached Patiala on a 45-day visa by Samjhauta Express on Thursday (March 7).

As the Indian Embassy in Pakistan gave her visa only for Patiala, she came to Patiala and stayed with her relatives at Samana.
