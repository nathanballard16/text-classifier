Bangladesh evacuated more than 300,000 people, while India had shifted nearly 125,000 people, mostly in West Bengal state.

Five of the six victims in Bangladesh were killed by falling trees, including a 52-year-old woman who had spent Saturday night in a shelter. She returned home on Sunday and was killed when a tree crashed onto her house. Another victim, a 60-year old fisherman, had refused to evacuate.

Some 30 people were injured and around 6000 homes were partially or fully damaged, Bangladeshi authorities said.
