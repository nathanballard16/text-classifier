From Our Special Correspondent

GUWAHATI: Union Minister of state for home affairs, G Kishan Reddy, has said that India would continue to pursue its policy of zero tolerance against terrorism while asserting that the defence forces have thwarted all threats to the country’s internal security.

Speaking at the Police Commemoration Day organised by Assam Police here on Monday, Reddy paid tribute to the police forces saying that the nation takes pride and will always remember the brave police personnel martyred in the line of duty.

“The country salutes our police forces, their families and remembers with pride those brave police personnel martyred in the line of duty,” the minister said.

Reddy said that Assam Police personnel have sacrificed their lives in battle against militants, maintenance of law and order, tackling crime, ensuring security in the border areas apart from helping the needy during floods and other natural disasters.

“Since 1964, a total of 879 Assam police personnel have laid down their lives for maintenance of law and order in the state,” he said, while adding that the number of police and civilian casualties has come down.

Acknowledging the exemplary service rendered by Assam Police, the minister said that over several decades of fighting insurgency and militancy, the police force has displayed professional qualities, courage and valour in the conduct of counter-intelligence operations.

“It is because of them that the security situation in Assam has completely changed and they have ushered in an era of peace and prosperity with a fillip to investment opportunities in the state,” Reddy said.

He appealed to all the remaining militant or insurgent groups of the region to lay down their arms and join the mainstream where they can also contribute to progress of the nation.

“Everyone should abjure violence and in a democracy like India, there is no place for violence and that every difference can be sorted out through dialogue in a peaceful manner,” he had said.
