Bollywood celebrities pray for Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman who has been captured by Pakistan Army : Bollywood News

The tension between India and Pakistan is only increasing day by day. Indian CRPF soldiers were killed in a deadly terror attack in Pulwama, Kashmir on February 14. India counterattacked on February 26 and destroyed Jaish camps in Pakistan. On Wednesday morning, Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by Pakistani Army.

Indian Pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was taken into custody by Pakistani forces. The commander was lynched by a mob before the Pakistan Army took him into their custody and gave him medical attention.

As the soldier remains captured by Pakistan Army, Bollywood celebrities are praying for him and his safe return to the country.
