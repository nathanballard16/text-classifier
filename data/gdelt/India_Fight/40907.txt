Opposition leaders, media got a taste of 'draconian' J&K admin and 'brute force' unleashed on people: Rahul Gandhi

Rahul Gandhi said both opposition politicians and the press got a taste of "draconian" administration in Jammu and Kashmir.

A day after being denied entry into Srinagar, Congress MP Rahul Gandhi on Sunday said both opposition politicians and the press got a taste of "draconian" administration in Jammu and Kashmir.

A delegation of opposition parties led by Gandhi was on Saturday not allowed to step out of Srinagar airport and sent back to Delhi.

The delegation comprising leaders of opposition parties-Congress, CPI, DMK, RJD, TMC, NCP, and JDS went to see the ground reality, days after the Centre abrogated provisions of Article 370.

Senior leaders, Ghulam Nabi Azad Congress, Anand Sharma, Sitaram Yechury, Sharad Yadav, Manoj Jha, Majeed Memon, Tiruchi Shiva, and D Raja were the part of the delegation which left from Delhi for Srinagar.

Before leaving from Delhi airport, the leaders had insisted that they were only going to assess the ground realities and not for creating any disturbance.
