Bengaluru: In a shocking incident reported from the state capital, a 20-year-old drunkard was arrested by police for sexually assaulting and murdering his 70-year-old grandmother. The victim, Poornima (name changed), was incharge of a graveyard in the Rupena Agrahara area next to Bengaluru Poonamahalli.

Her husband, who was a worker in the same graveyard, had died two years ago and she took on the responsibility. Her 20-year-old grandson, Harish, who was unemployed and a drug addict stole her jewels for purchasing drugs a few months ago. In the past too, Harish was involved in a number of crimes.

When he did not mend his ways despite repeated warnings by his grandmother, she drove him out of the house. However, since he did not have anywhere to go and wandered in the locality, she showed mercy and invited him to stay in her house.

She advised the accused to find some work but he did not pay heed to her words. The he did the unthinkable and locked the door of the house and hit her with an iron rod. Then, he sexually assaulted the victim who was struggling to survive in pool of blood.

Her granddaughter, who was shepherding in the area, heard the screams of her grandmother and ran towards the house. There she saw Harish sitting outside the house under the influence of drugs. When she went inside house, she saw her grandmother dead in the pool of blood. She called the neighbours while Harish tried to flee from the scene of crime. But he was captured and handed over to Toyahalli police.
