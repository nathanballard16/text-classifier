Firemen hailed as heroes in Delhi horror blaze

"No one in the area informed us that so many people were there in the building, some said there were three or four people trapped inside," Shulka told the Times of India daily.

"I saw at least 30 people in the room (on the third floor) with most of them sleeping. A few others were dead ... We were told that the labourers slept in shifts," he said.

On Monday, charred walls and smoke-blackened windows bore a grim testimony to the tragedy that unfolded at the cramped premises.

Locals told AFP that all illegal factories in the area pull down and lock their shutters at night, which gives workers time to flee if police raid the premises.

"But this time it proved fatal for them as a lot of precious time was lost in trying to enter the building," a local resident said, as officials from the electricity department arrived at the scene.
