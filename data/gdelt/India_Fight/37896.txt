Protesters decry Union govt.’s move to amend Article 370

Meanwhile, BJP holds multiple celebrations in city

A collective of progressive groups and people from Jammu and Kashmir held a protest here on Monday against the Union government’s move to abrogate Article 370 of the Constitution, and bifurcate the State into two Union Territories.

The protest was disrupted by another group which tried to storm the protest venue. They were immediately detained by the police and later released.

A Kashmiri student held a handwritten note: “Oh dear Modi! At least let me communicate with my family! I have not been able to contact my family for two days now. I fear what has happened to them.”

A statement issued at the protest said: “Article 370 is nothing but a Constitutional recognition of the conditions mentioned in the Instrument of Accession that the ruler of Kashmir signed with the Government of India in 1948. It reflects the contractual rights and obligations of two parties. Scrapping the Article without consulting the J&K constituent assembly is equivalent of going back on our word”.

The protesters also came down heavily on the opposition parties that supported the move. “The YSRCP, which recently moved a Bill to reserve 75% of its jobs for local residents, is OK with the people of Kashmir losing their special status. Parties like the AAP, which are fighting for the statehood of Delhi, are now giving consent to a Bill which makes an existing state into a Union Territory,” the statement said.

Meanwhile, BJP workers celebrated in the city including at the party head office, Jagannath Bhavan. “Today is the day when the full integration of Jammu and Kashmir has been achieved,” C.T. Ravi, general secretary, BJP, Karnataka, said. Workers of the BJP legal cell took out a rally at Mysore Bank Circle, and a few MLCs held a celebration at the National Military Memorial.
