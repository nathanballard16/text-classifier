Elephants have killed 369 people in Odisha between January 2015 and June 2019, a state minister said.

Wild elephant attacks are common in various parts of India, including West Bengal, Nagaland, Jharkhand and Odisha, as well as some parts of southern India.

Forest and Environment Minister Bikram Keshari Arukh said in the Odisha state assembly that another 207 people had been injured in these attacks over the same period. He added that the forest department was using various strategies to minimise human-elephant conflict--with stone walls and solar-powered fences, creating sources of fodder and water for the animals, and deploying squads to track the movement of jumbos and to keep them away from human habitations.

Last month, Minister of State for Environment Babul Supriyo had said that elephant attacks had killed 2,398 people in the five years up to March 31, 2019. Last year alone, 494 were killed. The majority of the deaths in the past five years occurred in West Bengal (403), Nagaland (397) and Jharkhand (349). However, the number of annual deaths in elephant attacks had come down from 516 in 2017-18 to 494 in 2018-2019, Supriyo added.

As per the last census in 2017 by the Ministry, there were as many as 27,312 elephants in the country.
