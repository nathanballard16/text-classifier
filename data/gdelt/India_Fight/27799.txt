MP: On alleged hawala racket, Kamal Nath says 'attempt to distract attention from good work'

The I-T report will mention names of several ministers and Congress leaders and also mentions who gave what amount to whom and when. The report also mentions funding from government departments and which minister was given direction for funding from state government, sources said.

The Income Tax department will submit a detailed report to the CBI, relating to an alleged hawala racket of about Rs 281 crore, which CM Kamal Nath finds himself snared in, sources said. Reacting to the allegations, Kamal Nath said that the entire affair was framed to distract the attention from the good work being done by the state government and to malign the reputation of the MP government. As per sources, the I-T department had found that huge money was sourced illegally from government departments of the Madhya Pradesh government and were allegedly used to carry out the hawala transactions and for aiding the election expense of some Congress candidates in MP during the Lok Sabha elections.
