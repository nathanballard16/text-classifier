11 dengue cases reported this year

At least 11 cases of dengue, eight cases of malaria and five cases of chikunguniya have been reported so far this year, the report on vector-borne diseases in the city, compiled by the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said.

Among these, while most of the cases have been “untraced after investigation”, the second highest incidence of vector-borne diseases has been reported in South Delhi with seven cases in all, followed by Delhi Cantonment with five cases and one case each in EDMC and NDMC.

Surprisingly, no cases from the North Delhi Municipal Corporation have been reported so far.

Comparatively, at the same time last year, there were 14 cases of malaria, 15 cases of dengue and four cases of chikunguniya, the report pointed out.

The municipal corporations in their efforts to combat the menace of vector-borne diseases have sprayed 2,61,560 houses and sent legal notices to 13,517 houses as having ‘musquitogenic’ conditions. At a house meeting of the EDMC on Monday, councillors urged officials to tackle the issue on a war footing.
