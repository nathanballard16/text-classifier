Ram Charan pledges to develop the birthplace of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy, not his descendants

As expected, the theatrical trailer of Sye Raa Narasimha Reddy released to a stupendous response from all quarters of the country in five Indian languages. The 3-minute clip is jam-packed with mind-boggling and high-octane action sequences, astounding sets, breath-taking visuals, battlefield episodes and a thumping background score. Unlike the teaser, it delved deep into the plot by showcasing the rebellion flagged by Narasimha Reddy ( Chiranjeevi ) against the mighty British Army in what is called as the first battle for freedom.During the trailer launch event which happened at Prasad’s IMAX in Hyderabad, the producer of Sye Raa, Ram Charan gave a clarification on several issues which included the protests from Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy ’s family members. Breaking his silence on the controversy , the 34-year-old actor said “When we take the life story of a prominent personality after 100 years, it becomes history. According to the Supreme Court’s ruling, anybody can make a film on anyone after 100 years of their death.” The RRR actor also cited Aamir Khan’s Mangal Pandey as the example.Recently, few descendants of Narasimha Reddy staged a protest outside Ram Charan’s production office in Hyderabad. They demanded compensation for sharing information about their ancestors and also stated that Ram Charan had promised them financial help last year.Making his point pretty clear, the Mega Power Star said “I cannot bring down the stature of Uyyalawada Narasimha Reddy by helping just a few members of his family. If I really want to do something, I shall help the district and village of Uyyalawada as a token of respect to the great freedom fighter.”
