Mahagun robbery plotter arrested

NOIDA: One of the prime accused in the Mahagun office robbery , who was roped in by the gang after a failed attempt earlier, was arrested on Monday. Sachin Thakur, who carried a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head in connection with the robbery, was arrested after a gunfight with the crime branch in Phase II area.Police said Thakur (30) was shot in the left leg during the gunfight on Dadri road around 4.30 pm. While Thakur was nabbed, his accomplice, who police identified as Rohit Kumar, managed to flee.According to crime branch officers, Thakur has 12 cases of dacoity, robbery and attempt to murder lodged against him in police stations across Gautam Budh Nagar and Ghaziabad. He was not part of the gang that tried to attack the Mahagun office on April 14, but was roped in after the failed attempt.“Sachin was one of the main plotters of the robbery on the intervening night of April 27-28,” said Dharmendra Kumar, the sub-inspector at the Star I team.Police had earlier said that Sachin took away Rs 4 lakh from the looted amount of Rs 35 lakh to fund a bhandara. But he has apparently told police that only Rs 2,600 were used for the bhandara at a Kali Mata temple in Ghaziabad. A resident of Bulandshahr ’s Sikandrabad, Thakur had been living in Vijay Nagar in Ghaziabad for the past few years.“He played a major role in misleading the police by parking a stolen Santro, which police believed was used in the crime,” a police officer said. After the arrest of Sachin, the police are now looking for another accused, Vinod.A truck used in the robbery apparently belongs to Vinod.One of the accused, Asif, has surrendered before court, while a quack, Ramprakash, in whose house the robbery plan was hatched, has got a stay on his arrest from court.
