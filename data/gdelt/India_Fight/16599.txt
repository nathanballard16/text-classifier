Centre Bans Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Under UAPA

The Central Government has banned the Yasin Malik-led Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) as an unlawful association under the provisions of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA).

Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front

Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) is spearheading the separatist ideology in the Kashmir valley and has been at the forefront of the separatist activities and violence since 1988.

It is also alleged that JKLF was involved in murders of Kashmiri Pandits in 1989 which led to their exodus from the valley.

It is also said that JKLF is posing a security threat to the country and is posing threat to the territorial integrity and sovereignty of India.

JKLF is also actively and continuously encouraging feelings of enmity and hatred against the lawfully established government as well as armed rebellion.

The decision to ban JKLF was taken in accordance with the policy of zero tolerance against terrorism.
