RAWALPINDI (Dunya News) – Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director-General (DG) Major General Asif Ghafoor on Saturday exposed another blatant lie of Indian Army and media that India had captured two terrorists along the Line of Control on August 21.

Maj Gen Ghafoor revealed that two farmers, including 21-year-old Muhammad Nazim and 30-year-old Khalil Ahmad, had mistakenly crossed the LoC from Haji-Pir sector.

The farmers were working on their fields when they had crossed into other side of the LoC.

The ISPR further stated that on August 27, both countries had spoken about the matter on hotline and Indian authorities had responded to give reply after routine legal proceedings; however on September 2, Indian media made a false propaganda that the two persons belonged to banned outfits.
