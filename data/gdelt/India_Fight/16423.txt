A tribal woman was killed in a fatal assault and acid attack in her own yard in a Rajasthan village, police said on Friday.

The attack occurred on Wednesday, a day before the Hindu festival of Holi. The victim, a 45-year-old woman, was out in her yard early on Wednesday morning to milk a cow when she was brutally beaten up in Banswara district's Jolana village. Her assailants smeared her with acid colours, burning the upper part of her body.

She died of her injuries at the Banswara District Hospital, SHO Arthuna Police Station Gahari Lal told The Tribune on Thursday.

An FIR registered by her husband names four people, all living in her neighbourhood.

SHO Lal said there were burn marks on her face, upper portion of her chest and hands. A packet some deadly chemical found nearby leads police to believe that her assailants forced her to have some.

Her family was in the house when she was attacked. Although police are still investigating the case, initial probe shows it could be a land dispute.

Police have booked four people for murder and have detained two, the SHO said.

The victim was cremated after an autopsy on Friday.
