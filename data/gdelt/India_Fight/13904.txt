‘Indira Gandhi a true democrat, dynamic PM’

Tirupati: Speakers at a meeting held under the aegis of Madabhusi Ananthasayanam Institute of Public Affairs (MAIPA) here last evening on the occasion of releasing a book on late Prime Minister Indira Gandhi described her as a pro-poor and a dynamic Prime Minister.

The book titled as ‘Indira Gandhi–A Great Democrat and Dynamic Lady Prime Minister’ was written by former Assembly Speaker Agarala Eswara Reddi.

Former Union Minister Chinta Mohan said Indira Gandhi is a great patriot and the credit of sacrificing life for the sake of the country first goes to her.

India had not seen such a daring Prime Minister, who saw Pakistan divided into two after a heroic battle, he said.
