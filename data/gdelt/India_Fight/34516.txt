Shubhankar finishes Tied-34th at Scottish Open; Wiesberger wins Scottish

India's Shubhankar Sharma shot a 67 in the final round to finish Tied-34 alongside the likes of Rory McIlroy and defending champion, Brandon Stone at the Aberdeen Standard Investments Scottish Open.

Sharma ended the week at 13-under.

Bernd Wiesberger, who started the final day with a handy two-shot lead, was taken to a play-off before winning his second European Tour title of the year and his first Rolex series event.

Wiesberger was not into the Scottish Open eight days ago, but his second place in Ireland earned him a place here and now the win puts him in a different league.

Wiesberger beat Benjamin Herbert on the third extra hole after the latter, who was seven shots behind Wiesberger at the start, set the clubhouse target of 22-under 262 with a final round of 62 with nine birdies and no bogeys.

"I wasn't in this tournament eight days ago. You know, I had a great week in Ireland and sealed my spot, and what a week this is. Just take a lot of confidence out of the last two weeks into the final major this year," said the Austrian.
