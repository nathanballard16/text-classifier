The Indian Air Force (IAF) will officially get its first batch of Apache attack helicopters at the Pathankot Airbase in Punjab on September 3.

"Defence Minister Rajnath Singh will induct the most advanced choppers into the Air Force on September 3 in presence of top IAF and other senior officers," IAF officials said here on Thursday.

The Apache Guardian attack helicopters, often called 'tanks in the air' as they are armed with deadly missiles and rockets, have arrived at the Hindon Airbase in Ghaziabad.

The Boeing-manufactured Apaches will be based at the Pathankot and Jorhat Airbases to cater for the western and eastern fronts.

The first squadron of Apaches, armed with Stinger air-to-air missiles, Hellfire Longbow air-to-ground missiles, guns and rockets, will be commissioned at Pathankot on September 3.

The Army is also on course to get six Apaches at a cost of Rs 4,168 crore. At present, the IAF has just two aging squadrons of Russian-origin Mi-25/35 attack helicopters.
