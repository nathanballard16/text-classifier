SURAT: The Surat unit of the State Goods and Service Tax ( SGST ) has recovered Rs 3 crore in tax evasion from eight firms involved in the fake billing scam during the raid operation continuing from the last three days.Two months ago, SGST authorities in Gujarat conducted simultaneous raids at 282 locations and busted bogus billing racket worth Rs 6,030 crore. This was the largest single-day operate in terms of extent of fake billing and tax evasion. Official sources said that of the 282 firms, 28 are from Surat. After the verification and scrutiny of the documents, the Surat unit raided eight firms in the last three days and recovered Rs 3 crore in tax evasion.The companies and locations were identified on basis of the mismatch in return for sales, purchase and e-way bills filed by the companies and firms. The contradictions in returns filed by these companies raised suspicion over tax evasion. The e-way bills generated showed that the goods were transported, but did not get reflected in the returns displaying sales of these companies.Official sources said that there is a total tax evasion of Rs 70 crore by the Surat-based companies. The operation is still continuing.
