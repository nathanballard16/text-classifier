RAWALPINDI: Director General Inter-Services Public Relations Major General Asif Ghafoor on Tuesday said the action against banned organisations is not being taken owing to anyone’s directives and the decision to ban Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Falah-e-Insaniat was taken in January this year.

Speaking to the media, the head of the military's media wing said, Pakistan received a dossier from India and it is being reviewed by the relevant institution. "Action will be taken against those found to be involved. They will be taken to courts and punished accordingly," he added.

Maj Gen Ghafoor further said that all the political parties agree on the National Action Plan. Unfortunately, the NAP wasn’t implemented as desired, he added.

The DG ISPR said that in the dogfight on February 27 between India and Pakistan, Pakistan Air Force jet shot down two Indian jets. One pilot was killed while the other was captured, he said.

He said that Pakistan had nothing to do with Pulwama attack, which killed above 40 people in Indian Occupied Kashmir.
