Janhvi Kapoor charmed the audiences with her smile and talent in 2018 when she made her debut with Dhadak opposite Ishaan Khatter. Soon, the actress gained a huge fan following on social media and also became one of the most loved stars among the younger lot. Since Dhadak, Janhvi has gone on to sign a couple of films and was shooting for RoohiAfza until recently in North India. The shooting which first took place in Uttarakhand's Roorkee, later moved to Manali. And while in Manali, Janhvi was in for a sweet surprise from her fans.

According to a report in Mumbai Mirror, Janhvi had some unexpected visitors to her hotel in Manali. Turns out, when the local children learnt that Janhvi was shooting in the area, some of them left adorable notes stuck on the door of her hotel room. "Hi Janvi Mam. We want to meet you as soon as possible. We are your big fans. We kids are very excited to meet you (sic)," one of the notes read. A source told the tabloid that the kids were die-hard fans of the Dhadak star.
