Jet ski worker rides to the rescue and plucks drowning boy from the waves off Thai holiday island

This is the dramatic moment a beachgoer battles through the waves on a jet ski to save a drowning boy.

Saroj Chuaykerd, 37, was at the beach when his friend shouted that there was a boy drowning in the sea in Koh Samui island, Surat Thani, southern Thailand, on Saturday afternoon.

Footage taken by Saroj's boss, Piyanant Jaipeam, shows the moment the brave local, who was helping out at a jet ski shop, cut through the choppy seas to grab the boy and pull him back to the shore.

The hero jet ski rider said that it was his duty to keep the tourists safe and warned others to be more careful, because drowning in the sea on the island is common.

Saroj said: 'I was working on the jet ski rental stand and part of my duty is to watch over the sea in case tourists have an accident while riding our vehicle or drowning.

'I was talking to my friend when they shouted that there was a boy drowning so I rode out and helped him as quickly as I could.

'People have drowned several times in this area of sea, so it would be better to be more careful.

'We will also put some red flags up as a warning to try and prevent more accidents in the future.'

The youngster was unharmed in the incident and clambered off the jet ski before thanking the man who saved his life.
