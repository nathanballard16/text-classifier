Abhinandan is now in Rajasthan school text

JAIPUR: Elsewhere, Congress may be questioning the Balakot airstrike, but its government in Rajasthan has introduced it in the Class IX social science textbook that students will be using from the academic session starting July.The highlighted text without any headline has been inserted in the chapter “Rashtriya suraksha evum shaurya parampara (National security and tradition of valour)’’ by the Rajasthan Board of Secondary Education. The content deals with India’s the strike on a Jaish-e-Muhammed camp in Pakistan following the Pulwama terror attack and talks about the role of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman. No mention is made of the government at the Centre or the number of terrorists killed.“After an attack on defence forces by terrorists in Pulwama, the IAF on February 26, 2019, with 12 Mirage-2000 fighter jets, attacked terrorist camps in Balakot. The next day, an F-16 Pakistan fighter jet violated Indian air space and attempted to attack (military establishments). IAF directed its “braveheart” Wing Commander Abhinandan, who flew a MiG-21, to respond. He displayed his excellence by shooting down a plane which was better than the jet he was flying,” reads the text.
