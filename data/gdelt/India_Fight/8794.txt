Pulwama attack: Pakistan takes U-turn on action against JeM

New Delhi : Pakistan has taken a U-turn on its decision claiming an action against Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). On Friday, the Interior Ministry announced that the Punjab government had taken control of a campus in Bahawalpur that is “reportedly the headquarters of Jaish-e-Mohammad”. But, the announcement was deleted in less than an hour.

For the first time in history, the campus, about 430 km from Lahore, had been acknowledged to be the headquarters of the JeM, the terror group run by Masood Azhar

Two tweets by PID, Pakistan government’s media arm, which did not link the campus comprising Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah to the Jaish were not deleted.

Pakistan’s Dawn News later reported that the interior ministry had issued a fresh statement, claiming that the Bahawalpur complex was “purely a madressah and Jamia Masjid (central mosque) where scores of orphans and students from underprivileged families are receiving religious and worldly education”.

There was no fresh explanation why the government had taken over the complex.

Earlier, the government had clearly notified that they have taken control of the complex and the decision was taken during the National Security Committee meeting under the leadership of PM Imran Khan.

Jaish-e-Mohammed had claimed the deadly Pulwama attack in Srinagar that martyred at least 40 CRPF personnel on February 14.
