Butcher held for killing man

Coimbatore: Police on Tuesday arrested a 24-year-old man for murdering a migrant labourer at Ettimadai. He was identified as M Prabakaran, a resident of KG Chavadi and a butcher by profession.

On Monday, KG Chavadi police had recovered the body of a 25-year-old man hanging from a tree near a temple. As the body had injury marks, police suspected it to be a murder. Retrieving a voter identity card from the body, police identified him as K Soren Markus, a resident of West Bengal. “He was working in a private firm in Ernakulam, Kerala and had left for his hometown by train on April 19. He had got down at KG Chavadi station in an inebriated state. Planning to rob the man, Prabakaran took him to a Tasmac shop at Ettimadai, bought liquor and reached the temple grounds to consume it. He demanded Rs 2,000 and when the victim refused, hit him with a piece of stone. On Monday morning, after finding Markus in a critical condition, Prabakaran hanged him to a tree using his belt,” a police officer said.TNN
