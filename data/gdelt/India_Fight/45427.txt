India’s monsoon death toll rises to 120 with 50 deaths in one day

The death toll from torrential rains in northern India has risen to 120, with more than 50 deaths reported in the past 24 hours alone, officials say.

Monsoon rains, accompanied by storms and lightning, hit large parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar states since Thursday. The incessant downpour felled trees and electricity poles, and brought down roofs and temporary structures.

Officials at Uttar Pradesh’s Disaster Management Department said 49 more people were killed in rain-related accidents, in addition to the 64 deaths reported since Thursday.

“The situation is grim in the eastern districts, with no let-up in the rains. The deaths were due to incidents of house collapses, lightning, drowning and snake bites,” said Ashutosh, an official who uses only one name.

Broadcaster NDTV reported that heavy rains also battered the neighbouring state of Bihar, killing seven people.

The rains flooded homes and hospitals, disrupting life for thousands of people in region. Boats were out on waterlogged roads for rescue operations, the report said.

The weather office has forecast more rain for the region on Monday.

India’s monsoon season between June and early October often sees heavy rains that cause death and destruction.

More than 1600 people died in rain-related incidents between June and September 24, according to the Home Ministry.
