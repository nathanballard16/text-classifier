University closes in Mexico border city after student slain

During the 1990s, it took dozens of slayings of women before outrage spread in Juarez, a city across the border from El Paso, Texas.

The weekend killing of a female university student has sparked protests and a four-day shutdown at the University of Ciudad Juarez. During the 1990s, it took dozens of slayings of women before outrage spread in Juarez, a city across the border from El Paso, Texas.

But the weekend killing of literature student Dana Lozano has spurred angry marches, and on Tuesday the university suspended classes for the rest of the week to hold sessions on gender and safety issues.

Prosecutors said Monday that they had arrested a suspect in the case, a young man reported to be an ex-boyfriend of the victim. Officials have said Lozano was four to six weeks pregnant when she was stabbed to death.
