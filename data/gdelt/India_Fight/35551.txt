We are investigating the incident.”The police investigation so far has revealed that a mob gathered outside the houses of the victims around 3am to accost them for “harming people through witchcraft”. All four were made to march to the village akhara (wrestling ground), where the mob rained fatal blows on them with sticks and sharp weapons.By the time Sudhir Prasad Sahu, officer-in-charge of Sisai police station, reached the village , the victims were dead. A social worker had reported the lynchings to the police station.According to police, Chapa and Phiri used to make a living selling vegetables at the weekly market. The couple’s three sons were labourers. Of the other two victims, Suna used to share his village home with his son and daughter. Phagni, whose sons are employed outside Jharkhand, lived alone.
