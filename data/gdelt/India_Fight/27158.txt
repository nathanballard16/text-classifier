Indian Sukhoi-30 MKI Aircraft Test Fires Homegrown Guided Bomb

India’s Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) on Friday successfully test fired an indigenously-developed 500 kg class guided bomb from a Sukhoi combat jet at Pokhran in Rajasthan.

The defence ministry said the guided bomb achieved the desired range and hit the target with high precision.

"The DRDO successfully flight tested a 500 kg class Inertial Guided Bomb today from Su-30 MKI Aircraft from the Pokhran test range in Rajasthan," it was quoted as saying by PTI.

The ministry said all the mission objectives have been met during the test firing of the bomb, adding it is capable of carrying different warheads.

The test firing of the guided bomb came two days after the Indian Air Force successfully test fired the aerial version of the supersonic BrahMos cruise missile from a Sukhoi jet at the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
