Jaipur, March 19

A real estate developer has gifted a flat to the family of a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) trooper who died in a suicide attack in Pulwama on February 14.

CRPF trooper Rohitash Lamba belonged to Govinpura village in Amarsar in Rajasthan’s Jaipur district.

The 27-year-old trooper got married last year and had a two-month-old daughter, whom he didn’t meet even once.

In a statement he made on Tuesday, BDI Group Managing Director Ssumit Berry said: “Military and Paramilitary forces lay down their lives while serving the country. This is the least we could do to show our gratitude for the selfless service".

More than 40 paramilitary troopers were killed on February 14 when a suicide bomber blew himself up in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district.
