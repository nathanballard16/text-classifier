Luxembourg offers to play mediator between India, Pakistan

Islamabad [Pakistan], Mar 7 (ANI): Luxembourg on Thursday expressed its desire for peace and stability between India and Pakistan and offered to play a role as mediator for peace between the two nuclear-armed nations, reports Geo TV

Minister for Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg Jean Asselborn, who is in Pakistan for two-day visit said: "The European Union is playing its role in [de-escalating tensions] between Pakistan and India. Luxembourg is ready to mediate between [Pakistan and India]."

While expressing concern over heightened tension between the two countries, Asselborn said that Luxembourg wants peace and stability in the region.

During the visit, Asselborn met his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mehmood Qureshi and the two discussed a wide range of regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, as well as the peace and security situation in the region.

The visit by Luxembourg Foreign Minister comes on the heels of high escalation between India and Pakistan. Various countries including China and the United States have asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint.

Tensions between India and Pakistan heightened following the February 14 attack on a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Pulwama in which 40 personnel were killed and five injured.

India had carried out air strikes at a JeM training camp in Balakot in Pakistan, eliminating a "large number" of terrorists, according to India's Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale.

The very next day, Pakistani jets violated Indian air space and dropped bombs in the Rajouri sector in Jammu and Kashmir. India said it foiled an attempt by the Pakistan Air Force to carry out strikes in the state by shooting down an F-16 fighter plane. (ANI)
