Ghaziabad: A man fell to the bullets of armed assailants in Modinagar, reportedly after he joined a protest by local women against a recently opened liquor shop in the area. Police have identified the deceased as 24-year-old Krishna Dipendra, a resident of Krishna Kunj area. A case of murder is yet to be lodged in this regard pending an official complaint.

Going by reports, Dipendra was attacked when he was at his friend's residence on Tibra road. Five armed men entered the residence and opened fire without any warning. Six of the twelve bullets fired by the armed assailants hit the victim who was rushed to a hospital but declared dead upon arrival. The identity of the men who shot at Dipendra is yet to be ascertained.

Tensions were high in the area ever since the inauguration of a liquor shop there, reported Times of India adding that the women of the area demonstrated against the shop and the victim was on their side. On the day of the crime, Dipendra allegedly had a scuffle with a rival group who favoured the shop and opposed his stance against it. This indicates that the victim may have been attacked by the men who indulged in a fight with Dipendra. Station house officer (SHO), Modinagar said that the police is yet to receive a formal complaint in this regard.

A similar case had come to light not too long ago from neighbouring area of Greater Noida where a 25-year-old liquor employee of a liquor shop was shot dead by two persons allegedly over a difference of Rs 10 in the price of beer. The incident took place in Aichar area under Kasna police station limits. The deceased was rushed to a hospital where he was declared brought dead on arrival. A case under sections 302 and 307 of the Indin Penal Code (IPC).
