One-year-old Daamin and four-year-old Uhbaan will remember this year’s Father’s Day as the saddest day of their life as they lost their father coincidentally on the same day. Their father Arshad Ahmed Khan was a brave police officer of the Jammu and Kashmir police, who breathed his last at the All India Institute of Medical Science in New Delhi. He was seriously injured in a terrorist attack, in which five CRPF personnel were killed, on June 12, 2019. Khan's body was brought to the police line in Srinagar for the wreath-laying ceremony. Khan's son four-year-old son Uhbaan is too young to understand the magnitude of the tragedy that has befallen him. Srinagar's Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) broke down when he carried Uhbaan in his lap and placed flowers on the coffin. Uhbaan also gave the last salute to his father before he was taken to his home in the Civil Lines area near Karan Nagar. J&K’s senior officials including K Vijay Kumar, who is the Advisor to the Jammu and Kashmir Governor, the Director General of Police, Dilbagh Singh, the Additional Director General of Police, B Srinivas, and the Inspector General of Police (Kashmir), Swayam Prakash Pani paid their last respect to the fallen officer. Born to Mushtaq Ahmad Khan and Mehbooba Begum in Balgardan, Srinagar, Khan was appointed as Sub-Inspector in the Jammu and Kashmir Police in 2002 and served in various important capacities. He was posted as the Station House Officer (SHO) in Sadar police station in Anantnag town.
