Dir council lauds PAF for quick response to India

DIR: The tehsil council of Dir on Wednesday paid rich tributes to the Pakistan Air Force for its tit-for-tat response to India and shooting down two jets of the arch rival. The council also passed a unanimous resolution extending full support to the armed forces in case of a war with India.

After the council meeting, the councillors, employees of Tehsil Municipal Administration and people held a rally from TMA office to DSP Chowk. Addressing the rally, Tehsil Nazim Mir Makhzanuddin and others said that they gathered to send a clear message that the people of Upper Dir would fight shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces against India.

They said that the people of Upper Dir had rendered sacrifices for the country in 1948 and 1965 wars and would not hesitate to do so again. Earlier in the council meeting, the nazim said that there would be no compromise on quality of work in the ongoing developmental projects.

Tehsil Naib Nazim Maulana Badshah Muhammad chaired the meeting. Malik Habibul Haq, Shakirullah, Bakhtiar Khan, and others complained about closure of link roads in Usherai Dara, Gawaldi, Doog Dara and other areas of the district due to recent snowfall. They complained that a week had passed but the Communication and Works Department was yet to reopen links roads. Other councillors also complained about the doctors absence at the basic health units in Usherai Dara and frequent electricity cuts in the district.
