Two children from Jammu and Kashmir who thwarted terrorists' attempt to carry out a large-scale massacre during the Sunjwan attack on February 10, 2018, have been conferred with the Indian Council for Child Welfare (ICCW) National Bravery Awards 2018.

The coveted awards were presented to Gurugu Hima Priya, 9, and Soumyadip Jana, 14, in New Delhi.

Priya and Soumyadip confronted heavily armed terrorists who had attacked a residential block in the Sunjwan Army camp on the outskirts of Jammu. They showed exemplary courage and spontaneous initiative by diverting the attention of Pakistan-backed terrorists and saved lives of their families and other persons.

Soumyadip was in the residential block with his family when the terrorists tried to enter his quarter. He received grievous injuries in the attack that left him into a coma for three months. He is still receiving treatment. He barricaded the door and did not allow the terrorists to enter. He sustained multiple splinter injuries during the confrontation.

Similarly, Priya too saved the lives of several persons. She valiantly stood in the way of the terrorists. Feeling frustrated, they threw a grenade inside the room, injuring her. Her mother was also grievously injured.

According to Ruby Saxena, project officer, ICCW, “Both the children had shown an extraordinary bravery and saved several lives. It is recognition of their brave act that they have been selected for the award.”

Eight girls and 13 boys from 12 states of India have been selected for the bravery award. The National Bravery Award Scheme was initiated by the ICCW in 1957 to give due recognition to the children who distinguish themselves by performing outstanding deeds of bravery.
