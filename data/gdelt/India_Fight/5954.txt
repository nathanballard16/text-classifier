Give ’em A Bloody Nose

The need is for a full-fledged muscular policy in which the army other security forces should be given a carte blanche to neutralise Pakistan's machinations.

These and counter-terror measures deep inside Pakistan will teach Islamabad a lesson.

The deadly terror attack by the Pakistani outfit Jaish e Mohammed on a CRPF convoy killing 39 jawans and critically injuring many more today should be treated by the Modi government as an act of war by Islamabad.

The surgical strike has obviously had no impact on the Pakistani govt.

The Modi govt’s Kashmir policy, howsoever well-intentioned, has failed to tackle the situation. The need is for a full-fledged muscular policy in which the army and other security forces should be given a carte blanche to neutralise Pakistan’s machinations. Anyone chanting pro-Pak slogans should be summarily gunned down. Ditto treatment to stone-pelters too. You cannot support Pakistan and yet demand civil liberties guaranteed by the Indian Constitution. This is at the military level.

At the political level Article 35A and 370 should be scrapped through ordinances. The government can legally do that.

And elsewhere in the country, jihadi fundamental outfits like the PDF should be banned. Elements working for D Company should be encountered. The IB has submitted tapes of a prominent Mumbai builder’s conversations with a Jaish e Mohammed operator in Lahore. Yet no action against him. A massive real estate project in Mumbai is being executed by a front organization of D Company. FIRs for murder registered against armymen in Kashmir and the totally untenable case filed against a brilliant officer like Lt Col Purohit should be withdrawn forthwith. These and counter-terror measures deep inside Pakistan will teach Islamabad a lesson.

Time we gave a bloody nose to Pakistan.
