Nawaz was busy shooting for his scenes and a huge crowd turned up on the sets to witness the actor perform and click pictures with him. Amidst shoot, a crazy fan of Nawaz pulled out a scary stunt. Despite tight security, a boy managed to skirt the bouncers and the policemen surrounding the actor and ran up to Nawaz, put his arms around his neck and tried to click a selfie with him. This surely did scare the actor and everyone around him.

However, the cops on duty were quick to act and they immediately rushed to Nawazuddin's rescue and nabbed the boy and took him away from the actor and the shoot location.
