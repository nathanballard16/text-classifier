"If Muslims Want To Lie In Gutter, Let Them Be": PM Quotes Former Union minister To Attack Congress

His remarks drew sharp protests from the Congress, prompting Modi to say he will send them a YouTube link of the interview.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday launched a blistering attack at the Congress party, alleging it of being negligent towards the upliftment of Muslim community, while replying to the Motion of Thanks to President Ram Nath Kovind’s address to Parliament. Modi quoted a former minister in the Rajiv Gandhi-led Congress government as saying in an interview that its leaders claimed that it was not the duty of their party to uplift Muslims and "if they want to lie in gutter let them be". Modi was referring to former Union Cabinet Minister Arif Mohammad Khan’s interview to ABP News for the show Pradhan Mantri.
