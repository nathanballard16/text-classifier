Video shows the ceremony taking place and coffins draped in the national flag of India. Rebels launched an attack on the soldiers in Kashmir's Anantnag on Wednesday, killing five. Four were injured, including one police officer. One militant also reportedly died in the fighting. A senior police official said two militants, riding a motorbike, attacked a joint deployment of India's Central Reserve Police Force and other police personnel. The militants fired at the security forces and lobbed grenades on a busy stretch of KP Road near Oxford School around 4.55 p.m.
