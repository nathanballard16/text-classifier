Before suicide, man pushes wife, two kids into canal

PATIALA: A 35-year-old domestic servant jumped into Bhakra canal after pushing his wife and two children into the waters at Bhadson-Nabha road here on Wednesday, just a few days after his employer had accused him of theft.Bhagwan Singh, a former excise and taxation officer, had lodged a complaint with the police that golden ornaments worth Rs 4 lakh of his wife had been stolen from his house, suspecting Ram Chander, the servant, to be behind the theft. Cops had called Chander to the police station and questioned him, but he denied any involvement.At the Bhakra canal around 3.30pm, divers noticed the suicide attempt and jumped within no time to save the family. They managed to save the woman and her daughter and fished out the body of the son. The body of Chander is yet to be found.Ram Chander’s wife Basanti said, “We have been working for years with Bhagwan Singh. He and his wife suspected we had stolen the gold and lodged a complaint with the Model Town police. Cops had interrogated my husband, who had become depressed since the last few days.”“As cops and Bhagwan Singh did not believe him, Chander decided to take a loan from his friends and offered Bhagwan the money. However, he refused, saying he wanted the gold jewellery or we would have to go to jail. Chander took me and our children for a walk and when he reached Bhakra canal, he pushed all of us and then jumped in. I have lost my son and husband for no fault.”Police have booked Bhagwan Singh under Sections of abetment to suicide of the Indian Penal Code .
