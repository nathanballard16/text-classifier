A display of immaturity

India intruded Pakistan’s air space and claimed to have destroyed a terrorist camp near Balakot. The claims were immediately debunked by Pakistan’s military, but now independent analysts have also proved with the help of satellite images that the Indian claim of destroying the alleged terrorist camp is fictitious. All television channels of India vehemently and continuously spewed venom against Pakistan, displaying their irresponsibility. Indian TV and film actors also stepped forward and glorified war. It’s time they had a thorough introspection of what they did and what they should have done.

All the claims of destroying a camp in Balakot and killing ‘300 terrorists’ have been debunked by international observers as India has failed to produce credible evidence to prove its claim. Contrary to this, sanity prevailed on Pakistani TV channels.
