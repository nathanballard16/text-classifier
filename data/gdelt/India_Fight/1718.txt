Jawan injured in Rajouri sniper fire

JAMMU: An Army jawan was injured on Sunday when Pakistani troops violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked firing from across the Line of Control in Rajouri district of Jammu and Kashmir, police sources said.The soldier, manning a forward post, was hit by a bullet apparently from a Pakistani sniper in Keri sector, sources said. “He was shifted to a nearby health centre immediately from where he was airlifted to Army hospital for specialised treatment,” an official said.The Indian troops retaliated and the exchange of fire between the two sides continued for some time, officials said.It should be noted that an Army major and a soldier were killed when an improvised explosive device went off in Naushera sector on Friday, the day when a porter was also killed in Pakistani firing in nearby Sunderbani sector.There has been a spurt in ceasefire violations along the LoC in the twin districts of Rajouri and Poonch since the beginning of this year, resulting in the killing of two army personnel and injuries to several others.
