The original Hindi Medium was directed by Saket Choudhary with Pakistani actor Saba Qamar as the female lead . Irrfan had won several awards for his performance in the film.

After being occasionally spotted with a mask, the actor was recently seen removing his mask at the Mumbai airport as the paparazzi clicked his pictures. The actor finally announced his return a few days back. He took to Twitter to share a note, “Maybe somewhere in the pursuit of winning, we forget how much it means to be loved. In our vulnerability, we are reminded. As I leave my footprints onto these steps of my life, I want to pause to be grateful for receiving your immense love and support, it soothed me in my process of healing. So I travel back to you, thanking you from the bottom of my heart.”
