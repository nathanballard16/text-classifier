‘If similar actions were taken in 1999…’: Kargil hero Captain Kalia’s father praises Modi govt’s response to Pulwama

In a gross violation of the Geneva Convention which lays down the laws of modern warfare and treatment of soldiers, the soldiers were brutally tortued.

On Thursday, as the nation commemorated the braves of the Kargil War 20 years ago, NK Kalia lamented his son’s treatment at the hands of Pakistan.

For the peaceniks and pacifists and people of this generation, Captain Saurabh Kalia’s case was a reminder of the brutality of the Pakistanis which had scant disregard for the laws of engagement and even basic human rights.

Captain Saurabh Kalia and Sepoy Arjunram Baswana, Sepoy Mula Ram Bidiasar, Sepoy Naresh Singh Sinsinwar, Sepoy Bhanwar Lal Bagaria and Sepoy Bhika Ram Mudh of 4 Jat Regiment were captured and tortured.

In a gross violation of the Geneva Convention which lays down the laws of modern warfare and treatment of soldiers, the captured were brutally tortured.

Their ear drums were pierced with hot rods, eyes punctured and genitals cut off. Autopsies revealed that they were burnt with cigarette buts, teeth broken and even their skull fractured. All injuries took place ante-mortem, that’s before their death.

Preparations by the Indian Army are in full swing to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Kargil war on July 26 to rekindle the pride and valour of the soldiers who took part in Operation Vijay.

The Indian armed forces had defeated Pakistan on July 26, 1999. Since then, the day is celebrated as Kargil Vijay Diwas.

President Ram Nath Kovind will visit the war memorial in Dras on Friday to pay tributes to soldiers who laid down their lives in the 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan.
