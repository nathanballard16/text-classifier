‘No question of army atrocities, it's only fighting militants’

NEW DELHI, Sep 7: The Army presence in the Kashmir Valley was only limited to fighting militants, and police and central forces are there for handling public order, said National Security Advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval on Saturday.

In an interaction with select group of journalists in New Delhi, Ajit Doval said, "The question of army atrocities in Jammu and Kashmir does not arise. Only state police and some central forces are handling public order, the Indian army is there to fight militants".

NSA Ajit Doval also informed that restrictions in the Valley were limited to only ten police station areas and hundred percent of landline phones have been restored.

"Out of 199 police station areas in Jammu and Kashmir only 10 have prohibitory orders in place, rest have no restrictions. 100 percent landline connections are operational in the state", he said.

Earlier in August, the central government had scrapped the Article 370 of the Constitution, which conferred special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

The Centre also bifurcated the state into two union territories - Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh.
