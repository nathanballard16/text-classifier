Is Zain Imam missing ex co-star Aditi Rathore?

MUMBAI: Television's heartthrob Zain Imam is currently busy shooting for his Star Plus' show Ek Bhram Sarvagun Sampan.

Zain's previous show Naamkaran on Star Plus received immense popularity. The debonair actor played the character of a police officer Niel in the show, while Aditi Rathore played female lead Avni.

The duo enjoyed a crazy fan following, and their fans lovingly named them AvNiel. Although the TRP of the show fluctuated throughout its run on television, the love from fans grew leaps and bounds, so much so that when Zain was finalized for Ek Bhram, fans requested the makers to rope in actress Aditi to play the female protagonist opposite him.

Well, that did not happen, but fans of the onscreen couple miss them terribly and are strongly hoping for their comeback.

Well, it looks like even Zain misses the show. He recently took to social media and posted a throwback picture from the show.

See the picture.

The actor was also seen as Arjun in &TV's Laal Ishq and Mohit in Star Plus's Ishqbaaaz. He was a contestant in Colors' Khatron Ke Khiladi 9. Currently, he plays Kabir Mittal in Ek Bhram Sarvagun Sampanna opposite Shrenu Parikh.
