Pune: The terror attack on CRPF convoy in south Kashmir’s Pulwama has drawn worldwide outrage with several people taking to the streets in different parts of the country to protest against the cowardly act.

Meanwhile, a shopkeeper in Pune is protesting against the dastardly attack in a unique manner by selling Pakistan flag, along with a free lighter. Murudkar Zendewale, a famous shop in Pune sold over 100 national flags of Pakistan on Friday and gave a free lighter with every flag.

"Since morning, we sold over 100 Pakistani flags. We gave a lighter free with every flag," said Girish Murudkar, the owner of Murdudkar Zendewale, according to PTI.

On Thursday, at least 40 security personnel lost their lives and several others were injured after a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terrorist rammed an explosive-laden car into a Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) convoy in Awantipora of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar. The Intelligence sources highlighted that the terrorists have been lying low after the attack.

Expressing their ire over the attack, people in the city burnt Pakistani flags at several places.

Several anti-Pakistan protests are being held across the nation to condemn the attack. Earlier today, a group of people congregated outside High Commission of Pakistan in New Delhi and staged a protest against the dastardly terror attack.

“You have seen what has happened yesterday. This is mass murder,” a protestor said on the killing of the CRPF personnel.

Meanwhile, candlelight marches were held at India Gate and Jantar Mantar in Delhi by several people to express solidarity with the families of the CRPF jawans killed in the attack
