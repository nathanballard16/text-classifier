Woman attempts suicide on district court premises

A female advocate who had alleged rape by Congress leader Rohit Tilak allegedly attempted suicide inside the session court premises on Friday. She has been shifted to a private hospital in the city for treatment.



The incident happened at the district court where the victim was present at the hearing in a case of abduction and attempted murder of Tilak’s advocate Nandu Phadke and his son Sandip, which was registered against her at Deccan police station.



The victim had written to the Pune police commissioner on April 25 against the alleged harassment by sub inspector Santosh Sonawane in collusion with additional commissioner of police Ravindra Sengaonkar and Tilak’s advocate Nandu Phadke, who were allegedly blackmailing, pressurising and trying to extort money from her in regards to the rape complaint she had filed against the Congress leader.



She had mentioned in her complaint that in November 2018 Phadke’s son Sandeep had met with an accident and she was allegedly being framed in that case. Sonawane had allegedly called her and asked her to withdraw her rape complaint and had threatened to frame her . Sonawane had also allegedly admitted to her that there was no proof of the alleged abduction and attempt to murder against her. The police said that after the hearing got over she allegedly consumed sleeping pills to commit suicide.



Inspector Bapu Shinde of the Shivajinagar police crime unit said, “The woman consumed sleeping pills inside the court premises. She is under treatment at Ruby Hall Clinic. She is not in a state to give us a statement and we are yet to register a case in this incident.” PMB
