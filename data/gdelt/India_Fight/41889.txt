While the actor is currently busy with promoting his upcoming film ' Dream Girl ' and shoots of his upcoming projects, the actor makes sure that he achieves a balance between his professional life and personal life.In a recent interview with the Hindustan Times, Ayushmann opened up about what he likes about the Ganesh Chaturthi festival in Mumbai. The 'Badhaai Ho' actor remembered that while going for auditions during the festival when he was new to the city, he used to get off the auto-rickshaw and randomly start dancing in Ganpati procession.The 'Andhadhun' actor further revealed that the best thing about the festival he likes is the cheerful friendliness around it. Ayushmann said the whole energy that comes with the festival is amazing, so much so that nothing stops devotees, even if it's raining people like to dance with Bappa by their side.Talking about the film 'Dream Girl', Ayushmann said producer Ekta Kapoor is a very spiritual and religious person and believes in attaching songs with the films that she believes in. That's how the Ganapati song 'Dhagala Lagli' came out around this festival and 'Radhe Radhe' came out around Janamashtami.'Dream Girl' will see the actor beautifully transform into the skin of a woman, through his voice. His character named Pooja works in a female friendship call center. The film stars Nushrat Bharucha as the leading lady.
