Mill’s security man held for firing at cop

Ludhiana: Sadar Raikot police on Thursday evening arrested a security supervisor of a private mill after he allegedly fired at a cop inside a police post in Jalaldiwal.

The accused, identified as Fauji Jeet Singh of Tugal in Sudhar, worked at Oswal Mills. ASI Lakhvir Singh, in charge of Jalaldiwal police post, said on Thursday evening, a woman named Gayatri Devi, who worked as a labourer at the same mill, and her husband, Gagandev Mahatav, came to the police post with a complaint against Fauji. Gayatri, who lived with her family on the mill premises, said Fauji harassed her and used indelicate language with her after getting drunk.

The cop said when she was giving her complaint, Fauji came inside the police post and on seeing him the couple walked out. The cop questioned Fauji about the allegations and asked him to stop harassing the woman. He said Fauji replied that he would not let the woman live in the mill as she disobeyed him.

When the ASI told him that he could not do any such thing, Fauji, in a fit of rage, took out his pistol and fired at him. Luckily, the bullet missed its mark and hit the police post building’s wall. The ASI alleged that Fauji tried to fire another shot at him, but he and other cops overpowered him.

Fauji was arrested and a case under sections 307 (attempt to murder), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) of the IPC and under sections of the Arms Act was registered against him.

The ASI said a 32-bore pistol, four live cartridges, an empty cartridge and a motorcycle were recovered from Fauji, whose medical examination was conducted at Raikot civil hospital. The examination confirmed that he was drunk at the time of the incident.

The police official said Fauji was produced in a local court on Friday that sent him in judicial custody.
