Pakistan president accuses India of ‘hysteria’ following airstrike

Pakistan's President Arif Alvi said on Tuesday India has created "hysteria" in the wake of this month's attack on Indian troops in disputed Kashmir region.

Alvi warned that rhetoric "can lead to war" and that his country was ready to defend itself, during an address at an international conference on media and conflict.

His comments came after New Dehli's warplanes attacked a training camp in disputed Kashmir, which he did not address directly.

India said its jets struck a terrorist training camp, killing a large number of militants, although Pakistan has reported no causalities.

Pakistan's military spokesman Major General Asif Ghafoor tweeted that the Indian Air Force had violated the Line of Control, the de facto border between Indian- and Pakistani-administered Kashmir.

Jaish-e-Mohammad, a militant group based in Pakistan, claimed the February 14 attack that killed dozens of Indian troops.

Pakistan has denied any involvement in the bombing, which it says was planned and executed "indigenously".

India regularly accuses Pakistan of supporting radical groups who stage operations in Indian-administered Kashmir.

Pakistan denies supporting militants.

The Himalayan region has been divided between India and Pakistan since the end of British colonial rule in sub-continent in 1947.



They have fought two of their three wars over the region.
