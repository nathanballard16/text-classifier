DK Aruna, Vijayashanti Question KCR’s Silence On Mamata Episode

Hyderabad: Telangana Congress hit out at the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) party alleging that the ruling party won the recent Assembly elections via unfair methods.

Telangana Congress party campaign committee chairperson and actor Vijayashanti along with co-chairperson and former MLA DK Aruna on Monday spoke to the media at the latter's residence where they further alleged that the TRS intended to follow the same for the upcoming Parliament elections.

Vijayashanti pointed out Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao's silence in the West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's battle with CBI and the Centre.

She questioned as to why KCR was not supporting Mamata Banerjee, particularly after seeking her support for his Federal Front and further claimed that the Chief Minister's entire focus is to support Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the Centre.

In regard to the elections, the Congress leader spoke about the irregularities such as EVM tampering and voters being flooded with money.

Expressing confidence on Congress victory in the Parliament elections, DK Aruna also lashed out at the TRS, stating that the people will teach them a lesson in the upcoming elections if they indulge in misusing official machinery.

She said that TRS was again trying to fool the people by claiming that it will win 16 of the 17 Lok Sabha seats in the State. The senior Congress leader further pointed out that TRS failed to make the Centre implement even a single assurance given to Telangana in the AP Reorganisation Act.
