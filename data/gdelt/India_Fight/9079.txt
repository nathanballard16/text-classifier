Demanding a 'full-fledged state' status to Delhi, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)'s opposition to statehood for Delhi is a confession that Modi lied in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Launching an attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the chief minister said the people of Delhi will respond to lies and decades of deceit appropriately now.

The Aam Aadmi Party chief is going to sit on an indefinite hunger strike from March 1 over the demand.

"BJP's opposition to statehood for Delhi now is its confession that Modi ji lied to the people of Delhi in 2014 Lok Sabha elections. People of Delhi will respond to lies and decades of deceit appropriately now," Kejriwal said in a series of tweets.

LK Advani, as Home Minister, in August 2003 introduced a statehood for Delhi Bill in Lok Sabha, the chief minister said.

"Advaniji, as Home Minister, in August 2003 introduced statehood for Delhi Bill in Lok Sabha. Pranab da (former President Pranab Mukherjee) headed parliamentary committee endorsed it in December 2003, but it finally lapsed. Did they intend to just play with the emotions of people of Delhi? Why this injustice with Delhiites?, the chief minister asked.

"Yes, Delhi is India's national capital, so let the Centre keep entire NDMC area under its complete control. How can rest of Delhi, in which Delhiites elect their own government, be kept subservient to the Centre? No more injustice to be tolerated," Kejriwal added.
