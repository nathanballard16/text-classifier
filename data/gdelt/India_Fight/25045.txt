Rajneeti Podcast | Lok Sabha elections: Delhi, eastern Uttar Pradesh key for BJP in Phase 6

In the sixth phase of the ongoing Lok Sabha elections, people living in 59 constituencies across seven states and a union territory are casting their votes. Among these, the seven constituencies in Delhi and few in Uttar Pradesh are being closely watched.

In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had won all seven seats in Delhi; and 13 of the 14 UP constituencies going to polls on May 12. BJP President Amit Shah and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath have consistently expressed their confidence of repeating their 2014 victory.

Meanwhile, amid incidences of sporadic violence in various pockets of West Bengal, seven constituencies will also cast their votes in the sixth phase. The BJP has managed to be a prominent face in West Bengal and is hopeful on the basis of its victory in the 2018 panchayat polls.

Moneycontrol's Sakshi Batra chats with Moneycontrol's Deputy Executive Editor Gaurav Choudhary to take a closer look at the key battles in this phase.
