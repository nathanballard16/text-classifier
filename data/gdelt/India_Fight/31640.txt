Indian armed forces and paramilitary forces are seeking an exemption from the stringent vehicle pollution norms, that are going to take effect from next year, according to sources Officials aware of the development said that these waivers are likely to be granted, as per Hindustan Times India is set to welcome the new Bharat Stage VI (BS-VI) norms from April 1, 2020. The norms lay down tighter rules for exhaust emission requirements for vehicles compared to the BS-IV applicable currently.However, defence vehicles were given an exception from BS IV norms in 2016 and this could be repeated again. “They have conveyed that it will be difficult to procure new vehicles till 2019 and have said that the dispensation given to the army should also be given to paramilitary vehicles because their operational areas are also similar,” according to an official.Military vehicles in all the countries are exempted from stringent pollution control rules, “This is in part due to difficulty in assuring ultra-low sulphur fuel (10 parts per million) supply in all of the remote areas where a military vehicle might operate,” Anup Bandivadekar, passenger vehicles programme director, International Council on Clean Transportation told Hindustan Times Due to security reasons, there is no official estimate on the total number of such vehicles lined up for exemption. An official said that the army alone has about 150,000-160,000 terrestrial vehicles, such as SUVs, trucks and infantry combat vehicles.
