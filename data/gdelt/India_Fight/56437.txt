Delhi Court delays death warrant of convicts in Nirbhaya case

A Delhi court on Wednesday directed Tihar jail authorities to issue a fresh notice for one week to convicts of 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape-and-murder case, as to whether they want to file mercy pleas.

The development came after the Top Court dismissed the review petition of Akshay Kumar Singh- one of the four convicts and upheld the earlier judgement that awarded him a death sentence.

Unhappy over the judgement by the lower court, Nirbhaya’s mother Asha Devi broke down in court, “Wherever we go, we are told about the their (convict’s) rights, what about our rights?,” she said.

Expressing sympathy with Asha Devi, the court said that they had full sympathy with her but was bound to follow the law that now required fresh notices to be issued for the execution of the convicts.

The court has adjourned the matter till January 7.

The 23-year-old paramedic student was gang-raped and brutally assaulted on the intervening night of December 16-17, 2012 in a moving bus in the national capital.

One of the six men accused was a juvenile.

She passed away at Mount Elizabeth Hospital in Singapore while undergoing the treatment.
