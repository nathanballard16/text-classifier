Varanasi, April 3 : A Banaras Hindu University (BHU) student was shot dead in the campus premises in Uttar Pradesh's Varanasi, leading to tensions, police said, adding that four men have been arrested.

On Tuesday night, four bike-borne men opened fire at Guarav Singh near the Birla A intersection in the university campus, Circle Officer, Varanasi Cantt Anil Kumar Singh told IANS.

"It was a case of personal enmity," Kumar said.

Immediately after the incident, police raided the BHU hostels and surrounding area and nabbed the accused, he added.

The slain student was pursuing Masters in Computer Application and was jailed in 2018 for his involvement in a fight in December 2017. He was expelled from the college later.
