BJP playing with lives of soldiers in Kashmir: Karnataka CM – KashmirWatch

PTK reports from Indian occupied Kashmir

SRINAGAR, APR 5 (PTK): The chief minister of Karnataka HD Kumaraswamy accused BJP government of ‘playing with the lives of soldiers who was killed in Pulwama attack’.

While attacking the BJP of misleading people, JD(S) leader accused the government of ‘playing with the lives of soldiers’, furthermore told the audience to ‘not fall for the words’ of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

He said, “Today for their (BJP) sustenance, they’re playing with the lives of hundreds of soldiers. In the guise of protecting the nation, they’re misleading you. Do you need such a PM? I request you to not fall for the words of PM Modi.”

Moreover, he alleged how the votes are being ‘sought’ not in the name of ‘development’, but the ‘need of an able PM’ citing national security.

“Today why are we facing conflicts with our neighbouring countries? A retired military officer told me two years ago that they will cook up enmity between India and Pakistan before the Lok Sabha polls to mislead and seek votes from people. I had this discussion two years ago. He’s (Modiji) not seeking votes from you on the basis of development but they claim that the need of the hour is an able PM to protect the country.” (PTK)
