Brothers seek judicial probe

‘Our brother was caught and cruelly killed by police’

Siblings of C.P. Jaleel, who was killed allegedly in a police encounter at a resort at Lakkidi in the district on Wednesday night, have demanded a judicial probe into the encounter to reveal the truth.

Speaking to mediapersons here on Thursday, C.P. Rasheed and C.P. Jishad, Jaleel’s brothers, said they suspected the police encounter to be a fake one.

“We suspect that our brother was caught and cruelly killed by the police,” they said. “Usually Maoists don the olive green uniform when they interact with outsiders. But Jaleel was in casual dress at the time of the police encounter. In such a situation, we suspect that Jaleel had been arrested from somewhere else and the police shot him at the resort,” they said. There are rumours that Velmurugan, the Maoist who was with Jaleel, was injured in the encounter. If that was the case, the police should show humanitarian consideration to him, Mr. Rasheed, who was also a human rights activist, said.

Moreover, Jaleel had seven injuries on his body and the police did not allow the relatives or mediapersons to see the body till noon, he alleged said.

‘No bid to extort money’

What was the crime committed by the 26-year-old youth to award capital punishment. He was just a campaign squad member of the Communist Party of India (Maoists), Mr. Rasheed said.

It was not the policy of Maoists to extort money from anybody, but the police were spreading the news that the duo were trying to collect cash by threatening the receptionist of the resort. Such a propaganda was to defame the organisation, he added.
