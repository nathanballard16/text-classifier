Rape survivor critical, should be airlifted to Delhi: Swati Maliwal

The Delhi Commission for Women chief meets the Unnao rape survivor, writes letter to U.P. CM

Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) chief Swati Maliwal on Monday met the Unnao rape survivor at a hospital in Lucknow where she was admitted following a road accident on Sunday.

Stating that the survivor is in a “critical condition”, Ms. Maliwal said that the survivor should be airlifted to Delhi for treatment.

In a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, Ms. Maliwal demanded that BJP MLA Kuldeep Sengar, who is an accused in the case, be removed from the party and disqualified from the Assembly within 24 hours.

“The most shameful has been the fact that till date Kuldeep Sengar happens to be an MLA. Neither has he been removed from the party nor from the legislature. I appeal to you in the interest of humanity to ensure that he is immediately removed both as a member of the BJP and from the UP legislative assembly,” read the letter to the CM.

The women’s commission chief also alleged that Sunday’s incident was a “conspiracy” and not “a mere accident”.

“First her father was killed inside the jail, then an eyewitness in the case and now two of her aunts have been killed. Presently, she and her lawyer are battling for their lives in the hospital,” Ms. Maliwal wrote. She said while all the evidence hint at a conspiracy, the UP police are trying to brand the incident as a mere accident and is taking no steps to investigate into the matter.

Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a tweet, said: “Systematic attempts to eliminate the Unnao rape victim and her family appear to be a pre-planned conspiracy and mockery of rule of law. How can any civilised society allow such state sponsored barbarism? [sic].”
