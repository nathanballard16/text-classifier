Rahul Gandhi flays PM Modi, lauds Nyay in Gujarat rallies

Ahmedabad: Congress president Rahul Gandhi continued his attack on Prime Minister Modi on his home turf of Gujarat on Thursday. Addressing two public rallies in the state, Mr Gandhi said, “Modi ji had promised to deposit Rs 15 lakh in your account. Instead of depositing the money, he made you to stand in a queue by announcing demonetisation. Have you seen any of the industrialists standing in the queue?”

Mr Gandhi was addressing public meetings in Vanthali and Bhuj covering the Junagadh and Kutch Lok Sabha seats respectively. He will address another rally in Bardoli in South Gujarat on Friday.

Reiterating the benefits of the Congress’ Nyay minimum income guarantee scheme, Mr Gandhi said, “I asked my party’s think tank how we can help the poor. The think tank gave me a figure of Rs 72,000 and said that we can give this amount to 20 per cent poor families of the country. This scheme will create new employment.”

Targeting Mr Modi in his home state, Mr Gandhi again mentioned the Rafale deal and said, “Modi ji calls you ‘friends’ but calls Anil Ambani and Nirav Modi ‘bhai’.”

Promising a fisheries ministry if voted to power at the Centre, the Congress president said farmers will get a separate budget for farmers.
