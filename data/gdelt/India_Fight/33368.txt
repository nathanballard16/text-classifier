Karnataka Resignation Drama: Yeddyurappa lashes out at DK Shivakumar for 'tearing resignation letters'

"This type of activities (were) are going on in Karnataka. Today they thought that it is high time to come out of that party and resign from the legislator's post because they felt that continuing as MLA (is) not good in larger interest of the constituency and the state. So they have resigned," he said.

The BJP on Saturday said it is ready to form the government in Karnataka following fresh trouble in the ruling Congress-JD(S) government with resignations of 11 MLAs from the two parties and that party leader B. S. Yeddyurappa will be the Chief Minister.

Party leader and Chemicals and Fertilizers D. V. Sadananda Gowda told reporters that the MLAs have decided to resign as they thought it was not in the interest of the people of the state and their constituency.

"This type of activities (were) are going on in Karnataka. Today they thought that it is high time to come out of that party and resign from the legislator's post because they felt that continuing as MLA (is) not good in larger interest of the constituency and the state. So they have resigned," he said.

Asked if the next government will be that of BJP, Gowda said the Governor is the supreme authority as per the constitutional mandate.

"If he calls us, certainly we are ready to form the government as we are the single largest party. We have got 105 people with us," he said.
