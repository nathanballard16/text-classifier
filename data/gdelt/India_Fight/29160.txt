Noida (UP), June 9

Head of a private television news channel and its editor were on Saturday arrested here for allegedly broadcasting defamatory content against Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, say police.

The development comes after journalist Prashant Kanojia was arrested for tweeting a video of the same story, prompting a Twitter hashtag #ReleasePrashantKanojia.

The supposedly controversial content pertains to a news story that the channel aired on June 6. The video shows a woman speaking to reporters outside Adityanath’s office saying she had sent him a marriage proposal. Police claim that the channel aired the video without “verifying the woman’s claims”.

An FIR against Kanojia books him under Section 500 of the Indian Code (criminal defamation) and Section 66 of the Information Technology Act (hacking). The FIR says Kanojia, registered at Hazratganj police station on Friday night, claims he made "objectionable comments against the CM and tried to malign his image".

"This could have led to a possible law and order situation," Senior Superintendent of Police, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Vaibhav Krishna said.

The officer said investigations found that the channel did not have a licence to operate, he said.

The channel meanwhile has been booked for fraud, and forgery of documents.

"They have been arrested on both counts for the defamatory content as well as illegal operation of the channel," Krishna said.

The channel did not immediately comment on the development.

Condemnation

Meanwhile, Twitter was abuzz with condemnations over Kanojia’s arrest.

Editors Guild of India has also condemned the arrest.

“The police action is high-handed, arbitrary and amounts to an authoritarian misuse of laws. The Guild sees it as an effort to intimidate the press, and stifle freedom of expression.”

“Whatever the accuracy of the woman’s claims, to register a case of criminal defamation against the journalists for sharing it on the social media and airing it on a television channel is a brazen misuse of law. To give the police powers to arrest, provisions of Section 66 of the IT Act have also been added,” the Editors Guild said in a statement on Sunday.

“This is a condemnable misuse of the law and state power,” it added.

Here are some reactions.

UP police says @PJkanojia has been arrested under Sec 67 of IT Act (though there was nothing remotely 'obscene' or 'lascivious' in his posts on @myogiadityanath), Sec 505 of IPC (Read 505 to see how laughable this charge is https://t.co/xnfjLU6SiS) #ReleasePrashantKanojia 1/n — Siddharth (@svaradarajan) June 9, 2019

The entire RW eco-system was up in arms when a BJP worker was arrested by WB police for posting a meme on Mamata Banerjee



Where are they now when @PJkanojia has been arrested by UP Police for a sarcastic tweet against Yogi Adityanath?



Hypocrisy, much? #ReleasePrashantKanojia — Umar Khalid (@UmarKhalidJNU) June 8, 2019

if this is the FIR, it is a complete mockery of justice. section 500 of the IPC is non-cognisable. Section 66 of the IT Act applies to hacking and related offences. Section 66A pertaining to 'offensive messages' has been struck down by the Supreme Court #ReleasePrashantKanojia https://t.co/Qx9am5o39r — jatin gandhi (@jatingandhi) June 8, 2019

I strongly condemned the arrest of #PrashantKanojia @myogiadityanath There are many others things to do in UP, rather than tracking your criticism, It would be better if you have tracked increasing crime & Dalit Atrocities in UP. #ReleasePrashantKanojia https://t.co/VMwYaQW0rg — Dr. Nitin Raut (@NitinRaut_INC) June 8, 2019

Shocked to hear about the arrest of my friend, journalist Prashant Kanojia @PJkanojia by UP Police for a Tweet.



I demand his unconditional and immediate release. #IStandWithPrashantKanojia#ReleasePrashantKanojia — Ovais Sultan Khan (@OvaisSultanKhan) June 8, 2019

"The arrest is apparently over social media posts he wrote about UP chief minister Adityanath." This dictatorship needs to stop. #IstandWithPrashantKanojia#ReleasePrashantKanojiahttps://t.co/Bg0B677Myh — Nabiya Khan (@NabiyaKhan11) June 8, 2019

Journalist @PJkanojia has been picked up in Delhi by the UP police for a social media post

He is being taken to Lucknow, booked under Section 500 of the IIPC & Section 66 of the Information Technology Act

Aaj Prashant Kanojia.

Kal main.

Parson hum sab.#ReleasePrashantKanojia — Dr kafeel khan (@drkafeelkhan) June 8, 2019

Now consider danger of @uppolice using IPC 500 (criminal defamation). If the 'crime' is to be pursued by cops without @myogiadityanath filing complaint like an ordinary citizen, & you can be whisked away, then it's farewell to free speech in UP & India #ReleasePrashantKanojia 3/3 — Siddharth (@svaradarajan) June 9, 2019
