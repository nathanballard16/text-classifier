Dilip Kumar: Bombay HC relief for Dilip Kumar in Pali Hill property row, Real Estate News, ET RealEstate

MUMBAI: In a relief for thespian Dilip Kumar Bombay high court on Monday struck down an order of an arbitration tribunal directing the actor to give an undertaking to secure property worth Rs 25 crore in a dispute with a builder over his Pali Hill property. The dispute related to the builder claiming Rs 176 crore in damages from the 95-year-old actor for terminating a 2006 agreement to redevelop the Bandra bungalow.“Looking at it from any angle, the tribunal was wholly unjustified in directing Kumar to give an undertaking that he will not alienate or encumber or part with possession of the property which was subject-matter of the arbitration to the extent of Rs 25 crore till the proceedings are concluded. It was irrelevant whether the undertaking was in respect of specific property or any other unencumbered personal property belonging to Kumar,” said Justice Burgess Colabawalla.Kumar had signed a development agreement with Sharyans Developers in June 2006 to redevelop the property in Pali Hill that is spread over 2,056 sq metres. In 2010, Sharyans assigned its rights to Prajita Developers . As per the agreement, the builder would redevelop the property that will be shared with Kumar to the extent of 50%. Kumar was also to be paid Rs 10 crore by the developer. Prajita’s plea in the high court in 2015 to restrain Kumar from creating third-party rights in the property was dismissed.In August 2017, Supreme Court allowed the developer to withdraw Rs 20 crore deposited by Kumar after the possession of the property was handed back to the actor.The SC also appointed an arbitration tribunal to decide if there was a breach of contract and whether the developer was entitled to further damages.In an interim order in May 2018, the tribunal directed Kumar to furnish the undertaking. Justice Colabawalla held that the tribunal was not justified in seeking the undertaking without examining if there was any merit in the claim for damages. “This was wholly impermissible in law without first giving a finding whether such a claim had merit or otherwise, albeit prima facie,” the judge ruled and set aside the 2018 order.
