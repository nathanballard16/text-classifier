Rajnath Singh to reach Siachen today in first visit as Defence Minister; will interact with soldiers

He will first travel to the Siachen Glacier accompanied by Army Chief General Bipin Rawat.

Days after assuming office, Defence Minister Rajnath will visit the Siachen glacier on Monday and will interact with the Army’s field commanders and soldiers at the twelve thousand foot high post, in his first visit after taking charge. He will also be laying a wreath at the Siachen war memorial. The Siachen Glacier located in the Karakorum range is known as the highest militarised zone in the world where the soldiers have to battle frostbite and high winds. Avalanches and landslides are common at the glacier during the winters and temperatures can drop to as low as minus 60 degrees Celsius. Singh will also review security preparedness along the borders with Pakistan as well to take stock of anti-terror operations in Jammu and Kashmir.
