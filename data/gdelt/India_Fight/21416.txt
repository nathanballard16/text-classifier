J&K highway ban partially eased

SRINAGAR: Jammu and Kashmir government on Saturday partially eased the restrictions on civilian traffic movement along the Jammu- Srinagar national highway (NH-44). From Monday, the bi-weekly ban would be restricted only to Sunday and traffic will ply as usual on Wednesdays.In view of peaceful polls in Baramulla and Jammu on April 11 and Srinagar and Kathua on April 18, the government reviewed the requirement of security forces and decided to relax the ban.The restriction on civilian movement between Srinagar and Baramulla on NH-44 would now be limited only to Sunday from April 22. There would be no prohibition on civilian traffic on Wednesday.The restrictions would continue between Srinagar and Udhampur as earlier mandated, but the situation would be reviewed periodically and modifications made if necessary.The local administration would continue to facilitate traffic movement between Srinagar and Udhampur on Sunday and Wednesday, and between Baramulla and Srinagar on Sunday, as has been done in the last two weeks. Administrative officials and police will examine the possibility of allowing state transport buses to move on the highway even during the restricted period.A complete review of the highway ban would be done after the last phase of elections on May 6, to ascertain the need for continuing with the restrictions.On April 3, the home department had notified that civilian traffic would be banned every Sunday and Wednesday on the highway till May 31 to ensure safe movement of military convoys, as the state was receiving security personnel for the Lok Sabha polls as well as anti-insurgency operations. The ban came in the wake of the terror strike in Pulwama on February 14 and another attack on an Army convoy in Jammu’s Banihal in the last week of March.The move received flak from all quarters, after which the government made some exemptions to the ban, facilitating the movement of school buses, students appearing in examinations, tourists, government employees on duty, medical emergencies, hospital staff on duty, passengers flying by air, politicians out for campaigning, etc. Around 100 executive magistrates were deployed to ensure the smooth movement of military convoys as well as issue passes to exempted civilians using the highway.
