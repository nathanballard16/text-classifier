Unnao victim's family agrees for last rites

Unnao, Dec 8 : After lengthy discussions with the Lucknow Divisional Commissioner Mukesh Meshram and other senior police officials, the family members of the Unnao rape-murder victim have finally agreed to bury her body.

The family members earlier had said that they would not bury the mortal remains of the victims until, they met Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. The family said they will cremate her body only after the Chief Minister promises strict action against the perpetrators.

The sister demanded government job for one of the family members and immediate capital punishment to the accused. The father said that he wanted a 'Hyderabad-like punishment for the accused'.

The Chief Minister has already given a compensation of Rs 25 lakhs to the family and has promised a house under the Prime Minister Awas Yojna.

Leaders of the Samajwadi Party are present in the village and after the last rites; they will organize a condolence programme at the district headquarters.

A heavy deployment of police and Provincial Armed Constabulary has been made in the village.

The victim had passed away on Friday night after suffering 90 per cent burns.

She was set ablaze by five men on Thursday while she was on her way to Rae Bareli for a hearing of the rape case she had filed against the same men.

The family members have decided to bury her body instead of cremating her for the time being.

The father had maintained that the five men responsible for his daughter's death should be "chased and gunned down" like the Hyderabad case, where four people accused of raping and murdering a 26-year-old veterinarian were shot dead by the Telangana police.

The post mortem report of the Unnao rape-murder victim indicated that she died of extensive burn injuries. The victim suffered 90 per cent burns when five men dragged her outside the village, poured petrol on her and burnt alive.
