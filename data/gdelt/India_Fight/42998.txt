India committing genocide in IOJ&K, tells FM Qureshi to UN Human Rights Council

GENEVA (Dunya News) – While addressing the 42nd session of UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi Tuesday highlighted the Indian atrocities in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJ&K), and demanded the forum to form an independent commission to probe into the matter.

The foreign minister maintained that India has converted the whole valley into a jail, and Kashmiris are being imprisoned without any offense. There are grave threats to the lives of Kashmiris as genocide is being committed in IOJ&K, he warned.

India is refusing to give the right of self determination to the people of the held valley, and media and neutral observers are also highlighting the atrocities being committed there, he said.

The foreign minister quoted BBC which reported that Kashmiris are raising slogans, “Don’t beat us, just shoot us.” He also mentioned the report by The Independent which revealed India’s extreme brutality in the held valley and its wicked act of stripping the Kashmiris naked.

Shah Mehmood Qureshi reminded the dignitaries that it is not a flashback to medieval times, this is 21st century and all this represents breach of human rights by New Delhi.

He said people in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir are under subjugation and even reluctant to go to the hospitals. India is hiding the truth and has devised a nefarious plan to turn the Muslim majority into minority in IOJ&K, he added.

Shah Mehmood Qureshi affirmed that India’s move of August 5 to scrap the autonomy of the occupied valley is illegal under the international laws and flagrant violations of the human rights.

Kashmir is an internationally acknowledged dispute and New Delhi’s claim that it is an internal affair is false, he stressed. India is trying to shamelessly hide its atrocities and outright brutalities, he asserted.
