4, including 2 foreigners, held from Bengaluru for online scam

Four persons, including two foreign nationals, were arrested by Mumbai police from Bengaluru for allegedly cheating people online, an official said Monday.

The accused used to lure people through Facebook and other social media platforms by promising them valuable gifts which could be had by depositing "custom duty fees" online into a specified bank account, he said.

NM Joshi Marg police, which was probing a cheating case with the same modus operandi, found that a complainant had transferred Rs 68,500 into a Bengaluru-based bank account, the official said.

"A team from NM Joshi Marg police station reached Bengaluru and found that at least Rs 45 lakh had been deposited in this account from people across the country," he said.

The police team from Mumbai raided a house in Bengaluru and arrested four persons, two of whom are Africans, he said.

"The four were brought to Mumbai on Sunday and produced in a court here which remanded them in police custody till April 11. Further probe into the cheating racket is underway," he informed.
