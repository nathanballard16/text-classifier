North 24 Parganas: Vehicles belonging to Bharatiya Janata Party leader Mukul Roy and party’s candidate from Dum Dum Lok Sabha seat, Samik Bhattacharya, were on Thursday night allegedly vandalised by unidentified men in Nagerbazar area of North 24 Parganas district.

Bhattacharya and Roy were not present at the spot when the shocking incident took place.

Notably, campaigning ended at 10 pm on Thursday in nine Lok Sabha seats of West Bengal that will vote in the final phase of the Parliamentary Elections on May 19, 20 hours before the scheduled time.

It is the first time the Election Commission has curtailed the campaigning time by invoking the Constitution's Article 324.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had expressed her displeasure over the Election Commission's decision to curtail poll campaign in the state.

The EC's decision had come in the wake of violence between the BJP and the TMC in Kolkata during Amit Shah's roadshow on Tuesday.

In a similar incident that took place last week, a convoy of West Bengal BJP chief Dilip Ghosh and Assam minister Hemanta Biswa Sarma was purportedly attacked by Trinamool Congress (TMC) supporters in Purba Medinipur district’s Khejuri area.

The parliamentary constituencies in which elections will take place on Sunday are Kolkata North and Kolkata South, Barasat, Basirhat, Dum Dum, Jadavpur, Diamond Harbour, Jaynagar (SC) and Mathurapur (SC) seats.
