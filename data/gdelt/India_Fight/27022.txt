Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif & Sunil Grover’s stills from Bharat’s shoot in Abu Dhabi are piquing fans interest

Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif are all set to win over the audiences soon with their upcoming film Bharat. Helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar, Bharat has been making headlines from quite some time. Now that the promotions for Bharat are in full swing, director Ali Abbas Zafar has been sharing some shoot life stills on social media. After Salman’s BTS shots from the stunt scene, Ali shared stills featuring the Tiger Zinda Hai star, Katrina Kaif and Sunil Grover. In all the four stills, the stars can be seen shooting for Bharat in Abu Dhabi.

Ali shared photos on social media and the fans can’t seem to control their excitement for the film. In one of the stills, Salman and Katrina can be seen shooting together for the romantic song Chashni. While the song has been loved by the fans, it is the chemistry between Salman and Katrina that has impressed everyone. In another still, we get to see Sunil Grover and other artists standing on the deck of a naval ship clad in a purple uniform.

Katrina Kaif is seen in a white lehenga in the middle of the Abu Dhabi desert. While the fans can’t get enough of their favourite stars, Salman and Katrina are busy with promotions of their film. Yesterday, Salman shared photos of himself and Katrina gracing The Kapil Sharma Show. Talking about the film, Salman will be seen in five different looks from distinct timelines ranging from 1964 to 2010. Katrina also will be seen in a never before seen avatar. Bharat also stars Jackie Shroff, Disha Patani, Tabu and Nora Fatehi in pivotal roles. It is slated to release on June 5, 2019.
