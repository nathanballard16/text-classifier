A California man is sentenced to 20 years in fatal false-hostage ‘swatting’ hoax

Prosecutors say police responded to the home of 28-year-old Andrew Finch in Wichita on Dec. 28, 2017, after a caller falsely claimed to be inside with hostages and a gun — a style of prank known as “swatting.” Finch, unaware of the report, answered the door and was fatally shot on his porch by officers who had surrounded his home.
