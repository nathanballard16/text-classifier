Opposing Sajjan Kumar’s bail application, CBI compares November 1984 massacre of Sikhs with Genocide by Nazis

JALANDHAR: The Delhi High Court in its December 17, 2018 judgement had, while convicting and sentencing former Congress MP Sajjan Kumar on December 17, 2018, had held that the massacre of Sikhs in November 1984 amounted to “crimes against humanity”. The CBI has, in its reply filed in the Supreme Court to contest his bail application, equated the 1984 Sikh massacre with the Genocide of Jews by Nazis, Genocide of Armenians by Kurds and Turks and Genocide of Bangladeshis by Pak army.“That the present Appeal arises in reference to a ghastly incident that occurred on the morning of October 31, 1984 in Delhi, subsequent to which thousands of Sikhs were brutally murdered and their houses vandalized. The killings had taken place in pursuance to the provocative speeches made by the Applicant/convict against the Sikh community. The killing of 5 innocent Sikhs in this case was not a revengeful act but had taken place due to the hatred disseminated/spread by the Applicant/convict against the Sikhs,” reads para number 3 of the CBI reply.“The brutal murder of innocent Sikhs during the 1984 riots fall under the category of crimes against the humanity on parity with well known genocides worldwide like large scale killing of Armenians by Kurds and Turks, mass extermination of Jews by Nazis, mass killing of Bangladeshi citizens by the sympathizers of Pakistani army and mass killing during various ethnic riots within India also. In this case, the minority community was targeted by the spearheaded attacks of the dominant political actors like the Applicant/convict and duly facilitated by the law enforcement agencies. As such, this case has to be viewed in the larger context of mass crimes and requires a different approach than a case of normal murder/rioting,” the CBI reply reads further.Notably, in their judgement Delhi High Court justices S Muralidhar and Vinod Goel had held that mass killings of Sikhs answered the description of “crimes against humanity”.Senior advocate H S Phoolka, counsel for the complainant in the case, who provided a copy of the CBI affidavit, informed that the bail application of Sajjan Kumar was listed for hearing on March 25, 2019.The Delhi High Court order of June 17, 2018 mentioned Phoolka’s arguments on the issue of “crimes against humanity” for which he had also referred to the decisions of foreign courts and Tribunals.
