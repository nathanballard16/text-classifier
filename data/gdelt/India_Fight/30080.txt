Farah Khan to choreograph Akshay Kumar-Katrina Kaif's Tip Tip Barsa Paani

It's not very often that an actor gets to be a part of the redux version of one of his own hits. However, Akshay Kumar always paves the way and sets an example. The actor, who had romanced Raveena Tandon in Mohra’s Tip Tip Barsa Paani, is ready to feature in the reprised version of the song which will be shot next week for Rohit Shetty 's cop-drama, Sooryavanshi. This time around, his leading lady is Katrina Kaif , who has shot a similar-looking song with him a decade ago for the film De Dana Dan . The team of Sooryavanshi is gearing up for a long schedule in Hyderabad, and the number will be shot at Ramoji Rao Film City. immediately The original was choreographed by Rekha Chinni Prakash for Mohra, which had released in 1994. The song was composed by Viju Shah. Apparently, the new version will be choreographed by Farah Khan and composed by Tanishq Bagchi, who also created the redux version of Aankh Maarey.The choreographer-director will join the team after a short holiday with her kids, Anya, Diva and Czar, in the Maldives. Her kids are expected to be at the studio with her when she choreographs the number. The song will be shot on a grand scale while trying to up the sensuality quotient. Farah has already spent a few days designing the song's look, feel and the dance moves for the actors, who are currently in great shape. The original number is considered to be among the most sensuous romantic songs in Bollywood films. With Rohit Shetty helming the film, this song only promises to set the temperatures soaring when the cop drama releases on March 27 next year.
