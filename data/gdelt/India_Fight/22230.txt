Grandnephew Of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Attacked By TMC Goons While Filing Lok Sabha Nomination Papers

In an alleged attempt to intimidate and cause harm to political opponents, 1,000 TMC party workers reportedly attacked BJP candidate Chandra Kumar Bose who was on his way to file his nomination for South Kolkata constituency.

Chandra Kumar Bose is also the grand nephew of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose.

The attack which took place on Wednesday (24 April) has been dubbed as a predetermined plan to harm and grievously injure Bose.

Bose speaking to ANI said, “More than a thousand TMC goons had assembled at chief minister’s residence to attack us. While they were attacking us, the police were silent spectators. The sheer strength of more than 6,000 BJP workers made them retreat otherwise we would have been killed”.

Several BJP candidates contesting the 2019 Bengal Lok Sabha elections have said to have been targeted by the supporters of the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) party.

Some of the attacked candidates include Dum Dum Lok Sabha constituency contestant Samik Bhattacharya, Chandi Charan Rai (general secretary and BJP Kolkata North Suburban District) and Locket Chatterjee BJP's Hooghly candidate.

With reports of such clashes, the Election Commission deployed 194 companies of central forces to cover 80 per cent of the 5,000 booths in the three Lok Sabha seats.

Three of the seven phases of the Lok Sabha elections are completed and counting will take place on 23 May.
