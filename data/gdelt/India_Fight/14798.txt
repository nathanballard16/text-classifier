Saif Ali Khan shoots for a song as the antagonist in Ajay Devgn and Kajol starrer Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior

In Bollywood, at times, actors work together in one film and then for the longest time, don’t get an opportunity to star in one film again. Speaking of this, one example of such actors is Saif Ali Khan and Ajay Devgn. The two were seen together last in Vishal Bhardwaj's Omkara 13 years ago. Now, after 13 years, both Saif and Ajay have got a chance to work together on a film and it is none other than Ajay Devgn’s Taanaji: The Unsung Warrior. Interestingly, Kajol and Ajay will also be seen together in this period biopic based on Tanaji Malusare.

As per the report, Saif Ali Khan has started shooting for Taanaji with Ajay Devgn. As per Mumbai Mirror, Saif recently shot for a song in the film in Filmistan studio.

As per Mumbai Mirror, “t has been choreographed by Ranju Varghese, who has also directed another song in the film that features Kajol.”

As per the report, Taimur Ali Khan also dropped by on the sets of the song to meet his daddy. Taanaji will see Kajol and Ajay playing husband and wife on screen after almost 9 years. The two were seen in Toonpur Ka Superhero last which was a children’s film. They were seen on TV together on Koffee With Karan 6 but in films, it has been quite a while.

Amidst all this, Kajol also had shot for a celebratory song for the film in which she will be seen dancing among rangolis and decorations.
