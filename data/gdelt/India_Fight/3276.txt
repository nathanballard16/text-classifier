Check out Taran Adarsh’s tweet here:

In an interview with Bombay Times, Kangana revealed the reasons for taking up direction. She said, “After Queen (2014), I started to feel absolutely underutilised, and I had already decided that I wanted to direct. I even directed a short film. I thought Queen was just like a hobby film for everyone involved, as we all had a chilled out attitude. At that point, I started thinking that acting is not something for me and I must pursue direction, though I knew that I had to start from scratch. After, Simran I thought that I would get an opportunity but that didn't happen.”
