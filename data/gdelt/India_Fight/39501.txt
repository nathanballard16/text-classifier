Lok Virsa observes Black Day, condemns Indian atrocities

Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan in collaboration with National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) on Thursday observed Black Day on Indian Independence Day to convey to the world that India’s occupation of Jammu and Kashmir was totally illegal, unjust and contrary to the Kashmiris’ aspirations.

Lok Virsa screened documentaries on a large projector in the Heritage Museum Hall, highlighting the atrocities being committed by the Indian forces in Indian-held Kashmir (IHK).

A photographic exhibition showing a wide array of photographs that shed light on the plight of innocent Kashmiris, particularly pellet gun victims, including women and children, who suffered from injuries at the hands of Indian security forces in IHK, was also part of the daylong activities.

A large number of visitors watched the documentaries to express solidarity with the Kashmiri brothers.

The event was aimed to highlights atrocities committed by the Indian forces against the innocent Kashmiri people struggling for their right to self-determination.

Banners bearing slogans in support of the Kashmir cause were displayed at prominent locations at Lok Virsa premises, Shakarparian.
