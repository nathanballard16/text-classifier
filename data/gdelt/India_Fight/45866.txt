Patna Getting Ready for 'Ravan Vadh' at Gandhi Maidan

Patna: Patna is gearing up for the traditional 'Lanka Dahan and Ravan Vadh', the 'killing of the demon king Ravan' that is scheduled to take place at the historical Gandhi Maidan on October 19 to mark the end of the 10-day festival of Durga Puja.

With Bihar Governor Lalji Tandon and Chief Minister Nitish Kumar as the chief guests, the effigies of Ravan and his brothers would be burnt amidst dazzling fireworks that would last for nearly 45 minutes, Patna Dussehra Committee officials said.

On Saturday, workers were seen trying to put the finishing touch on the large effigies of Ravan, Kumbhakaran, and Meghnad who would be 'killed' by actors playing the roles of Lord Ram, Sita, Lakshaman, Bharat, Shatrughan, and Lord Hanuman in the presence of hundreds of thousands of people coming from all parts of Bihar to witness the spectacle.

Officials said Gaya artist Mohammed Zafar Hassan and his team is building the 70-feet effigy of Ravan. The height of Kumbhkarn and Meghnad is 65 and 60-feet respectively.

The event that ends with a grand spectacle of fireworks signifying the victory of good over evil involves more than 300 fireworks of different calibers coming from a factory in Kolkata, officials said.
