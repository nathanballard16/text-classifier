2 smugglers held with Rs 12 crore heroin

Ludhiana: The Crime Investigation Agency-II of Ludhiana police commissionerate arrested two drug smugglers after 2.40kg heroin worth Rs 12 crore was found from them near Shivpuri on Wednesday morning.

Shubham Bamb, 23, of New Kundanpuri and Abhishek Jain, 21, of Sundar Nagar, Daresi, were caught on a tip-off.

While Shubham is an orphan, Abhishek’s brother owns a hosiery unit.

Commissioner of police Rakesh Agarwal said, “At a checkpost near Buddha Nullah, close to Shivpuri, a silver Maruti Suzuki Dzire car (PB 10 BV 5773) was stopped. During checking, 2.40kg heroin, an electronic weighing machine and 90 empty pouches were found hidden in it. Following the recovery, its two occupants — Shubham and Abhishek — were arrested.”

Police said Shubham, who studied up to Class XII, earlier worked as a salesman at a clothing store in Madhopuri. “In October 2017, he was arrested by Hoshiparpur police in a case of carjacking, drug peddling, attempt to murder and under the Arms Act. Shubham had fired at cops when they tried to nab him in the carjacking case. He was lodged in Hoshiarpur jail for two years and came out on bail a month ago,” the cop added.

After coming out on bail, Shubham again started peddling drugs and Abhishek joined him to make easy money.

Assistant commissioner of police (detective) Surinder Mohan said, “The accused told during interrogation that a smuggler had delivered heroin to them near Ludhiana. Shubham sells heroin to his customers and drug peddlers as well. Sometime back, Shubham had bought the car to use it for smuggling drugs. The second-hand car was purchased in the name of a Hoshiarpur jail inmate’s wife.”
