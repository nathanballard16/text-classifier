CBI Jt Director issued summons in alleged torture case

The Kolkata police has sent a notice to CBI Joint Director Pankaj Srivastava to appear before the investigating officer at the Bhawanipur police station here within seven days in connection with a complaint registered against him last month.

The summon notice was sent to his office here on Thursday, said a senior officer. Based on the complaint lodged by Vaibhav Khattar, the CBI allegedly illegally detained and tortured him in a case in which he claimed he had no connection.

When contacted, a senior CBI official said: “We have not received anything from the Kolkata Police,” he said.

Khattar, an employee of a private mill in West Bengal, was raided by the agency in August last year in connection with multi-crore fodder scam .
