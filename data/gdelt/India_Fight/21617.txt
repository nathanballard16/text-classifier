Mumbai: Two police officials, who were attached with the MIDC police station in Andheri, were suspended after a departmental inquiry found them guilty of shielding an illegal dance bar operation. It was reported that sub-inspector Kalyan Narayan Ghadge and police naik Dattatray Narayanrao Ambore, of beat chowky-3, were not taking appropriate action against an illegal dance bar, Saroj Palace Bar, in Andheri.

Ghadge and Ambore failed to report the illegal activities at Saroj Palace Bar after the duo was directed by senior officers to keep a watch on the illegal activities happening in that area.

According to a report in Hindustan Times, the incident came into light on March 30 when a team of officials from the Anti-Narcotics Cell, Kandivli unit, led by deputy commissioner of police (narcotics), Shivdeep Lande, raided Saroj Palace Bar. During the process, the team found that the women in the bar were dancing in a provocative and vulgar manner.

Reportedly, as per the revised Maharashtra Prohibition of Obscene Dance in Hotels, Restaurant and Bar Rooms and Protection of Dignity of Women (Working therein) Act, 2016, obscene dances are not permitted in a dance bar and an employer permitting them would be held for three years.

The team further stated that they had arrested 15 people and four women working at the bar. They were taken to the MIDC police station and a complaint was registered against them,

Meanwhile, the suspended police officials claim that they have inspected Saroj Palace properly but, the team raided the area found that they have failed to provide thorough information on all the terms and conditions regarding the bar owner's licence or taking action against him.
