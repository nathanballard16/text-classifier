RSS brainstorming meet in Gwalior ahead of Lok Sabha polls

A three-day brainstorming meeting of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sanghs highest decision-making body 'Akhil Bharatiya Pratinidhi Sabha' will be held from March 8 in Gwalior with Lok Sabha polls high on the agenda.

The meeting will be attended by RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat, Sarkaryavah Bhaiyaji Joshi, members of central executive body of the Sangh and around 1,500 delegates from across the country.

"The meeting will review its programmes over the last six months and evaluate organisational works. Programmes for the next six months would also be chalked out," said RSS spokesperson Rajiv Tuli.

He said a resolution on contemporary situation of the country is also likely to be adopted after discussions.

State representatives of the RSS, heads of various bodies and other functionaries are due to attend the meeting that will conclude on March 10.

Bhagwat along with Joshi reached Gwalior on Sunday to take part in the event which would be held at Saraswati Shishu Mandir, Kedardham.

The meeting assumes significance as it comes amid tension between India and Pakistan that escalated after both the countries engaged in aerial hostilities along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir for the first time since 1971. This happened in the wake of February 14 Pulwama terror attack that killed 40 Central Reserve Police Force troopers in Kashmir.

During the aerial hostilities Indian Air Force's Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was captured by the Pakistani army after his MiG was shot down and fell in Pakistani territory during a dogfight. He returned to India on Saturday night after Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan announced in the National Assembly said that the IAF pilot will be freed 'as a peace gesture'.
