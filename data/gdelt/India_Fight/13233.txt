Five times Justin Trudeau made (bad) headlines

In December 2017, Canada’s ethics commissioner ruled that Trudeau had violated Canadian ethics laws with two all-expenses-paid trips to the Bahamas. The island was owned by the Aga Khan, spiritual leader of Ismaili Muslims (and a billionaire). Trudeau and his family took an undisclosed trip to the island at the end of 2016, and his wife took another in March of that same year. Trudeau tried to say that taking trips on a private helicopter to the island wasn’t a violation of the Conflict of Interest Act because he and the Aga Khan were friends, and public officeholders can accept gifts from friends. The ethics commissioner, Mary Dawson, wasn’t buying it; Trudeau and the Aga Khan had spoken once in 30 years before Trudeau became party leader. Her report said Trudeau violated four sections of the act — the first time a sitting prime minister had done so since it became law in 2006.
