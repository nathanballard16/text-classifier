QBullet: Uddhav as Maha CM; Activist On Way to Sabarimala Attacked

Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray will be the new Chief Minister of Maharashtra, heading a party-led government that will include allies NCP and Congress.

Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari Tuesday night invited Uddhav Thackeray to take the oath of office and secrecy at 6:40 pm on Thursday at the Shivaji Park in Dadar after he received a letter from the Maha Vikas Aghadi which stated it had the support of 166 MLAs.

“You may send me the list enjoys the majority support in assembly within the period of 7 days i.e. 3 December,” the letter from the Governor stated.
