Military clashes with militants leave 2 civilians dead in In...

(MENAFN) Officials say two young men were killed in Kashmir when government forces fired on anti-India protesters who thronged a village where soldiers were battling militants.



Police said Friday that the violence began overnight when Indian soldiers cordoned off the village of Khudwani on a tip that rebels were hiding there.



After fighting broke out between soldiers and militants, anti-India protests erupted in Khudwani and neighboring villages, with stone-throwing protesters marching toward the gunbattle.



The protesters were marching in solidarity with the militants and to help them escape the security cordon.
