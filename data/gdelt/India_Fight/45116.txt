A police team immediately rushed to the spot and rushed the victim to GTB Hospital, from where he was later shifted to Max Hospital, Patparganj. He is presently under treatment.

Police said initial probe revealed that the injured, as well as the accused persons, are residents of the same village and hail from Bulandshahr in Uttar Pradesh. Police said the firing incident was a fallout of an old enmity between the two parties.
