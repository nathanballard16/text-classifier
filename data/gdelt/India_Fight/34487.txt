NEW DELHI, July 13 (Xinhua) — At least six people were killed and around 900,000 affected by floods in India’s northeastern state of Assam, officials said Saturday.

“Nearly 900,000 people are affected in the recent wave of floods across 21 districts of the state,” a local government official said. “So far six people have lost their lives in the flooding.”

According to officials, several rivers including the Brahmaputra river, one of the largest rivers in the world, are flowing above danger due to incessant rains and water has inundated several places.

Authorities have pressed disaster response force personnel in the affected areas for search, relief and rescue operation.

“At present, 68 relief camps are operational, where affected people have taken refuge,” the official said. “Food items and drinking water bottles are being distributed among flood-hit people.”

Apart from flooding, landslides have also been reported that has affected the road and rail connectivity at several places.

“Train communication between Lumding and Silchar remains cut off due to landslide in Dima Hasao district and efforts are on to restore it,” the official said.
