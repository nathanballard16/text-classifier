Two Maldivians held in Chennai for smuggling drugs

CHENNAI: The Chennai zonal unit of Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) arrested two Maldivian nationals at city airport after they were found carrying 1kg of hashish concealed inside shampoo bottles.The duo — a man named Abdulla Aalim, 22, and a woman, Shamsiyya Mohamed, 24, have been arrested under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. They were on their way to Male via Colombo in a Sri Lankan Airlines flight.The hashish was found inside silver foil packets, which were stuffed into shampoo bottles of various brands, a NCB officer said. The drug has a huge demand in Maldives and the seized quantity could fetch Rs 50 lakh.Investigations are under way to trace the source of the hashish by backtracking and break the racket under operation. According to NCB sources, the duo had come into India more than 20 days ago, on July 23. They stayed in Trivandrum for a while and moved to Chennai last week, where they checked into a hotel in Egmore.On the directions of a handler in Maldives, the duo collected the hashish from a guy in Chennai and proceeded to fly back to their country of origin. As soon as NCB got a tip regarding this, surveillance was mounted on the duo.When they reached the Chennai international airport on Sunday to check-in their luggage, NCB officers intercepted them. The shampoo bottles raised suspicion as they were brand new, but did not have a seal.Hashish is obtained by extraction of cannabis and is used for smoking, vapourising or eating.
