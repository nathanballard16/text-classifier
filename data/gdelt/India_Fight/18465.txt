EC issues showcause notice to officers who banned book on Rafale

Day after members of the flying squad of the Election Commission (EC) banned the release of a book on the Rafale deal, the poll panel relieved them from election duty and issued a showcause notice.

Sources in the EC said the showcause notice was served to S Ganesh, Assistant Executive Engineer, Thousand Lights constituency, a Superintendent of Police and two constables who conducted raids at Bharati Puttakalayam, the publishing house. The action was taken based on the report submitted by the district election officer.

The election officials blocked the release of a Tamil book titled 'Rafale: The Scam That Rocked The Nation' in Chennai on Tuesday, citing violation of the model code of conduct.

However, following an uproar on social media, the ban on the release of the book was revoked by officials and the book was released in the evening.

Tamil Nadu Chief Electoral Officer (CEO) issued a statement denying the role of the EC or the CEO's office and said, "Regarding the seizure of books, neither the ECI, nor the CEO's office had given any instructions. I have directed DEO (district electoral officer), Chennai, to look into and give his report immediately."

The book was later released by N Ram, chairman of The Hindu, in the presence of author and social activist S Vijayan and PK Rajan, the editor of the publishing house. As the news of the ban trickled in on social media, the demand for the book shot up. The publishing house sold over 5,000 copies priced at Rs 10 each.
