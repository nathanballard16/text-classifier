During search, the police managed to arrest Sohan Kol (21), a key member of the inter-state Babuli Kol (IS 262) gang while the other two managed to escape during a brief exchange of fire,” the DIG added.The DIG claimed that the dacoits had planned to hide the slain bandit’s arsenal in a safe cave in the forest and were moving towards it when the police intercepted them and had an encounter. With the seizure of the three rifles, the fire power of the gang has been curtailed.He added that the recovered Springfield rifles were being carried by Babuli before his eliminations by the police.Police said several slain dacoits like Shiv Kumar alias Dadua, Ambika Patel alias Thokia, Ghanshyam Kevat, Swadesh Patel alias Balkharia and Babuli Kol had extensively relied on such guns to rule the badlands of Bundelkhand.
