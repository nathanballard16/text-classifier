Delhi CM critical of Modi politicising Pak-India tension

NEW DELHI: Chief Minister of Delhi and AAP leader Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday voiced his criticism of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi politicising the recent tension with Pakistan.



"Whatever happened after the Pulwama attack on India-Pakistan border and the way BJP's conduct was, which politicised it, it is causing damage to the BJP. There's a notion that it is helping it but it is not, at least not in Delhi," he told reporters here

Kejriwal further said he was told by several people that they were apprehensive of a Pulwama-like attack prior to the Lok Sabha polls.

"I am only saying what people told us... They told us that they were apprehensive for the last two years that they (BJP) will either foment a conflict over Ram Mandir or between India and Pakistan," he said.

The Delhi CM has been critical of Modi following the Pulwama attack, questioning how many bodies he needs to win the upcoming polls.
