New Delhi: Popular TV actress and emerging Bollywood star Digangana Suryavanshi, who has recently debuted in Tollywood with her movie Hippi, has penned down a note urging Honourable Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi to look into the serious water crisis in Tamil Nadu. The news of the horrible situation faced by the people due to the water scarcity in Tamil Nadu this year has gone viral like malignancy all over the world as famous Hollywood actor and environment-activist Leonardo Di Caprio has posted the news on his official Instagram handle and brought it to the light. In Digangana’s own words, “This is an alarming condition when all of us should step forward to prevent the terrifying water crisis of Tamil Nadu. Many thanks to @Leonardo Di Caprio to stretch this news to an international exposure! What more horrible is, according to environmentalists, a number of Indian cities, including Delhi, Bengaluru, Mumbai, and others will be out of ground-dip water and people will actually have to relocate from those places. It is high time for us all, irrespective of race, religion, nationality, skin colour and everything to work with hand in hand so as to fight out the forthcoming condition. I urge all the Governments and Non-Government bodies to think about on how we can fight out this severe water crisis @narendramodi sir” As many prominent faces of the country are stepping forward to make people aware of the recent water crisis of Tamil Nadu and the importance of saving water in the monsoon as well, we hope the situation will come under control soon and Government will take necessary action to prevent such devastating condition in future.
