Pulwama Terror Attack: Varun Dhawan-Shraddha Kapoor observe two-minute silence on ‘Street Dancer 3D’ sets

Varun Dhawan and Shraddha Kapoor are currently shooting in London for their upcoming film Street Dancer 3D with director Remo D’Souza. They even celebrated Valentine’s Day there, and unfortunately got to know the news about Pulwama Terror Attack there itself.

However doing their bit, the whole team stood in two-minute silence to remember the martyrs who laid their lives on the border. The attacks obviously hugely affected every Indian and many came forward to contribute in their own ways. While some paid the families of martyrs, the others prayed for them in silence.

The Pulwama Attack is not the first surprise attack on the Indian army. Back in 2016, an attack took place on the border of URI, post which India had a surgical strike over the attackers. A movie, URI, starring Vicky Kaushal, released in January this year, which happens to be the previous month.

Here, see how Varun, Shraddha and Remo paid their tribute with two-minute silence on their movie sets:
