John Abraham, Anil Kapoor to reunite first in Mumbai and then in London for Anees Bazmee’s Pagalpanti

Anil Kapoor and John Abraham will come together once again. The two were last seen together in Anees Bazmee’s Welcome Back. And this time again it’s for Bazmee’s Pagalpanti, which will go on the floor in the first week of February. The film is an out-and-out comedy and is expected to be a laugh-riot. According to an insider the film will be shot first in Mumbai and then over a period of 50 days in London and Leeds. An insider says, “The film will go on floors early February. Bazmee will first complete the Mumbai schedule and then the film will commence shooting in London. It will be a month-long shoot there. We are looking at releasing the film this year.” The film cast has also been revealed. Apart from Anil and John, the film also stars Arshad Warsi, Pulkit Samrat, Urvashi Rautela and Kriti Kharbanda and is slated to release this year.

It may be noted here that it is the same film that was earlier titled Saade Saati, but the title has now been changed to Pagalpanti. The story revolves around John’s character that brings bad luck to whoever he comes in association with. John and Anees had last worked together on Welcome Back. However, Anees and Anil go back a long way and have teamed up on several hits and superhit films earlier. Some of their films together include No Entry, Welcome, Welcome Back. The last film that the two had done together was Mubaarakan, that also starred Arjun Kapoor in a double role.

Meanwhile, Bazmee himself has been multitasking and juggling between multiple projects including Aankhen 2 and a sequel to Ready.
