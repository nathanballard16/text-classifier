Despite Pulwama attack, no change in China’s stance on Masood Azhar

BEIJING: The dastardly attack on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama by Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM) notwithstanding, China signalled on Friday that it would not change its stance on Masood Azhar, head of the Pakistan-based terrorist organization.At a media briefing here, the Chinese foreign ministry made it clear that it would not support India’s efforts to persuade the 1267 Committee of the UN Security Council to list Azhar as a global terrorist. As a permanent member of the Security Council, China has repeatedly blocked India’s bid to list Azhar as a global terrorist, saying there is no consensus in the top group of the world body on this issue.“I could tell you that the 1267 Committee of the Security Council has a clear stipulation on the listing and procedure of the terrorist organisations,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said, adding, “JeM has been included in the Security Council terrorism sanctions list. China will continue to handle the relevant sanctions issue in a constructive and responsible manner.”“China has noted the reports of the suicide attack. We are deeply shocked by this attack. We express deep condolences and sympathy to the injured and bereaved families,” the spokesperson said, adding, “We firmly oppose and strongly condemn all forms of terrorism.”The ministry chose its words carefully saying it is opposed to “all forms of terrorism” instead of specifically condemning the attack in Pulwama.The Chinese response came only after questions were raised at the regular media briefing of the foreign ministry. There was no specific response from Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi as one would have expected after a series of friendly meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese president Xi Jinping last year.The foreign ministry indirectly appealed to both India and Pakistan to avoid an altercation on this issue. “We hope the relevant regional countries will cooperate to cope with the threat of terrorism and jointly uphold regional peace and stability,” Geng said.There was no sign of meetings between Indian diplomats and Chinese officials on the Pulwama attack.China’s official media including Xinhua news agency described JeM as a Pakistan-based terrorist organization in its reports about the Pulwama attack. But there was no mention of Azhar.
