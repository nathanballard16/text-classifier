Pakistani Fighter Jets Never Entered Indian Air Space After Balakot Strike - IAF Chief

The Pakistan Air Force claimed to have dropped the H-4 Stand-Off Weapon (SOW), a precision-guided glide bomb, on 27 February while retaliating for the 26 February Indian airstrike on Balakot, Pakistan, reportedly to destroy the facilities of the terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which had been implicated in a 14 February suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir state.

Following the retaliatory strike, Pakistan military spokesperson Major Gen. Asif Ghafoor claimed the PAF set out to execute the attack in a way to "make sure that there was no collateral damage".

Nevertheless, the air force chief marshal's statement completely contrasts with the information provided by the Indian External Affairs Ministry, which at the time had lodged a strong protest over the "unprovoked act of aggression by Pakistan against India earlier today (27 February), including by violation of the Indian air space by Pakistan Air Force and targeting of Indian military posts".

Pakistan had reportedly downed two Indian aircraft while the pilot, who managed to eject from MiG-21 Bison, was released a few days later in what Islamabad described as a "peace gesture".

India, however, confirmed the loss of only one of its warplanes and claimed that its downed MiG-21 Bison jet had shot down a Pakistani F-16 during the aerial combat. Pakistan denies having lost any of its fighter jets.

Tensions between India and Pakistan heightened in mid-February, when a total of 40 Indian soldiers were killed by a JeM suicide bomber in Jammu and Kashmir state's Pulwama district. The Indian government vowed to avenge the terror attack, accusing Islamabad of harbouring JeM terrorists. However, Pakistan's government has categorically denied this claim on several occasions.
