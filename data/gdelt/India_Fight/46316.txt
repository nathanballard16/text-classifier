'Now I feel accepted as daughter of India': Wife of Sqn Ldr Ravi Khanna after his name engraved on National War Memorial

The wife of slain Indian Air Force (IAF) personnel Ravi Khanna, whose was engraved on the National War Memorial in Delhi, said on Sunday that now she feels "accepted as a daughter of India," almost 30 years after her husband was killed by separatist Yasin Malik-led Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) in 1990.

The Indian Air Force (IAF) has engraved the name of Squadron Leader Ravi Khanna on the National War Memorial in Delhi, ANI reported, quoting sources. The decision was taken in the last week of September by the Air Force.

The names of personnel killed in action are provided by the respective services to the National War Memorial and they are then put up on the walls there along with the detail of action in which they had laid down their lives.

Nirmal Khanna thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Indian Air Force (IAF) for acknowledging it as a real tribute to the Squadron Leader.
