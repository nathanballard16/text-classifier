Lock-up escape: Two cops suspended, 2 sent to lines

Two years ago, a `molestation' case of a research student of a premier technical institute highlighted how even socially and educationally privileged women can fall victim to post-rape trauma. The student was drugged and raped (according to doctors) by a staffer, but she refused to undergo a formal medical test and told the police that it was better if she were not to know what had happened to her while she was unconscious. The accused was convicted for molestation, prompting experts to say that societal attitudes need to change if survivors of sexual violence are to get justice. The student, who was 28 years old at the time of the incident (see box), was found sedated at the staffer's residence in the institute's staff quarters. “She told me that if she were to undergo a test and the medical report confirmed rape, she would bear the `guilt' of being raped throughout her life and would forever live in trauma,“ said a woman police officer who handled the case.The student filed a complaint of molestation after the police convinced her to do so, enabling the arrest of the staffer, who was then 57.
