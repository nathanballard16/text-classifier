NDRF battle rough sea to shift pregnant woman from Shiyal Beyt

RAJKOT: A pregnant woman from Shiyal beyt island in Jafrabad taluka of Amreli district, who was expecting delivery a month later, had to be taken in emergency to Rajula hospital in a boat by a team of coast guard NDRF and district administration amid the rough sea on Wednesday after she developed labour pains suddenly. Hansa Baladhia (34) successfully delivered a premature, but healthy baby in the hospital on Thursday.While the district administration had already shifted all pregnant women, whose delivery dates were due in this week, to safer places, Baladhia wasn’t among them as her due was still a month away. Shiyal beyt island has a population of 4,000.However, when she started having labour pains, the health officer on the island took a decision that Baladhia needed to be shifted to a hospital before she delivered her baby, as transporting the newborn along with the mother later will be difficult in the emerging weather conditions.Amreli district collector Aayush Oak said, “The coast guard and NDRF team were confident that the woman can be shifted safely to Rajula hospital in a boat. The team had three boats — one was local while the coast guard and the NDRF had one each. The two boats escorted the boat carrying the woman safely to the shores. According to the doctors at the hospital, both mother and child are healthy, he added.
