: The Supreme Court has modified its earlier order giving interim protection to P Chidambaram from judicial custody and instead agreed to hear Tuesday his plea against arrest by CBI in the INX Media case The apex court advanced its hearing from September 5 after Solicitor General Tushar Mehta on behalf of the investigating agencies sought modification of the order passed earlier in the day, saying it would cause jurisdictional difficulty in its implementation.Before lunch on Monday, the apex court bench of justices R Banumathi and A S Bopanna ruled that if Chidambaram's request for interim bail was not considered by the trial court when his remanded ended, he could stay in CBI custody for three more days.The court also asked Chidambaram's lawyers to file a regular bail plea in the trial court hearing the matter when he would be produced before it during the day.The bench passed the interim order after senior lawyer Kapil Sibal had argued that Chidambaram should be given interim protection from judicial custody - ie, Tihar jail - till the top court decided his petition against the arrest."I beg of you. A 74-year-old man cannot be sent to Tihar jail. After all, his liberty is at stake . Give interim bail or put him in house arrest, " Sibal said.The senior lawyer also argued that Chidambaram was sent to Tihar jail under judicial custody, his petition would become infructuous.After the order was passed giving the former minister interim protection from judicial custody, Solicitor General Mehta came rushing to the court post lunch to make his submission.The bench then said it would hear on Tuesday Chidambaram's plea challenging the non-bailable warrant (NBW) against him and remand orders of the trial court in the INX Media case and that the CBI was at liberty to move the trial court for his custody.The FIR against Chidambaram was lodged by CBI on May 15, 2017, alleging irregularities in FIPB clearance granted to INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of Rs 305 crore in 2007 during Chidambaram's tenure as finance minister. Thereafter, ED lodged a money laundering case in 2017.He has been in CBI custody for the last 12 days , after being arrested a day after the Delhi High Court struck down the anticipatory bail provided to him in the case.
