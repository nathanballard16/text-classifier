AGARTALA: At least 24 people, including two border guards, were injured when BSF resorted to baton charge on villagers allegedly for trying to help smugglers in despatching cows to Bangladesh last night at Putia village of Sonamura in Sepahijala district.

The official report said the BSF found some people cows were cutting the wire fencing along Indo-Bangladesh border and tried to stop them.
