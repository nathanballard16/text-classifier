Home Minister Rajnath Singh blamed the “Pakistan-based, Pakistan-backed” elements for the “dastardly” attack. On February 15, 2019, the Indian government withdrew the Most Favoured Nation status given to Pakistan in 1996. Agencies said this move will hurt Pakistan’s exports to India which stood at $488.5 million in 2017-18.
