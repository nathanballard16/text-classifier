People Share Hilarious School Time Stories That Prove Those Were The Best Days Of Our Lives

Some of the best memories we recall are undoubtedly from our school days. Homework, class tests, free periods and late nights spent cramming long answers, there's so much that takes us back to the good ol' school days.

These are memories that now bring a smile to our faces. May be it's true what they said: school is the one part of life we’ve have plenty of good memories of.

No matter how many times teachers told us our class was notorious--something we heard each year--it was great fun annoying our teachers. It's almost as if we knew these days wouldn't come back.

So for the sake of that sweet nostalgia, we asked 11 people what their craziest school time stories are. Here's what they answered.

1. “On a rainy day my principal saw me playing in the playground while English period was on. She noticed that my shoes had gone from white to brown. She promptly asked me to take them off and keep them in her room. I did as I was told. And as I sat in class, I couldn't help but wonder how ingenious this plan was because that way I had to sit in class the whole day unable to move."

2. “My principal while taking rounds entered my class and woke me up. I had slept off during a history lesson. The whole class couldn’t stop laughing for at least five minutes while I had an embarrassed smile on my face.”

3. “My principal used to commute on a two-wheeler everyday. When he punished the entire class for barely nothing, my friends and I punctured the vehicle. She kept trying to figure out who did it but got nothing. It was the best day ever.”

4. “I lit a firecracker in front of principal’s room but, unfortunately, I was caught while doing it. She came out after the noise and made me stand in front of the room with my hands up, wishing me happy Diwali.”

5. “My principal caught a note which was meant for my crush. She came up to me and politely asked me who the girl is. She then called her and handed the same to her in front of me. I ran like a donkey.”

6. “My principal sat in our classroom as a substitute one day. We had nothing to do as she told us to bring books from the library and read quietly. However, I decided to start eating my lunch. She quietly walked up to me, took a bite and walked away. We both smiled at each other while the whole class kept reading.”

7. "Like every other principal, even my principal had fun making us stand in the assembly for hours as she spoke god knows what. She saw me yawning and asked pointing at me, 'Is it too boring?' I didn't know what to say because I didn't listen to a word."

8. “I remember for some unknown reason my skirt was longer than the recommended length at school. My principal came up to me and said.... 'I love your lehenga.' Let's just say I've never got my skirt altered so quickly.”

9. “I was a national level debater and my school was the host for the debate. Everything was going well, till it was my turn. I gave my speech, strong argument and emotions and all. Then the opponent came on stage. He and I locked horns and were very close to a fist fight on stage in front of 500 students. The same 500 students also witnessed my school principal chiding me the next day at assembly and expressing his disappointment. It did not matter then because I had won the debate taken the trophy home."
