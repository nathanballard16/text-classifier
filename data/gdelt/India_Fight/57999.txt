Haryana fitness trainer files plaint

Surat: A fitness trainer from Haryana has filed a police complaint against four persons, who own a facility for physical exercise and a trampoline park, alleging that carelessness by them has resulted in serious injuries to her. Surat police have registered the case which has been transferred from Haryana where the fitness trainer is based.

Shweta Mehta, 26, was in Surat for a photo shoot on September 6. She was taken from this facility after the photo shoot to trampoline park at Bhimpore on Dumas Road, she says in her complaint being investigated by Dumas police.

At the trampoline park, which was not inaugurated that time, she took a pit jump and fell on concrete ground. Shweta suffered three fractures in her neck. She was treated in Surat for some time before returning to her home in Haryana.

Police have booked trampoline park owners Kapil Nandvani, Rajat Mahendra, Indra Punvani and Vikas Dang in this connection.

A police officer said, “She suffered injuries after the fall and trampoline park owners paid for her treatment. Park owners spent Rs5 lakh on her treatment in a local hospital. If she hadn’t received timely treatment, it would have been life-threatening for her. We have started investigations in the case.”
