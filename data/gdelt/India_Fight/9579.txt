Many popular television celebrities have reacted to the news of the Indian Air Force (IAF) bombing terror camps on Tuesday (February 26) at multiple locations across the Line of Control (LOC) in Pakistan The move comes 12 days after Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group carried out the dastardly Pulwama attack in Kashmir.Lauding the attack, reality show host Karan Kundrra tweeted, "How’s the Jaish now??? #Balakot salute the #indianairforce"Sharing similar sentiment, Karanvir wrote, "We destroyed the jaish bombed Balkot. Now the Bal is in their Kot. #godbless the #indianairforce #jawans #BharatMataKiJai"The same was Mahadev actor Mohit Raina 's reaction, who wrote, 'Jai Hind' on his social media account.Here's what other popular TV celebs tweeted:Government sources on Tuesday said the IAF's Mirage 2000 fighter jets pounded the terror camps in Balakot, Muzzafarabad and Chakoti.Indian Foreign secretary held a press conference on air strikes at 11.30 am, today, and in one of his statements, he said, "Credible intelligence was received that JeM was attempting another suicide terror attack in various parts of the country, and the fidayeen jihadis were being trained for this purpose. In the face of imminent danger, a preemptive strike became absolutely necessary."He further added,"The Government of India is firmly and resolutely committed to taking all necessary measures to fight the menace of terrorism. Hence this non-military preemptive action was specifically targeted at the JeM camp. The selection of the target was also conditioned by our desire to avoid civilian casualties. The facility is located in thick forest on a hilltop far away from any civilian presence."
