SC proposes retired judge to probe Hyderabad encounter

New Delhi, Dec 11 : The Supreme Court on Wednesday said it proposes to appoint a retired Supreme Court judge to conduct an inquiry into the Hyderabad 'encounter' involving four persons allegedly accused in the rape and murder of a veterinarian.

Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said the court had initially asked former Supreme Court judge P.V. Reddi but he had declined to be involved in this inquiry. The apex court emphasised on an independent inquiry into the matter.

The Telangana government said it has complied with an earlier apex court judgement which laid down guidelines in encounter cases.

The apex court also asked the state to propose the name of a former judge and said it will conduct further hearing in the matter on Thursday.

The Supreme Court earlier agreed to hear a petition against Hyderabad Encounter on Wednesday.

A bench headed by Chief Justice S.A. Bobde said it will also examine what is being monitored by the Telangana High Court.

The petition filed by two lawyers on Saturday seeks registration of FIR against cops and an independent probe into the matter, where four accused, in the rape and murder of the Veterinarian doctor in Hyderabad, were allegedly killed in an encounter.

Petitioners G.S. Mani and Pradeep Kumar Yadav seek directions for the registration of an FIR against the cops and then an investigation by CBI, SIT, CID or team of police officials from other state to conduct the probe into the encounter.

The petition urged the apex court that an independent investigation agency must be directed in accordance with the guidelines laid down in connection with investigation (the PUCL Vs State of Maharashtra) in fake encounter killing.

The petition alleged that it was stage-managed encounter to shield the alleged lapses committed by police, which led to the commission of the gruesome offence of rape and murder.
