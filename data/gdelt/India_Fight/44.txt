Five people were killed and many others injured in a fire that broke out in a food processing factory under Bochaha police station on the outskirts of Muzaffarpur in Bihar.

The injured were rushed to Sri Krishna Medical College and Hospital (SKMCH) in Muzaffarpur.

A search has been launched for the missing workers in the Tirhut Food Pressing Unit at Wajitpur-Chaknarain.

The bodies were sent for postmortem at SKMCH.

The fire broke out in the wee hours of Tuesday when around 25 workers were sleeping on the second floor of the factory.

Locals claimed that they heard loud sounds at small intervals.

The exact number of casualties is yet to be ascertained.

Muzaffarpur district magistrate Mohammad Sohail said, “Five bodies were recovered so far but the toll could rise after the debris was cleared. “

He said an ex gratia of Rs 4 lakh each would be given to the families of the deceased.

The injured workers, who were admitted to SKMCH, were said to be in a critical condition.

“When I woke up I heard screaming of my colleagues. I jumped out of the window from the second floor as there was fire all around,” said Riju Baitha, a worker.
