Ready to talk to whoever wins Indian election: Fawad Chaudhry

Pakistan is prepared to talk to whoever wins the elections in India, Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said Wednesday.

In an interview with Hindustan Times, the information minister said the government of Pakistan wants to normalise its relations with India.

Pakistan’s leadership believes talks with India are not possible until India’s election process is completed.

“Pakistan hopes the election process is completed peacefully and whichever government comes to power, we will sit with them and see how things can move forward. It is obvious that the atmosphere that developed post-Pulwama and the tensions are not in the interests of the people or the region,” he said.

Chaudhry said that Pakistan behaved very responsibly after the February 27 aerial battle with India.

“From the Pakistani side, there never was any war frenzy. We tried to reduce the retaliation, we have actually behaved very responsibly.”

The information minister said that Pakistan wants to open the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib in Kartarpur for Indian Sikh pilgrims for the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak in November. Pakistan will continue its efforts to operationalise the Kartarpur Corridor, he said.
