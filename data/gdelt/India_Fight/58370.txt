‘Why Muslims Haven’t Yet Killed Prime Minister And Home Minister’: Tamil Nadu Congress Leader Nellai Kannan

Nellai Kannan, a veteran Congress leader known for his rabble rousing speeches, waded in to yet another controversy as a video of a speech delivered by him at a gathering of Muslims saying, “Why Muslims have not yet killed Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah,” went viral .

Kannan made these remarks while addressing an anti-Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) rally organised by radical Islamist outfit Social Democratic Party of India (SDPI) in Tirunelveli. His remark was lustily cheered by the hundreds of Muslims who had gathered for the protest.

Kannan also went on to say "If his (Amit Shah’s) story is finished then the story of the PM would also be over. I was expecting something to happen, but no Muslim is doing it."
