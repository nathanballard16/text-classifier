Israeli tech firm sued by WhatsApp for 'using' its app to spy on scribes, activists

NEW DELHI: The central government said on Thursday it had asked WhatsApp to explain how the Israeli spyware “Pegasus” had been used to infect the phones of many Indian human rights activists, lawyers and journalists to spy on them and how the company would protect the privacy of Indians.The response, articulated by IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad , came after a storm generated by the Facebook-owned messaging platform’s revelation that 1,400 people had been targeted worldwide, including in India, by surveillance technology so invasive that it can read and transmit the entire content of a phone as well as operate its camera.WhatsApp did not name the entities behind the clandestine surveillance attempts but the Israeli company NOS Group, which developed the technology, has said it sells “Pegasus” only to vetted governments and their agencies.“The government of India is concerned over the breach of privacy of citizens of India on the messaging platform WhatsApp. We have asked WhatsApp to explain the kind of breach and what it is doing to safeguard the privacy of millions of Indian citizens,” IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad tweeted on Thursday. The government has sought WhatsApp’s response by November 4.Ministry of home affairs officials, responding to charges from the opposition Congress and NCP that government agencies had conducted the high-tech surveillance, said statements about the breach of people’s privacy were “an attempt to malign India” and “completely misleading”. It also promised strict action against anyone found responsible for a breach.Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala had earlier urged the Supreme Court to take suo motu cognisance of the “brazen and blatant illegal hacking of telephones and introduction of spyware by BJP government agencies and conduct a court-monitored inquiry”, while Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had tweeted that the government asking WhatsApp about Pegasus was like Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking Dassault Aviation who had made money in the sale of Rafale jets to India.Those targeted in India were people of similar persuasion, mainly human rights activists, lawyers and journalists fighting for or speaking out for tribals, Dalits and people fighting the government in court.They included Bela Bhatia , a human rights activist in Bastar, Chhattisgarh; former BBC journalist Shubhranshu Choudhary; Nihalsing B Rathod, who represents several people in the Elgar Parishad case; Degree Prasad Chouhan, a rights crusader for Dalits and adivasis; Anand Teltumde, a writer, academic and civil rights activist; and Sidhant Sibal, a TV journalist covering foreign affairs and defence. WhatsApp had contacted these people by sending them special messages to warn them their devices and been compromised.The snooping scandal was revealed after WhatsApp had filed a case in California’s Northern District federal court on Tuesday against the NSO Group saying the Israeli company had developed the software used to infect 1,400 “target devices” with malware and illegally obtain information from WhatsApp users without their knowledge. The social messaging platform said at least “100 members of civil society” had been targeted across four continents and that the number may grow.Will Cathcart, who heads WhatsApp, said in an OpEd in the Washington Post that his company had first detected this new form of cyberattack in May 2019 and that it exploited a vulnerability in the app’s video-call option.Cathcart said they were “certain” about NSO’s involvement because “we learned that the attackers used servers and Internet-hosting services that were previously associated with NSO”. He added that WhatsApp had also managed “to tie certain WhatsApp accounts used during the attacks back to NSO”. He said the attack was “highly sophisticated” but the attackers’ attempts to erase their tracks had not been successful.The University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab, which assisted WhatsApp’s investigation said the attackers used “operators” and that the one for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Brazil and Hong Kong was named “Ganges”.The technology involved is so high-tech that the target for surveillance would not even have to answer a call. A simple video call that went unanswered would be enough for the attacker to transmit the malware into the targeted device. The injected software would then be capable of secretly transmitting the phone’s contents to the attacker and of manipulating its camera and recording functions.That 100 human rights activists, journalists and others were targeted “should serve as a wake-up call for technology companies, governments and all Internet users,” Cathcart said in the Post. “Tools that enable surveillance into our private lives are being abused, and the proliferation of this technology into the hands of irresponsible companies and governments puts us all at risk,” he added.NSO responded to the furore by saying, “In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today’s allegations and will vigorously fight them. The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime. Our technology is not designed or licensed for use against human rights activists and journalists. It has helped to save thousands of lives over recent years.”It said strongly encrypted platforms are often used by paedophile rings, drug lords and terrorists. “Without sophisticated technologies, law enforcement agencies meant to keep us all safe face insurmountable hurdles. NSO's technologies provide proportionate, lawful solutions to this issue," it said. NSO said any use of the product other than to prevent serious crime and terrorism was a misuse.“We take action if we detect any misuse. This technology is rooted in the protection of human rights… and that's why we have sought alignment with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights…,” it said.
