There is anarchy in West Bengal under Mamata's rule: BJYM chief Poonam Mahajan

New Delhi [India], May 14 (ANI): There is anarchy in West Bengal under the regime of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, said Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) president Poonam Mahajan here on Tuesday.

"There is anarchy in the state under the rule of Mamata Banerjee, but the BJP will continue fighting against the anarchist government in the state," said Mahajan at a press conference here.

Referring to the Supreme Court's order to release of BJP worker Priyanka Sharma, arrested for posting a morphed picture of Banerjee on Facebook on May 10, Mahajan said: "Her arrest is a matter of serious concern."

"TMC workers are indulging in hooliganism and anarchy. The state police are also helping them. Our workers are even murdered in West Bengal," she said.

Commenting on the Supreme Court's order, she said: "The apex court has asked for an apology and we will abide by the court. We thank the apex court but direction of apology is a wrong message on the question of free speech."

"We will fight against Mamata Banerjee who has said that the Constitution is in crisis. In her own state, there is anarchy. We are also concerned about the people of West Bengal," she said.

The lawyer representing Sharma also spoke at the press conference. "The manner in which Priyanka Sharma was arrested was wrong. She was not produced before a judicial magistrate within 24 hours," said the lawyer.

"She was remanded 14 days to judicial custody. The top court has released her because the manner in which she was arrested has been held incorrect. The apex court has clarified that apology is not conditional to Priyanka Sharma's release," said the lawyer. (ANI)
