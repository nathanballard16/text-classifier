One arrested for abducted boy’s murder in Azamgarh

VARANASI: The Azamgarh police on Thursday arrested one Ravi Kumar for killing Sachin Yadav (15) after kidnapping him for ransom.Police also recovered a muffler and an axe which was used to kill Sachin. Ravi was closely associated with Sachin’s father Santosh Yadav and so he very well knew that Yadav could pay the ransom amount of Rs 10 lakh easily.SP Azamgarh Triveni Singh said that while investigating Sachin’s murder case after kidnapping police had taken many persons including Ravi into custody for interrogation. During interrogation, Ravi confessed his crime.Sachin, a native of Fattanpur village, was kidnapped by Ravi late on March 26. Around 9.40 pm his mother Sangeeta received a call where abductors had demanded a sum of Rs 10 lakh as ransom to release him. Sachin’s father Santosh immediately reported the matter to the police. However, before police could succeed, the abductors killed Sachin and dumped his body in Fattanpur village outskirts.Singh said that Santosh had returned home from Mumbai after selling a property there against the payment of Rs 70 lakh. Santosh had spent the maximum amount of money on construction of his new house in Fattanpur while remaining amount was deposited in his bank account. Singh said that due to being closely associated with Santosh his friend Ravi prepared a plan to abduct Sachin for ransom.To execute this plan, Ravi initially stole a mobile phone of a villager and inserted a sim-card purchased on fake identity to make calls for demanding ransom. On suspecting that he would be caught Ravi initially tried to strangulate Sachin and later attacked him with axe.
