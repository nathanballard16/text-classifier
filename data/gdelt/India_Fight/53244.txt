Avalanche hits Army patrol in Siachen, 2 killed

NEW DELHI: Two soldiers were killed after their patrol was hit by avalanche in the southern part of the forbidding Siachen glacier in the early hours of Saturday. This comes soon after another four soldiers and two civilian porters were killed in an avalanche in the northern glacier on November 18.The Army on Saturday said the two soldiers from Ladakh Scouts were killed when the avalanche hit their "link patrol" between two posts at an altitude of 18,000-feet. "An avalanche rescue team, which was following the patrol, immediately rushed and managed to locate and pull out all members of the patrol," said an officer."But two of them - Naib Subedar Tsewang Gialshan and rifleman Padma Norgais - succumbed," he added. Over 1,000 Indian soldiers, including over 35 officers, have lost their lives in the Siachen Glacier-Saltoro Ridge region since April 1984, when India's Operation Meghdhoot pre-empted Pakistan's Operation Ababeel to occupy almost all the dominating heights from 16,000 to 22,000-feet by a whisker.
