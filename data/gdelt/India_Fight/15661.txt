Watch: Jackie Chan visits Dubai Police in La Mer

Yesterday, movie superstar Jackie Chan was spotted at beachside suburb La Mer, where he checked out Dubai Police’s Smart Police Station.

The Rush Hour star was spotted getting a tour of the facility by Saeed Al Janahi, the director of operations at Dubai Film and TV Commission. He was briefed about the services provided by the autonomous police station, and the 64-year-old was also introduced to the Dubai Police's newest high-tech supercar, Ghiath.

The Smart Police Station in La Mer opened in October 2018 and is the second one for the Dubai Police (their first is in City Walk). It does not need any human intervention to run and operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

Chan is in town shooting his next film Vanguard, in which he reunites once again with Hong Kong action director Stanley Tong. This will be their sixth collaboration together. The duo were in the emirate a few years ago, chasing around supercars in Business Bay and filming a martial arts scene at Atlantis, The Palm back in 2015.

London, Taiwan and India are among the other filming locations for the film, according to IMDB. Details are scarce about the film but we know it will deal with an international security company who are hired to protect a Chinese businessman and his daughter from a shadowy terrorist group.

Teen heart-throb Yang Yang and actress/model Miya Muqi are among Chan’s co-stars.
