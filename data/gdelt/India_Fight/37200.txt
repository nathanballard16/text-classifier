Varun Dhawan’s committed to fitness

Varun Dhawan seems to be a stickler for discipline, especially when it comes to fitness. The actor, who works out regularly at his workout station in a suburban gym, never misses his daily work out. Even when there is pouring rain in Mumbai, one sees him striding off to flex his muscles and do his cardio exercises. The actor carries his gym equipment to his outstation shoots as well.

“It was raining pretty badly, but Varun made sure that he not only came to his gym, but also posed for pictures for the paparazzi as well as some fans before hitting the gym. When he is shooting at a remote location, he gets his basic workout regime complete by installing the basic equipment he needs at the shoot location, like he did during the shooting of Kalank, which required him to be in top shape,” says an industry source.
