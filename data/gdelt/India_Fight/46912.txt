The SP, along with the SWAT team in-charge, formed two teams and sent them to Mehrupur and Raje Sultanpur to wait for Yadav. Around 7.30 am, Yadav and an associate was seen coming on a bike. When police tried to stop them, they opened fire. While the one riding the bike managed to escape, the person on the pillion ran into the paddy fields.”

When the firing stopped, the field was combed and Lakshman Yadav was found dead with a bullet injury. A .32 bore pistol and another of .315 bore were recovered from his possession,” he added.
