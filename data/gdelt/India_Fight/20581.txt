Mumbai-based logistics and crane rental company ABC Infra Equipment has purchased the first new 70m truck mount, from Bronto Skylift, in India.

The sale represents a general trend of higher city buildings globally and therefore equipment like the 70m working height S70XDT.

Praveen Sharma, managing director at ABC Infra Equipment, commented, “There is increasing demand for such high-reach aerial platforms and at present the population of such machines is very low. We believe there is an un-tapped market for these machines.”

Sharma added that tall buildings and factories are an increasingly common sight in India, while the S70XDT is suited to large industrial plants, refineries, shipyards and general construction work too.

“The safety awareness in India has increased by leaps and bounds in the past ten years. Also, our customers feel using such platforms will boost efficiency and productivity.”

ABC chose Bronto after seeing its firefighting equipment being used successfully in Mumbai. Sharma says, “Also, they have supplied around 100 units in India. This gave us the confidence to go ahead with Bronto.” The company also bought a 62m working height S62MDT in 2016 when tit moved into truck-mounted sector.
