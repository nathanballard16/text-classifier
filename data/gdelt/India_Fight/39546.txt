J&K: Army kills 3 Pak soldiers in retaliatory fire, denies claims on Indian casualties

At least three Pakistan Army soldiers were killed in the Indian security forces’ response to the unprovocative firing from across the border. Pakistan violated ceasefire in Uri and Rajouri sectors of Jammu and Kashmir on Thursday.

Calling as “fictitious”, the Indian Army also denied the Pakistan military’s claim of killing five Indian soldiers during a cross-border firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in J&K.

The unprovocative firing from the Pakistani side began on the day India is celebrating its 73rd Independence Day. The Indian Army befittingly retaliated to the ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops.

The three Pakistani soldiers who were killed in the ceasefire violations have been identified as Naik Tanveer, Sepoy Ramazan and Lance Naik Taimoor.

The Indian Army has also denied the Pakistan Army’s claims that five Indian soldiers died in the ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC).

India’s response came after Pakistan Army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor accused the Indian Army of “increaseing firing” along the Line of Control to, he said, “divert attention from precarious situation in Jammu and Kashmir”.

Asif Ghafoor claimed that five Indian soldiers were killed and bunkers were damaged in the firing.

He tweeted, “In efforts to divert attention from precarious situation in IOJ&K, Indian Army increases firing along LOC. 3 Pakistani soldiers embraced shahadat. Pakistan Army responded effectively. 5 Indian soldiers killed, many injured, bunkers damaged. Intermittent exchange of fire continues.”
