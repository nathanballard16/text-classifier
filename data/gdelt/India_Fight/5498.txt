Bollywood star Sanjay Dutt, who is busy shooting for multiple upcoming projects, is presently stationed in Jaipur, Rajasthan. The actor is shooting for the upcoming film Panipat, which stars Arjun Kapoor in the lead. As the actor will be in the Pink City for a month due to his shooting schedule for the film, he has been skyping with his children Iqra and Shahraan every day.

“Sanjay won't be able to spend time with his twins or celebrate any occasion with then because of his shoot. Since they miss him, Maanayata is making sure that the actor skypes his children post his shoot after dinner every day,” A source told DNA.

Not just chit-chat, the report reveals that Sanju has also been enacting scenes from his upcoming film – Panipat. The Bollywood star has been performing some of the action scenes he has shot for the film, for his twins, Iqra and Shahraan. Isn’t Sanju the most awesome father ever?
