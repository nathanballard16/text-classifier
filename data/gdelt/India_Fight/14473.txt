Mumbai: Appropriate clearances by the fire safety department are necessary for all kinds of events held at outdoor venues as was proven true by a recent tragedy which has come to light from Gujarat. A wedding party held in Surat earlier this year turned tragic when either a firecracker or a drone came in contact with a high-tension cable causing burn injuries to several guests. The worst injuries were incurred by a Kandivli-based businessman Devendra Jain whose rear side was scalded as the result of the formation of an electric arc during the wedding procession.

Speaking to Times of India, Jain said that he had gone to Surat in Gujarat along with his family on January 29 to attend the wedding reception of a relative. The function was held at a resort about 30 km outside Surat, said Jain who was with the groom's party.

Jain recalls that there was a high-tension cable near the entrance of the resort. The incident took place at around 7 pm when the procession halted at the entrance of the resort in order for the bride's family to welcome us, he said. It is difficult to ascertain but either firecrackers which were being burnt at the time or one of the two drones which were hovering over the wedding procession came into contact with the high-tension cable leading to "a loud sound and a flash of light".

As a result, Devendra suffered 45 per cent second degree deep to third-degree burns on his entire back and lower limbs. He was shifted to a hospital in Mumbai and had to undergo as many as three surgeries in addition to seven procedures and several skin grafts.
