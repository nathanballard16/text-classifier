Proposal to seal Karnataka-Kerala border along Dakshina Kannada district

BENGALURU: In 2016, when US President Donald Trump during his election campaign spoke of constructing a wall along the US-Mexico border to prevent criminals from entering the US, it found few takers.Karnataka urban development department minister UT Khader has proposed a similar wall to seal the state's border with neighbouring Kerala, along the Dakshina Kannada district.The four-time Congress MLA, also the Dakshina Kannada (D-K) district in-charge minister, has tasked the deputy commissioner (DC) of D-K to prepare an action plan of constructing “modern” gates at as many as 20 different border crossing locations.Reason: The minister believes, the little known, smaller border crossings between the two states cutting across villages are allowing anti-social elements to commit crime in Karnataka and escape through or into Kerala.Spelling out his ideas, while speaking to TOI, Khader said one of the prime reasons for the idea to install these modern gates with closed circuit television cameras (CCTVs) is the spate of political murders that occurred in D-K in the last few years.“Where do you think these guys, who committed the murders, went? They slipped through Kasargod and into Kerala. We have been facing a serious threat from nefarious activities over the last few years including the trouble of vehicles being lifted, drugs mafia, illegal mining material exported and truck loads of illegal sand being ferried across the smaller border crossings,” he said.Khader said the plans to seal the borders with Kerala are being worked with the district officials and the police.There are as many as 20 small and big border crossings between D-K and Kerala.The minister said the bigger challenges will be the borders that connect the big towns in D-K including Sulia and other locations.On whether discussions have been held with Kerala on this issue, Khader said: “We are ready to hold talks with Kerala on this matter, as it will be beneficial to have a check on border crossings for both states.”Khader said the expenses for raising these gates and CCTV cameras will be met with the funds received from the reclamation and rehabilitation (R&R), allocated to each district by the state government.The minister said the DC is in the advanced stages of preparing the plan of action.“Once it is done, we will present it to Kerala and also to our cabinet to take the next step,” he said.
