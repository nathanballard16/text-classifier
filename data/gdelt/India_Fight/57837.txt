COIMBATORE: While the district mahila court is getting ready to deliver the judgement in the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl on Friday, the victim’s mother on Thursday filed a petition in the court, claiming that though the forensic report mentions that semen from two men was detected, police has arrested only one.The girl had gone missing on March 25 from her home in Thudiyalur . Her body was found near her home the next day. Seven days later, police arrested K Santhoshkumar, 34, a native of Uliyampalyaam near Thondamuthur , for raping and murdering the girl.Semen samples taken from the body were sent for forensic test. Forensic result released on November 11 confirmed that semen from two people was found, including that of Santhoshkumar.A group of lawyers had informed the victim’s mother about the forensic report. “We conveyed the information to the mother on Wednesday and she agreed to file a petition before the court. The judge told us that she will order a detailed investigation,” senior Madras high court lawyer P Rathinam told reporters.The investigation agency failed to conduct detailed investigation to nab the other perpetrator, said S Balamurugan, lawyer and national council member of the People's Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL). “We came to know about the controversy just a few days ago. It is a major flaw,” he said.The state government has appointed special public prosecutor U Shankara Narayanan to argue the case.
