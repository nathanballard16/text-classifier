How delayed justice after hate crimes in India worsens religious divisions

Zainul Ansari was killed on a fall day last year, when a religious procession in Sitamarhi during a Hindu festival turned violent. The crowd — which police estimated numbered a few thousand — clashed with the procession as it tried to detour into a Muslim neighborhood. A rumor that Muslims had thrown stones at the procession had enraged the crowd. The 82-year-old was on his way home when he came upon the mob, who beat him with sticks and then set him on fire.
