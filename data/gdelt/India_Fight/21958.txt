Lok Sabha Election 2019: Jaipur, Mewar royals make history

Rajasthan's history is going to witness a new chapter during these elections. With BJP's Diya Kumari deciding to fight from Rajmasand, members from the Mewar and Jaipur royal families have started meeting each other.

These meetings are being considered significant because these two families have been staying poles apart since they fought battles with each other about five hundred years ago.

In order to start her campaigning, Jaipur's Rajkumari Diya Kumari reached Mewar to seek blessings from former Maharana Mahendra Singh Mewar. Both the families met at Samorbag and talked for about 30 minutes. However, following this they did not meet the media. But it has been learnt that the Jaipur royals have sought support from their Mewar counterparts.

Jaipur's Maharaja Mansingh, who was the general of Emperor Akbar's army, had fought battles with Mewar's Maharana Pratap. Since then these two families have chosen to their own ways. Political parties have been trying to get mileage out of this rivalry between the two families. In this context, it is to be seen how such renewing of relations may help BJP candidate Diya Kumari in these polls.
