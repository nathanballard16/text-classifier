Road rage row: Cops warn of rumours on social media

GHAZIABAD: A day after members of two communities clashed at a temple in Dasna, Ghaziabad police on Monday booked unidentified persons for allegedly spreading rumours on social media platforms that had fuelled the violence. Cops said efforts were also on to nab priest Yati Narsimhanand Saraswati for organising a panchayat at the temple.On Sunday, some members of the two communities — Yadav and Gujjar — called for the panchayat at the temple to settle the three-week-long contention over a road rage case, but the situation went out of control as people from both the sides pelted stones at each other and also damaged several vehicles passing through the area.According to the police, the rumours on social media that a resident of Bamheta village in Ghaziabad was killed by Acheta villagers and two residents of Acheta village had been murdered in retaliation led to both sides resorting to violence on Sunday.Shlok Kumar, SP (city), said police were taking the rumours very seriously. “We have lodged two FIRs under the IT Act at Sihani Gate and Kotwali police stations against unidentified persons for allegedly spreading the rumours against the residents of both the villages. We are also conducting several raids to arrest the culprits,” he said.The SP (city) has warned villagers against conducting any panchayat to settle the matter without informing the district administration and the police.Meanwhile, Nand Kishore Gujjar, Loni MLA, said that he has written a letter to the district magistrate to intervene in the matter and resolve it as soon as possible. “I have also demanded strict action against those responsible for spreading the rumours,” he said.Naresh Kumar Singh, SHO of Masuri police station, said a gunner provided to the temple priest following a life threat some months back, have been removed. “We are looking for the priest and Bamheta resident Anil Yadav for violation of CrPc 144. The duo had called the meeting in violation of Section 144 of CrPC,” he said.The trouble between the two communities started on August 24 when a member of one community was thrashed in a road rage case.
