According to Assistant Commissioner of Police (crime) Shamsher Singh, on Sunday, when Prabsharan was returning from work, he received a panic-stricken call from his mother. He immediately called his father but Sukhbir was out for some work.

"After receiving Savinder's call, Prabsharan rushed and reached home at 7.50 p.m. He knocked at the door of her bedroom on the first floor of the bungalow. But it was locked from inside. While he was beating the door, Sukhbir too returned home at 8 p.m." Singh said.

They broke the door and found Kaur lying unconscious on the sofa with two blunt injuries on her head. They immediately informed the police who took her to a hospital where she was declared brought dead, said Singh.

The post-mortem report confirmed the injuries as cause of death, he said.
