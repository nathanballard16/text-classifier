Authorities are keeping an eye on the Krishna River in the Andhra Pradesh region to see if it goes over its banks. Former Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu's house on the banks of the Krishna River has flooded.

In the Karnataka state, authorities rescued 677,000 people from flooded areas. Authorities opened the Hirakud Dam in Sambalpur.

India deployed the army, navy and air force to work alongside local emergency personnel on search-and-rescue missions.
