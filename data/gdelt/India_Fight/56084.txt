Around the World in 500 Words — THE BAGPIPE

Marine archeologists around the Falkland Islands have recently uncovered the remains of a German cruiser, the SMS Scharnhorst, which was sunk on December 8, 1914, during World War I. German Vice-Admiral Maximillian Graf von Spee and 800 other sailors were killed when the British sunk the ship.

Archeologists have been searching for the wreckage of the German ship for the past five years, according to the BBC. Before being sunk, the ship had been involved in fighting off the coast of Chile during the Battle of Coronel.

“Suddenly she just came out of the gloom with great guns poking in every direction," archeologist Mensun Bound said. "As a Falkland Islander and a marine archaeologist, a discovery of this significance is an unforgettable, poignant moment in my life.”
