Shahid, Deepika, Yuvraj and Anushka all set to become neighbours

Hindi film superstar Shahid Kapoor has two adorable kids in Misha and Zain with wife Mira Rajput. The family of four have apparently decided to move into a bigger apartment and if reports are to be believed, the Kapoors are all set to be neighbours with B-Town’s most famous couple Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh.

However, there is a catch. As per ETimes, although Shahid and Deepika will share the same neighbourhood, they won’t be living in teh same building. The star studded neighbourhood is also home to Yuvraj Singh and Anushka Sharma.

The Kapoors currently occupy a beach-facing apartment in Juhu and will move to a sea-facing duplex in Worli.

The duplex is over 8000 sq feet in area which according to Mumbai Mirror, is idea for Shahid who is looking to move into a place that will comfortably house his family of four.

“I have taken a new home in Mumbai’s Central. Our family is growing with two children and I need a big house. Now our needs are changing and I wanted a home where Misha could play with children of her age and could spend a normal childhood,” Shahid had said earlier.

Still enjoying the record breaking success of ‘Kabir Singh’, Shahid could be next seen in the remake of ‘Jersey’, a super hit Telugu film.
