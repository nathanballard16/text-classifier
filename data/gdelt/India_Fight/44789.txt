Bookie shot dead in Ghaziabad

A 41-year-old bookie was shot dead over a monetary dispute by his acquaintance at Perm Nagar in Loni, police said on Tuesday.

The incident took place around 11 pm on Monday night, they said.

Superintendent of Police (Rural) Neeraj kumar Jadaun said Nafees Qureshi was called by Raja Qureshi at Nehru Park.

Nafees, along with his son and relatives, reached there.

Raja, along with his eight accomplices, reached there on three bikes.

Nafees welcomed him warmly and sent his journeyman Zuber to bring cold drinks for them.

Raja and his accomplices consumed the soft drinks and started firing indiscriminately at Nafees.

The victim received seven bullet injuries.

Raja threatened Zuber with dire consequences if he disclose his name to police.

Nafees was immediately rushed to the GTB Hospital, Delhi, where the doctors declared him brought dead.

Police had raided the office of Nafees Qureshi on August 8, recovering number slips and Rs 93,000 in cash.

The SP said Raja Qureshi had a criminal record.

Three years ago, he had allegedly killed a municipality contractor at a saloon near the Balram Nagar gate.

Sonu, the son of Nafees Qureshi, has lodged an FIR against Raja and others under Sections 302 and 307 of the IPC.

Police is raiding hideouts of Raja.

The possibility of extortion could not be ruled out, Jadaun added.
