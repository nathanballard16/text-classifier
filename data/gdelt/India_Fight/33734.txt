'Statistically, I shouldn’t be a doctor': Woman becomes first female Native physician in N.D. Guard

When Ciceley graduated from high school, she enlisted in the military, then followed in her mom’s footsteps and enrolled at USD.

She gets where she wants to go, her mom said. “I see her do that all the time, setting a goal and figuring out the steps that need to be taken to reach that goal. And then there she goes.”

In February 2003, Ciciley’s phone rang in the middle of the night.

Her little sister called, and Ciciley could barely understand what she was saying through the sobs. Her oldest brother, Anthony Wolfname Jr., had been stabbed in the heart and died from the wound. When then 21-year-old Ciciley returned home to the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, yellow caution tape surrounded the bloodied footprints on the white snow where her brother had tried to run for help.

Then three years later, Ciciley’s phone rang again.

Her second oldest brother, Shawn Wolfname, was beaten to death when he got in a fight over a bottle of whiskey with two men, who were later convicted. That second call was the same, Ciciley said. It was the middle of the night, and her little sister could hardly muster the words.
