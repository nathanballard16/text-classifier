On the north campus of Delhi University, a protester said a group supporting the ABVP beat up the agitating students

Holding placards and posters, students took out processions and candlelight marches and sat on dharna at IIT Bombay, IIT Kanpur, Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Hyderabad Central University, Delhi University, Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc), Pondicherry University and IIM Bangalore.

Students of several prestigious institutions have joined the campaign against the amended citizenship law and the attacks on students.

The student’s association of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) issued a statement to condemn the “violent brutal” attack on students and urged the elected leaders to be accountable to constitutional values.

“It is disheartening to see the ruling party, which boasts of protesting against the might of the 1975 national emergency, has resorted to brutal state-sponsored police repression against students, not even sparing hostels and libraries. It is time we held our elected leaders responsible to the values enshrined in the Constitution,” said the statement.

On the north campus of Delhi University, a protester said a group supporting the ABVP, the student wing of the RSS, beat up the agitating students.

“Police remained a mute spectator when ABVP members were attacking the students. They came in large numbers with lathis and attacked us,” said Dipsita Dhar, a student and the all-India joint secretary of the CPM-backed Students Federation of India.

She said the SFI held protests on the campuses of the Hyderabad Central University, Pondicherry University, TISS Hyderabad, the Babasaheb Bhimrao University in Aurangabad and several colleges in Kerala and in Tamil Nadu.

In IISc Bangalore, students held a protest holding placards to reject the National Register of Citizens (NRC) and the recent amendment to the citizenship law, a research student said.
