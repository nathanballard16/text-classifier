AICWA to Sushma Swaraj, PM Modi: Cancel visas of Pakistani artists

In the wake of the terrorist attack in Pulwama, All Indian Cine Workers Association (AICWA) has requested Minister of External Affairs Sushma Swaraj and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to cancel visas of Pakistani artists working in India and deport them to Pakistan.

In a letter addressed to Mrs Swaraj, President Suresh Shyamlal Gupta wrote that the association condemned the Pulwama terror attack and that it was about time that India stopped Pakistanis from performing in India and earn remuneration from the country.

“Nation comes first, we stand with our nation,” read the closing line of the letter.

The Pulwama terror attack, that happened on Thursday, took lives of at least 40 paramilitary personnel. A 19-year-old local Kashmiri boy, who has been identified as Adil Ahmed Dar, perpetrated the ambush by ramming his explosive-laden Scorpio car into a CRPF convoy of 78 buses. His SUV reportedly hit the fifth bus of the convoy.

Pakistan-based terror outfit Jaish-E-Mohammed claimed the responsibility of the ghastly attack. Adil, he claimed in a pre-recorded video, had joined the Jaish last year. It has been reported that he was making continuous visits to the terrorist organization’s headquarters in Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan.

Earlier today, Pakistan PM Imran Khan denied his country’s role in the Pulwama terror attack and asked India for evidence. He also warned India of retaliation if it launched an attack on Pakistan. His comments have met with negative reactions from India.
