CM asked to relinquish Home portfolio

The Revolutionary Marxist Party of India (RMPI) has asked Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan to relinquish the Home portfolio in the wake of the death of four Maoists after an alleged encounter at Manjakkatti in Palakkad district recently.

N. Venu, State secretary of the RMPI, told the media on Tuesday that seven Maoists had been killed in fake encounters in the State after the Left Democratic Front government led by Mr. Vijayan came to power in 2016.

In the recent case, one Maoist activist was shot dead while he was having food. Discussions were on with mediators for their surrender. Mr. Venu alleged that the decision to shoot them was a political one which flouted the guidelines of the Supreme Court.

Leaders of the CPI as well as local leaders of the CPI(M) and adivasis had busted the claim that there was an encounter between the anti-Naxal force and the Maoists. The arrest of two students from Kozhikode under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act too was part of the attempt to muzzle dissenting voices, Mr. Venu said.
