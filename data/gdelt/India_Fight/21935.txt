Assisted by the Indian mission, many of the expats working in country have come home.

Meanwhile, the Islamic State claimed responsibility via its news agency Aamaq, and named seven of the alleged attackers. Ruwan Wijewardene, the state minister of defence, told Parliament that the bombings were in "retaliation" to the Christchurch attacks in by a white supremacist.

Wickremesinghe also warned citizens of a possibility of more terror attacks as reports came in of an unidentified container truck and a van believed to be carrying explosives.
