Adrift for four days, fisherman picked from sea 600km away

India will ask Bangladesh to conduct another search

KOLKATA: An Indian fisherman from Kakdwip, South 24 Parganas, whose trawler capsized in the Bay of Bengal on July 4, has cheated sure-shot death by surviving for four days in the choppy waters without even a life jacket — all the time drifting towards the Chittagong coast in Bangladesh — before being picked up by a ship nearly 600km from home on Wednesday.Rabindranath Das’s trawler was one of the 100-odd fishing vessels that left Kakdwip last Thursday before they ran into a storm on Saturday and were pushed across the International Maritime Boundary Line into Bangladeshi waters. All the boats capsized and most of the 1,300-odd fishermen were picked up by Bangladeshi boats over the next few hours. But two boats — and the 25 men in them — were lost, perhaps forever, feared officials. Das’s miraculous appearance off the Chittagong coast — four days after his trawler (FB Nayan-1) sank and 600km from home — came in this backdrop.The crew of a 189-metrelong Bangladesh-flag bulk carrier, MV Jawad, spotted him floating in the sea around 10.30am (IST) on Wednesday.The first attempts to get close to him, however, failed as Das floated away from the ship and — for some time — was lost to its crew. The captain then raised anchor and the ship caught up with Das nearly three nautical miles (almost 5.5km) from the spot where he was first sighted as the crew moved the ship along with the tide.Rabindranath Das was hauled up on board after about a couple of hours as the crew struggled to get closer to him in the choppy waters. The ship’s crew then alerted Bangladesh Navy and Coast Guard.“He was provided firstaid, food and fresh clothes on board before being shifted to a hospital,” an S R Shipping Ltd of Bangladesh official said.The story about the miraculous survival of an Indian fisherman, who spent four days floating and swimming in the Bay of Bengal, first broke in the Bangladeshi media and then reached Das’s village in Kakdwip on Thursday, giving a slight glimmer of hope to the families of the 24 other fishermen still missing.South 24 Parganas district magistrate P Ulganathan met other senior officials on Thursday to discuss how to get Das back home and request Bangladeshi agencies to conduct another search for the missing fishermen.But the fishermen who have returned say Das’s tale would be “one-in-a-million”. “We are still praying but know that it is impossible to survive in the choppy waters of the Bay of Bengal for so many days,” West Bengal United Fishermen’s Association assistant secretary Bijan Maity said.
