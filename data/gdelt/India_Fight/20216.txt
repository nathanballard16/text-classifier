Lok Sabha Election 2019: Kartik Aaryan becomes the state icon of Madhya Pradesh

Looks like Kartik Aaryan is doing his bit not just to entertain his fans but also encourage them as responsible citizens. The young actor has been given the onus to make the youth of Madhya Pradesh aware of the importance of voting. The Lok Sabha elections are just around the corner, and the state of MP is taking the support of the Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety star to connect with the youth and spread the awareness of the importance of voting among them.

The Election Commission of India has appointed Kartik as the state icon for Madhya Pradesh to promote voters’ participation. A source says, “Common campaigns and processions don’t connect with the youth so much. But, a rising star like Kartik can make young minds understand the importance of voting and their role in the nation’s development. Since Kartik has an immense following amidst men and women, it’s a smart move to make him the face of such a campaign.” The actor was born and raised in Gwalior, where he also shot for his recent hit movie, Luka Chuppi. The Pyaar Ka Punchnama boy also hoisted the flag on Independence Day at his alma mater, St Paul’s High School.
