Most wanted terrorists: Million-dollar bounties

One of the highest bounties out for a terrorist is no longer on the table.

Dying "like a dog," President Trump described the end to ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as cowardly.

And as a "high-value target," al-Baghdadi had a $25 million bounty for information leading to his arrest. The reward money more than doubled from the original $10 million offer from the State Department in 2016.

U.S. Special Operations Forces ended up storming his compound in Syria. Trump explained he died whimpering in a tunnel. The president said the most-wanted terrorist then detonated a suicide vest.

Noting the recent death of Hamza bin Laden, the son of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, Trump said, "These savage monsters will not escape their fate, and they will not escape the final judgment of God."

According to the FBI, here are some of the other most wanted terrorists and the reward offered for info leading to their arrests/convictions.
