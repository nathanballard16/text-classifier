Two accused in Ludhiana gang-rape case arrested

Chandigarh: Punjab Police have arrested two men who were allegedly involved in the gang-rape of a 21-year-old woman in Ludhiana district. They have been identified as Jagroop Singh and Sadik Ali.

Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Ranbir Singh Khatra said raids were being conducted to nab the remaining four accused.

Khatra said investigations have revealed that six men were involved in the gang-rape of the young woman February 9 night when she was driving along a canal in a car with her male friend. The victim had alleged that she was gang-raped by at least 10 men after she and her friend were attacked and abducted and taken to an isolated plot in the Issewal area of Ludhiana district.

Police officials said that raids are being conducted to arrest the four other accused. These include Ajay Kumar, Syed Ali, Surma and another one (not yet identified but relative of Surma). All the suspects are in the 25-30 age group.

The police have registered a case of rape and under other sections of the IPC against the accused.

Khatra had earlier admitted that there were lapses by the local police in dealing with the matter due to which the gruesome crime took place. Assistant sub-inspector Vijay Rattan has been suspended for dereliction of duty as he had failed to investigate the matter seriously and did not inform his seniors about it after receiving a complaint about the incident.
