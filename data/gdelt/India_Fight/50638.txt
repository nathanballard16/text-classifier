Tis Hazari clash: Plea in Delhi HC seeks action against cops

The petition has been filed by lawyer Rakesh Kumar Lakra.

A PIL was filed in the Delhi High Court Thursday seeking action against the police officers who protested against lawyers, in the wake of the lawyer-police clash at Tis Hazari district court last week.

The plea, which also sought action against the officers who issued statements on social media when the matter is sub judice, has been listed for hearing Friday.

The plea sought directions to the Centre to initiate a departmental inquiry against the officers who sat on “dharna”, “made provocative slogans” and issued “inciting” statements on electronic and social media.

“Personnel of Delhi Police…sat on an unwarranted dharna in contravention of Rule 7 of the Central Civil Services Conduct Rules, 1964… ,”the petition read.

The petition has been filed by lawyer Rakesh Kumar Lakra.
