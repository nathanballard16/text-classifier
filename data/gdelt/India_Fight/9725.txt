The Supreme Court on Tuesday transferred the murder case of rationalist and author MM Kalburgi to the Karnataka SIT, which is currently probing journalist Gauri Lankesh’s murder. The apex court, which was hearing a petition filed by MM Kalburgi’s wife Umadevi seeking an independent probe, said that probe will be monitored by the Dharwad bench of the Karnataka High Court.

The Supreme Court bench also stated that if the four cases – the murders of Gauri Lankesh, MM Kalburgi, Govind Pansare and Narendra Dabholkar – are linked, then one special investigating team must probe all four murders and must be monitored by one High Court.

When the question of handing over the case to Maharashtra SIT came up, the counsel representing Karnataka SIT said that the team of investigators was already probing the Gauri Lankesh murder and that there was no point in handing over the case to the Maharashtra SIT.
