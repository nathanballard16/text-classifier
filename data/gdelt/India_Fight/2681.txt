Kudla man cares for mentally ill Pakistani

MANGALURU: A young Pakistani, once branded as a terrorist by the media, is silently recuperating from mental illness under the care of an auto driver-turned-social worker from Mangaluru for the past three-and-a-half years.Joseph Crasta, founder, Snehalaya Charitable Trust, has been caring for Abul Basheer who is possibly in his early thirties.While there are no details of how Basheer landed in India, he failed to produce his passport when asked by police in Kasaragod at least six years ago. When arrested, there were media reports that he was a potential terrorist who had sneaked into India to carry out attacks.A court in Kasaragod awarded him two years imprisonment for not producing his passport. With a supposedly disturbed past and unsure present behind bars, Basheer lost his mental balance.When he completed his jail term in 2015, the Kasaragod district administration was not sure how to rehabilitate him as Basheer couldn’t give any details about his family. The then deputy commissioner of Kasaragod turned to Crasta to look after him.“We now know that one of his sisters stays in Saudi Arabia. However, we couldn’t get in touch with her,” Crasta told TOI. “We do get a call once a year from the Kasaragod district administration enquiring about his whereabouts. We haven’t received any enquiry from Pakistan yet,” he added.According to Crasta, Basheer suffers from schizophrenia and chances of his recovery appear bleak. Snehalaya has been providing all necessary medication from Yenepoya Medical College. Geo Agrar of Snehalaya said repatriation to Pakistan was very stringent and there were not enough details about him to start the process.
