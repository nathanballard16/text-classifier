Sonali Bendre on surviving cancer: Wanted to be in charge of my narrative

As humans, we all battle similar fears. Most of us are wary of most diseases. But the one that really shakes us all up is cancer. At an event in Delhi today, the ever fearless Sonali Bendre talked in detail about her battle with this illness. She said that she wanted to be in control of her life story and that is the reason why she decided to share her cancer battle with the people on social media. "I wanted to be charge of my narrative from the start. When you are a public figure, there are so many narratives that it out there. And suddenly you lose hold of that narrative very quickly. It becomes a different thing all together," the actor said at the India Today Conclave 2019.

Ever since Sonali shared the heartbreaking news on her social media account, she has been a source of inspiration for millions with her positivity, determination and optimism towards life. From sharing the video of her chopped off hair, to sharing her smiling pictures throughout the battle, she has been an epitome of bravery. The 44-years old actress said that she always thought she caused the disease to herself by doing something wrong and also went to a psychiatrist in New York. “Everyone said, 'Your lifestyle was never like that. How did it happen to you?' I actually thought that it was me doing something wrong and that I have caused it. I went to a psychiatrist in New York. I was like, I don't understand what is happening to me. I'm not a negative person, I have a lot of positive thoughts. Am I being delusional? Do I actually have negative thoughts and I am burying it so deep in my sub-conscience that I don't realise it? I needed to understand what was happening to me,”







The 44-year-old actor was diagnosed with high-grade cancer last year and had to undergo treatment in New York. She returned home in December and has resumed her work here.
