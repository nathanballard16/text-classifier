#JusticeForPriyankaReddy: Netizens demand death penalty for accused Mohammed Pasha; question status of Nirbhaya case

Hyderabad: The police has made arrests in the sensational Priyanka Reddy murder case that had rocked the nation yesterday.

Mohammed Pasha, a lorry driver from Narayanpet in Mahabubnagar, has been picked up by the police. A cleaner and two other two persons who belonged to Rangareddy and Mahabubnagar were also arrested. Police are interrogating and seeking more details from them.

27-year-old Priyanka Reddy’s burnt body was found on the outskirts of Hyderabad. According to Cyberabad Police, the woman was returning home from her clinic a little after 8 pm when she noticed a flat tyre and called her sister, who suggested that she leave her two-wheeler at the toll plaza and take a cab home. But before she could, she was approached by two men, who offered to take her vehicle for repair, police said.

Priyanka Reddy reportedly agreed, and as she waited for the men to return, she was ambushed and dragged into the bushes barely 50 metres from Tondupally toll plaza, behind a line of trucks that obscured visibility from the road, police said.

According to police, after killing her, the accused took her body to an under-construction bridge a few kilometres away, and set it on fire. According to an officer, innerwear found around 100 metres from the spot has led police to believe she was sexually assaulted.
