A 26-year-old man has been arrested on Monday for allegedly shooting a video of a nine-year-old girl in the washroom without her knowledge in SG road in Gujarat's Ahmedabad.

The accused has been identified as Rushi Balwant Parmar.

The incident happened at a bookstore when the minor girl went to use the washroom at the shop and saw the accused filming her. The victim noticed that Parmar was shooting a video of her by placing a mobile phone in the gap of the washroom door. She then screamed and tried to open the door. The accused then fled from the scene, according to the report in The Times of India.

Police officials said the accused shot the video of the minor girl while she was using the washroom and later deleted the video. However, he later surrendered before the police after the girl's father lodged a complaint at the Vastrapur police station. Police said Balwar, who goes to the bookstore on every Saturday and Sunday, confessed that he is suffering from some mental disorder which forced him to carry out such an act.

Balwar has been booked under various sections of POCSO (Protection of Children Against Sexual Offences) and Information Technology (IT) Act. His phone has been sent for further investigation to the FSL and to retrieve the videos he had deleted.
