Indian PM Convenes National Security Council to Discuss Kashmir - Sources

India and Pakistan have been facing off in the disputed Kashmir region after a deadly attack by Jaish-e-Mohammad on the Indian paramilitary police force in Kashmir in mid-February. While India has accused Pakistan of supporting the militants and having a "direct hand" in the incident, Pakistan has rejected the allegations, accusing India, in turn, of being responsible for human rights violations taking place in Kashmir.

India struck targets inside Pakistan, while Pakistani air defences shot down several Indian planes and captured an Indian pilot before releasing him.
