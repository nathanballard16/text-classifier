Importance of LCA programme as flagship for 'Make in India'

The importance of the LCA programme as the flagship for "Make in India" was stressed here Friday by Air Officer Commanding-in Chief, Air Marshal Suresh of the Southern Area Command, who called for brainstorming on various aspects of its operational viability.

Speaking after inaugurating the first LCA TEJAS operators conference at the Air Force Station at Sulur on the outskirts, Suresh impressed upon the participants, the need to deliberate at length on further improvements in avionics, radar and other systems for future programme like LCA Mk IA & II and AMCA, while working on Tejas FOC and Mk1.

He expressed confidence that those present at the conference, "the finest brains in military aviation", would utilise the wealth of experience to make further versions of LCA into one of the finest combat platforms in the world.

The road map and timelines for Tejas capability enhancement and measures to step up its production were also discussed at the conference, an official release said here.

Senior dignitaries present included CMD and Chairman of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) R Madhavan, Dr Girish Deodhare, Director of the Aeronautical Development Agency.

The Light Combat Aircraft Tejas is the second supersonic fighter aircraft built by HAL after HF-24 Marut.

It is the smallest and lightest in its class of contemporary supersonic combat aircraft, integrating the latest technologies and composite material structures.

It was designed and developed by ADA and certified airworthy by the Centre for Military Airworthiness and Certification (CEMILAC).
