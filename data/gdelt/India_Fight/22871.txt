Hedge fund agrees record UK rent for office space Mayfair

A hedge fund boss has broken the record for the UK’s highest office rent after agreeing to pay £250 a square foot for a new London base.

Ravi Mehta, the 37-year-old founder of Steadview Capital Management, signed a deal to move his company into 30 Berkeley Square in Mayfair, one of the capital's most prestigious addresses.

The move will see it take up the 2,700 square feet office space in a building that is also home to the famed Phillips auction house.

The landlord was reportedly hoping to let the full floor to one tenant but Steadview agreed to pay a premium because it did not need the full space.

The deal is well above what was thought to be the most recent UK high of £190 per square foot, paid by fashion investment tycoon Lawrence Stroll for property in St James’s in 2017.

Berkeley Square has become increasingly popular for hedge fund managers keen to establish a base aware from the City and Canary Wharf.
