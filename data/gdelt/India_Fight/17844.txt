Does T-Series have more followers that PewDiePie?

Swedish Youtube sensation PewDiePie was the most followed account with over 91million subscribers.

But PewDiePie was overtaken by T-Series this morning with a lead of over 105,000.

T-Series briefly took the crown for the first time last month, but only for eight minutes.

It was the first time in five years that PewDiePie had been ousted at the top of the subscriber chart.

Why do PewDiePie and T-Series have a rivalry?

PewDiePie and the Indian music label T-Series have been battling it out to be YouTube’s most subscribed channel.

T-Series' success comes after PewDiePie boss Felix Kjellberg was accused of "insulting India" with his platform in the ongoing battle.

He hit back by accusing T-series of "spamming his diss track" and trying to whip up nationalistic fervour to get them over the finish line.

An intervention from eccentric billionaire Elon Musk last month saw him throw his support behind the controversial Swede by hosting the 'Meme Review' segment on his channel.

"Elon Musk came down from the sky and hosted Meme Review," Kjellberg said in a video he posted in February. "PewDiePie is rightfully at number one again."

PewDiePie fans have taken the race so seriously they’ve hacked printers, Chromecasts, video games to show messages supporting him.

Who is PewDiePie?

He has over 89 million fans making him the second most subscribed person on the channel for his Let's Play commentaries.

He also has over 17 million Twitter followers and 16 million Instagram followers.

PewDiePie's channel has received over 13 billion video views and he was named one of "The World’s 100 Most Influential People" by Time magazine.

Felix was born in 1989 in Gothenburg, Sweden, and graduated from university with a degree in Industrial Economics and Technology Management, but in 2013, he had the most subscribed YouTube channel.

He currently lives in Brighton with his Italian fashion and beauty vlogger girlfriend Marzia Bisognin with their two pugs, Maya and Edgar.

The couple, who have been together since 2011, were introduced over the internet and have been referred to as YouTube's biggest power couple.

But in November 2018 Marzia quit YouTube.
