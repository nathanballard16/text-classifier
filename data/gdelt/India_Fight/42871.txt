NSUI alleges attack by ABVP members

Its candidate for vice-president post beaten up during campaign

NSUI candidate for the post of Delhi University Students’ Union vice-president Ankit Bharti was attacked on Monday allegedly by members of the ABVP, the student’s group said.

The ABVP, however, denied the allegations.

Attacked twice

Mr. Bharti alleged that while campaigning in the College of Vocational Studies, ABVP members got inside his vehicle and beat him up in an effort to stop him from entering the college.

Following this, he said he was again attacked when he entered the college and was hit on the head. In a video, Mr. Bharti is seen bleeding from the head. After the incident, he was taken to RML Hospital, said NSUI’s media in-charge Neeraj Mishra, adding that a police complaint has been filed.

‘Anti-Dalit mindset’

In a statement, the NSUI said the attack was a reflection of the ABVP’s “anti-Dalit mindset.”

Given Mr. Bharti was from the Dalit community, the attack was to create fear among Dalit students, the group said.

The ABVP claimed that Mr. Bharti was attacked by another NSUI candidate Ashish Lamba, who is contesting for the post of secretary. “Internal conflicts within the group were coming out,” said Ashutosh Singh of ABVP.

The ABVP said it has filed a police complaint in the matter.

The NSUI had “polluted the election environment” with cheap political tactics, it said, adding that if the name of the organisation was further dragged, it would be compelled to file a defamation suit.

The NSUI rubbished these claims.
