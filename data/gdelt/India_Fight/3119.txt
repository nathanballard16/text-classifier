‘This is result of political vendetta’: Ex-Haryana CM BS Hooda on CBI raids at his Rohtak residence

The Central Bureau of investigation on Friday conducted raids at the residence of Former Haryana Chief Minister BS Hooda in Rohtak, Haryana. On the raids conducted by CBI, BS Hooda called it ‘political vendetta’. Bhupinder Singh Hooda told news agency ANI “this is a result of political vendetta. I will fight this battle myself. I have complete faith in the judiciary. No one can silence my voice.” Congress MLA Kuldeep Sharma also lambasted the BJP government and charged that the action was intended to stop the senior Congress leader from attending a poll rally to be held Friday in the run-up to the Jind bypoll. Jind bypoll, which has turned out to be a multi-cornered contest, will take place on January 28. A CBI team from Delhi Friday raided Hooda's house in Rohtak and other places in a land allocation irregularities case. The raids are part of CBI investigations into the alleged release of 1,300 acres in Gurgaon to real estate developers
