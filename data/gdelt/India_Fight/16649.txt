Pakistan deploys Chinese air defense systems, more attack & surveillance drones at India’s border

Pakistan has deployed more Chinese medium-range air defense missiles across several cities and military bases, to prevent any intrusions after the Indian Air Force carried out cross-border anti-terrorist strikes last month.

Five units of LY-80 (HQ-16) surface-to-air missiles (SAM) and IBIS-150 air defense surveillance radar units were spread across Pakistan following New Delhi’s strike last month against terrorists in Balakot, deep inside Pakistan’s territory, Indian news outlets reported, citing the latest intelligence reports.

Besides SAM systems, Islamabad also reportedly has deployed additional Chinese-made Rainbow CH-4 and CH-5 drones, for surveillance and even potential strikes at the Kashmir Line of Control. At least three of those drones have been shot down following the February 26 strike against the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist camp.

The Indian raid inside Pakistani territory came in response to the Pulwama attack on February 14, in which a Kashmiri member of a Pakistan-based militant group killed 40 Indian paramilitary police in a suicide bombing. That sortie was followed by a mid-air dogfight the following day, in which one of India's MiG-21 Bison was shot down while confronting Pakistani jets that conducted a retaliatory cross-border raid.
