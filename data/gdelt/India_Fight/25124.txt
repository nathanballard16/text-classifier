SCOOPS: Why Arjun Kapoor thinks Ajay Devgn is Mr. Cool, Mithun Da to be a guest on a dance show?

1/3

Arjun Kapoor, who is getting ready for India’s Most Wanted, a film that releases a week after Ajay Devgn’s De De Pyaar De, says he likes the way the senior actor conducts his life. When asked to specify what he meant — Arjun said, “Ajay sir is Mr Cool. He stays private throughout and only comes out to promote his film during the release. Then he goes back into his well-guarded shell. He prefers to stay low-key except during promotions.”

Arjun is happy that Mr Cool Devgn is the leading man of his father, Boney Kapoor’s next project directed by Amit Sharma, who made his Hindi film debut with Tevar.

Arjun adds, “Amit got his real due in Badhaai Ho, a slice-of-life film that went on to create box-office history. I’m happy dad is getting to work with Amit and Ajay sir.”
