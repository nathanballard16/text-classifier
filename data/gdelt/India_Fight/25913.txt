'God-Se Lovers': Rahul Gandhi takes a dig at BJP, RSS over Sadhvi Pragya's remarks

New Delhi:

Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday took a dig at Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) for latest remarks Nathuram Godse - the man who killed Mahatma Gandhi -Â saying they are not "God-ke Lovers" but "God-se Lovers".

"I finally got it. The BJP and the RSS...Are not God-Ke Lovers...They are God-Se Lovers (sic)," Gandhi tweeted.Â

I finally got it. The BJP and the RSS...



Are not God-Ke Lovers.



They are God-Se Lovers. â€” Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) May 17, 2019

The Pandora's box opened on Thursday with Malegaon blast accused and BJP's Bhopal Lok Sabha candidate Sadhvi Pragya Singh Thakur lauding Godse as a "patriot" and issuing an apology hours later, saying she respected Gandhi and his work for the country cannot be forgotten.

Amid all this controversy, BJP's MP from Karnataka Nalin Kumar Kateel compared Godse with former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi.

"Godse killed one, Kasab killed 72, Rajiv Gandhi killed 17,000. You judge who is more cruel in this??" Kateel tweeted on Thursday, equating Godse, 26/11 Mumbai terror attack convict Ajmal Kasab and Rajiv Gandhi.Â Â Â

Union minister Anantkumar Hegde also found himself in the news with a purported tweet justifying Godse's action. However, later the minister claimed his account was hacked.Â

"My account was hacked since yesterday. There is no question of justifying Gandhi ji's murder. There can be no sympathy or justification of Gandhi ji's murder. We all have full respect for Gandhi ji's contribution to the nation," Hegde tweeted.Â

"My Twitter account has been breached twice in the past one week and certain tweets have been posted on my timeline which has been discarded and deleted. Regret the posts attributed to me," the Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship said in another tweet.Â

Meanwhile, BJP president Amit Shah on Friday came out strongly against the controversial remarks of his party leaders saying the BJP has taken serious note of their statements, which are against its ideology.

Stating that these comments were their personal statements and had no link with the party, the party president said that all the three leaders have been asked to explain their remarks within 10 days.
