Banda: Water crisis in India is making its way to the remotest parts of the country. While the southern parts of the country are steadily running out of groundwater, the situation in the northern parts is also deteriorating. Bundelkhand, in Uttar Pradesh, is a place that is inching closer to drought with every passing day.

While Bundelkhand is struggling in the clutches of a water crisis, a small village here is using traditional methods to revive its water bodies. Situated 20 kilometres away from Banda, Jakhni village has managed to find its way out of the water crisis.

Around eight years ago, the residents of this village were facing an acute water crisis, this was when they decided to adopt traditional techniques to revive ponds, wells and other water bodies. Shanti, a farmer told ANI, "Eight to ten years ago, we decided to divert wastewater to ponds and this measure has rejuvenated the water level and has made farming easier."

As a result of the efforts, the Jakhni village now has 32 wells, 25 handpumps and four ponds, all of which are full of water. The villagers claimed that they fought their battle against the water crisis without any help from the government. It is due to the availability of water that the residents who had once abandoned the village are now tracing their way back to the village.

The villagers have also formed an organisation called Sarvodaya Aadarsh Jal Gram Abhiyan Samiti. This organisation works towards adopting measures to harvest rainwater.
