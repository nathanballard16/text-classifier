The comments section is full of people writing on her dupatta’s price tag.

“tag ..bhul gyi nikalna,” one wrote.

Another wrote: “Did she or her stylist rob that suit from a shop? It has that sensor wala thing attached to dupatta.”

“Myntra return will not pick it up if it doesn’t have tag… that’s y,” a user wrote in jest.

Myntra was quick to respond. A comment was posted on behalf of the fashion e-commerce company Wednesday. It read: “Flag it, tag it, bag it. Clothes returned without a tag are as good as rag! We don’t wanna brag, but if you follow the steps, your return will be without a snag!”
