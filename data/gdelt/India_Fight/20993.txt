Deepika Padukone beats the heat, all thanks to 'Sattu'

Mumbai: While the temperatures of Delhi are shooting with every passing day, Deepika Padukone continues to shoot for her upcoming film Chhapaak in the capital.

Beating the heat, Deepika Padukone is taking extensive care to shield herself from the rising heat, along with the help of her team. Interestingly Deepika Padukone has been sipping on "Sattu" at regular intervals. A month-long quota has been organised for our B-Town beauty, who knows how important it is to stay hydrated.

The Sattu Sharbat is popular across the country and has its own variations in states like Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.

Deepika is currently leaving no stone unturned in getting into the skin of her character as the actress has now embarked an emotional journey with Chhapaak as she slips into the shoes of an acid victim survivor.

The upcoming film of the actress demands her to feel and live the life of an acid attack survivor touching upon all the adversities the victim feels as Malti.

After bringing to screen the courage and valour of Rani Padmini in Padmaavat, Deepika Padukone personifies another tale of bravery and human spirit with Malti. Drawing instances from the life of Laxmi Agarwal, Chhapaak is a story of the strength and integrity of a woman.
