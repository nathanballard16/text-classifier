Been a physically intense year for me: Shraddha Kapoor on working on three films - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

MUMBAI: Shraddha Kapoor, who shot for three films — “Saaho”, “Chhichhore” and “Street Dancer” — in 2019, said it has been a physically intense year for her.

The actor, however, said she is happy to be a part of three big films.

“My body is paining a lot. It has been a physically intense year for me. I did shoot three films but ‘Street Dancer’ is releasing next year. I feel I should get some break but now promotions of ‘Saaho’ have also started.

“I am so excited and it’s a big thing. ‘Saaho’ is my first multi-lingual film and I am happy I got to be part of such a big film,” Shraddha told reporters here at the trailer launch of “Saaho” on Saturday.

“Saaho” is slated to release on August 30 and “Chhichhore” will hit cinemas on September 6, while “Street Dancer”, also featuring Varun Dhawan, will release in January next year.

Talking about her two films releasing back-to-back, Shraddha said, “The fact is both the films are different from each other. I feel lucky that I am coming on the big screen in such a short duration.”

“Saaho”, directed by Sujeeth, will see Shraddha trying her hands on action. (AGENCIES)
