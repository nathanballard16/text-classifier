Hubballi: A woman suffered serious burn injuries after her saree caught fire from a candle while she was offering prayers at Vishwanatha temple in Karnataka's Hubballi. The tragic incident took place on June 17, around 12:40 in the afternoon, as seen from the camera (CCTV) counter.

The woman, identified as Chaya, has been admitted to the KIMS hospital where she is undergoing treatment.

In a CCTV footage that surfaced on media, the woman can be seen running in flames and shouting for help after her saree caught fire. Hearing her scream, several people rushed to the site and tried to douse the blaze. She was later rushed to the hospital.

The temple authorities have not made any official statement over the incident as yet.

Earlier in January, a similar incident was reported from Kolkata where a 50-year-old woman sustained burn injuries after her saree caught fire from a candle while she was offering prayers at Karunamoyee Kali temple. Following the incident, the temple authorities prohibited the use of candles, incense sticks, and other inflammable materials in the premises, a media report said.
