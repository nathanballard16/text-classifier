Two smugglers arrested in Delhi with fake Rs 2,000 notes

NEW DELHI: A consignment of fake Indian currency notes (FICN) in the denomination of Rs 2,000, which was sent to Delhi from a remote location near the Indo-Bangladesh border, has been seized and two smugglers have been arrested in the capital. The consignment had a face value of Rs 4 lakh.The accused have been identified as Gautam Mandal (25) from Malda and Shiksha (32) from Panipat in Haryana. Since April, the Special Cell had been receiving tipoffs about a Malda-based module pushing fake currency into Delhi and Haryana, said Sanjeev Yadav, DCP (Special Cell). “A team led by ACP Manoj Dixit and inspectors Vivekanand and Kuldeep was formed to track down the members of the syndicate,” Yadav added.On July 31, the team received a tipoff that a key member would come near Haiderpur-Badli Mor metro station to deliver a consignment to a Panipat-based receiver. A trap was laid and the accused were arrested with fake notes.The seized FICN has been printed in a sophisticated printing unit and several security features, including watermarks and security threads, have been copied so accurately that it was often difficult to differentiate between the fakes and the genuine notes in the first instance, said a police officer. The fakes could be detected only after a minute scan, he added.Mandal told cops that the fake currency notes were being pushed into India through the porous Indo-Bangla Border. Supplies were first brought to Kaliachak in Malda and then circulated to different parts of India. He claimed that he had joined the gang a year ago and delivered five such consignments till now.
