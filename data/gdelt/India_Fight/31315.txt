Kolkata: Amid the all-time high political tensions between the BJP and the TMC in West Bengal, BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya has equated state Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan. Vijayvargiya contended that there's no difference between the two as both did not perform yoga on the International Yoga Day.

"Even when the whole world celebrated the Yoga Day with enthusiasm, Mamata Banerjee and Pakistan boycotted it. There is no difference between her and the Prime Minister of Pakistan," said Vijayvargiya.

Terming Prime Minister Modi as the most popular leader in the world, Vijayvargiya called upon political leaders to rise above their ideological differences and support the idea of 'One Nation One Poll' to strengthen democracy in India.

BJP general secretary also took a potshot at Congress president Rahul Gandhi, terming him "mentally unsound." While Rahul has again reiterated his stand to step down as party president, he recently faced criticism over his post on International Yoga Day when he shared a post wherein Army's Dog squad was seen participating in Yoga Day celebrations. Rahul posted the picture with a sarcastic jibe saying, 'New India'.

Meanwhile, West Bengal is reeling under political violence between the BJP and the TMC. Earlier today, clashes erupted in Bhatpara area soon after a three-member BJP delegation led by former Union minister SS Ahluwalia left the town. The team was sent in by Union Minister Amit Shah to access the ground situation after two people were killed and several were injured in violent clashes at the same place on Thursday.
