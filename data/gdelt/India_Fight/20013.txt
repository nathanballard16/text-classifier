World's biggest election starts

Tens of millions of Indians joined nationwide queues yesterday to give their verdict on prime minister Narendra Modi as the world's biggest election started amid deadly clashes.

Election officials reported a heavy turnout across the 20 states taking part in the first day of the massive exercise which involves 900 million eligible voters and will take nearly six weeks to complete.

While the 68-year-old Modi remains popular because of his tough stance on national security, he is under pressure over unemployment and controversial economic measures.

Opposition leader Rahul Gandhi, 48, the latest member of his family dynasty hoping to become prime minister, accused Modi of causing a "national disaster".

"You vote today for the soul of India," he told voters. "For her future. Vote wisely."

On the ground, security forces were on high alert and two members of regional parties were killed in clashes outside a polling station in Tadipatri, Andhras Pradesh state.

Because of India's vastness, yesterday marked the first of seven phases in the election to take place.

Thousands will run for office between now and May 19 in 543 constituencies across the nation of 1.3 billion people, with results not due until May 23.

Phase one sees some 142 million people able to cast ballots while 1.1 million electronic voting machines are transported throughout the country.

Polling stations in northeastern states like Arunachal Pradesh bordering China were the first to open, followed by parts of Bihar in the north. Modi appealed in a tweet to his almost 47 million followers on voters to "turn out in record numbers and exercise their franchise."
