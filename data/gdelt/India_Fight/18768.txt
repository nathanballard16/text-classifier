The female lead of the film has not yet been revealed but it is being reported that actress Kareena Kapoor Khan will star along with Irrfan.

'Angrezi Medium' marks Irrfan's comeback into Bollywood as the actor was on a break from the filmy scene after being diagnosed with NeuroEndocrine Tumour – a rare form of cancer.

It was in 2018 that Irrfan shared the news of his illness, leaving us all in shock.

It is indeed a relief to see the actor in good health and getting back to work. He returned to Mumbai recently after seeking treatment in London.

After returning to the city, Irrfan thanked all his fans for their love and support by writing a heartfelt note on Twitter.

Here is wishing all the very best to the actor for his future endeavors!
