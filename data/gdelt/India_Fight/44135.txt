‘Terrorists In J&K Didn’t Land From Moon, They Came From Pakistan’: EU Parliamentarians Slam Islamabad

Slamming Pakistan for being the bastion and breeding ground for terrorists, European parliamentarians Ryszard Czarnecki and Fulvio Martusciello quipped if the terrorists who have been attacking India came from the moon, reports Indian Express.

The two parliamentarians made the scathing tirade on Pakistan sponsored terrorism at a special debate of the plenary of the European Parliament which had been called to discuss the ongoing situation in Jammu and Kashmir.

“India is the greatest democracy of the world. We need to look at terrorist acts that took place in India, Jammu and Kashmir. These terrorists didn’t land from the Moon. They were coming from the neighbouring country. We should support India,” said Czarnecki, a EP member from Poland.

Martusciello, who hails from Italy, brought up Pakistan's threat of using nuclear weapons against India in response to India's abrogation of Article 370 of its own Constitution. He called Pakistan raising nuclear bogey a serious concern for European Union.

Further calling out Pakistan's shambolic record on human rights, he said, “Pakistan is somewhere where terrorists have been able to plan bloody terrorist attacks in Europe.”

Meanwhile, hailing India as the greatest democracy of the world, Czarnecki said, "We need to look at terrorist acts that took place in India, Jammu and Kashmir. These terrorists didn’t land from the Moon. They were coming from the neighbouring country. We should support India."
