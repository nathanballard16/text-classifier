Dwarka Expressway’s blocked again, steel barriers stronger than CM’s orders

These steel barriers must go,” said a state government official. “We have spent Rs 2.8 lakh to get the 20 steel barriers made. Its subsequent attempt to install barricades at the site, on January 29, was met with stiff resistance from local residents. Friday has been a black day for new sectors.”Some residents said the impact of this wall coming up again in the form of steel barriers could take a toll on the health of local residents. MCEPL has already got a go-ahead to seal the site from Delhi high court, which it had approached soon after the demolition of the wall.
