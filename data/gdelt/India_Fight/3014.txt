However, Jassi’s uncle Surjeet Singh and mother Malkait Kaur who allegedly hatched the conspiracy from Canada to kill were extradited on Wednesday.Talking to The Times of India, Mithu, said “I am very happy with the extradition of the two main accused in the gruesome murder of my wife. I heard that they were extradited from Vancouver yesterday and reached Delhi airport at 4.45 am today. I am hopeful that their trial will begin soon in the Sangrur court and want that they should be handed over capital punishment. Even if it is not capital punishment, they should rot in jail and shouldn’t be given parole so that they can feel my pain and agony.
