Japanese PM Shinzo Abe may cancel India trip over Citizenship Amendment Bill protests

Japanese Prime Minister Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may cancel his trip to India scheduled to start on Sunday in view of the growing protests over the Citizenship Amendment Bill across Assam.

Abe was scheduled to attend a summit meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Guwahati in Assam over the weekend. However, Assam has been reeling under violent protests with protesters taking to streets against the parliament passing the controversial Citizenship Amendment Bill.

Reacting to the media reports, Indian ministry of external affairs spokesperson Raveesh Kumar tweeted, “With reference to the proposed visit of Japanese PM @AbeShinzo to India, both sides have decided to defer the visit to a mutually convenient date in the near future.”

Earlier, Bangladesh Foreign Minister and Home Minister had canceled their visit to India even though the Indian MEA said that the relationship between India and its neighbouring country remained very strong.

Two protesters were shot dead by security forces in Assam on Thursday. Authorities have imposed curfew and banned internet services in at least 10 districts of Assam. Several airline operators had canceled their flights to and from Assam on Thursday.
