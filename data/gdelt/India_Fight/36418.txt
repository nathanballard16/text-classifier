Deepika Padukone returned to Mumbai a few days back after shooting for Kabir Khan's '83 with Ranveer Singh in London. Soon after returning she has been working for her brand endorsements and also meeting up with filmmakers so as to finalise her forthcoming projects post-Chhapaak and '83.

Deepika and Ranveer are currently away from each other and they are bound to miss each other crazily. Thus, the dimpled beauty took to her Instagram page and shared a throwback photo with Ranveer shot during a magazine shoot. In the photo, Deepika is smiling while talking to Ranveer who is on the floor literally. This photo shows they don't need anyone else and complete each other. Deepika posted the photo with a caption stating, "#us".

Earlier, during an interaction with a magazine, Ranveer was asked about Deepika's one quality which only a few people know. He said, "There is a child-like quality to her that nobody other than me has the privilege of seeing. It’s a precious part of my life." Furthermore talking about how their relationship has evolved post-wedding, Ranveer said, "It has only gotten better. Now, we’re cocooned in love, and there is no space for doubt or misgiving. It’s grounded-ness, centred-ness, security, warmth, and joy. We share experiences and laugh together. The added security that comes with marriage has allowed our relationship to blossom further."
