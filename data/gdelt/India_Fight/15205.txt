Indian Shot in NZ Mosque Terror Attack, Family Seeks Urgent Visa

"The family only wants the government to expedite the visa to New Zealand. We will get his tickets done and everything. The brother needs to reach there as soon as possible. Jahangir’s wife will have to take care of two small children and they will need help," Owaisi told TNM.

On Friday, two mosques in New Zealand were attacked by terrorists who carried out a mass shooting. The police said that a man dressed in black with a helmet walked into the back of the Linwood mosque and began firing at people praying in the mosque, killing at least 30 worshipers.

At the same time, the Al-Noor mosque which was also located in Christchurch, New Zealand, came under attack by another terrorist. It was reported that at least 49 people were killed and several others injured in both attacks combined.

Witnesses said there were around 400 people in the Al-Noor Mosque at the time of the attack and they ran for their lives after hearing gunshots. Around 100 were there in Linwood Avenue Mosque, the second mosque targeted.

New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern called the killings 'unprecedented’ and ‘one of [New Zealand's] darkest days’.
