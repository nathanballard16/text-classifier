Two youth killed in police firing in UP

Anas, whose son is only 7-months-old, had just stepped out of his home to get milk for his son but was shot dead by the police.

The Citizenship Amendment Act has left many parts of the country burning. While some protesters have indulged in violence, others question the violence caused by the government machinery.

Until Friday, Nehtaur, a small town in UP's Bijnor, was peaceful but around 1:15 pm the situation dramatically changed after the Friday prayers in the locality's mosque.

A local Hamid Salmani told India Today TV, "People had just left from the mosque and the police asked them to head home. They were leaving but suddenly an argument erupted between a local and a policeman and the situation got out of control."

In a confrontation between police and protesters, 21-year-old Anas and 20-year-old Suleiman were hit by bullets fired by UP Police.

The two were taken to a local hospital where Anas was declared dead on arrival and Suleiman succumbed to his injuries while undergoing treatment.

Anas, whose son is only 7-months-old, had just stepped out of his home to get milk for his son but was shot dead by the police.
