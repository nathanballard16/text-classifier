Tamil actress Mary Sheela Jebarani, also known as Yashika apparently committed suicide by hanging herself to death at her residence in Peravallur, Chennai.

Before taking this drastic step, the actress messaged her mother a suicide note, where she blamed her lover Mohan Babu for her condition.

According to reports, Yashika's boyfriend Aravind alias Mohan Babu of Vadapalani left the house following a quarrel with Yashika and went back to his home. This apparently left Yashika all alone due to which she, later on, committed suicide. Now, according to latest reports, Yashika's mother Esther Beula Rani has filed a complaint to the Commissioner of Police. The actress' mother in her complaint has stated that her daughter has not committed suicide but has been murdered by Aravind. She also stated that the handwritten letter found by the police has not been written by her daughter.

According to a report in Times Now, Yashika's mother has found 50 souvenirs of gold missing from Yashika's flat and thinks that those has been taken away by Aravind.
