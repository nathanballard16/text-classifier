Dalit leader Mayawati attacks Dalit leader Chandrasekhar, says he gets arrested to influence voters

Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati attacked Bhim Army chief Chandrashekhar Azad over his arrest while protesting against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act.

Azad was taken into police custody from outside the Jama Masjid on Saturday morning and has been sent to 14-day judicial custody.

After the court order, Chandrashekhar Azad was taken to Tihar jail. He was earlier denied permission for a protest march from Jama Masjid to Jantar Mantar.

While Mayawati is a veteran Dalit leader, Chandrashekhar Azad Bhim Army has been emerging as a grassroot organization in the recent past.

Mayawati, in her tweet, wrote, "The common perception among Dalits is that Chandrashekhar Azad conspires with opposing parties to weaken support for the BSP. He rakes up local issues around elections and stages protests and gets arrested to influence voters."

"For example, he is a resident of Uttar Pradesh, but he attended the Jama Masjid protest against CAA/NRC in Delhi and forcibly got arrested because assembly elections are going to be held in Delhi soon," she continued.

She also appealed her party members to be vigilant of such "selfish elements". In her last tweet, she said, "There is an appeal to the people of the party to always be vigilant with all such selfish elements, organizations and parties. However, the party never takes such elements, no matter how much effort they make."

Chandrashekhar Azad was inside the mosque in protest against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. The Bhim Army chief had given the Delhi Police a slip to reach the Jama Masjid on Friday.
