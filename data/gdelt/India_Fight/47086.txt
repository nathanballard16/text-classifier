Prosecutors said Grewal killed 30-year-old Navneet Kaur in 2007 after she told him she wanted a divorce.

They said he strangled her before putting her body in a bathtub and filling it with water.

Defense attorneys argued Kaur’s death was accidental.

The couple married in 2005 and had a long-distance relationship with Grewal residing in Canada and Kaur living on a visa in the Ahwatukee area of Phoenix.

Grewel was arrested and extradited to Phoenix in 2011, but his trial didn’t begin until June.
