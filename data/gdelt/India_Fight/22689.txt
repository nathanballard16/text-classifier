The Chaturshungi Police Station solved a murder mystery of an 84-year-old man named Ganesh Pandharinath Jethgaonkar, who died at Blossom Society. During investigation, the police found that the victim's ATM debit cards had been stolen and used to withdraw money. Subsequently, the crime was soon registered by the Chaturshungi police station under Section 380 34 of the IPC.



After receiving information on Jethgaonkar's account, the police found that transactions were made from Lonavla, Worli, Mumbai and Panvel. The police went to the ATM and gained access to the CCTV footage around the neighbourhood. Soon enough, the police obtained the suspects' mobile numbers and arrested them on April 27.



The accused have been identified as Krishna Devendra Badekar (24), who hails from Rajiv Gandhi slum area, Saif Ali Babuji Sheikh (22) from Pawar Vasti of Dapodi, Nadim Salim Pathan (24) and Mosin Akbar Syed (30) from Elevencity, Dapodi. The police added that during investigation, they found that accused had made duplicate keys of the victim's flat.



The four accused had used the duplicate keys to enter Jethgaonkar's flat and threatened him for money. Badekar and Sayyed later held Jethgaonkar's hands while Shaikh killed him. It is believed that Badekar's mother, Sunita Badekar, used to work at the victim's home. The offence committed has been registered under Sections 302, 460 and 394.
