'Thankfully, she didn't call him a 'devta'': Opposition slams Pragya Thakur for 'Godse a patriot' remark

The BJP immediately got into damage control and distanced itself from Thakur's statement and asked her to tender a public apology, which the controversial leader did.

NEW DELHI: Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath on Thursday slammed Pragya Singh Thakur, BJP's Lok Sabha candidate from Bhopal, for referring to Mahatma Gandhi's assassin Nathuram Godse as a "deshbhakt" (patriot). "Thankfully, she didn't call Nathuram Godse a 'devta' (god)," Nath said. The Congress leader claimed that the BJP first asks its leaders to make such statements and later condemns their remarks. "Democracy is in shambles. It's the matter of concern that what will be the future of the country," he said. Thakur's remarks created a major row with the opposition parties attacking her and the BJP, with the NCP saying people can now see the "real face" of the Amit Shah-led party and the Congress demanding an apology from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
