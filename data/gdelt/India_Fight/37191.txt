Police yet to crack motive behind Netajinagar Narendrapur murders

Kolkata: The homicide section of Kolkata Police's Detective Department took over investigation of the Netajinagar elderly couple murder case on Thursday. Several angles have cropped up in the case, but police are still not sure about the motive behind the murders. Investigators suspect that as the elderly couple was issueless, they might have had prepared a will which is yet to be traced. It was also found that the murderers had taken away the mobile phone of Dilip Mukherjee, but did not take the mobile phone of his wife Swapna. On the other hand, police are still in the dark about the motive of the Narendrapur double murder.
