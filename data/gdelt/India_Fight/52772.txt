Thalapathy 64: Vijay to shoot in Shivamogga prison in December

After the massive success of Bigil, actor Vijay is thrilled about his next film with young filmmaker Lokesh Kanagaraj. Tentatively titled Thalapathy 64, the film is tipped to be a gangster flick with a college backdrop. The shooting of the film is currently underway in Delhi.

The latest reports suggest that the team will head to Karnataka after wrapping up the Delhi schedule. Reportedly, the makers of Thalapathy 64 sought permission from the district administration to shoot important sequences in and around Shivamogga prison.

The team has been given permission to shoot in and around the prison from December 1, 2019, to January 18, 2020. Further, they have also gotten permission to clean the premises from January 21 to January 30.

A copy of the permission letter has been doing the rounds on social media. The district administration also added that the Thalapathy 64 crew should ensure that law and order are maintained during the course of the shooting.

Reportedly, the Shivamogga prison in Karnataka holds a special place in history. Built in 1897, the prison is spread over 46 acres and has housed several freedom fighters belonging to the region. After attaining independence, it became a district prison.

Lokesh Kanagaraj and team are planning to wrap up the shooting of Thalapathy 64 by the end of February. After wrapping up the shooting in Karnataka, the team may jet off to Kerala for the final leg of shooting. According to producer Xavier Britto, the film will hit the theatres in summer 2020.

Thalapathy 64 stars Vijay, Vijay Sethupathi, Malavika Mohanan, Antony Varghese, Shanthanu Bhagyaraj. Gouri Kishan, Ramya Subramanian and Soundarya Nandakumar in important roles.
