Delhi: Tailor killed for hitting dog with a brick, accused on run

According to police, the victim Afaq Ali (30), a tailor, was shot dead in a dark alley opposite Mehtab’s house. When I was taking him to the hospital, he told me Mehtab had shot him for hitting his dog with a brick because the animal was chasing him,” she claimed. AdvertisingThe FIR, filed by Shaukat, alleges that Ali told her: “When I hit the dog, Mehtab said ‘tune kutte ko ith kaise maar di, abhi bataata hoon tujhe’. With the accused, 34-year-old Mehtab, and his family on the run, Jack is now being looked after by neighbours, who drop by to feed it biscuits and rice. He then shot me.” Ali was rushed to GTB Hospital, where he was declared dead on arrival.
