CM orders police to complete double murder probe quickly

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday ordered the police to complete the investigation into the two double murder cases quickly and take strong action against the culprits.

Two double murders were reported on Tuesday at Netaji Nagar in the southern part of Kolkata and Narendrapur located in its southern fringes.

"Yesterday two families have died, one in Sonarpur and another in Netaji Nagar. I have asked the police to conduct investigations very seriously to find out what actually happened in detail and take take strong action against the culprits," Banerjee said.

"If someone has planned to encroach the property land by killing the couple staying there alone with nobody to look after them, then that will be not that easy. In Netaji Nagar busts of the couple will be put up so that people cannot take away that land. The locals must look into it," the chief minister told reporters at the state secretariat.

Further asking the panchayat and the municipalities to work in tandem to help curb such growing menaces, she said nobody, found guilty in the matter will be spared in such matters.

"I will request both panchayat and the municipalities to work under one umbrella in such cases," she said.

Bodies of an elderly childless couple - Dilip Mukherjee and Sapna Mukherjee - were found lying in a pool of blood on the first floor of their two-storied building at Netaji Nagar on Tuesday.

In Narendrapur, bodies of Pradip Biswas and his wife Alpana, were found inside two suitcases in the washroom of a house where they worked as caretakers on Tuesday.
