We should remain peaceful

#SMALL-IMAGE##The Pulwama attack is heart-wrenching for every Indian. As reports of attacks on Kashmiri students and residents emerged from various parts of India, is not good for the sake of the country. In this critical situation, we are duty-bound to maintain peace and communal harmony. A sinner's punishment can not be given a innocent man.

Some of the shocking developments in different parts of the country are unacceptable. Those who are seeding hatred, more enmity and disturbing communal harmony are the real enemies of India. They are spoiling the atmosphere of peace and the integrity of the nation. We need to act against them too just as we would handle external aggression.
