Days after Pulwama attack, MHA okays air travel on Jammu and Kashmir sector for security forces

New Delhi:

In the wake of the Pulmawa terror attack in which 40 CRPF jawans were killed, the home ministry on Thursday approved air travel for all the personnel of Central Armed Paramilitary Forces (CAPFs) in Jammu and Kashmir sector. The decision will immediately benefit approximately 7,80,000 personnel of CAPFs in the ranks of constable, head constable and ASI, who were otherwise not eligible earlier. This includes a journey on duty and journey on leave, i.e; while going on leave from Jammu and Kashmir to their hometowns and a return journey. This facility is, in addition, to the existing air courier services for CAPFs that have been steadily extended in all sectors by the MHA to help the jawans cut down on travel time during their journey to and fro from home on leave.

A statement from the home ministry said: "In the Jammu and Kashmir sector, it may be recalled that Air Courier Service for CAPFs jawans was approved for the Jammu-Srinagar-Jammu sector. Subsequently, the service was extended to cover 1) Delhi-Jammu, 2) Jammu-Srinagar, 3) Srinagar-Jammu and 3) Jammu-Delhi sector in December 2017. The number of flights was further extended in December 2018. In addition, air support is provided from Indian Air Force as and when required."

On February 14, 40 CRPF personnel were martyred when their convoy was attacked by an explosive-laden vehicle being driven by a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist. The convoy of over 70 vehicles was on its way from Jammu to Srinagar.
