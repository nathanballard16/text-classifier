At all-party meet, Opposition lauds IAF, tells government to not lower its guard against Pak

NEW DELHI: The Pakistan army “seems to be in denial while there is anger in the political class” as reflected in proceedings in Pakistan’s Parliament even as India emphasised that its actions were aimed against terror and not an act of military aggression, the government told an all-party meeting on Tuesday.A meeting convened by foreign minister Sushma Swaraj was told that the IAF’s strikes at a Jaish-e-Mohammed facility in Balakot in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa targeted Jaish commanders and fidayeen who were being trained for attacks in India.While the government did not spell out the numbers, political leaders were told that there were a large number of people present at the JeM camp which had several facilities for housing jihadis. The strike followed intelligence that more terror strikes being planned would be executed soon.Swaraj explained that she interacted with several foreign ministers including those of Afghanistan and Bangladesh and was headed for important meetings with Russian and Chinese ministers. She said she had spoken to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo National Conference leader Omar Abdullah said elections in J&K should not be delayed as this would play into the hands of forces opposed to India. He was supported by Congress’s Ghulam Nabi Azad while home minister Rajnath Singh said the Centre had conveyed its preparedness for polls to the Election Commission.Azad and Abdullah raised concerns over the prevailing conditions in J&K. Azad commended the government for conducting a “clean operation” and added that it must “keep in mind the internal situation”. Abdullah flagged the “panic” in J&K, fuelled by the deployment of security forces and escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.He said people were stockpiling supplies of fuel in the Valley, and the government should make arrangements to evacuate civilians if it received information of further tensions.The meeting saw all parties recording their appreciation of the IAF for carrying out the strike without any loss of life, but also advised the government to “not lower their guard” and remain vigilant in light of the “mixed signals” emerging from Pakistan in the aftermath of the air strikes.A section of opposition leaders sought clarity on which Balakot was targeted, the one in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or the one in Poonch in PoK, and also asked whether the government would show any videos of the air strikes. While Swaraj and Rajnath Singh clarified that the IAF had struck the “interior” target, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government could not divulge more details because it was a “secret operation”.Left leaders Sitaram Yechury and D Raja said the government must guard against “jingoism” and not allow passions to be whipped up. Yechury also cautioned the government against raising contentious issues like Articles 370 and 35A saying it will be counter productive and damaging. He also said the government should not allow attacks on Kashmiris living in other parts of India because this would only hurt India’s unity and integrity.
