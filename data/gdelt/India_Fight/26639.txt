New Delhi, May 22: Days after two gang wars in the national capital, a 27-year-old gym trainer, who was active on social media app TikTok, was shot dead by three men at a shop in outer Delhi's Najafgarh on Tuesday evening.

The police identified the deceased as Mohit Mor, who had over 5.17 lakh followers on TikTok. He hailed from Haryana's Bahadurgarh, but often stayed at his home in Najafgarh.

The incident occurred around 5.15 p.m. when Mohit Mor had gone to meet his friend at a photostat shop near his residence in Najafgarh's Dharmpura area.

Having lost his father earlier, Mor is survived by his mother and brother. The police are speaking to them to find out if they had any enemies or if he was involved in a confrontation in the recent past.
