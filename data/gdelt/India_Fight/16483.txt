Tweaks in Forest Act to give more immunity for gun use

NEW DELHI: The Centre’s first draft on comprehensive amendments to the Indian Forest Act (IFA), 1927, sent to states early this month for comments, has drawn flak from experts and forest rights activists who felt that giving more powers, including higher immunity for use of firearms, to forest officers can easily be misused.Experts believe that though certain provisions in the 123-page draft are relevant for promoting conservation and in bringing this British period law in sync with India’s current international commitment, excessive powers to forest bureaucracy would not only directly clash with decentralised governance mechanism but also turn the country’s forest into a police state.“The proposed amendments will directly clash with the decentralised governance mechanism enacted in the 2006 Forest Rights Act FRA ). These legal contradictions and their implications must be debated openly before any steps are taken to accept these amendments,” said Kanchi Kohli, a legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR).Citing an example, she noted that the exclusion of ‘village forests’ from the purview of the FRA is not just legally contradictory but can create huge governance confusions on the ground.The draft, carrying expanded definition of ‘forest’ and introducing a new category of ‘production forest’, also makes stronger provisions for immunity to forest officials where state government won’t be permitted to grant prosecution sanction without constituting an inquiry.“These amendments will turn India's forests - almost a quarter of the country's land area - into a police state where the interests of forest bureaucrats and private companies will reign supreme, ” said Shankar Gopalakrishnan, Uttarakhand-based forest and tribal rights activist.The ‘production forest’, as introduced in the draft, will be forests with specific objectives for production of timber, pulp, pulpwood, firewood, non-timber forest produce, medicinal plants or any forest species to increase production for a specified period.Referring to India’s current dependence on import to the tune of Rs 46,000 crore every year to meet its demand for wood, Ajay Kumar Saxena of the Network for Certification and Conservation of Forests (NCCF) said, “The idea of creating ‘production forests’ is catching imagination of all stakeholders while generating apprehensions also.“If the forest management in India practices this idea in true spirit, we can significantly reduce the quantum of wood imports as well as provide bio-resources and livelihood opportunities to millions of people depending on forests by the way of regeneration of degraded forests and wastelands.”The states are expected to submit their comments and suggestions to the environment ministry by June 7. A non-official member of the panel which prepared the draft said it was all part of the process before coming out with final draft which may even change substantially after incorporating suggestions from states and other stakeholders.
