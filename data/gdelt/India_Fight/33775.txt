Fabricated hand grenades recovered from Jamat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh terrorist

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has recovered hand grenades and raw material for improvised explosive devices (IED) from Bengaluru on Tuesday on direction of an arrested Jamat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB) member Habibur Rehman. All these arms and ammunition were kept hidden by Rehman, who was arrested in Bengaluru on June 25 and was later remanded to police custody by NIA Court in Kolkota in Burdwan blast case. He was absconding in the case.

The tip off about the whereabouts of Rehman came five years after the group carried out the 2014 blasts in West Bengal's Burdwan district.

With Rehman disclosing key elements of the group's operations to the NIA, the latter launched an operation against the group in Karnataka.

"There has been recovery of fabrication material for IED and hand grenades and other incriminating materials on the disclosure of Burdwan blast accused Habibur Rehman," said NIA spokesperson.

Based on the disclosure of Rehman, the NIA recovered five fabricated hand grenades, a timer device, three electric circuits, suspected explosive substance, different components for making IEDs and rockets.

"These hand grenades were fabricated as part of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts in different parts of the State. He (Rehman), along with other members of JMB, was involved in raising funds by committing dacoities in Bengaluru in 2018. The recovery has been made while Rehman is in police remand," the NIA spokesperson added.

While evading arrest, he was part of module of JMB, which intended to wage a war against the democratic set up of the state by conspiring to commit terrorist acts, the probe agency said..

The NIA has now registered a case, after recoveries under relevant sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
