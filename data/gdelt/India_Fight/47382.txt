45-50 Suicide Bombers Being Trained at Reactivated Balakot Camp - Indian Intelligence Report

Indian intelligence agencies have received inputs that about 45-50 terrorists, including suicide bombers, are being trained at the reactivated Balakot terror camp inside Pakistan.

The facility was reportedly destroyed by the Indian Air Force in an unprecedented air strike in February this year.

"Around 45-50 suicide bombers are training inside the Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist camp in the Balakot town of Pakistan", top government sources told the Indian news agency ANI.

Intelligence agencies also received inputs that some of the trained terrorists have already entered Indian territory. Last week, a red alert was issued across Indian airports after reports suggested that four terrorists from the proscribed militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed’s had entered Delhi. Indian intel agencies have been tracking the activities at the camp using its surveillance capability at the National Technical Research Organisation.
