VADODARA: A woman residing at a village under Kadana taluka in Mahisagar district of Gujarat killed her three daughters by throwing them in a well and then ended her life by jumping into it. It is suspected that she took the extreme step as she did not have a son.The incident took place in the early hours on Thursday at the Ditvas village. Mangu Damor (27) was found missing at her residence early in the morning. A relative from her husband’s side informed the family that he had seen a sweater and bedsheet near a well at the village.An offence registered at the Ditvas police station by Mangu’s husband Raman Damor states that he went to the well and saw the bodies of his three daughters – Sharmishtha (5), Sura (3) and Bhuri (1) – floating in the water. Mangu’s body was recovered later from the well after some water was pumped out of it.Raman told the police that he and Mangu had been married for seven years. Mangu was disturbed since Wednesday evening itself. She had been sitting silently and had not cooked food even as the eldest daughter Sharmishtha was hungry and was crying. Raman’s mother later cooked food.Mangu left home at around 8pm with the youngest daughter Bhuri and could not be located despite efforts by the family that looked for her both in Ditvas and nearby villagers. However, around midnight Mangu returned home and went to sleep. Raman has stated in the offence that Mangu may have been upset as she did not have a son.
