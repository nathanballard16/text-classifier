SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, Jan. 26 (Xinhua) -- Two militants were killed in a fierce gunfight with Indian troops Saturday in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, officials said.

The gunfight broke out at village Khunmoh on the outskirts of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Two militants were killed today in a fierce gunfight with government forces here," a senior police official posted in Srinagar said.

"We have recovered two assault rifles from the spot and retrieved their bodies."

The Gunfight in the village began after contingents of police, paramilitary and army cordoned off the entire area.

"As the searches were going on, the search party was fired upon by the militants, thereby triggering a gunfight," the official said.

According to officials, the village was cordoned off following specific intelligence information suggesting the presence of militants.

Police officials said the identity of the slain militants was being ascertained.

The gunfight broke out ahead of India's Republic Day celebrations in the restive region.

Authorities have beefed up security across the region and suspended mobile Internet services.

On Friday, a series of grenade attacks were carried out across the region. However, no major damage was reported.

Since the beginning of this week, nine militants were killed in three different gunfights across the region.

A guerilla war is going on between militants and Indian troopers stationed in the region since 1989.

Kashmir, the Himalayan region divided between India and Pakistan, is claimed by both in full. Since their independence from Britain, the two countries have fought three wars, two exclusively over Kashmir.
