Seven more bodies recovered at Kavalappara

Five of those belong to a family; two unidentified

Seven more bodies were recovered from the landslip-hit Kavalappara of Pothukal village, near Nilambur, in Malappuram district on Wednesday, taking the death toll to 30.

Of the bodies recovered on Wednesday, five belong to a family, including a child. The other two bodies could not be identified and were in a decomposed state. Officials believe that the persons also belonged to the same family.

Rain hampers search

The search operation on Wednesday began at 7.30 a.m. but had to be suspended for an hour following heavy rain. At least 29 persons are still missing. Debris from a landslip at the Muthappan hill covered the Boothanam colony on August 8.

Braving multiple odds, the rescue teams, including the Army, National Disaster Response Force, Department of Fire and Rescue Services and police personnel, numbering about 400, were battling to retrieve the bodies.

The flattened 50 acres of the landslip site has been divided into a dozen sections for search operations. Volunteers from different agencies who are trained in rescue and disaster management and local people are assisting the search teams.

The patchy drizzle throughout the day and the sudden downpour at times hampered the operations which had to be wound up at 6 p.m. The search would continue on Thursday though the India Meteorological Department has predicted heavy rainfall in Malappuram district.

Landslip chances

On Wednesday, the weather appeared totally unfavourable. Besides, apprehensions of further landslips in the region have not been ruled out. People from the other side of the hill have been evacuated in the wake of huge cracks formed in that zone. The district machinery has facilitated the search teams with additional vehicles and equipment, including JCB and Hitachi earthmovers. The debris and broken trees from the landslip area are being shifted to an identified forest area in the vicinity.
