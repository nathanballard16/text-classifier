Leopard found dead in Mahuva

SURAT: A one-and-half-year-old female leopard was found dead under suspicious circumstances near Kakariya village of Mahuva taluka in Surat district on Wednesday. Villagers were the first to spot the carcass because of a foul smell.There were no external injury marks on the carcass of the leopard and this had left the forest officials surprised. They suspected that the leopard might have been poisoned but preliminary examination by a veterinary doctor ruled out poisoning.“Since it was a young leopard, detailed postmortem is being done. Preliminary examination has not shown any signs of poisoning. Thus we are doing a detailed investigation into its death,” deputy conservator of forest, Puneet Nayyar told TOI.The teeth and claws of the leopard were found intact. The carcass was not decomposed but had started to emanate a foul smell. Forest officials claimed that the leopard might have died a day before. The carcass was taken by them to Mahuva for postmortem.“The exact cause of the death is not yet clear, but it seems that the big cat had died of organ failure. Postmortem will reveal the exact reason for its death. So far it looks like a natural death,” Nayyar added. Forest officials initiated the investigation since death of a young leopard is rare. Veterinary doctors would also see whether the leopard had starved to death by any reason.Forest officials informed that there were no calls about leopard sighting around Kakariya village during the past seven days. There were information about movement of leopards in some other villages but not about this specific big cat.
