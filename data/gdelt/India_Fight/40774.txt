Ranveer's fan Kiran, knows him well and so does he, and so, he decided to visit her house and give her a surprise. She shared about her experience on social media, and wrote, “I literally jumped & ran into my kitchen/conservatory & hid. My hubby answered the door & I could hear Ranveer he was like where is she, where is my precious one or special one something along those lines. Hubby said she is hiding in kitchen I think and Ranveer made his way in.” She added, “Ranveer Singh was in my house. Like omg I was pinching myself. He came around into the kitchen and I froze and had my face covered laughing/holding back tears. He was like OMG let me look at you my Kiran. Wow! And he hugged me and blessed my baby bump. We hugged and spoke some more and then I invited him into my living room and he sat in the middle of my hubby and me. He had his arms around both of us and we just talked and talked and he blessed us both.” In one of her tweets she also thanked him and wrote how this will be a story she would tell her children about.Take a look below:
