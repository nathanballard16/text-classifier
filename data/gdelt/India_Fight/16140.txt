US state department concerned about those not in NRC

NEW DELHI: The US state department in a report raised concerns over fate of persons excluded from the national register of citizens in Assam and singled out BJP chief Amit Shah ’s speech where he described illegal immigrants from Bangladesh as “termites” as a case of erosion of India’s economic and social fabric.In its annual report on human rights, the US report said NRC exclusions have “lead to uncertainty over the status of these individuals, many of whose families had lived in the state for several generations”.Observing that the Supreme Court is overseeing the process (the apex court has mandated NRC), the State Department commented, “On September 24, ruling BJP party president Amit Shah called Bangladeshis who may be in Assam ‘termites’ who will be struck from the list of citizens.”The remark had, at the time, created some disquiet in Bangladesh over whether India might push these eventually stateless persons into their country, already battling an influx of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar The annual report criticised both “militant/terrorist” killings as of journalist Shujaat Bukhari as well as custodial deaths and alleged state oppression as human rights abuses. “Killings by government and non-government forces, including organized insurgents and terrorists, were reported in the state of Jammu and Kashmir , northeastern states, and Maoist-affected areas of the country.”Quoting the Institute for Conflict Management, it said, “In the state of Jammu and Kashmir, the Institute recorded 213 fatalities from terrorist violence through June, compared with 317 for all of 2017.”Media freedom, and growing intimidation of journalists by government agencies as well as extremists finds mention. “… there were several instances in which the government or actors considered close to the government allegedly pressured or harassed media outlets critical of the government, including through online trolling. There were also reports of extremists perpetrating acts of killing, violence, and intimidation against journalists critical of the government.”Political prisoners, the report observed, are fairly numerous — “according to the Jammu and Kashmir High Court Bar Association, political prisoners made up one-half of all state detainees.”The law, the report observes, prohibits torture, but notes that there are reports that government officials, specifically police, employed such practices. The instance of Rakbar Khan, killed on suspicion of cattle smuggling, was detailed as is the callousness of the police supposed to take him to hospital. The report quoted media sources saying the policemen stopped to have tea en route to the hospital, with the result that Khan arrived dead at the hospital.
