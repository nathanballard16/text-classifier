Mangaluru, Jun 15: The Mangaluru city police have finally managed to arrest notorious underworld rowdy Asgar Ali, who had fled to Dubai in 2007 on a fake passport.

A native of Ullal on the outskirts of Mangaluru, Asgar is an accused in at least 9 criminal cases including 2 sensational murder cases.
