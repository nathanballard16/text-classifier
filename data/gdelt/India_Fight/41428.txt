Pakistan To Make A Comic Film On Wing Commander Abhinandan After Bollywood Plans One On Balakot

Bollywood has been on the forefront as far as real life storytelling is concerned. Whether it was Uri, Shahid or a Sarabjit, the filmmakers have the art to pick up subjects that touch the chord with the audience.

Recently, Vivek Oberoi also announced that he will be making a movie on IAF Abhinandan and his life after the release. "As a proud Indian, a patriot, and a member of the film fraternity, it's my duty to highlight what our Armed Forces are truly capable of.

In the form of a trilingual, this film is a powerful tool to underline the achievements of brave officers like Wing Commander Abhinandan, who went behind the enemy lines and did what makes every Indian proud of them," said Vivek to IANS.

Titled Balakot, the film will be based on the air strikes as well as the capture and subsequent release of IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman in the aftermath of the terror attack in Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.

And now, as per reports, Pakistan film fraternity also plan to make a comedy film on the same subject. Taking a dig at Bollywood, the makers start shooting from next month onwards.

According to Dunya News, actor Abbasi confirmed the news, saying, "What is to come will be a surprise for his fans and the Pakistani audience." Further report states that the film will be released on February 27, 2020, which is the same date on which the Indian pilot was captured by Pakistan.
