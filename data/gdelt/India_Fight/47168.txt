Modi Govt Has Zero-Tolerance On Custodial Deaths, Police Atrocities: Amit Shah

New Delhi:

Union Home Minister Amit Shah on Saturday hailed the Narendra Modi government of working “extensively to protect the human rights”, saying the Central government has zero-tolerance on custodial deaths, extra-judicial deaths, and police atrocities.

"The Modi government has worked on various fronts on human rights. After Independence, the Modi government worked on human rights matter," Shah said at the 26th foundation day celebrations of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in Delhi.

Shah also said it was the first time that a government, from 2014, worked on the human rights matter.

"The government is providing electricity to households, free medical services, and gas connections. Providing toilets is also the human rights of people and the Modi government has done a massive work in the direction to provide these rights to the people," he said.

On Jammu and Kashmir, Shah said: "40,000 civilians have been killed since Independence in Kashmir by terrorists. Is that not an attack against human rights? I would like to ask, do the families of people who died due to terrorism in Kashmir have no human rights?"

"I believe that people being affected by terrorism and Naxal attacks is a human rights issue and should be looked at. We have zero-tolerance against extra-judicial deaths, police atrocities but we should also concentrate equally on terrorism because that's the biggest attack against the human rights," he said.
