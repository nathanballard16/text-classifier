Vadodara: Three persons were killed and two others injured when two motorcycles met with a head-on collision in the Shehra taluka of Panchmahal district late on Monday night.

Five persons were injured in the incident, of whom three were later declared dead. The deceased include Rakesh Raval (23), a resident of Gangadiya village, Nathu Vanzara (20), a resident of Kavali village, and Deepak Vanzara (18), a resident of Tadva village. Rinku Raval and Bhavesh Raval were seriously injured and sent to Vadodara for treatment.

Rakesh and his wife Rinku had gone to her home in Bordi village, from where Rinku’s brother Bhavesh joined them to see garba.

Sources said that at some distance away from the motorcycles, a car also went up in flames around the same time as the accident. The fire led to speculation if the car was also involved in the accident in some way.
