Alia Bhatt’s New Year getaway

Alia Bhatt has begun shooting for Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Gangubai Kathiawadi, and has taken a break early into the schedule to bring in the New Year with beau Ranbir Kapoor.

The actress was spotted at the airport on the weekend, ready to jet off with Ranbir. “They were heading for Bangkok to ring in the New Year. While Alia seemed a bit lost, Ranbir was in a nice mood, he even wished all the paparazzos a happy New Year before he entered the airport. Something seemed to be amiss with Alia, as she was not too happy with some papers that she had as she cleared the security. Her face had a sad expression as she was checking her passport as well,” says a source.

Alia is expected to return to Mumbai and continue shooting for Gangubai. This break will surely rejuvenate her before she returns to play the role of the young girl who was sold to a brothel in Mumbai’s Kamathipura and then went on to get the most nefarious people from the Mumbai underworld as her clientele.
