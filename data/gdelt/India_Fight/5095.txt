3 of 4 major government hospitals in Noida lack basic fire safety tools

Noida: Three of the four major government hospitals in the district don’t have NOCs from the fire department, officials told TOI on Friday. These are the district hospital in Sector 30, the ESIC Model Hospital in Sector 24 and the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Kasna.While the district hospital, which sees a daily footfall of over 3,000 patients, does not have many of the equipment functional, the ESIC hospital is yet to apply for an NOC, while GIMS Kasna is also waiting to get the required equipment from the Greater Noida Authority.Fire safety officer-I Kuldeep Kumar said the district hospital does not have the mandatory underground pump system.But the district hospital’s Dr Ajai Agrawal said that the hospital is expected to shift to the new building coming up in Sector 39. “The new building has an NOC and fire-fighting equipment in place,” he said.ESIC Model hospital, too, does not have the NOC so far, despite a thrust by the central government for mandatory compliance after at least six persons were killed in a blaze in Mumbai’s ESIC hospital. Hospital director Dr Anish Singhal said they have given a contract for getting the fire-safety equipment.Further, Kasna’s GIMS, where hundreds of patients turn up from the rural belt, too does not have a an NOC from the fire department. “We have written to the Greater Noida Authority multiple times for the fire safety equipment but it has said we have to arrange the same,” said GIMS director RK Gupta.
