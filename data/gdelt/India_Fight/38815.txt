DMRC staffer found dead in rented house

He was streaming live on social media during the incident

A 27-year-old man working as a maintenance staff with the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) was found dead inside his rented accommodation in Shahdara’s Farsh Bazar on Sunday morning. The man from West Bengal was live on social media during the incident.

No note has been recovered, said the police.

“A PCR call was received at 9.05 a.m. from the friend of the deceased. He said that his friend had hanged himself,” a police officer said. The friend of the deceased allegedly told the police that he received a call around 8 a.m. from an acquaintance who informed him that the man, wearing his DMRC uniform, had ended his life live on Facebook. The friend rushed to the house of the deceased from where he called the police.

Death by hanging

When the police reached the spot, the room on the second floor was found closed from inside. The door was broken and the man was found dead. It was death by hanging, said an officer.

The mobile phone of the deceased has been seized for further investigation.

“His family has been informed,” the officer said, adding that the body has been shifted to Sabzi Mandi mortuary for post-mortem. The police said inquest proceedings into the incident have been initiated and statements have been recorded.

A senior officer said though the reason behind the step is yet to be ascertained it is suspected that the man might not have realised the consequences of the act as he was also seen laughing at one point in the video.
