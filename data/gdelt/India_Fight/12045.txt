Centre should provide ‘solid proof’ of IAF air strike: Digvijaya Singh

Indore: Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh said the central government should provide ‘solid proof’ of the IAF air strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s terror camp in Pakistan’s Balakot.

“I am not raising questions on the operation, but this is the technical age and satellite pictures are possible. Like USA had given solid proof of the Osama bin Laden operation to the world, we should also do it for our air strike,” Singh said addressing media here on Saturday.

West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had on Thursday asked the central government to spell out “details” of the exact place where the air raids were carried out and the casualties inflicted as international media has claimed that there was no damage in the strikes.

“We, as the Opposition, want to know the details of the air strike. Where were the bombs dropped? How many people died? I was reading the New York Times and Washington Post and they said that there were no casualties. Some media houses said one died. We want to know the details,” Banerjee had told reporters in Kolkata.

Tension spiraled between India and Pakistan after the Indian Air Force on February 26 carried out a strike at a Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) terror training camp in Balakot. The strikes were in response to the terror attack in Pulwama in which about 40 CRPF personnel lost their lives. JeM had claimed the responsibility of the attack.
