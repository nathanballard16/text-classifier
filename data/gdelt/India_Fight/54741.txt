Jaipur: Following a dispute over 'missing buffalo' among people of two villages, a man was killed in Rajasthan's Sawai Madhopur Bharawanda Kalan area on Sunday morning.

The scuffle broke out after around half-a-dozen men came to Nathpura village in search of their missing buffalo. One of the members from the group opened fire in which one youth was shot dead while some of the other members sustained injuries.

The deceased was identified as 22-year-old Dharam Singh Gujjar. According to a report in The Times of India, Sawai Madhopur police circle officer Rakesh Rajora said that on Sunday morning few men from the other village reached Nathpura and claimed that their missing bovine was seen there. The heated argument between the men soon turned violent and the accused opened fire killing the youth.

Reportedly, so far the police have arrested two accused in the case who were also injured during the scuffle. The rest of the injured villagers have been shifted to a local hospital and are undergoing treatment. Rajora further added that the missing cattle appears to be the only reason for the dispute. While the villagers (where the incident happened) claimed that there was no buffalo from the other village but defying their claim the accused villagers stated that their buffalo was with them.

However, the accused have been booked under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code.
