Days ahead of Easter, a group of 20 children between the age group of 4 to 12 years, dressed in chick costumes volunteered to support People’s for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) India’s cause. The children were seen holding up sign boards that read ‘Baby chickens are killed for eggs. Try Vegan’, at the Panaji market.

PETA India campaigns coordinator, Ayushi Sharma said: “We are here in Goa with a bunch of children (locals) who have dressed themselves as baby chicks to tell people that baby chicks are killed for eggs in hatcheries and farms.”

She added that male baby chicks who cannot lay eggs are considered as waste and are killed in gruesome ways. “We conduct demonstrations all over India and today we are here with a message to try a vegan lifestyle and avoid harming animals,” she said.
