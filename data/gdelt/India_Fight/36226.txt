GHMC to produce manure and power from animal waste

The Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation is in talks with the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre on implementing technologies to produce manure and power from animal waste.

GHMC Commissioner Dana Kishore held a meeting here Friday with BARC officials on the matter, a GHMC release said.

The corporation is maintaining slaughter houses at Ramnaspur, Amberpet, Jiyaguda and New Boiguda and nearly 100 tons of animal waste is produced daily, according to the release.

"From these waste, it is proposed to generate manure and power by installing compost plants at each slaughter house," the release said.

"The BARC officials submitted proposals to GHMC on installation of these plants at minimum cost," it said.

As the GHMC collects waste from chicken and fish stall centres, the commissioner instructed the solid waste management officials to study the feasibility of having compost units at 17 transfer stations of GHMC, it said.

The GHMC is taking steps to establish compost units, as per solid waste management norms 2016 of 'Reduce, Reuse and Re-cycle,' it said.

The commissioner said he and other officials would visit and study the projects being implemented by BARC in and around Mumbai, according to the release.
