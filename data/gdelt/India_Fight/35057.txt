NSG Mumbai gets Composite Indoor Shooting Range to hone shooting skills

Maharashtra's first Composite Indoor Shooting Range (CISR) was inaugurated on Thursday at the National Security Guard (NSG) in Mumbai. Named after 26/11 martyr Major Unnikrishnan, the facility is for elite 'Black Cat' commandos to hone their shooting skills.

There are only seven such facilities in India. The Mumbai facility was inaugurated by Union Minister of State (Mos) for Home Nityanand Rai in presence of Sudeep Lakhtakia, Director General, NSG.

This will enable the NSG soldiers to practice advanced shooting on a regular basis. This CISR is customised to acquaint us with all types of practices. Earlier, the force was sent to Manesar for this training, but now it can be done in Mumbai itself.

The project was executed by Aimtrex Technologies.

"We are honoured to have been given the opportunity to work with the elite 'Black Cats' for such a landmark project. This is our seventh firearms training facility in India and the most advanced to date. And we are especially proud to have executed this with indigenously developed and manufactured technologies," Aseem Yadav, Managing Director of the Delhi based company.

NSG's Mumbai hub currently has a force of more than 400 and it is growing in size since its inception in 2009, after the Mumbai terror attacks.
