Punjab: Married Couple Attacked, Shot Dead by Family Members

New Delhi: In a case of alleged ‘honour killing’ a married couple was killed by relatives of the wife in Punjab’s Tarn Taran district on Sunday. Amanpreet Kaur (23) and Amandeep Singh (24) had married in August 2018, against the wishes of some members of the former’s family.

According to Hindustan Times, the couple were staying at Naushehra Dhala, a village near the India-Pakistan border, about 40 km away from Tarn Taran. Media reports suggest that Kaur’s cousins were responsible for the murder and that her parents did not have any link to the killings.

Kaur and Singh were on their way home after visiting a gurdwara near Chabhal town on Sunday morning when Kaur’s relatives forced them into a car. Amandeep Singh’s father Sukhdev Singh told Hindustan Times that he heard gunshots outside his home at around 8:30 am. “I rushed out to see my son and his wife, lying on the ground in a pool of blood. I also saw a Maruti Suzuki Swift car leaving the spot,” he said.

Amandeep Singh died on the spot while Kaur was declared dead at a private hospital.

Tarn Taran’s deputy superintendent of police Kawaljit Singh told the media that the couple was hacked and then shot. India Today reported that the couple was intentionally run over by a car and were cut with a sharp-edged weapon before being shot from a close range.

Ten people, including four relatives of Kaur have been charged by the police.

Amarjit Singh and Gurjit Kaur, the deceased woman’s parents, were also questioned by the police. According to Hindustan Times, Amarjit Singh said, “The couple was killed by my nephews (brother’s sons) and their accomplices, even as we had accepted the love marriage.” The DSP said that the police have not found any link between Amanpreet’s parents and the killings.
