New Delhi: The Delhi police is all set to upload the IEMI details of 311 stolen phones it recovered after a raid in Nepal. The move will help people to locate their mobile phones stolen in the last twelve months.

The Delhi Police has recently busted an international racket of mobile phone thieves and arrested seven persons from Nepal.

According to police, the stolen or snatched phones were sent to Nepal after they were temporarily kept with the second-hand mobile phone sellers in Karol Bagh.

The entire racket involved thieves, couriers, middlemen and finally the buyer of the phones based in Nepal, says a report in The Times of India.

The racket was busted after police probed a snatching incident at Connaught Place last week. A woman reported to police that a boy driving Honda Activa snatched her phone when she was shopping in the Connaught Place area

The police managed to get crack the whip against the racket after a tipoff about the gang.

"A team comprising ACP Jasbir Singh, inspector Gurmeet Singh and others was formed to investigate the racket based on the informer’s tipoff,” the report quoted DCP (crime and legal cell) Rajesh Deo as saying.

During the course of the investigation, the police found that the Nepalese receiver of stolen phones had a man in Delhi, who used to coordinate the movements of the phones from India to Nepal.

The accused told police that they had been working as mobile repair technicians in the Gaffar Market. Nepal had been a lucrative market for stolen phones as the IMEI search of the phones is restricted within India.
