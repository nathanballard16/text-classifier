Search on for two in killing of Muthoot Fincorp manager

A manhunt is on for the two of the accused involved in the killing of a Ghaziabad-based manager of Muthoot Fincorp, police said on Wednesday.

The company's Ghaziabad branch manager Aazaad was killed on June 20 by four men including his cousin after a failed gold robbery bid, the police said.

"Sunil and Deepak had accompanied the key accused and Aazaad during the drinks. They were part of this gold robbery bid and had also gone to the Ghaziabad office on Muthoot Fincorp on the night of June 20," Gautam Buddh Nagar Senior Superintendent of Police Vaibhav Krishna said.

"Our teams are working and searches are underway to nab the absconding men. We have got clues about them and they would be arrested soon," Krishna told PTI.

The killing resulted from a failed conspiracy of robbing the company's gold from its vault in its Ghaziabad branch, the police said.

"Aazaad's body with bullet injuries was found near a culvert in Badalpur police station area on June 20. It was a blind murder case and investigation was taken up leading to the arrest of two accused now," the SSP had said.

Those held have been identified as Parwinder, Aazaad's cousin and key accused, and Chamanlal Kashyap, he added.
