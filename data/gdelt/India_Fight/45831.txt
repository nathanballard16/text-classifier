A.P. gang behind theft of mobiles in buses arrested

They committed the robbery during weekdays and returned to their hometown on weekends to sell the stolen phones

A special team attached to the Flower Bazaar police district nabbed a 10-member gang from Andhra Pradesh that stole cellphones from bus passengers. They committed the robbery during weekdays and returned to their hometown on weekends to sell the stolen phones, police said.

A police team travelled in buses between Tambaram and Chennai Central where such crimes were reported frequently. They tracked the gang for six months and recently managed to nab one of its members near Central railway station. The accused revealed that nine others from his gang were staying in a rented house in Gandhi Nagar, Red Hills.

The police raided the house and arrested them. They are all in their mid-twenties. During interrogation, they revealed that the kingpin was Ravi from Rajahmundry.

“Initially, Ravi brings his wife and takes a house on rent. He sends his wife back and his gang starts staying in the house. Prior to Red Hills, they were staying in Tambaram and Avadi,” said Assistant Commissioner S. Lakshmanan.
