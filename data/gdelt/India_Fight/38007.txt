NDMC issues directive to prevent slaughtered animals' blood from flowing into Yamuna on Eid

The North Delhi Municipal Corporation (NDMC) has issued directions to prevent the blood animals slaughtered on Eid from flowing directly into the Yamuna river.

In an order dated August 5, the civic body said the Ghazipur abattoir under the East Delhi Municipal Corporation remains functional on Eid and any person "intending to offer sacrifice of sheep, goat and buffaloes on the religious occasion should utilise the facilities provided at the slaughterhouse".

"It is mandatory for persons preferring to sacrifice sheep, goats and buffaloes in their premises to ensure hygienic disposal of the biological/organic waste of the sacrificed animals in an environment-friendly manner," the order read.

Non-compliance of the order will attract penalty, as decided by the National Green Tribunal, for polluting the and the Yamuna river, said Y Kumar, Deputy Director of the NDMC's veterinary services.

Slaughtering of animals at private places is not allowed, barring on the occasion of Eid. Meat shop owners in the national capital can slaughter animals at the EDMC's abattoir only, he said.

The NGT-appointed Yamuna Monitoring Committee said the EDMC and SDMC have not yet issued any orders regarding slaughter of animals.

The green tribunal had in September 2015 ordered the Delhi Pollution Control Committee and Delhi government to "ensure that no blood of slaughtered animals is allowed to flow directly into the Yamuna".
