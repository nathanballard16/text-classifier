Monster Cyclone Fani batters eastern India

At least eight people were killed on Friday as Cyclone Fani, the biggest in years, slammed into eastern India, sending trees flying and cutting off power, water and telecommunications. The monster weather system made landfall in Puri in the morning, with winds gusting at up to 200 kilometres per hour. Authorities in Odisha, where 10,000 people perished in a 1999 cyclone, evacuated more than a million. Meanwhile, authorities in Bangladesh, where Fani was headed, said a woman was killed, also by a tree, and that 14 villages were inundated. Disaster management spokesman Mohammad Jahir said 400,000 people from Bangladeshi coastal villages have been taken to shelters. Hundreds of thousands more people in India’s West Bengal state have also been given orders to flee.
