Chennai: A sub-inspector was allegedly attacked on duty in Chennai on Saturday, June 9. The cop had gone to a bar in Kolathur to investigate a murder case when he was allegedly attacked with a beer bottle.

The cop had gone to investigate a week-old murder case. The incident had come to light after the body of a man was found by the police. The police were suspecting the murder to be a result of personal enmity.

The sub-inspector was identified as Antony Ramesh. It was suspected that the gang which was involved in the alleged murder was visiting the bar. Ramesh and some other cops had gone to the bar after receiving the said information.

When the police team did not find the suspects in the bar, they started scanning the CCTV footage. The police then parked their vehicle and started interrogating people. The police then noticed a man who was consuming alcohol and throwing stones at the passersby.

After they noticed the man, Ramesh stepped out of the vehicle and asked the accused to leave the area. According to the Times of India's report, the accused was identified as Sathish Kumar. Allegedly, Kumar refused to leave and started arguing with Ramesh. Following the argument, Kumar went inside the bar and came out with a beer bottle.

Kumar allegedly smashed the beer bottles on Ramesh's head. Ramesh was on a phone call when he was attacked. Kumar was arrested by the cops accompanying Ramesh. Ramesh was taken to the Stanley Medical College Hospital.
