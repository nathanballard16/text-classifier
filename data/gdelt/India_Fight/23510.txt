The 'Baaghi' actor recently wrapped up shooting the first schedule of the film in Punjab and commenced the London Schedule in February.

Many thought the film would be titled 'ABCD 3' as it's the third installment in the 'ABCD' series. However, with the title of the film, it's clear now that this one is a different dance film in 3D.

Shraddha is also reuniting with Varun Dhawan in the upcoming dance film. The two had shared screen space in 'ABCD 2'.

Along with the lead pair, the upcoming film also features Nora Fatehi, Aparshakti Khurana and Shakti Mohan in pivotal roles.

According to various media reports, Shraddha will be seen as a dancer from Pakistan, while Varun will be playing a dancer from Punjab.

Produced by Bhushan Kumar, Lizelle D'Souza and Krishan Kumar, the film is all set to hit theatres on November 8.

Varun was last seen in 'Kalank', while Shraddha has three films in her kitty including 'Saaho', 'Chhicchore', and Saina (Saina Nehwal's biopic). (ANI)
