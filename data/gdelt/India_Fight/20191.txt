Deepika Padukone has company on the sets as she shoots for Chhapaak in the capital city

Deepika Padukone is currently in the capital as she is shooting for her film with Vikrant Massey, Chhapaak. Pictures of Deepika from the sets keep coming in and while they aren't all that clear, we can't help but zoom in on all those leaked videos and pictures that do the rounds on the internet. Having said that, the first look of Deepika as Malti was much appreciated and fans of the actress have been highly anticipating the film's release.

While DP has been in Delhi for quite some time now, she has not been a part of many events in Mumbai and is away from husband Ranveer Singh. Ranveer returned from Dharamshala just yesterday and has been busy prepping up for his upcoming Kapil Dev biopic, '83. But, Deepika had a visitor on the sets of her movie as sister Anisha Padukone visited her on the sets. Staying away for work can often get overwhelming and we bet the two of them are having a ball of a time together.
