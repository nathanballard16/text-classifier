VADODARA: A day after arresting four people for running a racket of concocting blood test reports of patients, Vadodara rural police arrested a homeopath for practicing allopathy at his clinic in Dabka village of Padra taluka.

Cops from Vadu police station raided Santram Clinic based on a tip-off on Thursday afternoon. On entering the clinic, police found homeopathy medicines in the front room and the accused doctor Yogesh Bhatt. When the cops checked other rooms of the clinic, they found injections, syringes, syrups, lotions and tablets which are prescribed by a doctor practicing allopathy.

Policemen then asked Bhatt to show his license and a degree certificate which he holds. But when Bhatt could not produce any document, he was arrested and booked under the Gujarat Medical Practice Act.

“We had received complaint from several citizens that Bhatt is practicing without any license and that he is a quack. After proper information from our sources, we raided his clinic and found the medicines which he is not allowed to prescribe,” said a police official.
