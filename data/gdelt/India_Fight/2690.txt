New Delhi, jan 22: The probe into the Amarnath Yatra attack has thrown up a shocking revelation. It has been found that the vehicle of PDP MLA from Jammu and Kashmir was alleged used in the attack.

The NIA wrote a letter to the Additional Director General of Police, Jammu and Kashmir in which this revelation was made. The NIA's letter states that it had come to their notice that the vehicle of Aijaz Mir was used to attack the pilgrims of the Amarnath Yatra. It may be recalled that 8 pilgrims were killed on July 10 2017 after terrorists carried out the attack.
