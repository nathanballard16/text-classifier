The Indian government has handed over to Pakistan a dossier detailing terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed's role in the Pulwama attack that killed 40 CRPF jawans on February 14.

The dossier also details the presence of JeM terror camps as well its top leadership within the territory of Pakistan. The move comes after Pakistan had demanded India provide "actionable evidence" on the Pulwama terror attack.

Through the dossier, India conveyed that it expects Pakistan to take immediate and verifiable action against terrorism emanating from territories under its control.

India handed over the dossier to the acting high commissioner of Pakistan Syed Haider Shah who was summoned by the Ministry of External Affairs earlier in the day. The MEA lodged a strong protest against the crossing of LoC by Pakistani jets on February 27.

India said Pakistan's act of aggression was unprovoked and was in contrast to India's non-military airstrikes on the Balakot JeM camp on February 26.

India also called on Pakistan to ensure that no harm comes to Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman who is in Pakistani custody. His safe and immediate return was also stressed upon.

On February 24, Pakistan Prime Minister urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to "give peace a chance". Imran Khan said he "stand by his words" and Pakistan will "immediately act" if India provides "actionable intelligence" on the Pulwama terror attack.

India had however called Pakistan's demand for proof a "lame excuse". "It is a well-known fact that Jaish-e-Mohammad and its leader Masood Azhar are based in Pakistan. These should be sufficient proof for Pakistan to take action," the Ministry of External Affairs had said.
