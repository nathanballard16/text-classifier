New Delhi: Jammu and Kashmir police official Arshad Khan, on Sunday, succumbed to his injuries sustained during a terror attack in Anantnag on Wednesday.

Khan, who suffered bullet injuries during an encounter with terrorists, was admitted to Delhi’s premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) this afternoon in a critical condition, media reports.

He was the Station House Officer (SHO) of Saddar Police station in Anantnag.

On Wednesday, a Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terrorist targeted a patrol team of the CRPF, killing five personnel of the paramilitary force.

After the encounter broke out, military and security personnel posted in nearby areas reached the spot to tackle the terrorists.

Khan, who also rushed to the site was fired upon by them soon after he stepped out of his official bulletproof vehicle.

One of the terrorists was gunned down in the fierce gun battle with the security officials.

Several people, including a civilian, also suffered injuries during the crossfire.

The banned terrorist outfit Al-Umar Mujahideen claimed the responsibility for the attack. The outfit which was formed in 1989 became dormant after the arrest of its founder Mustaq Ahmed Zargar alias ‘Mustaq Latram’. Zargar was arrested in 1992.
