Now Maruti Suzuki engineers to help investigation agencies in probing Pulwama attack

Srinagar

After the National Investigation Agency (NIA) and National Security Agency (NSA), the authorities are also taking the help of Maruti Suzuki engineers to identify the owners of the Eeco van used in the blast, media reports claimed.

A metal plate having some numbers on it was found from the blast site. The engineers, who travelled to Srinagar on Monday, are now ascertaining the vehicle’s year of manufacturing, the showroom it was supplied to and the person who bought it, Times of India reported.

The video clip of bomber Adil Ahmad Dar, through which JeM claimed responsibility for the attack, is also being examined by experts from the Chandigarh forensic laboratory as he appears to be reading a script. “The video is being examined for any superimposition, voiceover and modulation,” Times of India quoted an officer as saying.

On February 14, 49 paramilitary troopers were killed in a car bomb attack, claimed by the JeM outfit in Lethpora Awantipora area of south Kashmir’s Pulwama district.
