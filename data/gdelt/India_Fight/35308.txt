Year after Rinkle’s death, family’s struggle for justice continues

Ludhiana: One year after Jagdeep Singh (23) alias Rinkle Khera was assaulted and fatally injured, allegedly by a councillor’s son and his accomplices, his family members claimed they were dissatisfied with the police probe into his killing. The family members also claimed cops were trying to pressurise them for a compromise.

On July 19 last year, Khera died after he was allegedly assaulted by Jatinder Pal Singh Sunny, the son of councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu and his accomplices. Police had booked the accused persons for murder at Division 2 police station. He added that the family would continue to press for Neetu’s arrest.

Rinkle’s brother Mani Khera, said the family would continue their struggle for justice. On his first death anniversary, the family had organised a langar at Amarpura Chowk on Friday morning, to pray for peace to his soul. He also claimed the police had lodged a false case against him and other witnesses in the case in a bid to pressurize them for a compromise. One of the accused was declared a proclaimed offender by the court on May 10, and the court had directed the police to initiate similar proceedings against three other accused in the case.

However, cops have been maintaining that a fair probe was being conducted in the case. On July 19 last year, BJP worker Rinkle was allegedly attacked by contract killers from the Sheru gang — who, Rinkle’s family members claimed — were allegedly hired by Congress councillor Neetu’s son Sunny. Political rivalry between Rinkle and Sunny was building up around the municipal corporation polls in Ludhiana. Rinkle died undergoing treatment, and three days later, on July 22, Sunny surrendered to CIA in the afternoon.
