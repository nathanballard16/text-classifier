SIT to take Dutch help in retrieving pistol used in murders of Gauri Lankesh and MM Kalburgi

Express News ServiceBENGALURU: The Karnataka Special Investigation Team (SIT), which is probing the two sensational murder cases of Kannada littérateur M M Kalburgi and editor-activist Gauri Lankesh may soon get a critical piece of evidence-the contraband 7.65 mm pistol used in the murders. An SIT official said that to retrieve the weapon, which could be crucial evidence, machinery from a Netherlands-based private company in Mumbai will be roped in. The machinery will be used for dredging, probing and filtering, he said. We hope to start work before monsoon arrives as the weapon is indigenous and could erode quickly, destroying the evidence,” a senior SIT official told The New Indian Express. He is an accused in the Gauri, Kalburgi and Kolhapur-based Communist leader Govind Pansare murder cases as well.
