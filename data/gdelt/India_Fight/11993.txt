What lies ahead?

A suicide attack on Indian paramilitary forces, which resulted in the death of 40 soldiers, in the highly militarised Indian Occupied Kashmir has escalated military tensions between India and Pakistan. After blaming Pakistan for the attack and without providing substantial evidence that could corroborate with its claim, India violated the LoC and entered into Pakistani territory. Pakistan’s timely response averted any disaster. India miscalculated the situation and assumed that Pakistan wouldn’t retaliate. But Pakistan was forced to strike back, as a result of which it shot down two Indian fighter planes and captured one Indian pilot.

Since the Pulwama attack, Pakistan has asked India to deescalate the situation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is on a completely different tangent. In the hopes of seeking a second term in office, Modi is putting the entire South Asian region at stake. The two nuclear-armed neighbours cannot afford war, it’s a given. If it breaks out, its results will be disastrous. Cities will be obliterated and not a single life will be left to mourn over the devastation. Pakistan understands it and this is why it has adopted a pro-peace stance. Modi should accept Pakistan’s offer and resolve the Kashmir dispute through peace talks.
