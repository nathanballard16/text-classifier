Pune court grants bail to Punalekar in Dabholkar case

The accused lawyer will not be allowed to travel abroad



The sessions court on Friday granted bail to advocate Sanjeev Punalekar, an accused in rationalist Narendra Dabholkar’s murder, which took place in 2013. Punalekar was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in May this year and was lodged at Yerwada Central Prison.



While granting Punalekar the bail, the additional sessions judge RM Pande said that the accused lawyer will have to be present before the CBI on every Monday and Tuesday and will not be allowed to travel abroad.



On May 25, Punalekar was arrested along with his aide Vikram Bhave, both members of Sanatan Sanstha. Bhave had not moved for bail and has been in judicial custody at Yerwada jail as well. After being remanded to judicial custody, Punalekar’s counsel advocate Virendra Ichalkaranjikar moved his bail application before the sessions court on June 7. While the argument was still underway, the CBI sought his custody to question him about some “incriminating documents and information” retrieved from his laptop which was seized by the central agency at the time of his arrest. He was again sent to CBI custody and later sent to judicial custody.
