SRINAGAR: The 23-member delegation of European Union parliamentarians , who were on a two-day sponsored trip to assess the ground situation in Kashmir , said on Wednesday that terrorism was not the problem of India alone but that of the international community.The team said Article 370 was an internal issue of India and members stood by the country in its fight against terrorism. The delegation representatives addressed select mediapersons at the defence airport in Srinagar as the Army had invited just a few TV and print journalists, while a majority of the journalists were not allowed to interact with the delegation.The four parliamentarians who addressed the media regretted the killing of five labourers from West Bengal, who were shot dead in Kulgam of south Kashmir on Tuesday evening.“Terrorism in Kashmir is not the problem of India only. I think it’s our problem, as well as that of the international community.We support India in fighting for a solution to the problem,” the team said. “Once we go back to our countries, we will inform them of what we saw,” MEP Ryszard Czarnecki from Poland said. The MEPs (members of European Parliament) from around six countries plan to prepare a report.“We are witness to the situation now. We will prepare a report. This mission could be useful.” Thierry Mariani, from France, said the visit was not to interfere in the internal matters of India but to get a first-hand knowledge of the ground situation.The MEPs criticised Pakistan for the violence against the Christian community while referring to the Asiya Bibi case.
