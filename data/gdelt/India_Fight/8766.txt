2018 deadly year for occupied Kashmir: Lodhi

Pakistan’s Ambassador to the UN, Maleeha Lodhi, on Friday, slammed India’s irresponsible behaviour in the wake of the attack in Pulwama in Indian-held Kashmir for destabilising its already sensitive relationship with Pakistan. During her interview with international media, she warned that this situation could turn into a grave security threat not only for our region but also for international peace and security. She maintained, “Pakistan would like to see a resumption of dialogue with India to address all outstanding issues between the two countries.”

Dr Lodhi reiterated Prime Minister Imran Khan’s offer of dialogue to the Indian leadership and added that he was ready to talk about terrorism along with the longstanding dispute of Kashmir. She blamed electoral politics in India for obstructing dialogue with Pakistan to resolve the issue between the two countries. The ambassador called 2018 deadly for Indian-occupied Kashmir where five hundred civilians were killed in the year alone.
