Pakistan violates ceasefire in Nowshera sector in Rajouri district, India retaliates

New Delhi:

Pakistan forces once again violated ceasefire in Jammu and Kashmir’s Nowshera sector in Rajouri district around 4.14 pm on Friday as Indian Air Force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, who was captured by Pakistan on February 27, returned to India via Attari-Wagah border. The Indian Army is retaliating to the Pakistan firing. Earlier in the day, one civilian was injured in a ceasefire violation by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control in Uri sector of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.

They said the intermittent firing continued throughout Thursday night. One civilian has been injured in the firing. The Indian Army has responded to the Pakistani firing in adequate measure, the officials said. The ceasefire violation by the Pakistani troops comes as tensions between India and Pakistan rose following the February 14 terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district in which 40 CRPF soldiers were killed. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror group claimed responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, in Kupwara, militants and security forces engaged in an encounter early on Friday. All India Radio reported two militants had been killed in the encounter.
