New Delhi:

Before the Pulwama attack, Maulana Masood Azhar-led Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) wanted to carry out a terror operation in national capital Delhi, according to sources. The Delhi Police and the military agencies have laid hands on an audio clip in which Masood was heard provoking Kashmiri youths against India and to carry out terror attacks. The plan was made by Abu Bakar.

On January 24, the Delhi Police and the military intelligence arrested one Abdul Latif Gani from the Rajghat area in Delhi. On his cues, another person identified as Hilal Ahmad Bhatt was arrested from Kashmir. It was then that the security personnel got to know of the plan of a terror attack in Delhi.

On mapping the mobile phones of both the terrorists, it was found that after Masood’s nephews Usman and Talha Rasheed were gunned down by Indian security forces in 2017, he wanted to avenge their deaths and hence had planned an attack on Delhi.

As per reports in a Hindi daily, in the audio clip, Masood is heard inciting Kashmiri youths against India asking them to avenge Usman’s death. He is also heard saying that India has only given them an alternative between death and slavery. So, it is up to them to face death in India’s hands or attain martyrdom respectfully. The youths were also shown videos of terrorist killed by Indian forces and were asked to avenge their deaths.

The sources also said that Indian security forces got to know that not only Delhi but also Ayodhya, Pune and Bengaluru were the targets of the terrorists.
