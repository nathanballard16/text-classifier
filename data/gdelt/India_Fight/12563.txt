Pakistan may not oppose the listing of Jaish-e-Mohammed chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist in the United Nations Security Council, hints Shah Mehmood Qureshi.

Last week, the US, the UK and France moved a fresh proposal in the UN Security Council to designate Azhar as a global terrorist.

If we want to protect the International image of Pakistan then no excuse will be acceptable because people now want a verifiable action, Qureshi said.
