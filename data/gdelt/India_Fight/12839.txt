Narendra Modi: Strike happened in Pakistan, but some sitting in India hit by it: PM Modi hits out at opposition

NEW DELHI: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday unleashed a stinging attack on the opposition parties for asking proof of the air strikes carried out by the Indian Air Force on Jaish terror camp in Balakot.Hitting out at the opposition for seeking proof of the Indian Air Force's action, Modi said the air strike happened in Pakistan, but "some of those sitting in India were hit by it".Addressing a rally in Dhar district of Madhya Pradesh, PM Modi said India gave a befitting reply to the Pulwama attack by entering the den of terrorists in Pakistan."Pakistan has been conveyed the message that if it doesn't improve, it knows the consequences it will have to face," Modi said.Taking a swipe at attempts to cobble up a mahagathbandhan (grand alliance) against the BJP, Modi said the opposition leaders are doing 'mahamilavat' (high adulteration) in Pakistan's favour."These 'mahamilavati' persons have become poster boys of Pakistan by terming it as an ambassador of peace. They are misleading people of the country and trying to demoralise our armed forces by asking for proofs of the IAF air strike," Modi said.Without naming senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh, he said a leader termed the Pulwama attack as an "accident" and dubbed slain al-Qaida terrorist Osama bin Laden as an "ambassador of peace"."A leader close to the Congress' naamdar (Rahul Gandhi) family has termed the Pulwama attack a mere accident. He also considers Osama Bin Laden a shantidoot (ambassador of peace). He is the same person who gave Pakistan a clean chit after the (26/11) Mumbai terror attack and tried to mislead the investigation (into it)," Modi said.Another senior leader close to the Congress' "namdaar" family shed tears after the Batla House encounter, he said."The party whose leaders shed tears on the death of terrorists can't be expected to wipe out terrorism," the PM said, adding that earlier Congress government kept quiet after terror attacks.The crowd at the rally responded in the affirmative when Modi asked them if they took pride in the valour of the Indian armed forces.
