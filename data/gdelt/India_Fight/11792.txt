India bans Jamaat-e-Islami in occupied Kashmir

Srinagar, March 01, 2019 (PPI-OT): In occupied Kashmir, the Indian authorities in yet another tactic of suppressing the Kashmiris’ ongoing freedom movement have banned the socio-religious organization Jamaat-e-Islami in the territory.

The Jamaat-e-Islami for the past several decades has been playing an important role in the ongoing freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir and demanding granting of right to self-determination to the Kashmiri people. Indian police and troops in a massive crackdown have arrested over 400 leaders and activists of the Jamaat in the last few days.

Indian Ministry of Home Affairs in a notification banned the Jamaat-e-Islami on the charges of supporting the mujahid organizations and promoting extremism in occupied Kashmir. It stated that the Jamaat is supporting the freedom movement and pro-freedom groups fighting for this purpose.

The notification said that the JI if not banned would continue advocating freedom of Jammu and Kashmir from India, propagate anti-India and pro-freedom sentiments and intensify the ongoing freedom struggle in occupied Kashmir.

Meanwhile, the Indian police arrested six more activists of the Jamaat-e-Islami during fresh raids in various villages of Tral in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district. The JI activists were detained from Laribal, Pinglish, Dardsara, Panner, Mandoora and Lurgam villages last night and were lodged at police station Tral.
