UNI

Guwahati/IBNS: Three protesters were killed and several got injured as police resorted to firing in the capital city of Assam, Guwahati, as the agitation turned violent against Citizenship (Amendment) Bill on Thursday evening, media reports said.

The incident took place as thousands of protests, defying the curfew imposed in the area, came out on the street to protest against the passage of the CAB by Parliament.

Earlier, in the day, the government increased the duration of internet suspension period for another 48 hours starting Thursday afternoon in 10 districts of Assam.

Two columns of paramilitary forces have been deployed here as agitators violated curfew and took to streets to stage protests, which turned violent in many places.

The army even staged flag march in Guwahati, reports said.

Even as Guwahati and Dibrugarh were placed under indefinite curfew, protesters attacked the homes of CM Sarbananda Sonowal, Minister Rameswar Teli and BJP MLA Binanda Hazarika.

According to reports, the initial agitation held by student groups was peaceful but it turned violent after angry mobs joined in.

Parliament passes CAB:

With the Rajya Sabha on Wednesday passing the controversial Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2019, which will grant citizenship to all non-Muslim refugees who came to India from Bangladesh, Pakistan and Afghanistan on or before Dec 31, 2014, the legislation is now in a process to become law.

As many as 125 legislators voted for the Bill while 99 voted against it.

The CAB was passed in Lok Sabha on Monday with the support of 311 members while 80 MPs opposed it.

The Bill now awaits the nod of the President to become a law.

However, many opposition leaders are now stating that they would challenge the Bill in the Supreme Court.
