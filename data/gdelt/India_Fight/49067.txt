Article content The last charge was due to multiple incidents of fraudulent information given to police following the incident, according to the court. The case was put over because a surety could not be assigned immediately. A bail hearing will take place Thursday, Oct. 31, as requested by Singh’s Brampton-based lawyer. A publication ban was ordered on information presented at the bail hearing. The college refused to comment on Singh or his registration at the school, but a member of a Sikh temple in the border city confirmed the 22-year-old is enrolled there. The Sikh temple member, Ekam Grewal, added Singh had visited the temple in the past but was not a regular attendee. The fatal crash happened Oct. 4 at about 1:30 a.m. on Oil Heritage Road between Gum Bed Line and Aberfeldy Line on a stretch of road that sharply curves east before continuing due south toward Chatham-Kent.
