Govt ads in J&K papers counter ‘terror tactic’

SRINAGAR: Front-page advertisements published by the J&K administration in some Srinagar newspapers on Friday spoke of the "same tactic of threats and coercion" being repeatedly employed by terrorists and appealed to Kashmiris to break free of the "endless cycle of terrorism , violence, destruction and poverty"."Closed shops, no public transport? Who benefits? Are we going to succumb to militants? Think!!!" says the opening text of an ad that appeared in a prominent local English daily. It goes on to describe how "for over 70 years now, the people of J&K have been misled", leaving them "victims of a vicious campaign and motivated propaganda".Contrasting their plight with that of separatists who "sent their children to exotic lands to study, work and earn", the ad leads to a section headlined "We are at the crossroads today".A series of questions follows. "Will we let a few posters and threats push us into not resuming our businesses, into not earning our legitimate livelihood, into not securing a rightful education and secure future for our children, into not letting development bloom for our Kashmir ?"The administration's appeal through paid ads coincided with suspected terrorists setting fire to two shops in the S R Gunj area of the old city for apparently defying their diktat to open only during the designated hours. Posters asking traders to stick to three hours of business in the morning and evening had appeared in Srinagar within days of the lockdown being eased.Sohail Nabi Dhoobi, whose shop was one of the two that was set ablaze, said he lost goods and other assets worth around Rs 15 lakh in the fire. Hilal Ahmad Kazli, another shopkeeper, said: “We have suffered huge losses because of the ongoing uncertainty.”
