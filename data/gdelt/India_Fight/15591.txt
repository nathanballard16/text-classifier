Glencore offices raided in India over alleged price-fixing cartel

The inquiry in India aims to find out whether collusion kept prices of pulses artificially high after a drought led to shortages

Glencore’s offices in Mumbai have been raided by the Indian competition regulator as part of an investigation into alleged price fixing of pulses.

More than 25 officials from the Competition Commission of India are said to have searched the premises of the mining group as well as those of Africa’s Export Trading Group and India’s Edelweiss group over a suspected three-way pricing cartel. The investigation is thought to centre on allegations of collusion between the companies while importing and selling chickpeas and other pulses at a time when there was a shortage in India, according to Reuters.
