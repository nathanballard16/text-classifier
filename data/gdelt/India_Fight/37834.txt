Bengaluru court issues non-bailable warrant against MP Nalin Kumar

Bengaluru (Karnataka) [India], Aug 5 (ANI): A court here on Monday issued a non-bailable warrant against Dakshina Kannada MP Nalin Kumar Kateel for not attending the hearing with respect to a case that was filed against him over a provocative speech.

Kateel did not attend the hearing, owing to which Justice Ramachandra D Huddara issued a non-bailable warrant against him.

On June 3, 2017, Kateel had made a provocative speech in a protest held in front of Konaje police (under Mangaluru city police) station.

"We (party workers) will not hesitate in setting fire to the district if the murderers of Karthik Raj are not arrested," he had allegedly said.

Karthik Raj was a BJP worker murdered by miscreants.

Block Congress Committee had filed a police complaint against the lawmaker for his speech. (ANI)
