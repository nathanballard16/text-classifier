"Were you uprooting terrorist or trees?" Sidhu questions government on Balakot air strike

“Deceit possesses our land in guise of fighting a foreign enemy. Stop politicising the army, it is as sacred as the state,” he wrote on Twitter.

: As opposition voices questioning the claim of government on air strike in Pakistan’s Balakot are growing stronger, Congress leader and Punjab minister Navjot Singh Sidhu also took a jibe by asking was the government “uprooting trees or terrorists”. Stating that the Army is “as sacred as the state”, he said that its politicization should not be done. Sidhu took to his Twitter handle to ask whether or not 300 terrorists have been killed in the IAF strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Pakistan. He questioned was it (the air strike) an “election gimmick”. “300 terrorist dead, Yes or No? What was the purpose then? Were you uprooting terrorist or trees? Was it an election gimmick?” Sidhu tweeted.
