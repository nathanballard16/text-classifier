Oppn treats illegal immigrants as vote bank: Shah

Badaun/Shahjahanpur (UP): BJP president Amit Shah Saturday accused the Opposition of treating illegal immigrants as a vote bank and doing ‘Ilu Ilu’ with terrorists, an apparent reference to a popular Bollywood love song from the nineties.

He made the remarks while addressing ‘Vijay Sankalp’ (victory pledge) rallies in Badaun and Shahjahanpur districts of Uttar Pradesh.

“The BJP wants to take the intruders out (of the country) but the BSP-SP and the Congress do not want this as they consider them their vote bank,” Shah said. He also accused the Congress of being soft on terrorists.

“Rahul baba’s guru Sam Pitorda said do not bomb (Pakistan) but negotiate… Rahul baba if your party wants to do ‘Ilu Ilu’ with terrorists you can do that. But our intention is clear, if a shot is fired, we will reply with a bomb,” the BJP president said.

In the song, ‘Ilu Ilu’ is an acronym for I love you. Shah alleged that during the Congress’s 10-year tenure, no action was taken even when terrorists took away heads of Indian soldiers. “This time it was the Narendra Modi government and not ‘mauni baba’ Manmohan Singh… within 13 days of the attack, the Indian Air Force went into Pakistan, bombed the terror camps and returned,” he said, referring to the Pulwama attack.

He added that BJP workers in Kashmir will ensure that it remains part of India and “intruders” are thrown out of the country. Training his guns at the opposition’s ‘mahagathbandhan’, Shah said the country would have a new prime minister everyday of the week if the grand alliance comes to power.

“On one side is the BJP led by Narendra Modi which is working for the country. On the other side is the ‘mahagatbandhan’ of Rahul Baba, ‘behan’ (sister) Mayawati, ‘bhatija’ (nephew) Akhilesh, Congress and others… I ask who is your (opposition’s) leader… it is clear that Modi is our leader and he will be the PM, but who is your leader… no one is telling,” he said.
