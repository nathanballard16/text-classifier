Mugilan’s wife alleges official apathy

Poongudi hopes govt. will take efforts to trace Mugilan

Missing environmental activist R.S. Mugilan’s wife Poongudi on Sunday alleged that official authorities showed little interest in tracing her husband, but hoped that the State government would take efforts.

In a brief interaction with reporters at the Tiruchi railway junction while proceeding to Chennai, Ms. Poongudi said it was a month since her husband went missing on February 15 after releasing a video against the Thoothukudi Sterlite Copper plant. She said she had embarked on a journey from Chennimalai in Erode to Chennai to draw the attention of the government to her plight. Stating that there was a hearing in court in Chennai on Monday in connection with the case, Ms. Poongudi said she hoped for a positive development. Mr. Mugilan went missing during a train journey from Chennai to Madurai after addressing the media in Chennai regarding the police opening fire on protesters in Thoothukudi.
