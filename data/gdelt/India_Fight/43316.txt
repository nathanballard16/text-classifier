Pakistani soldier martyred as India violates LoC ceasefire

RAWALPINDI – A Pakistan Army soldier embraced martyrdom as Indian border forces violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) on Thursday, according to the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR).

“Indian troops resorted to unprovoked fire in Hajipir Sector. Sepoy Ghulam Rasool, a resident of Bahawalnagar embraced shahadat,” the the military’s media wing said in a statement.

Tensions are souring between Pakistan and India after the former revoked the special status granted to occupied Kashmir and increased aggression along the Line of Control (LoC).

The Foreign Office has summoned Indian officials several times to condemn the unprovoked firing.

On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi warned that the situation in IOK risked sparking an “accidental war”, and urged UN rights chief Michelle Bachelet to visit the troubled region.
