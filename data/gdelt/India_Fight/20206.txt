Capsule reviews of feature films

THE AFTERMATH. 2 stars. A British officer and his wife have difficulties with the former owners of their home in post-World War II Hamburg. Keira Knightley and Jason Clarke star. An overpowering tone of soap opera is given to a worthy subject: the aftermath of World War II in Germany. 1 hr. 48 R (nudity)

APOLLO 11. 3.5 stars. Todd Douglas Miller directs this documentary that looks at the first journey by people to the moon while demonstrating the unique power of reality to amaze. Adapted from previously unreleased film using the latest digital technology. Best seen in IMAX. 1 hr 33 G

CAPTAIN MARVEL. 2 stars. Brie Larson stars as the superhero, who is caught in a battle between two alien races. The script gives our hero attributes, but no personality. 1 hr. 56 PG-13 (violence)

CLIMAX. 2 stars. A French dance troupe's rehearsal in a remote building turns ugly when their drinks are spiked with LSD. 1 hr. 36 R (sex, violence)

DUMBO. 2 stars. Mostly live-action and overly dark remake of the Disney classic about a beloved young elephant is missing the endearing quality of the original. 1 hr. 55 PG
