Kolkata (West Bengal) [India], Oct 10: BJP leader Rahul Sinha on Thursday clarified that the man who was murdered in Murshidabad was an RSS worker. He also targeted Mamata Banerjee-led government in West Bengal over law and order in the state and demanded resignation from the chief minister.

"The man who was murdered with his wife and son was an RSS worker. Mamata Banerjee must resign. There is no proper law and order in West Bengal. There is jungle raj in the state," he said while speaking to ANI in Kolkata.
