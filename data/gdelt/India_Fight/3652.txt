RTI reveals Sikhs were killed at the spots in Gurugram where police were present in Nov 1984"

JALANDHAR: After procuring information under RTI Act from Haryana government about deployment of Police in district Gurugram during anti-Sikh violence in November 1984, Manwinder Singh Giaspura of Hondh Chillar Coordination Committee, who had earlier brought to light the massacre of 32 Sikhs in village Hondh in district Rewari in November 1984, has alleged that this detail clear showed that Sikhs and their houses or gurudwaras were targeted only at those places where police were present . The Committee, which is already pursuing the case of massacre at Hondh Chillar, has alleged that later Haryana police under Congress chief minister Bhajan Lal closed the FIRs in all these cases in around six months.Providing details procured under RTI about the deployment of police and juxtaposing it with the details of the killings of Sikhs and arson during a press conference here, Giaspura said that 38 Sikhs were killed in Gurugram city alone at eight places, three gurudwaras were burnt and scores of shops were burnt. “Nine persons were killed in Pataudi in the same district. The RTI data clearly shows that police were deployed at all these places. It is clear that Sikhs were targeted with active connivance of the police as at other places where there were no policemen, Sikhs were not targeted,” he said in the presence of other Coordination Committee members.He held then Haryana CM Bhajan Lal was known for his strong anti-Sikh bias, which he openly displayed during Asian games of 1982, and the FIRs in all these cases were closed in around six months. “Total 79 Sikhs were killed in Haryana during November 1984 but no culprit was ever brought to book and all the cases were closed,” he said.Giaspura alleged that Justice T P Garg Commission, formed to investigate Hondh Chillar massacre, had recommended action against four police officials but Manohar Ll Khatar government was also going soft against them. “A petition seeking action against them is pending in Punjab and Haryana High Court but Haryana government has been preferring to get the case delayed on one or other pretext. This behaviour of Khattar government is in contrast to the claim of BJP to champion the cause of justice for the victims of November 1984 massacre,” he said.
