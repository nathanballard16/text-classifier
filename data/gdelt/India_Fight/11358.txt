JIT report on Sahiwal tragedy: govt to take MPs into confidence

LAHORE: The Punjab government says it will take the lawmakers into confidence over the Joint Investigation Team’s report on Sahiwal tragedy.

“The chief minister has received the JIT report on Sahiwal incident and will take the Punjab Assembly members into confidence soon,” Law Minister Basharat Raja said in reply to a question raised by PML-N MPA Azma Bokhari in the Punjab Assembly on Thursday.

Three family members - Khalil, his wife and their teenage daughter - and their neighbour Zeeshan were gunned down by personnel of the Counter Terrorism Department in Sahiwal in January last that sparked countrywide outcry.

Mr Raja said the chief minister would consult the cabinet members and take the House into confidence on the JIT’s findings soon.

The House praised the armed forces for giving a befitting reply to India. Minister Muhammad Akhtar said India got the reply after the Pakistan Air Force shot down its two aircraft. “We salute our armed forces,” he said, and also praised the political leadership for being on the same page.

The House also unanimously adopted a resolution regarding requesting the federal government to construct dual road from Kashmore highway to D.I. Khan.

PML-N MPA Samiullah Khan asked why the government had not set up a camp in provincial jails to screen AIDS patients for the last six months. The House was told a total of 217 prisoners in the provincial jails were AIDS patients. Of them, 187 were being given treatment and the remaining were under the diagnosis process. They would be provided with treatment under the Punjab Aids Control Program after the completion of the diagnosis process.

The speaker adjourned the proceedings for Friday morning after quorum was pointed out by an opposition member.
