Missing Latvian trekker found dead after 10 months at Chamba Lake

Dharamshala: A 32-year-old Latvian trekker who was missing since September 2018 was found dead at Manimahesh Lake in Chamba district of Himachal Pradesh. A police team brought his body to the base camp at Harsar area on Saturday along with his passport.

It was on Thursday that police got information about a badly decomposed body being found at the lake.

Chamba superintendent of police Monika Bhutungru told TOI that the passport identifies him as a Latvian national Aleksandr Cawa Ruzga.

“The body is being taken to the Chamba medical college for post-mortem examination,” she added.

Aleksandr was last spotted by another trekker at Nag Dal Lake (4350 metres above sea level) at Indrahar Pass in Dhauladhar ranges in September 2018.

The Latvian national was on a solo trekking expedition from Dharamshala to Leh.

A post on the trekker’s mother’s social media account had indicated that he was missing. Her post had said, “Aleksandr has left Dharamshala on September 14 and cannot be contacted after that.” She had further mentioned that Aleksandr was planning to attend a meditation camp from October 17-28 at Leh.

The police have informed the Latvian embassy at New Delhi.
