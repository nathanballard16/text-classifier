A cause for big worry in J&K: Local suicide bombers

NEW DELHI: The deadly terror strike on a CRPF convoy in Pulwama is reminiscent of the Badami Bagh attack of 2000 when a young suicide bomber, all of 17, had rammed a Maruti 800 into the Army cantonment. A year later, terrorists blew up a car outside the J&K legislative assembly complex, killing 38 persons.Yet, the Pulwama attack is unprecedented in terms of sheer number of fatalities suffered by security personnel in J&K in a single strike, and also brings back focus on home-grown terrorism that is now making local Kashmiris take to suicide attacks, until now a domain of hardened foreign fighters.Home minister Rajnath Singh and home secretary Rajiv Gauba, who were out of Delhi at the time of the attack, rushed back on Thursday evening and went into a huddle with the security brass to review the situation in J&K. Singh will visit the state on Saturday and hold review meetings with security forces and J&K police.Intelligence officials told TOI that Thursday’s attack was not the first incident of a vehicle laden with explosives — sources put the quantity used at 200-300 kg — being driven to inflict immediate casualties on security personnel in J&K. Adviser to J&K governor K Vijay Kumar told TOI that the same modus operandi was adopted in Badami Bagh attack of 2000, and repeated in a couple of attacks in 2005.Ramming vehicles into targets is now associated mostly with Islamic State-influenced, home-grown terrorists in Europe, though one of the most striking attacks using explosives-laden vehicle was the Glasgow attack of 2000 when suspected terrorists rammed a vehicle loaded with propane canisters into the glass doors of the airport building.The Pulwama attack ends a lull in big terror strikes in the Valley, with the past two years having seen 470 terrorists killed in sustained encounters with security forces. Thursday’s casualties are half the total number of forces martyred in 2018. The 2019 force fatalities figure therefore is set to end well beyond those in 2018 (86 till December 2 ), 2017 (80) and 2016 (82).Asked if such high casualties could have been avoided had CRPF restricted the size of the convoy, a J&K government functionary said it was not unusual for forces to move in large convoys, especially after bad weather.Sources said the attack may trigger a fresh review of standard operating procedures for movement of convoys. “While there are alternative transport methods such as airlifting the troops, it may not always be possible due to unpredictable weather. Besides, only a limited number of troops can be airlifted at a time,” the officer added
