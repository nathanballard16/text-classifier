They are not only facing problems on personal front, but also at their workplace. The number of vends has increased in recent years. We have shot off a letter to the state taxation commissioner, urging him to ban the opening of vends in the industrial areas and frame guidelines to set up vends at a minimum distance from an industrial area.”Kulpreet Malhotra, senior member of United Cycle and Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), said, “The presence of liquor vends in industrial areas means that liquor is available to workers even during the working hours. Every other day, they get cases when workers cause nuisance after consuming liquor during lunch break. Besides, the addiction has also taken a toll on their efficiency. Considering these factors, the government should ban liquor vends in industrial areas.”Atul Saggar, general secretary of Apparels Manufacturers Association, Ludhiana, said, “It is really shocking that liquor vends have come in industrial areas where there are no shops of daily necessity items. I think the government should immediately take notice of the matter.”
