Holy books burnt as fire breaks out at Sherpur Khurd gurdwara

Ludhiana: Five ‘birs’ of Guru Granth Sahib were burnt after a fire broke out at a gurdwara in Jagraon’s Sherpur Khurd on Wednesday morning.

Pathi Bhagwant Singh was the first to notice the flames. “When I went to the gurdwara around 8.30am, I was shocked to see the prayer hall ablaze. As I raised the alarm, villagers gathered at the spot and sounded the fire department and the police.”

CCTVs installed on the gurdwara premises have captured the incident.

Sadar, Jagraon, police station SHO inspector Rashminder Singh said, “The CCTV footage shows short circuit in an air-conditioner triggered the blaze. As wooden furniture spread the flames, five ‘birs’ of Guru Granth Sahib and a few of Gutka Sahib caught fire.”

Police have initiated proceedings under Section 174 of the CrPC.
