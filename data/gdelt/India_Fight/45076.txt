BJP probing councillors’ scuffle incidents

A formal complaint has been received and is being investigated by Delhi BJP chief Manoj Tiwari, days after a few BJP councillors indulged in a scuffle at an event in Kirari.

The complaint is against party’s women’s wing head Poonam Jha and her husband, a former MLA, Anil Jha. Copies of the complaint have also been sent to the party’s Assembly poll in-charge and Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and national vice-president Shyam Jaju.

The complaint is in relation to a scuffle on September 22 at a party event in Kirari allegedly involving Ms. Jha, Urmila Chaudhary and Sona Chauhdary in the presence of former Delhi unit president Satish Upadhyaya seeking “stern action” against the couple.

At another incident, BJP office-bearers clashed in Gokalpur where senior party leader Dushyant Gautam was present. Recently, a complaint was lodged by a party worker from Rajender Nagar against a senior Delhi BJP leader accusing him of misbehaviour.

“The party is looking very closely into the role of everyone involved and action will be taken soon,” Delhi BJP media head Pratyush Kanth said.
