BSF arrests two Pakistani "fishermen", seizes their boat

The Border Security Force (BSF) captured two Pakistani nationals along with a fishing boat from the 'Harami Nala' creek area off the Gujarat coast in Kutch district on Monday evening, an official said.

The incident took place when a team of BSF personnel was patrolling the creek area near Indias maritime border with Pakistan, the official said.

The duo was apprehended while trying to flee after abandoning their boat and primarily they appeared to be "fishermen", he said.

"Two Pakistani nationals were captured when they tried to flee after abandoning their boat in the Harami Nala creek area.

"They were captured at around 5:30 pm and their boat was also seized. Primarily, they appeared to be fishermen, the official said.

The BSF launched an intensive search operation after the incident and was further investigating the matter, he said.

This comes days after a BSF team seized five Pakistani fishing boats in the same area, a sluggish and shallow water channel in Sir Creek in the Arabian Sea, from where the border guarding force had recovered several abandoned Pakistani boats in the last couple of months.

Pakistan and India regularly arrest each other's fishermen who inadvertently stray into their territorial waters due to absence of any proper technology to confirm the coastline border between the two neighbours near Sir Creek.

Sir Creek is a tidal estuary (partially enclosed coastal body) that separates Gujarat from the Pakistani province of Sindh.
