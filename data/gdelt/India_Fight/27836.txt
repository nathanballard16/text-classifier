Bengal tigers hold an endangered status with the World Wildlife Fund. With around 2,500 remaining in the wild, the mammals are found mainly in India. Irrawaddy dolphins are also endangered and are found in Asia. According to officials, there are an estimated 92 left in existence.

Authorities last week announced that tiger population in the Bangladesh area of the Sundarbans has increased from 106 four years ago to 114.
