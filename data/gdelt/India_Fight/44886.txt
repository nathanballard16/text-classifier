Unnao victim and her family to stay in Delhi

They say that they fear for their lives in U.P. village

A court here on Tuesday directed that an accommodation be arranged for the Unnao rape victim and her family in Delhi.

The court order came after the Uttar Pradesh government submitted a report saying that the victim and her family members wanted to stay in the Capital as they feared for their lives in their village in Uttar Pradesh.

Lease terms

The court further directed that on finding a suitable accommodation, the terms and conditions of the lease be shared with the court, so that appropriate directions can be passed to the State government to bear or reimburse rental charges till further orders.

The victim is likely to be discharged from the trauma centre of the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences here on Wednesday.

The court also directed that the victim and her family be provided temporary accommodation in the hostel of the trauma centre for the next seven days.

The victim was shifted to the trauma centre from a Lucknow hospital in August. She, along with her lawyer, had sustained serious injuries while her two aunts were killed when an overspeeding truck collided with their car in Raebareli on July 28.

In its report to the court, the Central Bureau of Investigation had expressed concern over the safety of the victim and her family members.

The woman was allegedly kidnapped and raped by expelled BJP MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar in Unnao in 2017, when she was a minor.

The court has put up the matter for further hearing on September 28.
