CBI charge-sheet sayshelped killers. So why is he still free?Therecently filed a supplementary charge-sheet in the Narendra Dabholkar murder case against, the two men who allegedly pulled the trigger. But the central agency is yet to take any action against a lawyer who its own charge-sheet says aided and abetted the duo, as well as several other Hindu extremists wanted in a variety of cases, and tampered with evidence, the Mumbai Mirror can reveal today.The CBI says longstanding enmity between Dr Dabholkar and his Andhashraddha Nirmoolan Samiti and the Sanatan Sanstha led to the rationalist’s murder on August 20, 2013. Sanatan Santha members Dr Virendrasinh Tawde and Amol Kale planned the murder, it adds.Kalaskar told the CBI that Sanjeev Punalekar, national secretary of theand lawyer of Sanatan Santha, asked him to destroy the weapons used to murder Dr Dabholkar and journalist Gauri Lankesh, among others.On June 20, 2016, Mumbai Mirror reported that Punalekar had harboured those accused in the 2009 Madgaon blast case and wanted by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).Punalekar continues to make defamatory statements about Dr Dabholkar on various media platforms. He also admits giving shelter to Sanatan Sanstha members wanted for questioning in the Madgaon case.“During the interrogation of Kalaskar, it is revealed that in the month of June 2018, Sharad Kalaskar visited the chamber of advocate Sanjeev Punalekar at 305, Birya House, 265, Perin, Nariman Street, Bazar Gate, Fort, Mumbai - 400001 where Vikram Bave, assistant of Sanjeev Punalekar, was also present,” the charge-sheet, filed before a Pune court, says.“Punalekar told Kalaskar about ‘his role in the murder of Dr Narendra Dabholkar’ and also told him not to worry.“Sanjeev Punalekar also asked Sharad Kalaskar to destroy the firearms used in murder cases, including the Gauri Lankesh case.“On July 23, 2018, Kalaskar dismantled four country-made pistols (took out barrels and sliders containing firing pins) and threw them from a bridge into a khadi (creek) while on the way to the Nalasopara residence of Vaibhav Raut (accused in the Nalasopara explosive seizure case). He was returning from Pune in Raut’s vehicles.”In June 2016, the agency filed its first charge - sheet against Virendrasinh Tawde under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 302 (murder) of the IPC, among other charges.In the recent supplementary charge-sheet, the agency has charged Andure and Kalaskar under IPC sections for criminal conspiracy and murder and provisions of Arms Act and Section 16 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act.Section 16 relates to acts of terror and calls for punishment of life imprisonment if the act led to the death of a person.The agency has said it is still looking for the motorcycle and weapons used in the killingsMumbai Mirror contacted the CBI in New Delhi, Sanjeev Punalekar, Hindu Janjagruti Samiti and Sanatan Santha spokeperson Prasad Kale over text and email. MM did not receive a response from anyone.
