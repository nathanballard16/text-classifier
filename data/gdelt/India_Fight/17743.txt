55% of Lok Sabha MPs Facing Criminal Charges Are From BJP

Mumbai: At the end of the term of the current (16th) Lok Sabha, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) continues to have the highest number of parliamentarians charged with criminal offences.

Across parties, of the 521 Lok Sabha members of parliament (MPs), 106 (20%) are charged with serious offences such as murder, inciting communal disharmony, kidnapping and crimes against women.

As many as 55% of these are from the BJP (92), compared with 2% from the Congress (7), 3% from the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) (6), 17% from the Shiv Sena (15) and 7% from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) (7), an analysis by National Election Watch (NEW), a campaign run by the advocacy group Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR), shows.

The composition of the lower house of parliament has changed during its five-year term due to by-elections held for a variety of reasons including death, bankruptcy, mental illness or conviction for a serious criminal offence.

The 2014 elections saw the highest number of people facing criminal charges being elected to the Lok Sabha, a 14% increase from 2009, as IndiaSpend reported on May 23, 2014.

From the beginning of the current Lok Sabha until now, there has been a marginal decrease in the number of MPs with criminal cases, from 186 (34%) of the initially elected 541 members to 174 (33%) of 521 members now.
