Bengaluru: Karnataka Minister for Rural Development and Panchayat Raj KS Eshwarappa on Monday stoked a controversy saying that patriotic Muslims will vote for the saffron party and only those who support Pakistan will hesitate to do the same.

Speaking at an event in Bengaluru, Eshwarappa also said that the state government will ban slaughter of cows. "A rashtra bhakta (patriot) Muslim will vote for BJP, and those who are pro Pakistan and rashtra drohis (traitors) will hesitate to vote for BJP," said Karnataka Minister.



On cow slaughter in the state, the Minister said that he'll reinforce the ban like the previous BJP regimes in the state. "I'm saying this in this meeting, in front of holy seers that this government will ban cow slaughter, let there be no doubt," he was quoted as saying in a report.

The previous BS Yediyurappa government in 2010 had got the controversial Prevention of Slaughter and Preservation of Cattle Bill passed that proposed to replace the Karnataka Prevention of Cow Slaughter and Cattle Preservation Act, 1964. The bill had widened the definition of 'cattle' and imposed a blanket ban on cattle slaughter, coupled with stringent penalty clauses for violation.

However, the Congress government headed by Siddaramaiah withdrew the bill, before it could get President's assent.
