Fire in Indigo Flight: Engine fire on IndiGo Goa-Delhi flight; plane returns to land safely at origin

NEW DELHI: An IndiGo Goa-Delhi flight on Sunday reportedly suffered an engine fire soon after getting airborne. The pilots switched off that engine and returned to safely in Goa. The aviation regulator is probing this fire scare on board the Airbus A320 (not a Neo) which had about 180 passengers, including Goa’s environment minister Nilesh Cabral, on board.Cabral told the media that about 20 minutes after take off, the plane’s left engine caught fire. When passengers saw that, there was panic inside the aircraft with some flyers screaming out of fear. Pilots switched off this engine and returned to land back in Goa on a single engine.However, IndiGo denies that there was a fire in the engine. “IndiGo strongly refutes the occurrence of any fire in the engine of flight 6E-336 from Goa to Delhi operating on Sunday (September 29). During the shutdown process of the engine, it is not unusual that unburnt fuel ignites some sparks seen at the exhaust of the engine, which was noticed by the passengers. At no point of time there was any danger of fire in the engine. As per our records, the engine had no previous history of any technical issues. This aircraft was powered by CFM engine which has done 12,000 hours since the last shop visit. This is well within the expected life of the engine. However, the cause of the incident is not known yet and is currently under investigation,” the airline spokesperson said.She added: “6E 336 (VT-IHC) returned to Goa due to technical issues in (one) engine. As per the laid down standard operating procedures, our pilot landed the aircraft in Goa for inspection. All the passengers were accommodated on other flights to Delhi.”
