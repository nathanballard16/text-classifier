Neighbor, friend of slain West Chester family members: ‘I don’t feel safe over there right now’

• Religious leader: Man killed in West Chester quadruple homicide 'was a great guy'

Subdiner Kaur, who is no relation to the family, is an employee at the India Bazar in the Union Centre Pavilion. She said the four were “so kind, so good.” She also said that as a resident, she is concerned that police have not identified a suspect in the four homicides.

“I don’t feel safe over there (at the apartment complex) right now,” she said.

A West Chester spokesperson and Indian government official both said Tuesday the incident is not being investigated as a hate crime.

Kaur said she heard noises on Sunday night, but she didn’t know what caused them and she was not alarmed at first. Once she learned what happened, she felt scared for her own safety, she said.

“I don’t think they had any other difficulties ... I can’t believe it is a hate crime,” said.
