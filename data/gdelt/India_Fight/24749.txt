The more they abuse, the more the lotus will bloom, says Shah

Furnishing a hitting reply to the abuses hurled at PM Mr. Modi by the Congress and other opposition parties, BJP chief Amit Shah on Thursday said the more they hurl abuses at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the more the lotus will bloom.

He also said that it is only Mr. Modi that the nation can feel secure with and no one can take away Kashmir from India as long as BJP exists.

Referring to the airstrike on terror camps in Balakot in Pakistan, he claimed that Congress president Rahul Gandhi and other Opposition leaders sulked after the operation and asked whether the terrorists killed were their “maternal-paternal brothers”.

While addressing rallies in Sant Kabirnagar, Siddharthnagar and Balrampur in UP, the BJP chief said, “The security of the country is of top priority to us. If a bullet (goli) comes to us from Pakistan, our people will retaliate with a shell (golaa),” amidst applause from the crowd at his rallies.

“The Congress, Mayawati and Akhilesh are hurling all types of abuses at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sometimes he is addressed as Hitler, sometimes as Mussolini and sometimes he is called as a murderer. This is because they (opposition) cannot tolerate the son of a poor becoming the Prime Minister,” he said in Sant Kabirnagar, his third rally of the day after Balrampur and Siddharthnagar.
