Pak army chief visits Headquarters Rawalpindi Corps

Pakistan's Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa on Monday paid a visit to the Headquarters Rawalpindi Corps where he was briefed on the operational situation along the Line of Actual Contact (LAC), Line of Control and Working Boundary (WB), amid heightened tensions between India and Pakistan in the wake of Pulwama terror attack.

"COAS visited Headquarters Rawalpindi Corps. Commander Rawalpindi Corps updated COAS on operational situation & state of readiness along Line of Actual Contact (LAC), Line of Control and Working Boundary (WB). COAS expressed satisfaction on the state of preparations & readiness," tweeted Pakistan's Army spokesperson Major General Asif Ghafoor.

On February 22, Bajwa had visited Pakistani troops deployed at the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir and instructed the troops "to be ready to face any eventuality."

The recent visits came in the backdrop of the deadly terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district, where 40 CRPF personnel died in a suicide bomb attack. It was the deadliest attack on security forces in Kashmir in the last three decades.

Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based terror outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack.

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan had promised "action" if "actionable intelligence" was provided by India about its links to Pulwama terror attack but warned of "retaliation, without even thinking, if any kind of military action is launched by India."

In response, India dubbed Khan's statement as "a lame excuse" that he would take action if "actionable intelligence" is provided about links of Pulwama attack to his country and asked him to stop misleading the international community.
