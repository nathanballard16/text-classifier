Vidya Balan's Shakuntala Devi to clash with The Girl On The Train and Dil Bechara

Vidya Balan has announced that her next project Shakuntala Devi will be releasing on May 8 next year. She recently concluded her schedule in London and now the makers decided to lock in on a date for release. Interestingly, the film will face some stiff competition at the box-office as Parineeti Chopra starrer The Girl On The Train and Sushant Singh Rajput and debutante Sanjana Sanghi’s Dil Bechara will release on the same date as well.Earlier today, Vidya announced the release date of the film in a rather interesting manner. The actress asked fans to guess the release date by quizzing them with a math puzzle. Even though she did go on to share the release date of the film, it was interesting to see her encourage others to put their thinking hats on. Vidya shared the video along with a caption that read, “Get ready to be enamoured by her wit, charm & of course, genius! Watch the video to know when #ShakuntalaDevi is coming to theatres near you!@sanyamalhotra07 @jisshusengupta @TheAmitSadh @anumenon1805 @sonypicsprodns @Abundantia_Ent @vikramix@sonypicsindia”While Dil Bechara and The Girl on the Train are adaptations of Hollywood films, Shakuntala Devi is a biopic on India’s math genius. Who do you think will come out on top of this clash?
