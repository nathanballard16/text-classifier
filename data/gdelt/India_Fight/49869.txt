Kamlesh Tiwari murder: 24-year-old held for ‘providing pistol’ to killers, say police

The Hindu Mahasabha leader was shot in Lucknow.

A day after the eleventh arrest in connection with the murder of Hindu outfit leader Kamlesh Tiwari, a joint team of Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat Anti-terrorist Squads (ATS) arrested a 24-year-old man from Kanpur district on Friday for allegedly providing the pistol used in the crime.

Acting on a tip-off, police conducted a raid in Harbansh area of Kanpur on Friday evening and arrested Yusuf Khan, taking the total number of arrests to 12 in the case.

The police claimed to have recovered two cell phones from his possession. Khan, who hails from UP’s Fatehpur district, works in Gujarat.

“During course of investigation, police learnt that Yusuf Khan had provided a pistol to suspected killers Ashfaq Hussain Jakir Hussain Shaikh and Farid alias Moinuddin Khurshid Pathan,” said a police officer.

The two alleged killers were arrested near the temple town of Shamlaji on Gujarat-Rajasthan border last week.

“A pistol was recovered from the spot. We are presently interrogating Yusuf Khan in this connection,” said Inspector General D K Thakur of UP ATS.

Tiwari, the former working president of Akhil Bharat Hindu Mahasabha, was murdered at his house in Lucknow on October 18.

On Thursday, the Special Investigation Team, which is investigating the murder, arrested Kamran from Bareilly for allegedly providing logistic support to the two suspected killers while they were on the run.
