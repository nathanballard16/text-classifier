S-400 Missile System Defeats High-speed Maneuverable Targets

Russian S-400 missile defence system defeated new type of high-speed highly maneuverable targets in tests carried out at the Telemba proving ground of the Eastern Military District (EMD).

"During the live firing phase the most complex situation was created at the proving ground to simulate an enemy air attack. New types of targets were added. S-400 crews carried out ten launches of guided air defense missiles to hit all targets, including high-speed and maneuverable ones flying at extremely low altitudes," TASS reported quoting a press release from the EMD.

The missile and artillery systems Pantsir providing protection for the S-400 performed well. Involved in the exercise were the command center, air defense missile S-400 and Pantsir battalions and supply units (150 officers and men all in all).

The type of targets were not specified in a report by TASS. However, there have recent reports that the S-400 system has been challenged by fast moving aircraft and attack drones over Syria. Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu had declared on Sunday that weapons systems deployed in Syria had been tweaked based on combat experience.

Russian sources have suggested that the S-400/Pantsir combination would have been sufficient to stop the type of drone attacks that destroyed key facilities in the Saudi Abqaiq and Khurais oil refineries.

The S-400 is Russia’s most expensive and air defence system which has been recently exported to Turkey and India. It is trying to find more customers, particularly in the Middle East.
