New Delhi: As onion prices touched Rs 100 per kg mark in several places, the Income Tax Department conducted raids searching for onion hoarders. According to reports, Income Tax Department officials are conducting surveys across the country. Offices of several onion dealers have been raided by the I-T Department.

The tax department got reports of onion hoarding after which raids started. As of now, no raids have been conducted in Punjab.

It worth mentioning onion prices have been burning a hole in the aam aadmi's pocket. The price of the bulb went over Rs 100 per kg in the national capital last week. In several other states, the price ranged from Rs 80 to Rs 100. While the prices of onions touched Rs 80 per kg in August and September, prices have again shot up due to a shortage, triggered by unseasonal rainfall which has damaged crop in the main onion growing zones in Maharashtra.

As per reports, the average price of the bulb at the benchmark Lasalgaon wholesale market was at Rs 55.50 per kg. Traders fear that further spike in prices due to the high amount of damaged crops because of the unseasonal November rains. It is to be noted that rains have been battering the key onion growing zones over the last two weeks. Reports suggest that extensive damage to onions was caused by the rains in Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune.

It is worth mentioning that the government on Saturday said it will import one lakh tonnes of onion to control soaring prices that have risen sharply to around Rs 100/kg at some places, including the national capital. While state-owned trading firm MMTC will import onions, cooperative Nafed will supply onion in the domestic market. This decision was taken at a meeting of a committee of secretaries held on Saturday.
