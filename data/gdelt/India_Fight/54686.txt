Officials asked them about the accused and recorded their statement on details about when they last spoke to them and what the accused told them during those conversations. The NHRC team also recorded the family members’ statement on what they thought of the encounter and what the police told them, since the time the four men were arrested,” said a police source privy to the meeting.A week after being arrested for the crime, the four accused were gunned down by the police during an early morning encounter at Chantapally village.
