The two countries embarked on the corridor project last year, some 70 years after the partition after the Sikh community, who want passage into Kartarpur for pilgrimage, exerted pressure on both sides. It is believed that Guru Nanak Dev, the first among the ten Sikh Gurus, spent 18 years of his life at Kartarpur, which was also his final resting place.

There is a cross-border tiff currently underway between the two nuclear-armed states after the February 14 Pulwama terror attack claimed by a Pakistan-based jihadi outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad. The tensions escalated to a point wherein the two nations engaged in a show of air power, transgressing into each other's airspace. Cross-border firing and shelling of artillery is still going on unabated, according to media reports.
