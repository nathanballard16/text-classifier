Harshad Mehta’s wife wins 27-year legal battle with broker, ‘gets’ Rs 6 crore

MUMBAI: Twenty seven years later, Jyoti Mehta, wife of Harshad Mehta , won a legal battle against a broker who owed her late husband Rs 6 crore . Justice Shalini Phansalkar Joshi, heading a special court looking into the 1992 securities scam cases, upheld Jyoti Mehta’s claim of the amount along with 18% interest from 1992 till the sum is paid by broker Kishore Janani and Federal Bank. The broker had denied the claim and had pointed to the over two-decade delay in lodging the claim — the case was filed in 2014. The court said law of limitation would not apply in this case. The judge directed the custodian to recover the money and distribute it among the debtors of late Mehta.
