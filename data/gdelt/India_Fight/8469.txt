Hrithik Roshan, one of the most disciplined Bollywood actors, who is known to follow a strict routine, has changed his routine for his forthcoming flick. The Kaabil actor prefers to go to bed on time and also rises early to kickstart the day with a gym session.

Since his upcoming movie demands night shoots, the Mohenjo Daro actor has changed his schedule. He is also travelling a lot as the film is being shot at multiple locations in Mumbai.

In a statement, an excited Hrithik was quoted to have said, "I have always been a morning person. I like to start my day early but for the film that I am currently shooting, we are also doing a lot of night shoots. It is a big shift in my daily routine, but as actors, over a period of time, we get immune to it."

The Bang Bang! actor, despite shooting at nights, spreads cool vibes around ever since the moment he enters the sets and continues to captivate with his energy.

The actor runs by the clock and never wastes time to ensure that he completes the schedule before the end of the day. Even when he has been awake since morning, he doesn’t bother anybody by telling that he’s tired.

On the film front, the actor is currently gearing up for the biographical drama Super 30 which is slated to release on July 26, 2019. Helmed and co-produced by Anurag Kashyap, the film would also feature Pankaj Tripathi in a pivotal role.
