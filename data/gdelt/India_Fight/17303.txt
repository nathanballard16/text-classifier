Tejasvi Surya, BJP’s rising star in South, snagged in Congress' #MeToo charge

Bengaluru: The BJP's handpicked candidate from Bangalore South, Tejasvi Surya found himself at the centre of a controversy Wednesday after the Karna taka Congress attacked him, citing allegations of 'abuse' by a woman against him while attacking the saffron party on the choice. Neither Surya or BJP reacted to the allegations or Congress' tweet so far. “Is @Tejasvi_Surya another M J Akbar in the making? Dear @BJP4India, @Tejasvi_Surya seems to be a great choice. #Bangalore South will remember.

#MeToo #LokSabha Polls2019," Karnataka Congress tweeted with screen shots of comments made by a woman on Twitter.

M J Akbar had stepped down as Minister of State for External Affairs last year following a spate of allegations of sexual harassment during his days as editor of several publications. The woman whom the Congress cited meanwhile has deleted comments she made against Surya.

However in screenshots shared by the Congress with its tweet, the woman, replying to questions raised about her charges, claimed to have ‘suffered’ at the hands of Surya and has questioned why the BJP had not done a background check before giving him the ticket.

She also alleged she was not his first victim nor would she be the last and says she is ready to share proof.

The party's fiery youth wing leader Surya, 28, whose social media is replete with vociferous praise for PM Modi has been picked by the BJP top brass to stand from its bastion of Bangalore South, from where the widow of union minister Ananth Kumar, a six-time MP from the constituency, was denied the ticket.
