Heavy Fighting Erupts Between Armies of India and Pakistan in Kashmir

“The Indian army is retaliating effectively and strongly in Mankote areas of Mendhar,” an army official added.

The exchange of fire has been underway since the morning of 12 July on the de facto India-Pakistan border. However, there has been no report of any casualties so far from either side.

This is the fifth major exchange of fire between the two armies since 6 July. The fresh round of ceasefire violations started after more than a month-long lull in violence at the border. Two soldiers suffered serious injuries in 6 July exchange of fire, while on 8 July a civilian was injured in the Nowshera sector of Kashmir valley.
