New Delhi: Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Wednesday said that the cabinet has approved an establishment of 'Special Window' to provide priority debt financing for completion of stalled housing projects in the affordable and middle-income housing sector. FM Sitharaman informed that there are approximately 1,600 housing projects that are stalled in the building phase translating into an approximate of 4.58 lakh uncompleted housing units.

The Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), State Bank of India (SBI) and the government will be collectively infusing up to Rs 25,000 crore to revive the real estate sector, FM Sitharaman said. Out of the total monetary support of Rs 25,000 crore, the government is likely to contribute as much as Rs 10,000 crore. Sovereign funds have also shown interest in the real estate fund, the minister said.

"We've come up with a special window that will be structured as an Alternative Investment Fund which will pool all these investments," FM Sitharaman told. The special window will be designated to provide funding to projects which are meeting certain criteria including the company should be net-worth positive, the project should be focused on affordable and middle-income housing and must be registered with RERA.
