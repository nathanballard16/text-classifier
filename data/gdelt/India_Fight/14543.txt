Missing toddler found dead in Chinchpokli

Body found on parapet of building

A 15-month-old girl was found dead in her building three hours after she went missing on Tuesday.

The Kalachowky police said that Arohi Rane stayed with her parents and eight-year-old sister in a six-storey MHADA building near Chinchpokli station. The police said that Arohi was playing in her house and went missing at 2 p.m.

Footprints found

A police officer said, “The body was found on the parapet of her third-floor house at 5 p.m. She was rushed to Nair Hospital in Mumbai Central, where she was declared dead before admission.” The police conducted a search of the building and made inquiries with residents. An officer who is part of the investigation said footprints matching Arohi’s foot size were found on the terrace. However, no other footprints were found.

The officer said, “Given the victim’s age, it is unlikely that she made it to the terrace from her third-floor house on her own. The terrace is usually bolted, but never locked. We also found a chair on the terrace.”

Report awaited

The police said injuries on Arohi’s body were consistent with those sustained from falling from a height. The police are still awaiting the post-mortem report to find out if there are any signs of trauma or abuse.

Dr. Saurabh Tripathi, Deputy Commissioner of Police, (Zone IV), said, “We have registered an Accidental Death Report in connection with the matter and investigations are under way.”

The police are recording the statements of friends and family members to find out if any disputes or enmity could have caused someone to kill the child.
