10-foot crocodile found dead on riverbank

VADODARA: A 10 foot long crocodile was found dead on the banks of Vishwamitri River in the city on Tuesday afternoon. Some passers-by noticed the crocodile that was lying under the Sama bridge following which they informed the wildlife activists. Forest officials too were called in as the reptile is protected under the Wildlife Protection Act. “It seems that the reptile died about three days ago. It was lying at the spot since then but it was on Tuesday afternoon that someone noticed as its body started decaying,” said Hemant Vadhwana, animal activist. Vadhwana with the help of other volunteers and forest officials ferried reptile for postmortem.“The reptile didn’t have any external injury. We are waiting for the PM report to ascertain the cause of death,” Vadhwana told TOI. However, it is believed that the reptile may died due to electric current. The stretch where the crocodile was spotted is home to dozens of reptiles that often venture out of Vishwamitri River.After the recent floods that submerged several areas of the city, nearly 60 crocodiles that ventured out of Vishwamitri River and other waterbodies have been rescued from different spots.
