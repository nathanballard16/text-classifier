130-170 Jaish terrorists killed in IAF Balakot strike, their families paid off by Pakistan: Italian journalist

Nailing Pakistan's lies once again, award-winning Italian journalist Francesa Marino has reported that 130-170 terrorists were killed during Indian Airforce's strike at Balakot on wee hours of February 26. According to Marino, who earlier too reported that Jaish-e-Mohammed has suffered heavy losses in Balakot, Pakistani army contingent had to swoop in to rescue the heavily injured terrorists.

Marino claims that still around 45 terrorists are admitted in hospital, such was the intensity of the attack from IAF. Around 20 terrorists died in the hospital too and the cumulative toll is around 130-170 according to Italian journalist. Indian Air Force based on inputs about Jaish terrorists in Balakot did the strike on February 26, after the ghastly Pulwama attack on February 14, when 40 CRPF men lost their lives. She has filed this report in Stringer Asia and later elaborated her findings to DNA's sister organisation WION.

Marina earlier speaking to WION had said that at least 40-50 terrorists have been killed. Now, she has revised her number significantly upwards to 130-170. While officially India didn't give out a number, based on mobile tower intercepts, sources have claimed that toll could be high as 300-400. However, Pakistan has denied any loss to life and has claimed that some trees were only uprooted in the Indian attack. Although Pakistan tried to attack Indian military installations a day later as retaliation, it was promptly foiled by India. In the process, IAF pilot Abhinandan Varthaman crossed LoC and was taken by Pakistan but was released a day later.
