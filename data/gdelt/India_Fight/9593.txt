Heron Drone: IAF's UAV which tracked Pak fighter jets, enemyradars while Mirage jets bombarded JeM camps

New Delhi: The Indian Air Force Mirage fighter jets in the early hours of Tuesday morning carried out precision aeriel strikes to bombard JeM terror camps well within Pakistan teritory, killing more than 200 Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists. The strikes conducted by the Indian Air Force is seen as a retaliatory step by our security forces for avenging the death of our CRPF soldiers in the dastardly terror attack in Pulwama a fortnight ago.

The clinical execution of the arieal strikes by Mirage jets could only be possible due to the activation of Netra Airborne EW&C and deployment of Heron drone to keep an eye on Pakistan Air Force jets and anti-aircraft radars during the strikes. The IAF deployed its Netra AEW&C and Heron UAV- which are termed as ‘Eye in the Sky’ – to monitor the movement of Pakistan Air Force jets and anti-aircraft radars installed across the LoC on Tuesday.
