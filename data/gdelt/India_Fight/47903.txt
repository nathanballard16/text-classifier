Hindu Mahasabha leader Kamlesh Tiwari has been shot dead by unidentified assailants in a broad daylight in Lucknow on Friday, news channels reported. He was rushed to Trauma Centre where Tiwari succumbed to injuries. Tiwari had served as the president of the right-wing group. According to media reports, the attackers barged into Tiwari’s office on the pretext of handing over a gift. As soon as they walked in, the attackers opened fire on the Hindu Mahasabha leader and fled from the scene.

“Kamlesh Tiwari was found murdered inside his house. Two persons had come to meet him. Both were speaking to Tiwari when the latter sent one of his aides to get ‘paan’ for them,” news agency PTI quoted Vikas Tripathi, ASP – Lucknow West, as saying.

“When his aide returned from the market, he found Tiwari in a pool of blood,” Tripathi went on to add.

Recently, the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court had revoked the National Security Act (NSA) slapped on the right-wing leader. Tiwari was in news recently for giving a controversial remark involving Prophet Muhammad.
