Vishal’s 'Thupparivaalan-2' to be shot in foreign locales

Vishal is planning to begin the sequel of his detective thriller ‘Thupparivaalan’ from August 15. Sources say that the film’s director Mysskin is planning to shoot Thupparivaalan 2 in exotic foreign locales like Turkey, London, and various other parts of the world. The first part of the film was largely shot in Chennai but the sequel will be an upmarket detective thriller shot in foreign countries.





Vishal is currently on a break for the promotions of his recent release ‘Ayogya’ and he is expected to soon resume the shoot of his big-budget action entertainer with Sundar C. The yet-untitled film also has Tamannaah Bhatia and Aishwarya Lekshmi in pivotal characters.
