Massive fire in Thane factory, no casualties: Officials

A massive fire broke out at a factory in Bhiwandi area of Maharashtra’s Thane district early on Monday as firefighters managed to control the blaze after five and a half hours.

The fire department received a call about a fire at a paintbrush and colour manufacturing factory-godown in Jai Mata Di compound in Kalher at 5:30am.

At least 40 workers were asleep on the terrace of a nearby under construction building when the building caught fire, officials said.

Officials of the fire department in Bhiwandi claimed the fire is a major one and more fire tenders will be needed to douse it. Three fire tenders, two from Bhiwandi and one from Thane, are at the spot. Four water tankers have also been pressed into service.

“As soon as we received the fire call, our two fire tenders were sent. The fire is yet to be controlled,” said D Salvi, chief fire officer, Bhiwandi.

“We require more fire tenders. When approached the Kalyan fire brigade, their fire tenders were already occupied. We are now approaching the Ulhasnagar and Ambernath fire teams for help,” Salvi said.

“It is becoming difficult to handle the fire at present as it is spreading,” Salvi said.

The cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

Last year, at least a dozen godowns were gutted in a fire in the power loom town of Bhiwandi.
