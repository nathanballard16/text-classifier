As Andhra Pradesh heads for simultaneous elections to the state Assembly and Parliament on April 11, the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) will arouse nativist sentiment, like Telangana Rashtra Samithi’s (TRS) well-executed strategy for Assembly election in December, to counter anti-incumbency.CR Sukumar provides a snapshot of the poll strategies of various parties.TDP chief and AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu has been alleging a conspiracy against TDP and AP by the trio – Narendra Modi , K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR) and YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Citing several examples over non-cooperation and litigations by the KCR government in Telangana over division of assets and liabilities between the two Telugu-speaking states and the latter’s opposition to the crucial Polavaram irrigation project in Andhra, Naidu was striving to polarise the votes. Of late, TDP also accused TRS of coercing TDP lawmakers with assets and businesses in Telangana to defect to YSRCP.It also alleged TRS stealing critical data of TDP’s booth level workers through illegal police raids on its IT services provider in Hyderabad and handing over the data to rival YSRCP.Last week, Naidu made public papers as evidence of the conspiracy to steal party data and slap cases on TDP leaders.The YSRCP charges TDP of deletion of votes and addition of duplicate/ fake votes.In a close contest between TDP and YSR Congress in Andhra, TDP is expected to struggle minus its former allies BJP and Jana Sena Party (JSP) of actor-turned-politician Pawan Kalyan, who helped TDP scrape through in 2014 polls with a wafer-thin majority. TDP won 102 out of 175 Assembly seats while YSRCP secured 66 seats, though voting difference between the two was a mere 0.4%.Naidu’s TDP has gone hammer and tongs to potray Prime Minister Narendra Modi as the ‘villain’ of Andhra for ‘betrayal’ on the poll promise of conferring special category status (SCS) and helping build a world-class greenfield capital city at Amaravati. TDP has been holding large public meetings, Dharma Porata Deeksha, to highlight Modi’s ‘betrayal’ on the AP State Reorganisation Act 2014, Polavarm and Amaravati, Railway Zone to Vizag and steel factory at Kadapa. It highlighted Rs 2,500 crore that Modi doled out to build the Sardar Patel statue in Gujarat while releasing just Rs 1,500 crore for Amaravati.TDP claims to have achieved spectacular double-digit growth and attracting one of the country’s largest global investments.Large scale welfare schemes in the form of pensions, waiver of farm loans and loans of self-help groups, cash input subsidy to farmers, enhanced salaries and retirement age to government employees, large scale job creation, unemployment allowance to jobless youth, and development of villages and towns across the state key achievements that TDP will highlight.Accusing PM Narendra Modi of favouring weaker alliance partners, Naidu claimed Modi couldn’t dictate terms to TDP. After pulling out of NDA, Naidu went on to unite opposition parties with the Congress through a series of meetings with various regional parties. He managed to garner support of many to the cause of Andhra. Naidu is also preparing to bring top national opposition leaders for the public meetings to attack BJP and Modi.BJP, which shared power with TDP and enjoyed ministerial berths in Andhra till last year, secured a vote percentage of 7% in Lok Sabha and over 2% in Assembly polls in 2014. There is little chance of the BJP finding allies even while it struggles to find suitable candidates. Modi and Amit Shah are expected to address rallies to expose the TDP government’s ‘corruption and irregularities’Any significant gains for Congress in Andhra could seriously dent the YSRCP’s prospects as most of the latter’s voters were traditionally Congress supporters.The adverse impact is most pronounced in the Rayalaseema districts of Andhra.TDP hopes to gain from the split in anti-incumbency votes after losing its 2014 allies BJP and JSP and the latest attempts by Congress to gain the lost ground. However, any significant gains by the JSPLeft alliance could adversely dent the prospects of ruling TDP that has been banking on Kapus after it announced a 5% reservation for the community.Congress, completely routed in the truncated Andhra immediately after carving out Telangana from the united Andhra Pradesh, is attempting to regain lost ground by promising to confer special category status (SCS) on Andhra. Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi recently promised of conferring SCS immediately after Congress comes to power at the centre.JSP opposed the TDP’s decision on accepting special assistance package that the BJP extended against the promised special category status. JSP president Pawan Kalyan holds sway among the Kapu community that makes up 15% of Andhra’s population. The two Godavari districts and North Andhra have a strong Kapu population. Pawan Kalyan can win or adversely affect the prospects of TDP and YSRCP in at least 25 Assembly constituencies. JSP will put up candidates and so will its alliance partners CPI and CPM.JSP on Wednesday night became the first party in Andhra to announce its list of candidates for both Assembly and Lok Sabha.TDP plans to showcase completion of a major part of the Polavaram large irrigation project in a short span of time. The party wil also highlight pooling of 34,000 acres from farmers for the capital city at Amaravati, finalising designs, roping in global investors and taking up the construction of many key clusters despite non-cooperation from the Centre. It will also talk about global companies like Kia Motors investing in an automobile hub in the region.
