Rs. 96,000 found in dead beggar's artificial leg

Bangalore: A 75-year-old beggar Shareef Sab, originally from Hyderabad was found dead, here in front of his usual post, the cantonment railway station. The High Grounds police reached the scene when passersby alerted them on Tuesday Morning at 10 AM.

The locals informed the policemen that he had lost his leg due to gangrene and had gotten his artificial limb many years ago. He ate at the nearby hotels and slept near the railway station. When the policemen found the beggar's artificial leg unusually heavy, they opened it and found that the man had saved money he had received in the form of alms in his leg. They were all notes and coins in the denominations of Rs. 500, 200, 100 and other coins.

Shareef Sab's sister residing in Hyderabad has been tracked down and has been informed of the event. A case has been registered as an unnatural death.
