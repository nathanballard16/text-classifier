Apple CEO Tim Cook Praises Pictures of Aamchi Mumbai

San Francisco: Apple CEO Tim Cook has appreciated pictures of Mumbai shot on Australian photographer Andrew Kneebone’s iPhone XR. Kneebone took to Twitter on Friday to share colourful shots of Aamchi Mumbai and added the #ShotOniPhone hashtag that caught Cook’s attention. “I’ve always believed that the world is a beautiful place! India has a beauty all its own, from the cobblestone streets to the unique colours painted on the walls. I made these wallpapers from photos I took on my iPhone XR in Mumbai! #shotoniphone,” Kneebone captioned his shots.

Cook re-tweeted Kneebone’s album and captioned - “Love these #shotoniPhone photos! Thanks for sharing such a beautiful glimpse of Mumbai, @AndrewKneebone.” The pictures shared by Kneebone are not the regular landscape and portrait shots, rather they are of punchy wall-art colours, dried yellow flowers against the grey stony surface and other such pictures that fall under the abstract category.
