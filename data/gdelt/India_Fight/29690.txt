"Several CBI teams started the searches at over 22 places in Uttar Pradesh this morning. The CBI team also raided three residential premises of former UP minister Prajapati in Amethi," an unnamed CBI source told the news agency IANS.

The CBI also conducted raids at 22 other locations in connection with illegal mining in the state during 2012 and 2016. The agency had booked 11 people under various sections in the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act.

The agency named several people in the case including Hamirpur District Magistrate B Chandrakala, geologist/mining officer Moinuddin, SP leader Ramesh Kumar Mishra and former Mining Department clerks Ram Ashray and Ram Avtar.

On January 5, the CBI conducted raids at 14 locations in Delhi and Uttar Pradesh including the residence of Chandrakala.

The former chief minister and SP president Akhilesh Yadav held the mining ministry in UP from 2012 to 2013. Prajapati succeeded him as mining minister.
