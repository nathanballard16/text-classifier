Manipur rebel body boycotts Modis Imphal visit on Friday

IMPHAL: The Coordinating Committee (CorCom), an umbrella body of prominent rebel organisations, has called a statewide shutdown on Friday when Prime Minster Narendra Modi is scheduled to visit Imphal to inaugurate developmental projects. A special protection group team arrived here on Monday to provide fool-proof security cover to the Prime Minister. These policies are "triggering artificial conflicts among different ethnic communities in Manipur", it claimed.On Friday, Modi will land at Imphal around noon. Manipur police commandos have been conducting sudden raids and combing operations at hotels and some localities in both Imphal West and Imphal East districts in the last few days. The Prime Minister, through his visit, only wants to ensure that New Delhi can "strengthen its grasp" on the state so that a message can be sent out to the world that Manipur is an integral part of India, the body claimed.
