Watch: With Amma gone, Modi is our daddy, he's India's daddy, says Tamil Nadu Min KT Rajendra Balaji

Tamil Nadu Minister KT Rajendra Balaji on Friday hailed PM Modi saying he was AIADMK’s ‘daddy’ in the absence of J Jayalalithaa. On being asked why AIADMK had forged an alliance with BJP, Tamil Nadu Minister K T Rajendra Balaji said: “When Amma (Jayalalithaa) was alive she was in full control, her decisions were her own. So,it was different but in today's context due to absence of Amma, Modi is our daddy. He is India's daddy. So we have accepted his leadership.”

The Minister for Dairy Development was talking to reporters at Maharajapuram near Srivilliputtur.

When pointed out that Jayalalithaa had said in the run-up to the 2014 elections that she was 'better', he said: "She only wanted to show the world that such a qualified leadership from Tamil Nadu was present. Otherwise, she had all respect for Mr. Modi, even in the days of (former Prime Minister), Atal Bihari Vajpayee. They were good friends."
