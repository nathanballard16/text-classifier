In the midst of delay in the release of the list of candidates for the Haryana Assembly election by the Congress, former party chief Ashok Tanwar on Wednesday sent a voice message to his supporters across the state asking them to reach the AICC headquarters in Delhi.

The voice message said some people were out to ruin the Congress. "Come to AICC headquarters to save your interests as well as to save the interests of the party," said Tanwar in the message.

Hundreds of Tanwar's supporters had created a ruckus outside Sonia Gandhi's residence on Tuesday alleging discrimination with them in the selection of candidates.

Police had to be called as his supporters blocked the road outside Sonia's residence.

Speaking to The Tribune, Tanwar alleged that those who worked hard for five years to strengthen the Congress were being ignored in the distribution of tickets.

He said that he had given a list of 85 aspirants to the AICC based on their hard work, but except for one of two, all the names were being ignored by the party's new leadership, which includes former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda and State Congress chief Kumari Selja.

"I have given a call to my supporters to reach AICC headquarters. A large number of them are already there. We want to tell the central leadership of the Congress that injustice is being done to those who worked hard to strengthen the party during the past five years. If the AICC listens to our grievance, it's good, otherwise, the party workers will chalk out their future course of action," said Tanwar.

Tanwar's wife Avantika Maken said that hundreds of Tanwar's supporters are already outside Sonia Gandhi's residence and many others are on their way to protest against the "high-handedness" of certain elements inthe party were out to deny tickets to Tanwar's supporters.
