AMMAN, Aug. 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Thursday underlined the importance of de-escalating the rising tensions between India and Pakistan, calling for dialogue to overcome the crisis.

Jordan expressed confidence in the "wisdom" of the leaders of the two countries in dealing with the rapid developments, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Sufian Qudah said in a statement, a copy of which was obtained by Xinhua.

The official called for both countries to take necessary measures to contain the tensions, and resort to dialogue to enhance their neighbourly relations in accordance with international conventions and laws, which would enhance the region's security and stability.

Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday visited Pakistan-controlled Kashmir amid the ongoing crisis with India after the latter scrapped the special status of Indian-controlled Kashmir on Aug. 5.

Tensions have been rising after India's move. In reaction, Pakistan downgraded its diplomatic relations and suspended trade relations and train service with India.

In the latest development, Indian and Pakistani border troops were involved in cross-border clashes on Thursday, India's 73rd Independence Day, leading to casualties on both sides.
