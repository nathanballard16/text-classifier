Martyred Maj Kaustubh Rane's Wife Shows Grit & Becomes Army Officer Within A Year Of His Passing

When a soldier dons the uniform for the very first time and vows to place the country above all else - above themselves, their family and friends, and second only to the welfare of the citizens- they also pledge to honour that oath till their dying breath.

There isn't much a soldier would let on about the harsher realities of his life, seen both on and off the battlefield. They are quick to snake around and dismiss their personal discomforts and fears, just so that they can focus on the greater task at hand - protecting the nation, and its people.

Those were probably the exact thoughts that dominated Late Major Kaustubh Rane's mind while he chased his own end on the fateful day of 7th August 2018. Major Kaustubh Rane was posted with the 36 Rashtriya Rifles deployed in Jammu & Kashmir at the time of his death.

29-year-old Major Kaustubh Rane was martyred during an encounter with terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Gurez, where Major Rane, along with three soldiers, gunned down two of the eight infiltrators before falling to their bullets.

Major Rane left behind his young wife Kanika and their 2-year-old son, besides a pair of heartbroken parents who lost their only son.

A resident of Mira Road in Mumbai, Kaustubh always wanted to become an Army officer, leading in front-line combat, and that is exactly how the brave soldier met his final end.

Given the kind of inspiration he became for a lot of people around him, it doesn't come as a surprise to see that Major Rane's wife Kanika has picked up the torch since his martyrdom, with a vow to protect and further his legacy.

In keeping with her promise to honour her husband's memories and the ultimate sacrifice he made for our motherland, Kanika decided to give her all and join the Indian Army. In less than a year since Major Rane's untimely martyrdom, Kanika cleared the exam and made it as an Army officer. She will soon be heading out to Chennai for her training which starts in October.

Kanika remembers her husband as a lively and jovial man, who hated nothing more than seeing her cry. She believes that by joining the army, she is not only keeping up his legacy, but also fulfilling her husband's dream. Additionally, she also wants their now 3-year-old son to feel proud of his father's sacrifice.

It is purely on the basis of her grit and determination that Kanika has been able to move past a great personal loss, and fulfil her late husband's dream of serving the nation.

Kanika's journey is nothing less than an inspiration for every individual who doesn't wish to be deterred by all the challenges life decides to throw their way. Instead, people like her, take their loss and pain and turn it into a source of fuel that would help them change their future for good.
