Police arrest coal mafia for ‘murderous’ assault on Sail chairman AK Chaudhary

Sail chairman AK Chaudhary was assaulted by four men on August 4.

New Delhi: The alleged murderous assault on Steel Authority of India Limited (Sail) chairman Anil Kumal Chaudhary on August 7 was not a case of road rage. The crime branch has arrested a contractor and coal mafia AK Singh who allegedly tried to kill Chaudhary as he cancelled a coal supply contract to a company owned by Singh's son

Worth mentioning here is that a contract was signed between Sail and Sonam Trading SEZ USA for supply of coal worth Rs 100 crore. Sonam Trading (US) is reportedly owned by Anil Singh's son Anu Singh. Sail paid the first installment of Rs 30 crore but when it checked the quality of coal that was to be imported, it didn't meet the quality standard set by the public sector firm.

The deal was then cancelled by Sail.

Singh then hatched a conspiracy to target Sail chairman and hired men who were told to stage a road rage and assault Chaudhary.

To recap, on August 7, around 10:30 pm, Chaudhary was returning home from work when his car was hit by another vehicle, occupied by four people on August Kranti road. The accused then brutally assaulted Chaudhary and his driver. Hearing their shouts for help, police constables who were on beat patrolling rescued Chaudhary and his driver and arrested two assailants.

According to Chaudhary, when the four men were assaulting him, one of the assailants shouted 'finish him'.

The chairman was taken to the trauma centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences and was discharged later, the company said.

Later four more were nabbed by the crime branch. They told the cops that Rs 6 lakh was paid to them for the assault. They said Singh's idea was to grievously injure Chaudhary so that someone else is appointed as interim chairman and they can get the deal renewed.
