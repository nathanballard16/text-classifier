(TIE)

At least two workers were killed and four received burns in a fire that broke out at an ONGC oil well in Nandej near Ahmedabad on Wednesday night. The fire broke out when the workers were carrying out maintenance work.

Additional Chief Fire Officer at Ahmedabad Fire Emergency Services, Rajesh Bhatt, said, “Although the exact cause of the fire can only be known after forensic investigation, it is suspected that an ignition source near the drilling site led to the blaze. There was sufficient quantity of spillage from the drilling well plus there was also an oil tanker near it. Moreover, during drilling, there are inflammable vapours that accumulate in the surrounding environment, thereby making it susceptible to inflammation.”

Bhatt added, “A total of nine vehicles were sent to the spot, including water tender, water bowsers, water tankers and foam nursers.” The deceased were identified as Sanjay Mahendra Singh (25) and Shahjad Alam Ansari (27).
