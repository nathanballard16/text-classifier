Pakistan afraid Indian Army's retaliation on border, Imran Khan levelled false allegations

Islamabad: The Indian Army on Saturday killed 7 Pakistani BAT fighters after foiling an infiltration attempt by Pakistan on the Line of Control (LoC). Since then, there has been a hue and cry in Pakistan. Pakistan's PM Imran Khan has called an emergency meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad on Sunday following a tip off about the incident.

Imran Khan then tweeted a series of tweets. The tweet clearly shows the fear of Imran Khan sitting in his heart. Now Imran Khan is talking about the killing of innocent people in the Indian Army's action. In fact, the Indian Army has been continuously retaliating against Pakistani military positions in an attempt to contain infiltration along the Line of Control (LoC). Fearing the retaliation, Pakistan summoned an Indian High Commission official and claimed the lives of two of its nationals in India's firing.

Imran Khan, on the other hand, wrote in a weeping tweet that "I strongly condemn India's attack on innocent civilians across the border. Pakistan's PM claimed that the Indian Army used a cluster bomb along the border. Pakistan has been consistently saying that the firing by the Indian Army has resulted in the death of its civilians.
