RAJKOT: A man and his two family members were attacked on Tuesday night by his ex-employer after he refused to provide him with the data of the firm where he joined recently.

Police said, Rohit Gajipara, Rajan Ankoria, Tejas Gajipara, Prashant Gajipara, Ajay Vekri and Ravi Daya along with their six unidentified aides attacked the house of Nitesh Chawda in Shrinathji Society on Mawdi Road in Rajkot.

According to the complaint lodged by Chawda, Rohit was angry with him after he had refused to divulge the data containing vital information of rates, client base and turnover of Ultra Power, a solar panel manufacturing company, which Chawda had recently joined.

Chawda earlier used to work under Rohit at his company which was also into manufacturing of solar panels. He recently left Rohit’s firm and joined Ultra Power.

“Chawda alleged that Rohit had called him up two days ago, asking for the data of Ultra Power, which Chawda refused, triggering heated arguments between the duo over the phone. Incensed with him, Rohit attacked Chawda’s house, vandalized it and beat up Chawda, his brother Deepak Chawda (47) and his nephew Hiren Chawda (19),” said J A Khachar, sub-inspector with Malaviyanagar police station.
