Bollywood brown-face controversy highlights India's bias for fair skin

NEW DELHI - An actress cavorting and wooing her lover by showing off her fair wrists may seem anachronistic, even downright offensive to some. But Bollywood actress Jacqueline Fernandez's song, Chittiyaan Kalaiyaan (Fair Wrists), proved to be one of the Hindi film industry's wildly popular hits in 2015.

It remains so even today, with fans overlooking the song's prejudice for fair skin.
