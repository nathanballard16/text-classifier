Veteran actor and filmmaker Aparna Sen has joined the doctors’ protest in Kolkata and has said she won’t accept any more state awards as a mark of protest against the plight of doctors in the state.

Aparna Sen was once perceived as close to Mamata Banerjee and her call for ’Poriborton’ in the last years of the Left Front rule.

A junior doctor on Monday night was left with a fractured skull after a 200-strong mob attacked the NRS hospital in Kolkata following the death of a patient.

As protest, doctors at the NRS hospital started a strike on Tuesday which has now snowballed and spread across the state and other parts of the country. Doctors in Delhi, Mumbai, Hyderabad and other prominent cities are protesting against the treatment meted out to their colleagues in Kolkata.

On Thursday, Kolkata Mayor Firhad Hakim's daughter Shabba Hakim posted on Facebook, demanding safety at work for doctors in the state. Shabba, who is a doctor herself, said she is deeply ashamed as a Trinamool Congress worker.

On Friday, Mamata Banerjee faced further embarrassment as her nephew himself has joined the protests that she claimed were a conspiracy of the BJP. Abesh Banerjee was seen leading the protests at the KPC Hospital this morning.

AIIMS Delhi along with hospitals in other cities has joined the protests against Mamata Banerjee's inaction in protecting the doctors.

Mamata Banerjee, meanwhile, has cried foul and accused Opposition BJP and CPI(M) of hatching a conspiracy against the Bengal government.
