Kerala Chief Minister Pinarai Vijayan, former Communist Party of India general secretary Prakash Karat and other leaders of the Left Party have strongly opposed the announcement of Congress party president to contest from Wayanad. They said that this action indicates that the Congress party is not against the BJP, instead, they are against the left party.

In the meantime, due to Mr. Gandhi's 'soft stand', CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury is seen alone inside the party. Yechury says that the left party should be reconciled with the same ideologically instead of falling into any kind of controversy at the time of the election, and the only goal should be to defeat the BJP at the moment. Lok Sabha elections are going to be held in seven phases from April 11 to May 19. Counting of votes will take place on May 23.
