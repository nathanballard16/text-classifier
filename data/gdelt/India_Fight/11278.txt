Qureshi told CNN that the Islamic Republic is ready to take any steps that could lead top de-escalation including an action Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar, given that India provides “solid evidence”.

“Please sit and talk, please initiate a dialogue and we will show reasonableness," Qureshi said in an interview to CNN. Pakistan Foreign Minister also confirmed that he is in Pakistan and keeping unwell. "He is in Pakistan, according to my information," Qureshi was quoted as saying.

"He is unwell to the extent that he can't leave his house, because he's really unwell," the foreign minister said.

In a statement issued on Thursday, Qureshi said Pakistan is ready to release the detained Indian Air Force pilot (IAF) Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman in order to de-escalate tension with India. Later Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan issued the statement in Parliament that Varthaman will be released as a gesture of peace.

Varthaman's MIG-21 Bison crashed after a fierce dogfight in which he shot down a PAF (Pakistan Air Force) F-16, along the Line of Control (LoC). The IAF pilot's parachute landed in Pakistan. His fighter jet was part of an IAF counter attack to thwart a bid by Pakistan Air Force (PAF) to target military installations in India a day after IAF bombed a JeM terror camp in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Balakot in Pakistan.
