EXCLUSIVE: Katrina Kaif REVEALS plans of making her debut production venture this year

In the last few years, there's a different Katrina Kaif that we have seen on-screen. Her performance in Zero was nothing less than effortless and suddenly, even the critics started taking notice of her role. In fact, she has gone on record saying that although at one point, a few years ago, her priorities were different, but now, she has a different outlook towards life.

While she's busy promoting Bharat right now, Kat has also been busy shooting for her portions in Rohit Shetty's Sooryavanshi. Ask her what's next and she reveals that she has not signed any other film as of now. "I'll take a call after Bharat releases," she smiles.

But she makes another interesting revelation. For the longest time, she has wanted to turn a producer. She had also bought the rights to a French film He Loves Me He Loves Me Not but that didn't take off. Now, it's finally happening. She tells us, "Yes, it's true. I plan to start my production house sometime towards the end of this year." Katrina further adds, "I really hope to put my name as a producer to one of the projects I've been in discussions with. So let's see." Will it be the PT Usha biopic? Only time will tell!

Bharat, directed by Ali Abbas Zafar, stars a huge ensemble with names like Salman Khan, Katrina, Disha Patani, Tabu, Jackie Shroff, Sunil Grover, Sonali Kulkarni among others and releases on Eid this year.
