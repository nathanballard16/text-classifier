Later, Malik shared the same pictures on her Instagram handle, with the caption, “I’m usually the kurta to her lehenga, so coming up with family-ready femme wedding outfits was more than a little stressful for me.”



Sporting elegant ethnic attire, the women went all out with bindis, nose pins, and dainty jewellery to complement their outfits. The picturesque backdrop of New York City serves as an apt romantic setting for the couple, who are seen sharing a transparent umbrella in the light rain.





People are pouring loving comments, including: “Feeling the love and that’s totally making my heart full" and “This is so cute my heart hurts <3”
