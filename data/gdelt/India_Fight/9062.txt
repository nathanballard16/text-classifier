10,000 more Indian soldiers deployed in occupied Kashmir as crackdown continues

SRINAGAR: More than 10,000 Indian soldiers were deployed in occupied Kashmir on Saturday as crackdown continued in the valley, Kashmir Media Service reported.



An additional 100 companies, around 10,000 soldiers started arriving in the occupied valley, a day after India ordered the reinforcements.

The occupying forces have launched a massive crackdown arresting over 200 pro-freedom people including Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) Chairman Yasin Malik and Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) Ameer Dr Abdul Hameed Fayaz.



Malik was arrested after a raid at his Maisuma residence overnight in Srinagar. The overnight arrests also included many senior members of JeI.

A complete shutdown is being observed in parts of Srinagar and in Bandipora town today, against the arrest and killing spree in the occupied territory.

The Joint Resistance Leadership (JRL) in its statement called for a strike in the valley against India’s arbitrary measures including mass arrests, nocturnal raids, killings and attempts to repeal hereditary laws.

Chairman of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Syed Ali Gilani, in a statement, said the unrealistic attitude of Indian leadership had created death and destruction in the territory.

The targeted onslaughts against Kashmiris in India continue unabated as three more Kashmiri youth were attacked by Hindu fanatics in New Delhi while a journalist was beaten up in Pune. Massive protests erupted in Lal Chowk area of Islamabad town against attacks on the Kashmiris in India.

The situation in occupied Kashmir has worsened in the aftermath of the February 14 Pulwama attack which killed over 40 Indian soldiers.
