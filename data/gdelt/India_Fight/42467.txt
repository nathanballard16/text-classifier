Jaipur, September 6

Around two dozen men opened indiscriminate fire with AK-47s inside Behror police station in Alwar, Rajasthan, on Friday morning and escaped with wanted gangster Vikram alias Papla Gurjar, who was in the lock-up.

The policemen, meanwhile, were hiding in an adjoining room trying to save their lives. They later informed their seniors about the incident, following which Superintendent of Police Amandeep Singh reached the police station.

He said the attackers were from Haryana. They attacked the police station around 8.45 am and escaped with Gurjar, who is wanted in several murder cases in Haryana, and had been arrested on Thursday.

Police sources said the gang had earlier managed to free Gurjar while he was being taken for hearing in Mahendragarh in Haryana.

They added that special investigation teams had been formed to probe the case and state highways between Jaipur and Delhi, and Alwar and Narnaul had been sealed. IANS
