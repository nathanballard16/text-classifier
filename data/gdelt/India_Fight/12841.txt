The unsung hero of the Indian pilot story? His moustache

Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman has returned home to India to a hero’s welcome. In a story line straight from a Bollywood version of The Dam Busters, fighter pilot Varthaman was shot down over Pakistan and taken captive. It’s reported that he swallowed confidential documents before being beaten by a mob and captured, filmed and paraded on video - in one clip, bizarrely, drinking tea - before being released by the Pakistani military on Friday. And in homage to his bravery, a curious trend has swept social media across the world; emulating Varthaman’s thick, fulsome moustache

It’s certainly majestic in its proportions; a moustache that tapers down to his chin and then, like a jet scrambling for cover, diverts upwards on each side of the jaw into two sculpted points, a follicular kamikaze run across the face that’s somewhere between a “mutton chops beard” with a touch of “handlebars” theatrically thrown in for good measure. It’s a wing commander in its own right, taking flight across his cheeks.

Gillette’s glorious glossary of beard shapes - a veritable almanac for the hirsute - features a style called, appropriately, the Gunslinger, which Varthaman’s beard bears a likeness to. Although befitting the swashbuckling antics of our action man, we prefer to think that his moustache is a sculpting of his own creation, matching his pioneer status. After all, this is not a man who follows the rule book in the throws of capture (he ditched his documents in a pond after hoodwinking his pursuers) or the bathroom cabinet.
