Letter: For health care, learn from the experience of others

(Susan Walsh | Associated Press file photo) A sign is shown during a news conference to reintroduce "Medicare for All" legislation, on Capitol Hill in Washington in April 2019.

Thanks to Bart Jacobs for writing “Medicare for All is a bad idea,” May 8, and to Christine Helfrich for her piece, “Medicare for All is right road to take,” May 7.

Both approaches and criticisms to our health care have merit. However, neither writer mentions fair compensation to the health care providers who are top of the line in skill and care. One size fits all doesn’t quite work in a field with diverse challenges.

We, as a nation, need to take a closer look at what other countries have done and are doing. France, after World War II, instituted a national health care system that helped unite the country. In the 1800s, Bismarck, having successfully taken control of the country, instituted a health care for all that united German citizens who had been members of various Duchies.

Both systems report statistically better outcomes than our own at a lower cost. Yet, the question remains: Do any systems encourage and reward talented and dedicated people to enter health care?

Our federal government could convene a blue ribbon panel of experts from our health providers, hospitals, insurance companies and other stakeholders that would review in depth the successes and failures of other systems, especially in Europe, and more recently, in India, for starters. The best way to solve a problem is from the experiences of others.

By the way, many thanks to Dr. Kim Bertin (now retired) and to Scotty, his wonderful physician’s assistant, for the titanium hip you installed in 2006. I have rolled my bike on it (not recommended), but the hip is just fine. Good job.
