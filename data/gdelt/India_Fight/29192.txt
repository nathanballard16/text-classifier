Expressing “deep concern” over continuing post-poll violence in West Bengal, the Centre on Sunday issued an advisory to the state government asking it to ensure that law and order is maintained.

Sources said the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) reminded the West Bengal government about the violent incidents that took place in the state. The advisory reportedly sad: “Latest reports indicated that four persons were killed on June 8 in post-poll clashes at Bhangipara and Hatgacha in North 24 Parganas district. Earlier also there have been reports of incidents of violence in which people lost lives in various parts of West Bengal”.

Claiming that it has “viewed the current situation in West Bengal with deep concern”, the MHA in the advisory said: “The unabated violence over the past weeks appear to be a failure on the part of the law enforcement machinery of the state to maintain the rule of law and inspire confidence among people”.

The MHA in the advisory has asked the state government to take “all necessary measures to maintain law and order, peace and public tranquility” and also requested to take “strict action against officials found delinquent in discharge of their duty”, sources said.
