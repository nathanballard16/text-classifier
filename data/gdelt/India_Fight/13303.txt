SCOOPS: Shah Rukh Khan in Salman Khan's next with Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Farhan-Shibani to get married this summer?

1/4

Since 2010, Salman Khan and Ramzan Eid have been synonymous. The only exception was the year 2013, when Salman let go of the date and Shah Rukh Khan brought Chennai Express during the festival. While the Dabangg actor hasn’t announced any project for next Eid, Akshay Kumar, Karan Johar and Rohit Shetty decided to announce their film Sooryavanshi during the festival in 2020.

Of course, no sooner had this announcement come than the industry grapevine was abuzz with rumours that Salman may still want to have a release too around the same time. According to our source, “Salman’s next with Sanjay Leela Bhansali could release on Eid 2020. Bhansali gave a huge hit in Padmaavat last year and his collaboration with Salman, after 12 years since Saawariya, has already created ripples.”

Another industry insider tells us that this Salman-Sanjay project is likely to get more heft with the presence of another superstar. “It is believed that Shah Rukh will also be roped in for a pivotal part in the Salman-Sanjay film. Considering that the last time the two superstars did a film together was Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam (2002), notwithstanding SRK’s cameo in Tubelight (2007) and Salman’s in Zero (2018), the two Khans in a Bhansali film will attract audiences to theatres,” observes our informer.
