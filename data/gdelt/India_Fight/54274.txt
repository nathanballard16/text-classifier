People in Agra want Unnao rape accused to meet same fate as Hyderabad culprits

The rape and murder case of the Telangana veterinarian appears to have come to a closure following the Hyderabad Police's action taken against the four accused in the case.

Largely, people in Agra are euphoric about the Hyderabad Police shooting incident but some are of the view that the police action violated basic tenets of the law.

After the police resorted to 'retaliatory' firing in the Telangana rape-murder case, the chorus for the same grew for the Unnao rape case as well. The people are demanding for an 'encounter' in the Unnao rape case where a girl was burnt alive by accused.

The Unnao rape victim is in a hospital fighting for her life as people demand the lives of her rapists be taken away.

The girl, whose body was 90 per cent burnt, is receiving treatment at Safdarjung Hospital in New Delhi.

Hindustani Biradari secretary Ziauddin said, "There have been several incidents of rape in the country where the culprits should have been shot dead on the spot but they are currently either in jail or out on bail, harassing the victims, just like what happened in Unnao. If the UP Police had also taken such a step earlier, the Unnao girl would have been saved from such a dastardly attack."

He said that a lot of such culprits are currently out on bail from Mathura, Firozabad and Mainpuri "and they too, should be shot down like the Hyderabad rape accused, only then will the rape incidents stop".
