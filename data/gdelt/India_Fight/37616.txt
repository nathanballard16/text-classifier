Cops nab mason after breakthrough in Netaji Nagar double murder case

Kolkata: The Detective Department of Kolkata Police has made a breakthrough in the case of the double murder at Netaji Nagar and arrested a mason in connection with the crime. The bodies of Dilip Mukherjee (80) and Swapna Mukherjee (72), a childless couple, were found at their residence in Netaji Nagar on July 30. The police had earlier detained another labourer, but he was released after his connection with the case could not be established. He added that murder for gain could be a motive but there are other angles to the case that need to be probed. The Mukherjee family had painted their house a few months ago and a number of labourers had worked there.
