India warns of ‘crushing response’ after Kashmir suicide bomb attack

India's prime minister warned Friday of a "crushing response" after an attack by a Pakistan-based Islamist group killed 41 Indian police officers in Kashmir, according to reports.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi blamed Thursday's bombing on Pakistan, which India accuses of supporting rebels in Kashmir.

"Our neighboring country thinks such terror attacks can weaken us, but their plans will not materialize," he said, adding that government forces have been "given total freedom" to deal with the militants.

"Security forces have been given permission to take decisions about the timing, place and nature of their response," he said.

The attack was one of the deadliest ever in Indian-controlled Kashmir.

India Finance Minister Arun Jaitley will take all possible diplomatic steps to ensure the “complete isolation” of Pakistan in response to the attack, Reuters reported.
