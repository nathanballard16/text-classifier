Pak youngsters condemn Pulwama terror attack

“Anti Hate Challenge”, “No to War” rule internet

JAMMU, Feb 21: Amid war-rhetoric at the government level in both the nations and wave of hatred against Kashmiris and Pakistanis across India, few young Pakistanis have taken upon themselves to raise a voice of sanity. And this, they have done by condemning Pulwama terror attack in unequivocal terms through an internet campaign “Anti Hate Challenge” and “No to War.”

The campaign initiated by a Pakistani journalist has taken internet by storm.

As per a “LiveWire” report, a Pakistani journalist Sehyr Mirza on Tuesday evening, posted a picture of herself on Facebook holding a placard which read: “I am a Pakistani and I condemn Pulwama Terrorist Attack.”

Using the hashtags ‘Anti Hate Challenge’ and ‘No to War’, the journalist appealed to her fellow citizens to join her in condemning the Pulwama attack, which claimed the lives of more than 40 Central Reserve Police Force soldiers.

In a long Facebook post, she wrote, “We’re deeply disturbed over the tragic terror attack that claimed innocent lives in Kashmir. In such testing times, we need more sane voices to speak out against war and terrorism.”

She spoke out against war and bloodshed, quoting popular lyricist Sahir Ludhianvi’s poem “Whether blood is ours of theirs, its the blood of humankind.” The poem, similar to Mirza’s peace appeal, talks about the tragic consequences of war and ends with: “War is a problem itself. How will war resolve problems?”

Soon after, many people from both India and Pakistan came on board and hashtags #Antihatechallenge and #Notowar started trending alongside #Pulwamarevenge and other violence-seeking hashtags. Unlike hate-filled Twitter threads against Kashmiris and Pakistanis, the comment section on her Facebook post only had messages promoting love, peace and humanity. Many people from Pakistan posted pictures with the same message on Twitter.
