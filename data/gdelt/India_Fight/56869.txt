Several chairs, tables, office stationery and documents reduced to ashes in the fire at the Islamabad Police Chowki here.

Some motorbikes were also razed in the fire. Columns of smoke were seen billowing from the police post.

Protests have intensified in various parts of the country against the new law which was passed by Parliament and enacted last week.
