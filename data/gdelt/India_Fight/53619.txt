Brahmastra, which also features Alia Bhatt is first part of Ayan Mukerji’s sci-fi trilogy. The film is scheduled to release in May 2020.

Big B’s post got 1.2K retweets and 26.2K likes. Fans posted his pictures with similar looks. One even posted a throwback black-and-white picture of his, sporting a white kurta-pyajama.

Replying to Big B’s tweet, a fan gushed: “The most handsome, attractive Indian actor loved, globally ever seen. You are irresistible sir, can’t take eyes off you. May you keep on shining like this forever and ever.”

Another fan said: “It’s not about money or connections – it’s the willingness to outwork and outlearn everyone. Hats off, sir. Love you and take care.”

A post read: “Dearest sir, you are the hottest superstars of our country. Please take good care of yourself and have a wonderful stay….”

One fan was obviously sad over the two rape-murder cases reported last week. She wrote: “I hope you are aware of what all is going on in our country nowadays. But unfortunately, our system is silent. They are not even listening to our screams. Maybe, they will listen to you. Please sir, raise your voice for justice and support us.”
