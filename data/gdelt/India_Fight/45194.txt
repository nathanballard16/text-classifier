Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi stayed clear of mentioning prevailing situation in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir in his address to UN General Assembly in New York on Friday, choosing instead to focus on domestic policies such as development and sanitation.He did however make an oblique reference to arch-rivals Pakistan, saying, “We belong to a country that has given the world, not war, but Buddha’s message of peace.“And that is the reason why our voice against terrorism, to alert the world about this evil rings with seriousness and outrage,” remarked the Hindu nationalist leader.Harping on his terror mantra, Modi said the world needs to unite in the fight against terrorism, adding that it was the greatest threat to humanity and the biggest global challenge.While Modi was delivering his speech, thousands of Pakistanis, Sikhs and members of human rights organisations protested against India's human rights violations in IoK outside the UN headquarters.New Delhi imposed draconian measures including use of brute force, detentions, curfew and a communications blackout after revoking the disputed valley’s semi-autonomous status in a rushed presidential decree on August 5.In comparison to Modi's low-key address, Prime Minister Imran Khan came down hard on India, saying Pakistan would fight till the end if New Delhi imposed a war in case of any Pulwama-like situation in Indian Occupied Kashmir.“If a conventional war starts between the two countries, anything could happen. But supposing a country seven times smaller than its neighbour is faced with the choice: either you surrender, or you fight for your freedom till death?” he said.“What will we do? I ask myself these questions. We will fight… and when a nuclear-armed country fights to the end, it will have consequences far beyond the borders.”He said there will be bloodbath once curfew is lifted in IOK.
