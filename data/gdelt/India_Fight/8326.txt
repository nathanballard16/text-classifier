New Delhi: In a shocking remark, Congress leader Haroon Yusuf on Thursday linked beef to RDX in the wake of February 14 suicide attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district in which at least 40 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans were killed.

Taking to Twitter, Yusuf, who is a known name in the national capitol’s political circle, said: “@narendramodi Ji can trace 3 kg of beef but cannot trace 350 kg of RDX” with hashtag ModiFailsNationalSecurity.

In an exclusive conversation with Times Now, BJP MP Subramanian Swamy said that it showed the Congress' desperation as the party thought that the surge in patriotism across the country after the dastardly incident would go against it.

Earlier today, Congress' chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala, while addressing a press conference, had said that the government needed to answer how did local militants get RDX and M4 carbines.

"Why did you ignore a video released by Jaish-e-Mohammad 48 hours before? Why couldn't you airlift troops? Is it more expensive than the lives of our jawans?" Surjewala had asked.

Later, the BJP hit back, saying the Congress has shown its "true colours". Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad accused the Congress of making efforts to weaken the morale of the armed forces at a time when the whole international community is "firmly standing" with India.
