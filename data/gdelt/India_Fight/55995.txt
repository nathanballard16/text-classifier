Protests erupt across India against new citizenship law after police storm university campus

A doctor at Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital told The Washington Post that two protesters were brought in with bullet wounds. One was shot in the chest and the other in the foot, said the doctor, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared harassment by the police. Four police officers escorted the two young men “like prisoners,” he said, adding that both were in stable condition after treatment.
