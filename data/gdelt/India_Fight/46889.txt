But he went to Pakistan and was listed by forces as C-category militant. According to his family, he had travelled to Pakistan through Wagah border on a valid passport.A top police officer disclosed that DNA mapping was the best way to establish the identity of the slain and could take about a week. “Once the DNA samples will be taken, we will send them to Forensic Science Laboratory (FSL) Srinagar . The process will take a week or so after which we would be able to establish the identity of the slain,” the officer said.Two terrorists were killed in a gap of three days in September in the dense woods of Gangbal in Naranag area of Ganderbal district . Since September 27, an area spread over 22 kms in the dense woods continues to remain under siege.A police officer said that search and mopping operation is still underway as there were apprehensions that two militants may be still hiding in the forest range which also leads to the Gurez-Bandipora ridge, a traditional infiltration route.
