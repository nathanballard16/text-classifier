Man who killed 7 may get reprieve on ‘juvenile’ plea

NEW DELHI: After remaining on death row for over two decades, a condemned prisoner is likely to escape the noose because of a chance discovery that while committing gruesome murder of seven persons in 1994, he was a juvenile, who could not be awarded the extreme penalty under law.On February 19, 1998, a Pune trial court had awarded capital punishment to him for the macabre murder of five women and two toddlers at a flat in Kothrud in suburban Pune on August 24, 1994. A year later, the Bombay high court upheld the conviction and sentence, pushing him nearer to the gallows.On September 5, 2000, the Supreme Court dismissed his appeal and on November 24, 2000, his plea for review was dismissed in chambers by the SC judges. Nearly a decade and half later on September 2, 2014, the SC felt that death row convicts should get one more chance to argue their cases in open court. It ruled that all petitions seeking review of judgments upholding death penalty should be heard in open court.Grabbing this fresh opportunity, the condemned prisoner moved the SC. However, then President Pranab Mukherjee rejected his mercy petition in August, 2015.In 2016, the death row convict sought review of the sentence and the apex court promptly decided to hear it in open court. In a very late realisation, he moved an application claiming to be a juvenile at the time of commission of the crime.Since no juvenile can be awarded death penalty, the SC on January 29 this year sent his application to the principal district and sessions judge at Pune to inquire whether the convict was a juvenile in August 1994. It sought a report within six weeks.In a startling twist, the district judge sent a report corroborating that the convict was indeed a juvenile, possibly 12-and-a-half-years-old, at the time of the crime. Contents of the report were revealed by a vacation bench of Justices Indira Banerjee and Sanjiv Khanna, who were seized of the convict’s application for release on parole to attend last rites of his father, who died on May 10.Advocate Shadan Farasat’s plea for parole was allowed by the bench, which asked authorities to release him for a week while ensuring that he did not abscond.Though the vacation bench posted the convict’s petition seeking review of his death penalty before the regular bench along with the Pune district judge’s report on his juvenility, the convict could now be assured he would not be sent to the gallows, a hope he had harboured for more than two decades.
