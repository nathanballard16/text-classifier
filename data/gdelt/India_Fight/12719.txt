Mock-Up of Russia-Made T-90 Tank Allegedly Spotted During Chinese Military Drill

In a parallel development, a Russian news outlet reported that the mock-up allegedly used by the Chinese military is likely “imitating” Indian T-90S tanks.

The T-90, a third-generation Russian battle tank, was developed by manufacturer Uralvagonzavod in the early 1990s. In 2001, India acquired 310 T-90S from Russia and is reportedly planning to have 21 T-90S tank regiments by 2020.

India and China engaged in an intense border dispute in the Doklam area in 2017, and last February both sides barely avoided a similar standoff in the Arunachal Pradesh region following an alleged incursion by a Chinese road building team.
