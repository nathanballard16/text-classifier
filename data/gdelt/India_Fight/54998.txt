Rajkot: Female leopard caged, hunt on for more

RAJKOT: After three days of Herculean 24X7 operation involving 200 forest department staff, a female leopard was caged in a farm early on Tuesday morning.The leopardess, aged between five to seven years, was caged in the farm in Kagdadi village, close to Munjiyasar, at around 3am. The leopard had dragged a 50-year-old farmer Vaju Board in Munjiyasar and torn apart his abdomen on the night of December 4.The forest department had set up 30 cages in a vicinity of five km on Munjiyasar village to trap the leopard, which attacked four people in four days last week, killing two of them. The department had given a nod to shoot the big cat if it could not be caged.However, it is cannot be said with certainty that this is the same big cat which has terrorized villages of Amreli’s Bagasara taluka over the last one week.Deputy conservator of forest, Priyanka Gehlot, said, “This female leopard is suspected to be involved in recent human deaths and attacks. However, we will get a concrete evidence only after the scat analysis. The leopard has been taken to animal care centre in Jasadhar.Meanwhile, the mega operation to capture leopards will continue in the area to ensure safety of villagers, officials said. Nearly 100 teams are searching for leopards in the area.Talking to reporters, Amreli collector Ayush Oak said, “There could be a male leopard also involved in this human deaths, so the operation will continue. People have been asked not to venture out during the night.”On the request of the district administration, the state-run power distributor Paschim Gujarat Vij Company Ltd (PGVCL) has also started supplying electricity for agriculture during the day time so that farmers don’t have to go to water their fields in the night.
