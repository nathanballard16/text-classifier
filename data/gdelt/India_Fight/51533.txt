Gutka worth Rs 72.28 lakh seized, 2 brothers held

Coimbatore: The city police seized banned tobacco products worth Rs 72.28 lakh from a godown at Moppiripalayam near Karumathampatti here on Friday.

Police arrested S Setharam, 34, of Telungupalayam and his elder brother S Mothilal, 38, of Church Street at Somanur, who had bought the contraband from Bengaluru for distribution in Pollachi, Coimbatore, Tirupur and Erode.

Special team sub-inspector Kandasamy had received a tip-off about the duo two months ago. The team nabbed them late Thursday night with the help of Saravanampatti police inspector V Selvaraj and also seized a mini truck from them. Police raided the godown at Moppiripalayam on Friday morning and seized the banned products.

“Seventy bags containing chewing tobacco packets of Hans, 33 bags of Ganesh, 21 bags of Cool Lip and 11 bags of Vimal were seized from the godown,” a police officer involved in the operation said.

The duo was booked under sections 269, 270, 353, and 506 (ii) of the Indian Penal Code and some sections of the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003.

Police are on the lookout for their partner Surender Singh.

City police commissioner Sumit Sharan said that Cool Lip is popular among school students. “We are closely monitoring the movements of tobacco products and taking stringent action against the sellers,” he told TOI.
