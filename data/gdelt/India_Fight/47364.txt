Less than a thousand people are in detention in Jammu & Kashmir and around 800 of them are "stone-pelters", Home Minister Amit Shah said as he defended his government's actions with regards to the state. Shah also said there is "no curfew" Jammu and Kashmir.

Restrictions under Section 144 are imposed only in six police stations, Shah said while speaking to India Today TV, adding that situation in the state is under control with postpaid mobile phones working now.

Amit Shah said this while speaking to Indai Today TV in his first interview since the Narendra Modi government moved to scrap Jammu and Kashmir's special status, accorded under Article 370. The government also moved to bifurcate the state into two Union Territories.

In the interview, Amit Shah admitted that former chief ministers Omar Abdullah and Mehbooba Mufti have been detained under the Public Safety Act. However, Amit Shah said Omar's father Farooq Abdullah was not under detention and was free to leave his home.

Amit Shah also said that there has been no firing by forces in the last two months during which enhanced restrictions have been imposed in Jammu and Kashmir. "Kashmir is moving towards normalcy," Amit Shah said.
