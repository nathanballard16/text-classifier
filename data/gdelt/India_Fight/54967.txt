VADODARA: A major fire broke out at a plastic and foam manufacturing company at Waghodiya GIDC estate on Tuesday afternoon.Due to lack of fire-fighting infrastructure at the industrial area, fire engines had to be rushed from 35 kilometres away in Vadodara city.According to sources in Vadodara Fire and Emergency Services (VFES), four fire engines and a staff of 20 men including four officers were pressed to control the fire which broke out around 2.30 pm on Tuesday. It was not known what sparked the fire, but fire officials said that the entire manufacturing facility was engulfed and the neighbouring facility owned by same family had also caught fire.Even as the firemen were making attempts to douse the fire, there were instances of tin sheds of the factory collapsing. No injuries or casualties were reported due to fire or collapse of infrastructure.“The company did not have any fire-fighting equipment nor there was a fire station in the industrial estate. After our bowsers ran out of water, we had to send them to a nearby tyre manufacturing factory for refilling,” said deputy chief fire officer Parth Brahmbhatt.The fire was brought under control only by 7 pm. However, the salvaging continued even after that. The fire department has instructed the Madhya Gujarat Vij Company Ltd to snap the electricity connection of the two units which were engulfed as well as two other neighbouring units which is also owned by same family.
