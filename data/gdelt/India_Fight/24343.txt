Watch: Parth Samthaan whisks away Erica Fernandes to Mussoorie for her birthday as they enjoy a bowling game

Today, as Kasautii Zindagii Kay’s Prerna aka Erica Fernandes celebrates her 25th birthday, the gorgeous actress decided to take some time off her busy schedule and jet off to Mussoorie with rumored boyfriend and Kasautii Zindagii Kay co-actor Anurag aka Parth Samthaan. Right after reaching Mussoorie, Erica has been updating her fans on social media- from pictures of checking into a five star hotel to gorging on some delicious pizza to playing a game of bowling, we love their Insta PDA.

As Erica Fernandes turns a year older today, birthday wishes have been pouring in for the actress from her fans and colleagues on social media and to begin with, we have Hina Khan aka Komolika sharing a sweet birthday wish for Erica on Instagram as she wrote, “choti ka birthday, choti tera birthday aaya.” Well, although Erica and Parth haven’t admitted to dating each other but the fact that Erica decided to celebrate her birthday away from the hustle-bustle of Mumbai and that is why, jetted off to Musoorie with rumoured boyfriend Parth, and therefore, we are sure that something is definitely brewing between the two.

Talking about the show, Hina Khan will soon be bidding adieu to Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2 and reportedly, Hina's last day of shooting will be May 13. In the upcoming episodes, the viewers will see Komolika staging her own death and Parth aka Anurag will be arrested for Komolika’s death. On the other hand, Mr Bajaj will make an entry into Prerna’s life soon. A few days back, social media was abuzz with pictures of Erica and Hina twinning in Indian attire as they shot an exciting dance sequence for Kasautii Zindagii Kay. Both Hina and Erica are dressed in Bengali sarees and in one of the photos, Parth was standing between them.
