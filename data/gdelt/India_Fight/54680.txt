Four thieves stealing from trucks give police team a slip

Two SUVs intercepted by the police

Rajkot: A gang of seven truck thieves gave police the slip after their two SUVs were intercepted at Shiyani village of Limbdi taluka in Surendranagar district on Saturday night.

The thieves rammed their vehicles into a private car in which sub-inspector S S Varu and driver Deepak of Limbdi police station were seated. After the car overturned due to the impact, Varu fired two rounds at the SUVs.

The identities of four accused were ascertained on the basis of a CCTV footage of a roadside hotel where they had halted for snacks and tea.

“Four thieves were identified as Sharifkhan Jatmalek, Wasimkhan Jatmalek, Hanifkhan Jatmalek and Bilalkhan Jatmalek. The identities of other three thieves in another SUV could not be ascertained,” said Varu.

Talking about modus operandi of the accused, Varu said the gang members would climb on to parked trucks, cut their tarpaulin and steal the goods.

“On Saturday night, we received a tip-off that the gang members were in the process of committing a theft at Shiyani village, following which we raided the spot. However, the accused managed to give us the slip,” added Varu.
