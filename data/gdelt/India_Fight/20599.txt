Chowkidar’s lie exposed in SC, loses job bid after 15 years

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court brought a 15-year legal battle to an end on Monday and terminated the services of a “chowkidar” who managed to get a job in Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority through corrupt means. Karamjit Singh was initially working as a daily wager but got regularised in 2001 after claiming that he was in continuous service for three years and was eligible for the job under the state government’s policy. Two years later, it was found that he had worked only for six months and was not eligible for regularisation. On a complaint filed by two of his colleagues, the state government conducted an inquiry and concluded that he managed to get his name surreptitiously included in the final list of employees recommended for regularisation in connivance with government officials. His services were terminated in 2003.He then filed a petition in Punjab and Haryana high court against his termination. The HC upheld regularisation of his service but allowed the state government to take disciplinary action against him. It held that state had not complied with the services rules of issuing charge-sheet and holding inquiry. It held that the action of terminating the services by merely issuing a show cause notice and granting a personal hearing was not sufficient compliance of the regulations. The state government moved the Supreme Court which held that the HC erred in not terminating his job.
