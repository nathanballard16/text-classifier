Smuggling Racket Busted At Airport, Gold Worth Rs 66 lakh Seized

The Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) officials seized 1.99 kg of gold worth Rs 66 lakh on Sunday morning at the Shamshabad International Airport in Hyderabad.

According to the DRI division, a passenger arrived at the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Shamshabad on Sunday from Indore by an Indigo flight (6E-648). After the DRI team subjected the passenger through security checks, he was found smuggling four pieces of gold biscuits. The officials seized the gold bars worth Rs 66.27 lakh and arrested him.

A DRI official informed that the accused revealed the organized gang behind the crime stating that he picked up the gold bars on the flight placed by another member, who traveled in the same aircraft from Sharjah to Thiruvananthapuram. Following the international travel, the accused picked up the gold hidden in secret places in the bathroom during the flight's domestic travel from Indore, Madhya Pradesh to Hyderabad.

The smuggling would be then completed at the last destination without going through customs checks. Upon checking the details of the accused, he is found to have traveled using a fake name carrying a fake Aadhaar card with him. The card was used to book the flight ticket. Following the interrogation, he was arrested under the Customs Act.
