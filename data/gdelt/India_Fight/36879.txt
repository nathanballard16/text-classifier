Fresh protests erupted in India yesterday amid growing public fury over a car crash that critically injured a teenager who accused a lawmaker from the ruling party of rape and harassment.

Two of the 19-year-old's aunts were killed and her lawyer was badly injured when a truck collided with their car in northern Uttar Pradesh state on Sunday, raising suspicions of foul play.

The incident will be probed by federal investigators amid speculation that local police could favor her alleged rapist, Bharatiya Janata Party legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar.

Sengar, a four-term lawmaker, has been in jail since last year but reports say he still enjoys considerable clout. The young woman and the lawyer were battling for their lives in hospital in the state capital Lucknow yesterday.

The teenager had accused Sengar of raping her at his home in Unnao district in 2017 but police in the notoriously lawless state initially refused to take action.

Her father was detained by police and severely beaten in custody - allegedly by Sengar's brother - and later died from his injuries. The woman also tried to set herself on fire outside the home of state Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a BJP stalwart.

Members of opposition parties yesterday shouted slogans and protested outside the national parliament.

The teen's family members accused Sengar of ordering the highway crash.
