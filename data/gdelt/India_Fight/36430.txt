Soldier killed in Pak firing on LoC

SRINAGAR, July 27: A soldier was killed when Pakistani troops violated ceasefire and targeted forward posts near the Line of Control (LoC) in Machil sector, about 150 km from Kupwara in north Kashmir, official sources said today.

They said Pakistani troops resorted to unprovoked and indiscriminate firing from across the LoC in Machil sector targeting forward posts. Indian troops also retaliated and targeted Pakistani forward posts in the sector, they said.

Soldier Lance Naik Rajinder Singh was hit and critically wounded, they said, adding the soldier died before he could be shifted to hospital.

India and Pakistan had agreed for a ceasefire on LoC and International Border (IB) in Jammu and Kashmir in 2003. However, Pakistani troops are violating ceasefire frequently, particularly in Jammu region.

A fresh alert has been issued to troops guarding the LoC following ceasefire violation and reports about presence of large number of militants at launchpads to sneak into this side before the infiltration routes are closed due to snowfall, officials said.

However, troops are already on high alert to foil any infiltration attempt from PAK, they said.
