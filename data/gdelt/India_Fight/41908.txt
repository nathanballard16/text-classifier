'We both fought Pakistanis': IAF chief BS Dhanoa flies MiG-21 with Wing Commander Abhinandan

Pathankot | Jagran News Desk: Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, along with Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa, on Monday flew a joint sortie in MiG-21 fighter from the Pathankot Airbase. They flew in the trainer version of the MiG-21 Type 69 fighter Aircraft. This was also the last sortie of the IAF Chief in a combat aircraft.

The Indian Air Force Chief is also a MiG-21 pilot and had flown the planes during the 1999 Kargil war while commanding the 17 Squadron, during the war.

"This is my last sortie on a fighter jet. Both of us have two things in common - first, both of us ejected and second, both of us have fought Pakistanis. I fought in Kargil, he fought after Balakot. And third, I've flown with his father. It's an honour for me to do my last sortie in the IAF, in a fighter aircraft, with his son," said Dhanoa after a sortie with Abhinandan.

Abhinandan was recently conferred with Vir Chakra award which is the third-highest gallantry award in India after Param Vir Chakra and Mahavir Chakra.

He was captured by the Pakistani Army on February 27 after his MiG-21 Bison jet was shot down in a dogfight with Pakistani jets during aerial combat.

Before his jet was hit, he downed an F-16 fighter of Pakistan. Varthaman was released on the night of March 1 by Pakistan. Varthaman had suffered injuries while ejecting from his MiG-21 Bison during the aerial combat.

A high-level medical board of the Indian Air Force has already cleared Varthaman to return to the fighter cockpit. Days after he returned from Pakistan, Varthaman conveyed to the IAF brass his wish to resume flying at the earliest.

IAF fighter jets bombed a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist training camp in Balakot on February 26, nearly two weeks after the Pulwama terror attack. Pakistan retaliated on February 27 by attempting to target Indian military installations.
