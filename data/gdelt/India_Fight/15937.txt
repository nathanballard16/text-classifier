Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar passed away on Sunday after a long battle with cancer. Manohar Parrikar had been in and out of hospitals in Goa, Mumbai, Delhi, and New York since February last year after he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. Known for his wide acceptability across communities, Manohar Parrikar was BJP's tallest leader having even occupied the post of the Defence Minister of India, a rare feat for a Goan politician. His death has resulted in a void that the Indian polity would not be able to fill in some time to come. Now, Amul has also paid his heartfelt tribute to the great leader Manohar Parrikar.

Amul shared a black and white cartoon poster of Manohar Parrikar on its Twitter handle with a text, “Har Goan ka Manohar” written over it. The caption reads: “Tribute to revered politician and leader.”

The IITian, who died Sunday after battling a pancreatic illness for over a year, had moved to the South Block at the insistence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November 2014.

His nearly three-year tenure saw the Army conducting the surgical strike in September 2016, after a terror attack claimed lives of 19 soldiers in Uri in Jammu and Kashmir.

Parrikar also ensured that the long-pending Light Combat Aircraft Tejas is inducted in the Indian Air Force's fleet, besides taking steps to ease the process of indgenisation in the defence sector.
