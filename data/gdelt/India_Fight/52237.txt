Student-Cop Clash Turns Violent During Protest over Girl's Death from Snake Bite in Indian School

Students from government-run schools and members of the Students Federation of India (SFI) were protesting over the alleged negligence of school authorities in the death of a 10-year-old girl.

Clashes broke out between police and students after protesters breached a barricade and entered a police station in the Waynad area.

The students marched through the streets holding placards, chanting slogans, demanding stern action against the Parents Teachers Association (PTA) and teachers who “refused to rush the student to hospital”. When the protesters turned violent, police used batons to disperse them.
