Bengal factory outlet fire: Five workers still missing

Kolkata, Feb 12 : Five workers were untraceable even after 24 hours of the massive fire at a factory outlet in West Bengal's Sodepur town in North 24 Parganas district, officials said on Tuesday.

The government has assured stringent action against the owner for flouting rules.

"The fire is now under control and a team is being formed to trace the five missing workers. Once the team is inside, they will try to locate the missing people," West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said at the spot.

He said with the help of 25 fire tenders, the remaining pocket fire and smoke is being gradually arrested.

Mitra assured they are ready with all required equipment for the rescue. Also, the "government will provide full assistance to the injured and support to the family members of the deceased".

The factory outlet of the chair-making unit had explosive materials inside, and still lacked proper fire security measures, the workers and relatives alleged.

"This time, we will strictly look into the matter to see why there was no provision of fire exit and other required measures. The step will be taken by filing an FIR against the responsible people," Mitra added.
