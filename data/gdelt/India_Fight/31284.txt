Kolkata: Fresh clashes erupted in West Bengal's Bhatpara area on Saturday, soon after a three-member BJP delegation led by former Union minister SS Ahluwalia left the town. Notably, the top BJP leadership had asked the team to visit the area and submit a report party president and Union Home Minister Amit Shah after two people were killed and several were injured in violent clashes at the same place on Thursday.

According to reports, moments after the team left, people believed to be affiliated to the TMC and the saffron party clashed with each other and hurled country-made bombs and stones at each other. Police had to resort to lathicharge to disperse the mob. This has come even as Section 144 that bans large gatherings is imposed in the area.

The BJP delegation led by Union Minister SS Ahluwalia included MPs Satya Pal Singh and BD Ram, besides other state leaders. Singh and Ram are former police officers and MPs from Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand respectively. Barrackpore MP Arjun Singh was also seen with the BJP delegation during their visit.

Before the saffron party team, a joint delegation of CPI(M) and Congress headed by Leader of Opposition Abdul Mannan and CPI(M) leader Sujan Chakraborty visited the area, demanding a CBI inquiry into the Thursday clashes.

Since the Lok Sabha elections, Bhatpara has been witnessing political violence between the TMC and BJP. The area has become more volatile ever sine TMC MLA Arjun Singh jumped ship and got elected as BJP MP from Barrackpore. Bhatpara comes under the Barrackpore Lok Sabha constituency.
