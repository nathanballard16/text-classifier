Aero India opens today amid shadow of death in Bengaluru

Bengaluru: Much to the disappointment of aviation buffs, the Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) was grounded on Tuesday will not take to the skies during the inaugural of Aero India 2019 on Wednesday after one pilot died after two Hawk aircraft of the Surya Kiran Aerobatics team had a mid-air collision with one aircraft cannoning into the other's cockpit, during a practice session for the Aero India 2019. Both aircraft, which were flying in mirror image formation spun out of control, plummeted to the earth, and crashed close to the Yelahanka Air Force Base station at around 11:50 am Tuesday, killing one of the pilots, while two of them ejected to safety.

The IAF decided to put flights by this aerobatic team on hold in view of the mid-air crash of two aircraft over Air Force Station Yelahanka on Tuesday. "We have to investigate whether it was an error in execution of mirror image formation flying, because of birds or any other reason which resulted in the crash," said a top IAF officer, adding "very few air force aerobatic teams opt for flying display by nine aircraft as it involves a great amount of risk with each aircraft flying four to five meters apart. In our case, the margin of error is low because of skill building over a period of time."

Wing Commander Sahil Gandhi, a Sukhoi-30 pilot, reportedly could not eject from the aircraft and was killed in the crash. From Hisar in Haryana, he is survived by his wife, Himani Jhamb Gandhi and a five-year-old son.

The pilots, who ejected, Wing Commmander VT Shelke and Squadron Leader Tejeshwar Singh, were airlifted to the Air Force Command Hospital and are reportedly recovering. According to sources, one of the pilots fractured both his legs and has been operated on.
