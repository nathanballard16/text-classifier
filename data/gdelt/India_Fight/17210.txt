Liquor rates in Chandigarh are likely to shoot up more than 20 per cent from April 1.

The UT Excise and Taxation Department’s auction for 2019-20 saw sale of 81 of 98 liquor vends rake in Rs 343 crore—34 per cent more than its reserve price and Rs 74 crore more than last year’s auction revenue.

A liquor vend in Dhanas village got the highest bid at Rs 10.78 crore—65 per cent more than the reserve price last year. This also beat last year’s record bid of Rs 6.60 crore, which was for a vend at Raipur Khurd.

Vends in Khuda Lohora—which links Chandigarh Kurali Marg to Palsora—fetched Rs 8.55 crore, almost 200 per cent more than its reserve prices.

The flipside however is that high bidding prices and increase in liquor duties would mean an increase in prices. A vend owner, Darshan Singh Kler, said prices of most India Made Foreign Liquor brands would shoot up 20-25 per cent, but would still be lower than in Haryana and Punjab. Prices of beer and wine are likely to increase only marginally because the duties on them are unchanged.

Deputy Commissioner Mandeer Singh Brar, also the UT Commissioner for Excise and Taxation, said this was the first time that the department had “successfully” conducted allotment process through e-tendering.

The department will also begin issuing excise permits online next month.

Auction for 17 vends that had no takers in Wednesday's auction would be held soon, Brar said.
