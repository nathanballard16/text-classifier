How did Amarnath Yatra become the government’s concern?

Not any yatra:

Vote for yatra:

State and pilgrims:

Terror and pilgrimage:

Over 1 lakh pilgrims will be making the annual pilgrimage to the 3,880 metre-high cave shrine of Amarnath starting today and keeping an eye will be a posse of over 40,000 armed CRPF and state police personnel. The security threat to the yatra is one of the reasons home minister Amit Shah made his first trip to Jammu and Kashmir since assuming office this week.The successful completion of the yatra is important for another reason - it could pave the way for Jammu and Kashmir to vote in a new assembly later this year. The state was put under President's rule on December 19 last year following six months of Governor's rule after the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) pulled out of the People's Democratic Party-led coalition government in June 2018. Earlier this month, the Election Commission said that it would take a call on elections in the state after assessing the situation following the Amarnath Yatra Amarnath cave is said to have been rediscovered by a Muslim shepherd, Buta Malik, in 1850. Malik's family were custodians of the shrine along with Hindu priests from Dashnami Akhara and Purohit Sabha Mattan till 2000. Shri Amarnath Shrine Board Act was passed by the J&K Assembly in 2000-01 and a shrine board with the state's governor as chairman was formed. The board became the custodian of the shrine in order to streamline the pilgrimage and improve facilities for pilgrims.Between 1990 and 2017, there have been 36 terror attacks on the yatra in which 53 pilgrims have died and 167 injured. The two major ones occurred in 2000 and 2017. In 2000, 25 people (including 17 pilgrims) died in a militant attack in Pahalgam, while in 2017, 8 pilgrims were killed and 19 injured in a terror attack at Botengro in southern Anantnag. In fact, the yatra did not take place from 1991 to 1995 because of terror threats. The terror threat is high given the recent terrorist attack in Pulwama when an explosives laden vehicle rammed into a CRPF bus killing 40 soldiers. Around 115 terrorists have been killed by security forces so far this year in comparison to 257 last year. There are still close to 290 terrorists currently active in J&K, say security agencies.
