Large Indian Restaurant Chains' Owner Dies of Cardiac Arrest after Murder Conviction

He was brought by ambulance to surrender before the Chennai court on 9 July to serve his sentence after being turned away by the top court of the country.

He was later admitted to a local hospital, where he died of cardiac arrest.

His popular South Indian restaurant is known to have pioneered the dine-out culture in the rather conservative city of Chennai in 1981 and popularised the “Dosa” – a flat, thin, layered pancake across the world.

The restaurant chain has a presence in 23 countries – from Leicester Square in London to Lexington Avenue, New York, from Singapore to Sydney and Stockholm.

Rajagopal’s story was that of a slumdog-turned millionaire, with the elements of an Indian film plot – rising from being a 'gofer' in a hotel to building up one of the largest restaurant chains in the world, and finally being caught by the law.
