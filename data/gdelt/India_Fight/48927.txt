In India, Release of Hate Crime Data Depends on Who the Haters Are

NEW DELHI — When India released its annual crime report this week, more than a year behind schedule, certain pieces of data were conspicuously missing.

Officials in the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had tracked many types of crimes, but they selectively released results, choosing to share figures about attacks committed by left-wing extremists but not religious-based crimes or violence against journalists.

This comes at a time when there has been a proliferation of caste-based and religious-based hate crimes. Hindu mobs continue to beat up and kill members of India’s Muslim minority and its lower castes, and human rights activists accuse Mr. Modi and his political allies of stoking an atmosphere of Hindu nationalism that has contributed to the violence. Most often, the attackers go unpunished.

Some Indians saw the omissions in the crime data as more evidence that the Modi government is withholding information it considers incriminating.
