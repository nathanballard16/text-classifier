Bombay HC refuses stay on cutting of trees in Aarey Colony for metro car shed

The cutting of trees has been met with stiff resistance from green activists.

The Bombay High Court on Saturday refused to stay the cutting of over 2,500 trees, underway since Friday evening, in the Aarey Colony by the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation Limited (MMRCL) to make way for a metro car shed. The cutting of trees has been met with stiff resistance from green activists.

Zoru Bhathena, a local resident who has been a petitioner before the High Court challenging the Tree Authority's order directing 2646 trees to be cut, moved the court again.

His plea came up before a division bench of Justices SC Dharmadhikari and AK Menon and it refused to grant a stay.
