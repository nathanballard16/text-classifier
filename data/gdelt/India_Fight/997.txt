Jayantilal Bhanusali, former Gujarat BJP vice president shot dead onboard train

New Delhi :

Former Gujarat BJP vice president and MLA from Abadasa, Jayantilal Bhanushali was shot dead by unidentified assailants onboard a train near Kataria railway station in Kutch district of Gujarat on Monday night, news agency ANI reported. Jayantilal Bhanushali was onboard Sayji Nagri Express between Kataria-Surbari stations when the assailants shot him. Bhanushali was a former BJP MLA from the Abadasa constituency in Kutch district of Gujarat.

Bhanushali made headlines last year for allegedly raping a 21-year-old woman from Surat. Following the accusations of rape, Bhanushali had to resign as the vice president of Gujarat BJP. However, a man, claiming to be the husband of the woman claimed that she was playing the victim card to extort money.

Although it was not immediately known why the influential BJP leader was killed, it is suspected that personal dispute could be the reason.

Reacting to the incident, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani said that an investigation will be issued and action will be taken against the perpetrators. "A thorough investigation will be conducted and strict action will be taken against those guilty," ANI quoted the Gujarat CM as saying.
