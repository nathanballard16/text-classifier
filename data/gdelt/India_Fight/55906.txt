Kamal Haasan’s party moves SC against Citizenship Act

CHENNAI: Kamal Haasan ’s political outfit Makkal Needhi Maiam has moved the Supreme Court against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2019, a top party source told ET on Monday.“We have argued that the Citizenship Act runs counter to the spirit of the constitution as it looks at people through the prism of religion,” said a party leader aware of developments at MNM . The petition was filed on Monday morning in the Supreme Court.The Citizenship Amendment Act was signed into law by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday last week. The votes of AIADMK, BJD and JD(U) became crucial for the Bill to get through Rajya Sabha. The AIADMK, the ruling party in Tamil Nadu and a constituent of the BJP-led NDA, had voted in favour of the Bill, even though it had raised concerns about the exclusion of Sri Lankan Tamils from the legislation.On Sunday afternoon, protesters against the amendment to the citizenship law and police clashed near the Jamia Millia Islamia institute in Delhi, causing alarm among students. According to reports, at least 51 people have been reported injured. The institute, in its statement, reinforced its commitment to peaceful protests.
