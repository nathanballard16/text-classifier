Pune: Seven-year-old raped and murdered inside College of Military Engineering

A seven-year-old girl was raped and murdered inside the campus of the College of Military Engineering (CME) in Pune. After murdering the girl, the accused person also committed suicide after hanging himself inside the campus.

The incident came to light on Tuesday evening. According to the police, the mother of the girl and the accused both worked in the CME mess as civil staff and they were staying inside the campus.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) of Pimpri Chinchwad police Smartna Patil said, "We received the information about the body of a girl being arrived at Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial hospital. When we sent our team to the hospital, the doctor hinted the team that the girl was sexually assaulted and then she was murdered."

According to the police, the mother of the girl had gone for work and her elder sister had gone to the school when the man entered her house and sexually assaulted her before committing murder. Police obtained the mobile number of the man and started tracing his location.

"When we started tracing his location, we found that the person was constantly moving from one place to other. We immediately sent our team to nab him. However, by the time we could catch hold of him, he had committed suicide by hanging himself to a tree inside the campus," Patil said.

According to police, the mother of the girl and the accused knew each other. "Few months back, husband of the woman died after which the accused had proposed the woman to marry him which she turned down. The woman gave a statement that they had a quarrel over the same issue at night before the crime," Patil said.
