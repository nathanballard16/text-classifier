Washington/Moscow, Feb 15

Countries across the globe, including the US, Russia, Australia, France, Saudi Arabia and Bangladesh, have condemned the Pulwama attack. Russian President Vladimir Putin said perpetrators and sponsors of the attack should be brought to book and reiterated his country’s support for further strengthening counter-terror cooperation with India.

In a message to President Ram Nath Kovind and PM Modi, he said, “...We strongly condemn this brutal crime. The perpetrators and sponsors of this attack, undoubtedly, should be duly punished.” The US specifically singled out Pakistan in its statement.

In a stern message, the White House asked Islamabad to “immediately end” its “support” to all terror groups and not to provide “safe haven” to them.
