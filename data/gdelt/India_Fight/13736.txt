Edappadi K Palaniswami seeks Param Vir Chakra for Abhinandan Varthaman

Chennai: Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami on Friday requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to confer the Param Vir Chakra, the country’s highest military honour, on Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman.

In a letter that he wrote to Mr Modi, Mr Palaniswami recalled the incidents from the Pulwama terror attack on a CRPF that led to the counter-terrorism strike on the Jaish-e-Mohammed camp in Pakistan.

He said a Pakistan Air Force fighter was shot down by an MiG-21 Bison of the Indian Air Force when it tried to violate Indian air space. Wg Cdr Abhinandan, who piloted the MiG-21, was taken into custody by the Pakistan armed forces.

Recalling the efforts undertaken by Mr Modi to secure the release of Wg Cdr Abhinandan, Mr Palaniswami said that due to the diplomatic initiatives of the PM and intense international pressure, the IAF officer was released by Pakistan on March 1.

“It is appropriate that Wg Cdr Abhinandan be awarded India’s highest military honour ‘Param Vir Chakra (PVC)’ for displaying most inimitable gallantry and valour,” the Chief Minister wrote.
