Our defence forces don’t just guard our borders and fight the enemy, but also work for the people of the country,” he says, going on to heap praise on his leading lady. “Isabelle’s formal training in acting reflects in her work. On the set, she knows what is required of her and she is always improving. Only a confident actor can do that spontaneously.”Meanwhile, Aayush, Karan informs, trained at an army camp for a few months in Pune as part of his prep and put on 12 kg of muscle weight. Describing the time he spent with the soldiers as an “enlightening experience”, Aayush says, “Our idea is to tell a story that not many people know, and at the same time, also do it with responsibility, without making the action look.”
