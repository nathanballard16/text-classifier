Eleven years of 26/11, tributes on social media

Mumbai: In one of the deadliest terror attacks in the country’s history, 166 people, including security personnel and foreigners, were killed and over 300 injured when 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in Mumbai.

During the ghastly attacks that lasted for four days, Mumbai witnessed a series of coordinated shooting and bombing attacks in several parts. 26/11, as these attacks are often referred to, finally culminated on the morning of 29th November 2008.

Remembering the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday paid tributes to civilians and security personnel who risked their lives to protect people on this day in 2008.

President Ram Nath Kovind also on Tuesday led the nation in remembering the victims of the Mumbai terror attacks on November 26, 2008, when hundreds of people were killed in one of the most horrific terrorist attacks in the country’s history by heavily-armed Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorists.

“On the 11th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks, we remember everyone who lost their lives and mourn with their families. A grateful nation salutes the security personnel who made the supreme sacrifice. We remain firm in our resolve to defeat all forms of terrorism,” President Kovind’s office tweeted.
