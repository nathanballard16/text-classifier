Harpoon Brewery releases new limited beer, ‘Allston X-Mas’ in time for yearly Boston move-in weekend

Bostonians know that Christmas comes twice a year, once on Dec. 25 and once over move-in weekend in September, known as “Allston Christmas,” where the new generation of college students all move into their housing at once.

For those who look forward the packed streets, sidewalks littered with miscellaneous furniture and the inevitable truck getting stuck on Storrow Drive, Harpoon Brewery has a new beer to pair with the full-weekend event.

“Allston X-Mas” is an India pale ale with 7% ALC/VOL and 40 IBUs.

“Utilizing a unique blend of specialty malts and a blend of modern, fruit forward hops, this New England IPA features bright, upfront notes of citrus, mixed berry, and black currant with a clean, rye like spice,” the brewery wrote in a press release.

Some locals see the weekend chance to pick up some free gently-used (or severely-used) items used by post-grads leaving the city.

“We took that spirit to heart as we cleaned out our supply closet and used some ingredients (high quality ingredients!) leftover from other projects,” the brewery wrote.

The limited release is available on draft or in 16-ounce cans. It’s not clear how long it will be available.
