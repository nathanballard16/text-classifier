Superior Diplomacies; Media War and February 26th Balakot Attack – KashmirWatch

Whole day the New Delhi’s South Block was crowded with foreign diplomats to know firsthand account of Indian misadventure inside Pakistan. The Ambassadors from China and United Kingdom were in lead who were unable to get any details other than strange clarification, “it was not India’s military action and the airstrikes on the Pakistani side were part of a non-military action.” Foreign media reported that attack was carried out in Balakot, Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province where local residents were woken by loud explosions. India has its own Satellites while both the Indian and US DIA’s have imagery facility at their disposal. If India and its ally really think that they successfully targeted Balakot why don’t they should the images to the world? There is none!

Interestingly, the statements emitting from Pakistan and India are quite confusing. Pakistan claims that Balakot has not been attacked but media is releasing the pictures. At the same time Pakistan is also talking about dropping of payload and four bombs by Indian Fighter aircrafts. On the other hand India is dubbing action of its serving Indian Air Force pilots, violating neighbouring territory and destroying targets by bombing inside Pakistan as “ non-military pre-emptive action”. In other words there is serious doubt about the genuineness of statements of either side. One wonders if Indian Air Force combat-aircrafts have really taken part in the 26th February action as there is no terminology as “non-military preemptive action” and Indian claims are contradictory.
