CP urges police to focus on security of elderly citizens

Kolkata: Keeping the recent gruesome murder of an elderly couple at Netaji Nagar in mind, Commissioner of Police (CP), Kolkata Anuj Sharma on Friday instructed senior police officials to emphasise on security of the elderly citizens and put more effort on the organisation 'Pronam'. Sources informed that the CP has praised the recent activities of the police personnel regarding 'Pronam' and has instructed them to stress on it further. As elderly citizens are much more vulnerable to criminals, police must protect them from all sorts of crimes. The CP also instructed the divisional DCs to carry out the work regarding 'Pronam' as is being done at present. Meanwhile, Officers in-Charge (OCs) have been conveyed the message that any person, especially elderly citizens, must not hesitate to visit police stations and officials must hear their problems and make efforts to sort them out.
