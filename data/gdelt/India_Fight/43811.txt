A Class 12 student in Tamil Nadu's Thanjavur, attempted to end her life after being forced to convert to Christianity. She did not respond to treatment by doctors and died in Thanjavur Medical College Hospital on January 19. A video has come to light in which the girl confessed that she was constantly scolded and also made to clean all the rooms in the hostel by the warden. The girl alleged that she was also constantly forced to take up Christianity. Disturbed by these incidents, the girl consumed pesticide in an attempt to kill herself.
