Jammu and Kashmir: BJP leader shot dead by militants in Anantnag

Militants on Saturday shot dead a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader in Jammu and Kashmir’s Anantnag district.

Identified as Gul Muhammad Mir, he was the BJP’s district vice president.

Mir who had contested assembly elections on a BJP ticket from Anantnag was killed inside his house.

BJP leaders said that Mir’s security was recently withdrawn by the government.
