Fifteen police personnel and the driver of a private bus they were travelling in were killed in an ambush by Naxalites outside a village at Kurkheda in Maharashtra’s Gadchiroli district this afternoon.

State DGP Subodh Jaiswal said the Naxalites had earlier burnt more than 25 vehicles belonging to a road contractor around 3.30 am. Following this, the Quick Response Team was rushed to the site.

The police team was on its way when an explosive device buried beneath the surface of the road was set off, blowing up the vehicle.

“It was not an intelligence failure... we will give a befitting response,” Jaiswal said.

However, state government sources faulted officials in the state Home Department for letting their guard down soon after the first phase of Lok Sabha elections was completed earlier this month. Elections in Gadchiroli were held on April 11, and polling for all 48 Lok Sabha seats of the state ended on April 29.

“There were enough indications that bands of heavily armed Naxalites were moving in Gadchiroli for the past several weeks,” sources said.

Groups of Naxalites had even fired at helicopter-borne security personnel who were moving officials after polling concluded. Though one policeman was injured in the firing, security was not tightened in the area.

The 15-member State Reserve Police Force team was hurriedly assembled and sent in a private bus. Standard operating procedures like a patrol being sent ahead to sanitise the route were also ignored, sources said.

The Opposition sought the ouster of Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who said an inquiry would be ordered.
