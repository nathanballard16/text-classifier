Irrfan Khan Returns To Mumbai After Wrapping Up 'Angrezi Medium' Shoot In London

After wrapping the shoot of his upcoming film Angrezi Medium, actor Irrfan Khan is back the bay. The actor was in London where he was shooting for Angrezi Medium, the sequel of his 2017 super hit Hindi Medium.

Irrfan was clicked by the paps at the Mumbai Airport but he covered his face and didn't want to get clicked.

The actor was on wheelchair and he looked frail. As soon as the pictures started circulating on the internet, a lot of his worried fans started flooding the posts with comments.

From being concerned about his health status to wishing him a speedy recovery, Khan's fans seemed visibly worried. The actor was in London for treatment for almost a year after he disclosed the news of being diagnosed with high-grade neuroendocrine tumour last year.

Irrfan returned to India this year and this in itself was a big sigh of relief for all his friends and well-wishers.
