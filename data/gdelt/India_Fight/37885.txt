Students from Kashmir in the city did not mince words in expressing their anger at the turn of events, though their immediate concern was the inability to get in touch with their families back home. A boy from Srinagar described the Centre’s decision to take away the special status of Jammu and Kashmir as “totally unpleasant”.

Another from Anantnag expressed fear that the decision might lead to a “mass uprising on a disastrous scale”. A student from Pulwama wondered how the Union government could forget that “Kashmir could never be won by sword, but through the spirit of love alone”. A boy from Jammu said he was “sad” over being separated from his friends in the Valley. Metro met the group on Monday evening and witnessed an interplay of anxiety and anger. “The last time when I talked to my mom, she said ‘anytime there will be a communication blackout in Kashmir. Maybe we won’t be able to talk, but remember beta, there is no need to worry. We have faced many tough and tumultuous phases. This, too, shall pass’. Little did I realise that her apprehension would come so true,” said the boy from Pulwama, who has a passion for shayari. He was frequently checking his cellphone while talking. His family was constantly “out of network area”. “I am just praying for their well-being,” he said.
