AHMEDABAD: Foreign currency worth at least Rs 1 crore was seized from a passenger at the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel International (SVPI) airport in Ahmedabad on Sunday. Well-placed sources at the city airport confirmed that the huge consignment was found in the baggage of a passenger travelling to Dubai, from the departures area of the international terminal of the city airport.

"The passenger was to depart for Dubai via an Emirates flight from Ahmedabad airport on Sunday morning.

Just ahead of approaching the check-in counter, when he got his check-in baggage scanned in the X-ray baggage scanner, something suspicious was found by the person in-charge. Upon personally examining the bag, notes of multiple currencies were found from his bag, rolled in between clothes," said the source.

The male passenger of Indian origin, was immediately handed over to the air intelligence unit (AIU). A source confirmed that he was in the custody of customs department. Different currencies that were found include dollar, pounds and euros among others.

It is a common practice to smuggle foreign currency into India which is used for various purposes, said a source, but since this huge consignment was being sent out, the kingpin of the scam is being identified.

"Such a huge sum of money could be hawala and this is being probed currently. The passenger concerned is in the custody of customs Ahmedabad and further probe is underway," said a source.

Earlier this month, two consignments of a total of 5kg gold were seized by customs Ahmedabad from the SVPI airport.

In one case, 3kg gold was seized from a passenger travelling from Bangkok, Thailand to Ahmedabad; whereas in another case, some 1.8kg gold was seized from another passenger who arrived at the city airport from Abu Dhabi. In both cases, passengers concerned have been arrested.
