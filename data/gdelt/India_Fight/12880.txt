Salman was supposed to begin shooting for yet another action film, which is the remake of Korean film Veteran. However, the actor, reportedly made it clear that he doesn’t want to shoot for cop films back-to-back. He’s opted to kick-start the shooting of SLB’s next post-Dabangg 3 in September this year.

A source close to the development told a leading daily, “Salman wasn’t keen on doing back-to-back cop films. That’s why he gave the nod to Bhansali’s love story that will help him break away from his larger-than-life image and is being readied for a 2020 release. The yet-untitled action thriller will now go on the floors in the first quarter of next year.”
