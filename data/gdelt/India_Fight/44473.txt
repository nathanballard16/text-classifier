Pakistani troops have yet again violated ceasefire in twin border districts of Rajouri and Poonch in Jammu and Kashmir by targeting Indian Forward posts and Civilian areas along the Line of Control.

Defence Spokesperson told AIR Jammu that Pakistani troops initiated unprovoked firing of small arms and shelling with mortars in Balakote sector of Poonch and Nowshera in Rajouri overnight and today as well, drawing befitting retaliation by the Indian Army.

Pakistan first violated the ceasefire in Nowshera sector from 8 pm to 10 pm last night followed by firing of small arms and shelling with mortars in Balakote from 11.45 pm to 2 am. Pakistani troops again resorted to unprovoked and indiscriminate firing by targeting Shahpur and Kerni sectors in District Poonch at 0945 hours today. There was no report of any casualty in the Pakistani firing on the Indian side.

According to official sources, this year, Pakistan violated the ceasefire over 2,050 times, leaving 21 Indians dead and scores of others injured. India has repeatedly called upon Pakistan to ask its forces to adhere to the 2003 ceasefire understanding and maintain peace and tranquillity along the LoC and the International Border
