Cease Fire Violation Leaves 10-Day-Old Boy Dead, Exposes Pakistan's Claim For Peace With India

A 10-day-old baby, who was critically injured in heavy shelling by Pakistani troops along the Line of Control (LoC) on Sunday has lost his life. The baby was admitted to a local hospital after he was hit by shrapnel from mortar shells fired by Pakistan.

Two others including the infant's mother Fatima Jan and another civilian Mohammad Arif, both residents of a village in Shahpur sector who were also injured in the firing are being treated at the Government Medical College Hospital in Jammu.

Pakistan had resorted to unprovoked ceasefire violation using mortars and small arms targeting forward posts and villages in Shahpur, Saujiyan and Mendhar sectors between 5 pm and 10 pm on Sunday.

The Indian Army retaliated to silence the Pakistani guns but the casualties on the Pakistani side was not known immediately, an Army officer said.

This is the second major escalation along the LoC in recent days. On July 22, an Indian soldier was killed in Pakistani firing in Sunderbani sector of Rajouri district.
