Highlights: Manohar Parrikar laid to rest at Miramar Beach

Goa CM Manohar Parrikar funeral highlights: Four-time Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar was laid to rest at Miramar Beach on Monday next to the memorial of the state’s first CM Dayanand Bandodkar. Manohar Parrikar was accorded state funeral with full military honours at Miramar. Meanwhile, BJP and its allies in Goa are yet to come up with a name for the next chief minister of the state.

Union Minister Nitin Gadkari said while the Goa unit of BJP had decided who should be the next chief minister, the issue was only with alliance partners. Speaker Pramod Sawant and BJP leader Vishwajit Rane are the CM post frontrunners. Earlier, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other Central ministers reached Goa to pay their last tributes to former Goa chief minister Manohar Parrikar.

The Congress, meanwhile, reached Governor Mridula Sinha staking claim to the government. All the 14 Congress MLAs, led by Leader of the Opposition Chandrakant Kavlekar, handed over a letter to Sinha, saying it was the single largest party in the Assembly and should be allowed to form the government.
