As it got closer to the resting canine the leopard suddenly pounced and grabbed the dog by the back of the neck.

The startled dog moved to get away and escape but was pinned down.

It tried to put up a bit of a fight but was no match for the much larger predator and was carried away in an instant.

As the leopard ran away two similar-looking brown dogs gave chase, but the leopard was too quick for them.

The other dogs and a cat got up and ran in different directions out of fear.

The CCTV footage shows a few dogs sleeping at a brick kiln in Huliyur Durga village near Kunigal in Karnataka state the night of January 12.

Local residents complained that the leopard has been raiding their homes to carry off pets and even cattle.

They have demanded the forest officials trap the leopard and take it away.
