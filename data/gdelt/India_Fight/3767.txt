New Delhi: Home Minister Rajnath Singh dialled West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee and expressed concerns over the violence that erupted in the state following BJP chief Amit Shah's rally on Tuesday. Citing reports about the violence, the Home Minister urged West Bengal CM that those responsible for the ruckus are brought to books. On Tuesday, vehicles carrying people to Shah's rally in East Midnapore were attacked by miscreants when they were parked outside the venue.

Following the violence, BJP workers also staged a protest condemning the attack on the vehicles parked outside the venue. While some of the vehicles were torched, news agency ANI cited police sources and reported incidents of stone pelting on the vehicles. Speaking at the rally, Shah referred to the ongoing tussle between the two parties and said, "In West Bengal, Congress government brought poverty, Communist government brought violence and Mamata’s government has unleashed the menace of poverty, violence and chaos of the syndicate, all at the same time."

An angry BJP leadership lashed out at Mamata Banerjee's government and accused her of creating 'terror' in the state and called her 'Talibani Didi'. "We have seen as to how very worried Mamata Banerjee has unleashed the terror of TMC on the BJP and the ordinary people of West Bengal," said BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra. BJP and Trinamool Congress (TMC) have been at loggerheads over allegations of violence against each other.
