A 31-year-oldfrom Bihar who killed his wife over a trivial row at the parking area of the apartment where he worked has been arrested by Rama Murthy Nagar police. The accused has been identified as Vinay Kumar (in pic), who used to live with his family in the basement of the same apartment located on Horamavu Main Road.After strangling his wife Geeta Devi, 23, at the accommodation provided to the security guard, Kumar waited for some time and dragged her to the parking area. He bludgeoned her to death at the parking lot and made it look like strangers have murdered her. The incident reportedly happened in the wee hours of Sunday.After positioning her body in the parking lot, Kumar called Geeta’s brother Guddu Bhagat to tell him that she had been killed. Bhagat suspected Kumar’s hand in his sister’s death and informed the police. The accused was arrested on Monday.“The couple would frequently fight as Kumar did not look after his family. During their fights, he would threaten to kill her, which the victim had reported to her brother who stayed at Nagarabhavi. The couple got married six years back and has two children,” said an investigating officer.
