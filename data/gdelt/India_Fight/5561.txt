5 Netflix Shows To Watch If You're A Non-Cheesy Rebel & Don't Want To Celebrate Valentine's Day

It's that time of the year again where the city is decked up in pinks and reds, and while most people enjoy the 'love' displayed all over, some are significantly indifferent or not so savvy towards it. It's a choice really. Even for couples who'd just like to spend Valentine's Day without any cupid-induced festivities and treat the day just like any normal day.

For single people, Valentine's Day can be a little rough or unremarkable. Either you feel bad about the fact that you don't have anyone to spend the day with or you're happy in your skin, feeling content with yourself, all the time.
