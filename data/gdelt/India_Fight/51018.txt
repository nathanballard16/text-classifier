An X-ray performed on the animal showed three bullets from an air gun lodged in the body. "The bullets in the X-ray look like they are from an air gun. We need to stabilise the dog first as she is in a state of complete shock. Till then, we cannot perform any surgery on her. We are carrying out blood tests at the moment," said Dr Sathish, senior veterinarian Doctor from Jeeva Pet Hospital.

Jaynagar MLA Sowmya Reddy who was in a meeting sent her team to inspect the issue. Later, Reddy visited the hospital to check on the dog. "An FIR will be definitely filed and those responsible for the incident will be brought to task. It is very inhuman for people to do something like this. I hope the dog recovers soon." said Reddy.

Some sources have revealed that irritated over the barking noise of the dog during the nights, an ex-army officer shot her. The police, however, have not confirmed the same.
