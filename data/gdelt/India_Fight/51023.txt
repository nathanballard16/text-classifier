India: Man kills himself after finding out his wife abused girls using sex toys

A man in India committed suicide after his wife was caught dressed as a man and sexually abusing young girls using sex toys.

The incident occurred in Andhra Pradesh when a 47-year-old took his own life by jumping off the third floor of his apartment, Indian news outlets reported.

Reportedly, the 32-year-old woman would dress up like a man when carrying out the sex abuse.

Officers found a large bag containing sex toys after a raid on the couple’s property took place on November 9.

When police questioned the couple, the man ran to the terrace and jumped off, suffering serious injuries and later that evening died at the hospital.

The deceased was the woman’s third husband.

The issue came to light after a 17-year-old filed a police complaint and told officers that she had been sexually abused by a man named Krishna Kishore Reddy.

After investigation police discovered that Reddy was a woman who wore men’s clothing and kept her hair short so that she looked like a man.

Reportedly, the woman had left her village in 2016 and moved to the city of Ongole in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh where she ended up marrying for the third time.

Local police stated that the woman would pose as a man and would befriend minor girls.

The accused also planned to move the 17-year-old girl who complained into her house to live with her and her husband.

Apparently, with the help of a 28-year-old male friend, the woman staged a fake marriage between him and the girl.

The girl’s parents got involved which prompted the suspect to approach the police where she requested protection from the teenager’s parents.

However, officers sent the girl back to her parents as she was still a minor and she informed them about the abuse.

The girl reportedly believes that Reddy and the woman are two different individuals.
