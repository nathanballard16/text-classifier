New Delhi: AAP MLA Prakash Jarwal has alleged that three shots were fired at him on Wednesday during an event in south Delhi's Shani Bazaar area, a claim denied by the police. Jarwal claimed that he was shot at on Sunday in south Delhi's Sangam Vihar.

The police said they had not received any written complaint about the incident from the AAP MLA. Jarwal claimed that he was shot at on Wednesday by an illegal alcohol distributor, who had been chasing him for the past three days. He alleged that despite asking the police for security, no action was taken in this regard.

"My life is in danger. I was previously attacked on Sunday and informed police about it but nothing was done," he said.

Jarwal said he would formally lodge a complaint with the police. Deputy Commissioner of Police (South), Vijay Kumar said they have not received any written complaint. The CCTV footage collected from the spot does not show any incident of firing, the officer said, adding further investigation is underway.
