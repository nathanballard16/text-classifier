Firing in the border area of Hindumal-Kot in Sriganganagar district caused panic on Saturday.

Two farmers working on fields close to the border fencing heard what sounded like a gunshot and immediately dropped to the ground to duck any firing.

Police later confirmed the gunshots, but said it didn’t come from across the border. Sriganganagar Superintendent of Police Hemant Sharma said he suspected that poachers were behind the incident, adding that no cross-border firing had been reported in the area in the past.

The incident comes at a time when tensions between India and Pakistan have escalated over a militant attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama that killed 40 troopers of the Central Reserve Police Force.
