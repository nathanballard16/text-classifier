AHMEDABAD: In the run-up to the 2017 Gujarat assembly elections, the trio of Hardik Patel Jignesh Mevani and Alpesh Thakor formed a formidable force for Congress. Representing different castes, the ‘young turks’ helped Congress reap electoral gains in the state.Eighteen months later, their plunge into poll politics seems to have taken a hit.Alpesh, who became MLA from Radhanpur on a Congress ticket, has quit from the party, Hardik’s electoral debut has been aborted following his conviction in a rioting case and Vadgam MLA Jignesh has been busy with his national ambition.Hardik shot to fame after he led thequota stir. The death of 14 Patidars in police firing catapulted Hardik to limelight and he positioned himself as the voice of the Patels who were seeking reservation in Gujarat. Patidars account for 12% of the state’s population. A month ago, he formally joined Congress and has been campaigning for the party across Gujarat.Around the same time, Alpesh gained popularity among the OBCs, whom he organised under his Thakor Sena and launched a hugely successful campaign against liquor consumption in dry Gujarat. He joined Congress and won assembly election from Radhanpur by more than 14,000 votes in 2017. For now, Alpesh claims that he will work for the OBC community.Jignesh hit the poll arena when he led protests after the July 2016 Una Dalit flogging. Four Dalits were flogged and paraded in Una on suspicion of killing a cow while an investigation revealed they were skinning a dead cow. Mevani was offered Vadgam seat by Congress, which he won as an independent in 2017. However, since last year or so Jignesh has made a conscious effort to become a national-level Dalit leader. For the last fortnight, he has been camping in Begusarai , where Kanhaiya Kumar is contesting.
