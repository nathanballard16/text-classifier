Rape victim shot dead by accused in Gurugram

She had refused to withdraw complaint, alleges eyewitness

A 23-year-old woman working at a Hauz Khas bar was shot dead in Gurugram on Friday allegedly by the man she had accused of rape.

A teenage friend of the victim who was a witness to the murder said the accused, Sandeep, shot the woman after she refused to withdraw the rape case against him.

According to the FIR, Sandeep called the woman in the early hours of Friday and asked her to meet him. The woman, along with the friend, reached her room in DLF Phase-III where Sandeep arrived with his friend and the four went out for food around 2 a.m.

When they returned around 5:30 a.m., Sandeep asked the woman’s mother and sister, who were visiting her, to persuade her to withdraw the rape case against him. The victim refused following which the four left the room and drove towards Faridabad. When they reached Khushboo Chowk around 6.30 a.m., Sandeep stopped the car and pulled the woman out. He threatened to shoot her if she did not withdraw the case.

When she refused again, Sandeep whipped out a revolver and allegedly opened fire at her. The woman's friend fled the spot and informed the victim’s mother about the incident. The mother reported the matter to the police. Gurugram Police spokesperson Subhash Boken said the woman was shot about five times. No arrests have been made so far.

The victim belonged to Karnal while her friend is from Bhiwani.

The police said the woman had come in contact with Sandeep, a bouncer, when she came to Gurugram four years ago. The two fell for each other and moved in together. After two years of live-in relationship, the woman learnt that Sandeep was married and lodged a rape case against him in November 2017. Sandeep was arrested and let off on bail in June last year. A month later, the two started living together again, the police said.
