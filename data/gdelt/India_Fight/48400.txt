A man hacked to death in broad daylight on Sunday at Nagarjuna Hills, Panjagutta in Hyderabad by a group of five persons. The victim was identified as Mir Riyasath Ali Razvi. Razvi was attacked with sickles when he went to have tea at a stall near his house. Police have claimed that the murder was a ‘revenge killing’.

Razvi was an accused in the murder of one Mohammed Anwar and had been jailed earlier in June for the crime. Razvi was imprisoned at Chanchalguda police station and was released on October 10.

Anwar’s son and his relatives were waiting for an opportunity to kill Razvi and seek vengeance, the police said. The killers learnt about Razvi’s schedule, and they were waiting in an Omni van when the victim came to the tea stall. As soon as they spotted Razvi, they intercepted him, hacked him to death and fled from the spot in the van.

Police have promptly arrested three accused involved in the murder while two others are still at large.

“On Sunday morning around 9 am Anwar’s son Mohammed Azhar (19), his brother Abdul Rahman (40) and their relative Abdul Aleem attacked Razvi with sickles near a tea stall in the area. Soon he was rushed to Gandhi hospital, where doctors declared him dead,” Hyderabad Commissioner Anjani Kumar said.

Two other accused — Syed Amjad (22) and Mohammed Hasan (20) — are still at large.

“It is a clear case of revenge murder and the entire police department in the city swung into action and nabbed the accused in a record time,” Anjani Kumar was quoted as saying by The Hindu.

The Times of India reported that the arrested accused had surrendered themselves at the Panjagutta police station.
