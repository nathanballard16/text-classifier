Amnesty demands independent probe in Hyderabad custodial deaths

NEW DELHI: Amnesty International India on Friday sought an independent investigation into the alleged extrajudicial killings of four under—trial prisoners by the Hyderabad police. The four had been arrested a day earlier and were accused of raping and murdering a 25-year-old veterinarian.“Extrajudicial killings are not a solution to preventing rape,” Avinash Kumar, AII executive director said. “The reported delay in filing the First Information Report by the Telangana Police in this case coupled with the shoddy investigation and the general low conviction rate for those accused of rape raises deeply disturbing questions about the state of justice in India," said Kumar in a press statement.The incident occurred when the state police had taken the under-trials to the site where rape had been committed as part of the investigation. The state police have alleged that the under-trials snatched the police firearms, attacked the police officials and tried to flee, which led to the police firing at the under-trials and subsequently killing them.Under international law , extrajudicial, arbitrary or summary executions and enforced disappearances are strictly forbidden. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which India is a party prohibits arbitrary deprivation of life and guarantees the right to a fair trial. Moreover, the UN Principles on the Effective Prevention and Investigation of Extra-legal, Arbitrary and Summary Executions require that “[t]here shall be thorough, prompt and impartial investigation of all suspected cases of extra-legal, arbitrary and summary executions, including cases where…reliable reports suggest unnatural death in the above circumstances.”“In a modern and rights-respecting society, using extrajudicial executions to offer justice to victims of rape is not only unconstitutional but circumvents the Indian legal system and sets a grossly wrong precedent. An independent investigation is essential,” said Avinash Kumar.
