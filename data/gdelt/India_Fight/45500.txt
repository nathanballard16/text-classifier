Solapur: A motorcycle rider died on Monday after an over-speeding car ran over him in Maharashtra's Solapur district. The car belonged to Shiv Sena leader and state cabinet Minister Tanaji Sawant, and he was in the car when the accident happened. After seeing an angry mob gathering around his car, the minister, along with his driver, fled from the scene.

According to reports, Shyam Kumar Devidas had gone out to buy vegetables in the morning and was coming back home on his motorcycle. While he was at an intersection on a state highway near Shelgaon Hole village on the outskirts of Barshi town, Sawant's over-speeding car rammed into his motorcycle. Shyam was immediately rushed to a nearby hospital where he succumbed to his injuries.

Immediately after the accident, the minister took another car and left from the accident site. According to an eye witness, Sawant's driver took the number plates of the car and fled from the scene. After the accident, some angry locals gathered around Tanaji Sawant's car and vandalised it. Police have now deployed heavy security in the area to avoid any violence.

Tanaji Sawant is a senior Shiv Sena leader who serves as the Minister of Water Conservation in Maharashtra's state government. He is also the deputy leader of Shiv Sena from Solapur district.

Yesterday, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA came under-fire after a video surfaced on social media where he could be seen dancing with a bar girl in Mumbai. In his response, he alleged that the opposition has released a doctored video of him in order to malign his image.
