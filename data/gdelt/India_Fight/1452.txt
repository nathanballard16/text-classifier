A curious thing about Otani is that he can speak English, there is footage of him giving quite eloquent speeches (albeit prepared ones) in English. Ichiro can speak English well too but used the interpreters for interviews. Why you ask yourself? because they (Otani, Suzuki et al) can. It's convenient and provides a safe buffer between them and the reporters, they can't get hit with a barrage of questions and get flustered. There is a bottleneck in the interview process. It must be quite nice for them to have that barrier between them and a rabid press looking for a juicy soundbite. They also know they are less likely to make a goof in their native language, than trying to come up with something in English.

As someone who has interviewed sportsmen in the past and ones who are not native English speakers, you can see the fear in the eyes as you ask them questions and they nervously answer, hoping not to make a blunder. Big intimidating men normally, out of their element in the mixed zone with the press, who are usually extraordinarily proficient at language.

All that said Stephen A was out of pocket here. I usually like him, but he does have strong racial agendas, especially for black people. This " hot take" was more xenophobic than racist, not that it makes it any better. On the same episode of First take, he also dismissed a Nigerian Basketball player mocking his hard to pronounce name, he really was having a bad day.
