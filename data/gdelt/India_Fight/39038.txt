Yeh Hai Mohabbatein actor Ribbhu Mehra and TikTok girl Parree Pande in AltBalaji’s X.X.X.–2?

MUMBAI: Having worked as a director, producer, writer, and a food blogger, Sakett Saawhney has come a long way in his career. He has contributed to some very popular television and film projects.

Now, the talented man has started working on a brand new project for AltBalaji.

Sakett took to Instagram to announce his next, that is, the second season of X.X.X.–2, an erotic comedy–drama on the OTT platform. The first season was directed by Ken Ghosh, and the actors on board in lead roles were Kyra Dutt, Aparnaa Bajpai, Rithvik Dhanjani, Shantanu Maheshwari, Ankit Gera, Pryanca Talukdar, and Aparna Sharma.

And we have reason to believe that Yeh Hai Mohabbatein actor Ribbhu Mehra and TikTok star Parree Pande have been roped in for the project, as Sakett has tagged them in a post that announces its commencement.

We tried reaching out to Sakett, but he asked us to call back later. We could not reach out to Ribbhu and Parree for a comment.

Ribbhu played the role of Nikhil in Yeh Hai Mohabbatein and Arjun Rathod in My Name Ijj Lakhan. He is currently seen as Ritik, Disha's good friend, in Balaji Telefilms' Kumkum Bhagya.

Are your excited to watch X.X.X.–2?
