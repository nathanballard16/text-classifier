Mumbai: Marriage is a delicate event in one's life. Utmost care needs to be taken while fixing marriages. An unhappy marriage can lead to serious crimes. In a shocking incident, a woman killed her husband as she did not ‘like’ him.

The accused poisoned the victim and strangled him once he fell unconscious. The incident took place at Kolsewadi, Kalyan. The deceased has been identified as Jagdish Salunkhe, while the accused has been identified as Vrushali Salunkhe. The incident took place on March 6.

According to information, Vrushali had lodged a complaint with Kolsewadi police station claiming that her husband was murdered. She claimed that thieves broke in their house on March 6 and murdered Jagdish. However, autopsy revealed Jagdish was poisoned and strangled to death.

Jagdish and Vrushali got married in December. Vrushali was said to be unhappy with the marriage as it was against her wish. Since she could not gel with her husband and his family, she would pick up fights with Jagdish frequently. Finally, she hatched the plan to kill Jagdish and executed it.
