Patna: Nearly 600 prisoners, convicted of offences other than murder, rape and corruption, will be released from 150 jails across the country on Wednesday, the 150th birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi. All these prisoners will be released under a special remission scheme.

However, around 80 convicts selected from jails in Maharashtra and Haryana, will have to wait for their release. With the announcement of Assembly elections in the state and the model code of conduct coming into force, their release date has been shifted till the elections get over.

Of the five prisoners named, the Tihar jail administration will release only three.

"Two prisoners have to clear payment of fines of Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000 respectively imposed on them," Tihar Jail Director General Sandeep Goyal told IANS.
