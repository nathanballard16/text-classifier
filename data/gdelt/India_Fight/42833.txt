Watch the video discussion with auto industry stalwarts on the crisis:

Most two-wheeler manufacturers hope retail sales will pick up with the upcoming festive season, and there will be some respite from the auto industry crisis, with auto sales on the decline for 10 months in a row. The auto industry contributes 50 per cent towards manufacturing GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and an unprecedented slowdown in the industry will have serious ramifications, if a correction is not seen in the coming months. In August 2019, passenger vehicle sales dropped 31.57 per cent, with sales of passenger cars alone crashing by 41 per cent, the worst decline since 1997-98.
