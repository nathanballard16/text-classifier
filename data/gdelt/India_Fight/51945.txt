11 held for attack on owners of textile units

Surat: At least 100 labourers of powerloom units were booked for rioting and unlawful assembly at Amroli police station after they attacked Anjani Industrial Society president and his friend here on Tuesday. Vijay Mangukiya, president of Anjani Industrial Society, along with Nikit was attacked when the duo asked labourers not to force others to join the strike that began a month ago for higher wages.

Police rounded up around 50 suspects of whom 11 were later arrested. Their leaders reached the police station to demand release of the detained labourers, police sources said.

Mangukiya had confronted a group of labourers at around 5pm. The labourers pushed Manjukiya and his friend and then thrashed them.

“I didn’t suffer major injury, but the unit owners are terrified. We were trying to get police support. Police bandobust can ensure law and order in the area. However, police are not taking any preventive action,” Mangukiya alleged.

“Police had reached the spot immediately and dispersed the crowd. We have arrested 11 people and made bandobast to ensure that peace is not disturbed in the area,” said S M Patel, assistant commissioner of police, G division.
