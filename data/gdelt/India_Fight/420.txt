The 2019 Bajaj Avenger 220 ABS is expected to launch this month, well ahead of the April 2019 deadline set by the Indian Government, along with the Avenger 180 ABS.

Similar to the Bajaj Pulsar 220 ABS, the Pulsar 180 ABS and the Pulsar 150 Twin Disc ABS, the Avenger 220 comes equipped with a single-channel unit. Bajaj has also opted for a single-channel ABS to keep prices competitive. The MY2019 cruiser will additionally benefit from rear-wheel lift protection (RLP) sensor to stop the wheel from lifting in case of heavy braking.

The 2019 Bajaj Avenger 220 continues with the features and design of the standard model. A completely new model, as confirmed by Bajaj Auto’s Managing Director, Rajiv Bajaj, will arrive in 2020 as the third generation Bajaj Avenger.

A 220cc, oil-cooled, single-cylinder DTSi engine churns out 19 PS of maximum power and 17.5 Nm of peak torque on the Avenger. The motor is paired with a 5-speed transmission.
