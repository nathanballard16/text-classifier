World War II veteran's 50-state tour makes stop in Kansas City

KANSAS CITY, Mo. — One of America's oldest World War II veterans made a stop Thursday in Kansas City, Missouri.

Sidney Walton, who turned 100 years old in February, joined the U.S. Army in March 1941, nine months before Pearl Harbor. He served in India as part of the China, Burma, India (CBI) combat theater.

Walton, who is from San Diego, made his first visit to Kansas City on Thursday as part of an ongoing mission to travel to all 50 states in hopes of raising awareness about the shrinking number of living WWII veterans.

He has dubbed his journey the "No Regrets Tour." It began in March 2018.

At each visit, Walton has met with mayors and state governors, a list that now includes KC Mayor Sly James. Missouri is the 21st state he's visited.

"My father represents all World War II veterans — females, males, doesn't matter what religion, what orientation, what color, it doesn't matter," Walton's son, Paul Walton, said. "He's just putting a face on World War II veterans and letting people know how few there are left."

Paul travels with his father, who he said always regretted missing an opportunity to meet some of the last surviving Civil War veterans.

Walton's next stop will be St. Louis. You can follow his journey online.
