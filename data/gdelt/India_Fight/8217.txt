Indian yoga guru plans 100-store apparel chain

Indian yoga guru Baba Ramdev is making moves into fashion through his firm Patanjali.

The brand plans to launch 100 exclusive clothing stores with e-commerce support across India by next year. It is also seeking to open small venues in metropolitan areas.

Twenty stores are expected to be operational by the end of this year in cities such as Jaipur, Agra, Patna and Nasik.

A recent ad campaign for the Baba Ramdev brand sought to “create a movement towards embracing and embodying Indian fashion,” according to a report in Business Today.

The firm’s flagship in New Delhi sells around 3000 items under three distinct sub-brands, which will be made available on Amazon, Flipkart and Paytm under the new expansion drive.
