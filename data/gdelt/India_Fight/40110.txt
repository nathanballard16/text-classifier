Opposition parties turn heat on ruling BJP on ‘deteriorating’ law and order

Meerut: Opposition parties in Uttar Pradesh on Monday turned the heat on ruling BJP over what they said “rule of goons” in the state against the backdrop of murder of two youths in Saharanpur and killing of six persons in Allahabad.Reacting to the murder of a journalist and his brother in Saharanpur, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said, “Now what will you call this system, where every day people are being gunned down. People responsible for stopping crimes are involved in cover-ups and as a result, Uttar Pradesh is full of crime!”While, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav dubbed UP as “Hatya (murder) Pradesh” in his scathing dig through a tweet.“Due to deteriorating law and order, Uttar Pradesh has become #HatyaPradesh. Is this the identity of UP that BJP wants to create? When people do not have the confidence of life, then what kind of development, and whom to trust?”Former UP chief minister Mayawati said, “Under the current BJP government in UP, there is no rule of law. Rather, there is ‘Jungleraj’ of goons, miscreants, mafias etc. Because of this, all kinds of crimes are at peak and there seems to be a flood of murders.”After coming to power, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had promised to curb crime in the state. On several occasions, he has hailed the strengthened law and order in the state as one the biggest achievements of his governments.Saharanpur-based scribe Ashish Dhiman (24) and his brother Ashutosh Dhiman (20) were killed on Sunday morning inside their house allegedly by their neighbours Mahipal Saini and his son Suraj Saini.
