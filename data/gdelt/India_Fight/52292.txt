NEW DELHI, Nov 22 (KUNA) -- Indian authorities said on Friday that three police personnel were killed in an attack carried out by Maoists in Latehar district of eastern Indian state of Jharkhand.

The Press Trust of India said quoting officials that the Maoists launched the attack at around 8:30 PM (Local Time) when a police party was on-board an official vehicle in the Chandwa police station area resulting in the killing three police officers and injuring another one.

The Maoist rebellion is considered a major internal domestic threat to the country as majority of the states are affected by them and their presence in the states of Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar and Maharashtra is very strong.

The banned group is waging an armed struggle for decades against the government and its developmental projects in order to establish a communist society toppling the current system, which they call as semi-feudal and semi-colonial. (end) atk.mb
