LeT pays tribute to slain Baramulla militants

Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) chief Mehmood Shah has paid tribute to outfit’s commander Sohaib Farooq Rumi, Mohsin Mushtaq, and Nasir Ahmed who were killed in Baramulla.

A spokesperson of LeT Dr Abdullah Ghaznavi in a statement quoted Shah as saying that “the youth being the nation’s prestigious asset and pride change the course of destiny for any nation”.

“Kashmir today is under the clutches of Indian slavery and occupation and hence the youth are sacrificing the worldly glamour and rendering immense sacrifices for their freedom. This is all for nothing but an ideology and a struggle. And this ideology is none other than the Ideology of Kalima Tayyibah,” Mehmood Shah said.

He added: “Today’s youth have understood that they can never ensure a safe future for Kashmir by enduring the occupation. India is living in a fool’s paradise if it thinks that Baramulla will raise no son after the martyrdom of Sohaib. There are hundreds of other youth ready to pick up the fallen gun of Sohaib.”

Lashkar chief also thanked people of Baramulla for their “utmost support to freedom struggle” and said “the land of Baramulla has raised hundreds of brave sons in the freedom struggle”.

“The heir of Mu’aviz and Muaz, the young Mudassir was also the son of Baramulla. The youth of Baramulla are still confronting the Indian forces with courage and persistence,” LeT chief said.
