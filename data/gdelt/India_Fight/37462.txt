Srinagar: Jammu and Kashmir Governor Satya Pal Malik on Saturday said it was the Centre’s responsibility to ensure the safety of all Amarnath Yatra pilgrims and other tourists in the Valley in wake of the escalated tensions between Pakistan and India along the Line of Control and the intelligence inputs of a terror attack around August 15.

“It is our responsibility to ensure the safety of pilgrims and tourists. Many terrorists are waiting to cross the Line of Control into India and several of them are suicide bombers. We wanted to avoid all possible repercussions across the country in case of an escalation,” Malik said.

He also said that he had told Peoples Democratic Party chief Mehbooba Mufti in front of the delegation that called on Malik late last night, that she was creating a sense of panic among people in the Valley by saying the Centre was attempting to scrap Article 35A and Article 370, which give special status to Jammu and Kashmir.

“As per my knowledge, there is no such inclination of something of that sort happening here. What might happen tomorrow is not in my control. But as of today, there is nothing to worry... The delegation left satisfied last night,” he said.

Over 40,000 additional security personnel have been deployed in the Valley over the past one week amid rumours that the Centre would scrap the special status that the state has been enjoying for over six decades.

“The situation is normal. People are engaging in rumour mongering. Such activities are a very routine thing here. People are triggering unnecessary panic due to their vested interests,” Malik said.
