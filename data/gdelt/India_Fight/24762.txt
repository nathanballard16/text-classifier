IAF jets intercept Georgian cargo plane after it deviates from flight path, force it to land at Jaipur

NEW DELHI: India scrambled fighters to force an Antonov AN-12 commercial cargo aircraft of Georgia to land at the Jaipur airport after it diverted from its scheduled flight path from Pakistan and entered Indian airspace in north Gujarat on Friday afternoon.“The AN-12 aircraft, which had got airborne from Tbilisi in Georgia for Delhi via Karachi, was forced to land at Jaipur at 4.30 pm. Intelligence Bureau, CISF and local police officials are questioning the two pilots and six others on board the aircraft as well as inspecting the cargo to ascertain more details,” said an official.Flying cargo for an aircraft engine-manufacturing company called Motor Sich based in Ukraine, the AN-12 entered Indian airspace north of Nalia at about 3.15 pm from a route closed for air traffic by Pakistan ever since the Balakot air strikes on February 26.“Though the aircraft had its IFF (Identification, Friend or Foe) transponder switched ‘on’ as per procedure, it did not follow the authorized Air Traffic Services (ATS) route and entered Indian airspace from an unscheduled point. It was also not responding to radio calls from Indian controlling agencies,” said an IAF official.The IAF then swiftly scrambled two fully-armed Sukhoi-30MKI fighters from Jodhpur to intercept the plane, even as the entire air defence network with missiles and guns was activated in north India, including in New Delhi. “On visual contact, the aircraft was identified as a Georgian AN-12, flying at 27,000-feet,” he said.The AN-12 did not initially respond on the international distress frequency, nor to visual signals during the interception by the Sukhois. But when it was challenged with “an offensive posture” by the fighters, the AN-12 informed it was “a non-scheduled aircraft” that had got airborne from Tbilisi for Delhi via Karachi.“The aircraft was shadowed and forced to land at Jaipur for necessary investigation,” said the official."Nothing suspicious was found in the investigation. The plane has been released," Jaipur Additional Police Commissioner Laxman Gaur told PTI.
