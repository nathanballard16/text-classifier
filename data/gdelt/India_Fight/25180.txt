Narendra Modi Slams Sam Pitroda Over ‘Hua Toh Hua’ Remark on 1984 Riots

Guwahati: Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched a fresh attack on the Congress over its leader Sam Pitroda’s “hua toh hua” (it happened, so what?) remark on the 1984 riots.

Addressing a rally at Ratlam in Madhya Pradesh, Narendra Modi said that the remark on 1984 anti-Sikh riot reflects the arrogance of the opposition party saying that ‘hua toh hua’ are not just three words but reflect the arrogance of the Congress party. He said that while they were saying ‘hua toh hua’, people of the country were saying ‘enough is enough.’

PM Modi while addressing the huge gathering at Ratlam said that these mahamilawati people are saying ‘hua toh hua’ but the country is now saying mahamilawati logon ab bohot hua (mahamilawati people enough is enough). He further said that poor people who never got pucca houses, electricity, LPG, toilets during the Congress-led government due to its ‘hua toh hua’ approach are now saying that enough is enough.

Modi also targeted the Kamal Nath government in MP over its alleged failure to implement its loan waiver promise in the state and said that Modi likened people to God but the Congress cheated God.

Modi further stated that the Congress had a problem saying ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’ but they were happy abusing him. Taking a jibe at Congress, Modi said that veteran Congress leader Digvijay Singh who is contesting the Lok Sabha polls from Bhopal Lok Sabha seat has not cast his vote.

The Lok Sabha poll in Madhya Pradesh is slated to be held in the seventh and last phase of the general election on May 19.
