Kishan Reddy Homeless In Capital

Kishan Reddy who had been inducted into the Central Cabinet over four months ago has been left homeless at the country’s Capital. It is learned that he has been operating from Andhra Bhavan.

According to sources, Reddy was accorded two bungalows in Delhi. He is unable to move into the place as the former union ministers have not moved out of the premises. According to the rule, Ministers are supposed to move out of their official residences a month after the dissolution of their post

Kishan Reddy was allocated a bungalow at Tughlaq crescent road in Delhi where the former union minister Jayath Sinha is residing. Jayanth Sinha has put in a request for another residence to the authorities concerned, and they had allotted him the house opposite to the BJP office where the party senior leader Radha Mohan Singh is staying. Jayanth has no option left but to stay at Tuglaq road till the house allotted to him is vacated.

Meanwhile, the centre has taken its step to ensure that these occupants shift out of the said houses immediately. it is learned that the government has given them the time of just one week to shift out. They also said that basic facilities like water and electricity will be shut at the last days of the week that is kept to complete the process.
