Sarbjit Kaur

Prosecutors allege Gurpreet Singh murdered his second wife Sarbjit Kaur, with the help of an unknown accomplice, at their Rookery Lane home on February 16 last year.

The 44-year-old, who denies all charges, is also accused of soliciting the murder of his first wife Amandeep Kaur by offering an employee £20,000 to stab her in the neck in 2013.

Jurors retired to consider their verdicts shortly after 12.30pm at Birmingham Crown Court on Wednesday.

During the trial, father-of-two Singh allegedly strangled 38-year-old Sarbjit between 8.15am and 9am after dropping his children at school and before leaving for work.

The defendant, of Coalway Avenue, Penn, is thought to have thrown chilli powder in his victim’s face to incapacitate her before killing her.

He is alleged to have let in an accomplice, thought to be a woman, that morning to help him carry out the murder and to mess up the house afterwards.

The trial also heard Amandeep died of a brain haemorrhage during a holiday in India with Singh a year after his alleged hitman failed to kill her.
