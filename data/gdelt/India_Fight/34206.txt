The incident has happened a few days after a local TMC leader was shot on the railway tracks at Bandel station in Hooghly district, West Bengal.

The ruling TMC blamed BJP-backed miscreants for the incident. TMC called for a 12-hour shutdown in Chinsurah to protest against the incident.

TMC leader Dilip Ram, 40, was rushed to a nearby hospital from where he was referred to a hospital in Kolkata, which was about 45 kilometres away.

He died on the way, said Akhilesh Chaturvedi, Commission of Chandernagore Police.

A few days before this incident, at least three people died after a bomb was hurled at a TMC worker's house in Murshidabad.

The two deceased TMC workers were identified as 19-year-old Sohel Rana and 55-year-old Khairuddin Sheikh.
