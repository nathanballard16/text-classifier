"I am urging all our Kashmiri brothers to kill any Hindu who settles there. Don't let such a Hindu live even for a second. Don't spare them and kill instantly. They simply want to grab your land. Your condition is worse than Palestinians," he was heard as saying on the broadcast.

Why am I not surprised. It is this mentality that has reduced non Muslims in Pakistan to less than 1%. However what surprises me is that Indian News Channels allowed him space to spew poison&hate on their channels and paid him for it! pic.twitter.com/Gip74aw22z — Priyanka Chaturvedi (@priyankac19) August 12, 2019

Tensions between India and Pakistan have reached a crescendo after the Narendra Modi government in India abrogated the Article 370 of the Constitutuon that gave special privileges and status to Kashmir. Pakistan responded by downgrading diplomatic relations with India and called off bilateral trade with its neighbour.

This is not the first time that Pirzada has stirred hornet's and he's known for making derogatory statements against India and it's armed forces.
