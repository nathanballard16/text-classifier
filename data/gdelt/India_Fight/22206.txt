Ludhiana burgerwala who was caught in legal battle with Burger King too in foray

LUDHIANA: On Wednesday, three candidates filed their nominations for Lok Sabha elections in Ludhiana. Of the these, street vendor Ravinderpal Singh’s candidature was the highlight of the day.Ravinderpal is a burger seller from the city who had hogged headlines after being dragged into legal battle by global brand Burger King. The MNC had filed a case against him in Delhi high court for using Mr Singh Burger King name on his foodcart. He claims that a compromise was struck between him and the American burger chain and thereafter he changed the name of his cart to Mr Singh Food King. He had also started the practice of giving free burger to kids for reciting Japuji Sahib path.Speaking to TOI, Ravinderpal claimed that he was hopeful of a vistory as people of Ludhiana were with him. “It’s the people of the city who for past two years have been encouraging me to fight the elections,” he added.He said, “There are several reasons I am contesting. Our rivers, air anf even land is getting polluted and no one is even paying any attention. Education mafia are getting a free hand. Look at the condition of our government schools and government hospitals. If elected I will change the entire system one by one and try to end corruption in government departments at the earliest.”He also faces an FIR for abetment of suicide. The vendor, however, dismissed it. “This is a well planned conspiracy against me by a leader of Shiromani Akali Dal and I will reveal the name only at the right time. All I can say is I have not been held guilty by court and I know I will be acquitted soon.”
