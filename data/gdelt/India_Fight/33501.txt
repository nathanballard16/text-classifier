But instead of taking them to a shelter home, Shaikh allegedly sold them back to the brothel owner.Anson Thomas, a social activist who was following the case brought the scam to light following which the Social Service Branch of theraided the brothel again and found the three girls there. The minors were then sent to Navjivan Mahila Vasatigruha in Chembur in April 2004.The girls allegedly also told the Child Welfare Committee about the incident and described how they were sold back to the brothel keeper.Thomas later also approached the Mazgaon court. After hearing the case, the court, in 2016, had ordered a police investigation into the matter."Based on the statement given by one of the rescued girls and our investigation, we arrested Shaikh from Aurangabad on Sunday morning. Pandey was picked up from Mumbai," said a police officer."The case dragged on for so long because Shaikh was a senior police inspector. He was arrested only after the court intervened," pointed out another police officer.
