830 grams gold worth Rs 25 lakh seized at Nagpur airport

Customs officials Tuesday nabbed three persons and seized gold worth Rs 25 lakh from two of them at the Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar International Airport here, an official said.

The duo had landed at Nagpur from Sharjah by Air Arabia and were planning to go to Mumbai further using a domestic flight, he said.

One of the persons, hailing from Thane near Mumbai, had hidden the gold inside his body and revealed the name of the receiver after getting caught, the official said.

"The receiver waiting outside the airport was nabbed who gave us further information that a third person was also inside the airport premises carrying gold illegally," he said.

He too was held just as he was about to take a flight to Mumbai, the official said, adding that a total of 830 grams of gold was seized from both of them.

The Nagpur International Airport receives a flight each from Sharjah and Qatar daily.
