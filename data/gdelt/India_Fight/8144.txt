Pulwama attack: India won’t share blast info with Pak

NEW DELHI: India is unlikely to provide evidence to Islamabad regarding the role of top Jaish-e-Mohammad leadership, ensconced in Pakistan, in the February 14 Pulwama terror attack and would rather present this proof to friendly nations across the world to unmask the complicity of Pak-based elements in perpetrating terror, a senior government functionary said on Wednesday.The statement seemingly reflects the thought process in the government, which is not in favour of going through the rigmarole of presenting dossiers to Pakistan on terror attacks that only end up gathering dust there even as the perpetrators roam free, be it with respect to 26/11 Mumbai attacks or Pathankot airbase strike.“There is no question of giving any evidence to Pakistan. Rather we will share it with friendly countries to expose the role of Pak-based elements in Pulwama and other terror attacks on Indian soil,” stated the functionary.Pakistan PM Imran Khan had on Tuesday said he would act against the perpetrators of the Pulwama attack — in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed — if India shares “actionable intelligence”. Finance minister Arun Jaitley mocked at Khan’s offer saying JeM had already publicly acknowledged its hand in the attack.
