Nepalese timber mafia cut down trees in DTR, fire at forest team, flee

BAREILLY: Nepalese timber mafia Monu Khati and his accomplices cut down several trees in Sathiana range of Dudhwa Tiger reserve on Sunday, but they couldn’t smuggle the timber logs to Nepal as DTR officials along with special tiger protection force (SPTF) and SSB jawans raided the place.When smugglers saw forest officials approaching, they opened fire at them and escaped into Nepal, said officials.DTR authorities are now establishing contact with Nepalese government officials, seeking their help.DTR field director Sanjay Pathak said, “We have identified the timber mafia, Monu Khati, who was accompanied by 20-odd gang members and had cut down several trees in the reserve. After he escaped, we contacted the CDO of Nepal’s Kanchanpur district and requested him to look into the matter. We are expecting a reply from him soon.”According to Pathak, the accused chopped trees inside Sathiana range, which falls under DTR buffer area. “The timber mafia had chopped few sheesham trees perhaps on Saturday night, and were cutting down the timber into logs to smuggle to Nepal.”“The armed accused opened fire at us forcing us to retaliate. Fortunately, no one was injured from our side, but their gang members might have sustained bullet injury as several rounds were exchanged. We are in the process of identifying the exact number of trees chopped by the accused and its market value. We are suspecting the role of some officials as well, because such act cannot be carried out without the support of someone from inside,” added Pathak.Recently, two Nepalese poachers were arrested in Nepal with skins of two leopards, which were poached in Shuklaphanta National Park in Nepal, adjacent to DTR. After the incident, DTR officials were put on high alert and patrolling was intensified to check the movement of poachers.
