Hyderabad: Dalit lawmaker from YSR Congress Party M. Sunil Kumar allegedly slit his wrist over reports of being denied party ticket to contest from Puthalapattu assembly segment in Andhra Pradesh. The lawmaker who is a doctor by profession shot a video and uploaded it on social media sites. In the video, the 50-year old MLA can be seen in tears and urging YSRCP chief YS Jagan Mohan Reddy for granting him an audience.

50-year old MLA says: “Jagan sir, I love you very much but I decided to end my life due to talks of denial of ticket to me within the party. I followed your footsteps for five years. Now, I am sending you this video before my death”.

Kumar was rushed to the hospital in Madanapalle after failed suicide bid and according to his family members he is out of danger now. His wife later informed the cops that her husband lost his mental balance after receiving inputs from party members that he won’t be getting the ticket to contest in the upcoming parliamentary elections. Facing uncertainty over his political future the MLA decided to take the extreme step.

The MLA also tried to meet Reddy on Thursday at his Lotus Pond residence in Hyderabad but failed to get an audience.

As per the media reports, Kumar was sidelined in the YSRC after he decided to switch sides to N Chandrababu Naidu’s Telugu Desam Party in 2016 along with 23 lawmakers. Senior party leaders after getting information about his plan foiled the attempt and since then he has been completely sidelined.
