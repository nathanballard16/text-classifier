Indians wage online social media battle against citizenship law

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) – As protests rage across Indian universities against a new citizenship law, students have taken to social media to wage battle online and teach people how to organise demonstrations. Approved by India’s president last week, the law paves the way for minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan to get Indian citizenship, but critics say it is biased against Muslims. Current and former students have taken to Instagram, a photo and video sharing platform known for lifestyle content, to express their disapproval. Many are using social media to support the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Chinese firm ByteDance’s TikTok, which allows users to create and share short videos with special effects, is also being used to voice opposition to the citizenship law.
