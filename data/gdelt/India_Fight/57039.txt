Hundreds Protest in Toronto for Kashmir’s freedom and CAA withdrawal

-

TORONTO, Canada: Over 300 people gathered outside the Indian Consulate in Toronto to protest against the illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir by India and the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA).

The protest was held in Toronto when the Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was in Canada for a two-day official visit.

The Indian External Affairs Minister met the Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister François-Philippe Champagne and the Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade Mary Ng.

Thank PM @JustinTrudeau for a cordial meeting. We agreed to raise the quality of our relationship and chart a path for the next 5 years. Will also work closely in the global arena. pic.twitter.com/Qm20CCYzb0 — Dr. S. Jaishankar (@DrSJaishankar) December 20, 2019

The protesters were holding placards and banners inscribed with slogans in favour of Kashmir’s freedom, and against the policies of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Minister for Home Affairs Amit Shah i.e. “Free Kashmir No CAB – NRC No Fascism”, “Stop Modi Fying The Constitution”, and “No More Silence No More Violence” etc.

The anti-Muslims Citizenship Amendment Act has also fueled violent protests in various States of India including the Capital New Delhi, wherein at least 13 people have so far been killed by the police in clashes.
