Hizbul Mujahideen chief calls for truce as infighting among terror groups in Kashmir continues

Hizbul Mujahideen chief Sayeed Salahudeen

New Delhi: A recent video message from Hizbul Mujahideen chief Sayeed Salahudeen has exposed a major split among the terror groups operating in Jammu and Kashmir. The Hizbul chief's eight-minute-long video has come in the wake of the killing of an Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK) militant who was allegedly killed by Lashkar-e-Taiba ultras in South Kashmir's Anantnag district.

In the video, Sayeed Salahudeen makes a plea to fellow terror groups to forget their differences with each other and go on to appeal for unity. In order to assuage the aggravated groups, he also offers a probe into the killing of the ISJK terrorist.

Earlier on Thursday, a group clash broke out between Hizbul Mujahideen and ISJK militants in an orchard in Anantnag’s Bijbehara. The two militants engaged in the fight were found injured by the Indian security forces. Adil Dass of the ISJK died due to bullet wounds while Arif Hussain Bhat of the Hizbul was arrested.

According to reports, Adil Dass had joined Lashkar-e-Taiba last years in July but later fell out of the terror group due to ideological differences and joined ISJK.

It should be noted that after the killing of ISJK militant Adil Dass, ISJK released a video message on social media on Friday where an ISJK militant claimed that Lashkar-e-Taiba and Hizbul Mujahideen are working at the behest of Pakistan. He went on to say that these terror groups are targeting and killing innocent Kashmiris, and they are not fighting for the liberation of Kashmir but merely trying to grab land for Pakistan.
