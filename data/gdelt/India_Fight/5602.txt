Jaipur, Feb 12: A MiG-27 fighter jet of the Indian Air Force (IAF) crashed near Pokhran in Rajasthan on Tuesday. The pilot of the MiG-27 has ejected safely.

The jet was on a training mission and had taken-off from Jaisalmer, said reports. The crash took place around 6.10 pm today.

Both the pilots - Squadron leader Negi and Squadron leader Abrol - of the fighter aircraft had died in the Mirage 2000 crash. Both pilots had ejected, but one of them died as he landed on the wreckage of the aircraft. Other pilot who had also ejected has succumbed to injuries in a hospital.

It may be recalled that in June 2018, a pilot was killed after an Indian Air Force Jaguar fighter jet crashed soon after taking off from the Jamnagar airbase in Gujarat.
