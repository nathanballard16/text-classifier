It’s Modi versus India, says Congress

The Congress on Monday asserted that the 2019 Lok Sabha polls will be a fight between ‘Prime Minister Narendra Modi versus India’ in response to a blog by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley titled ‘Modi versus Chaos.’

“This is going to be a fight of Modi Vs India. This is now a fight between Modi’s Thugbandhan (alliance of thugs) and Janta’s janbandhan (people’s alliance),” senior Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters.

The Congress alleged that Ministers in the Modi government were attacking Opposition parties for attempting a grand alliance to cover its failures like ‘Rafale, rural distress, tax terrorism, bank frauds among others.’

Reacting to Prime Minister Modi’s statement that Opposition parties come together in an unholy alliance only to keep him out of government, Mr. Singhvi reminded the BJP of its alliance with the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir.

“The Prime Minister misleads the Nation by making casual comments, and poking fun at alliances but forgets that he has just come out of the world’s most unholy alliance in J&K. I repeat the words, the most unholy alliance,” Mr. Singhvi said.

The Congress asked the BJP if there was chaos in Atal Bihari Vajpayee government as well as the former Prime Minister headed a multi-party coalition government.

“If Mr. Finance Minister is right about legacy of chaos, and if the Hon’ble Education Minister is right about lack of vision and legacy of chaos, well, then there must have been chaos in J&K earlier with Vajpayee Ji, earlier in 1977-79,”said Mr. Singhvi.

“The convergence of political forces opposed to this rotten dispensation which gathered recently at Kolkata has led to terror, fear and absolute panic in the hearts and minds of the BJP and the Prime Minister. And obviously to cover such blunders as in the farm sector, as in the denial of jobs and as in scams like Rafale, as in midnight knocks and tax terrorism as in misuse of agencies,” he asserted.
