Mother, paramour held for killing 3-yr-old boy

Ludhiana: The police on Wednesday arrested a woman and her lover for murdering her three-year-old son in Jagraon. The accused have been identified as Rajni Devi, wife of Pradeep of Hathur, and Sonu Kumar of Bihla village.

In his police complaint, Rajinder Rishidev of an area near Saim Nullah in Jagraon said he married his daughter Rajni to Pradeep about five years ago. The couple had a son named Sonu. The complainant said after a matrimonial dispute between the couple, his daughter left Pradeep and returned to his house with her son.

Cops said Rajni fell in love with Sonu Kumar, an acquaintance of the family, and about five months ago she went with him, leaving her son with her parents.

They said on Tuesday, Rajni had come to her parent’s house. She and her paramour were sleeping in another shanty and her son Sonu was with his grandparents. Around 2am on Wednesday, both the accused took away the boy and strangulated him to death. The accused then threw his body near the slums and ran away. They added that Rajinder had seen the duo go with the child.

Rajinder went in the direction. He lifted the child and found that he had died. He informed the cops, who moved the body to the civil hospital for post-mortem.

Jagraon city SHO inspector Nidhan Singh said a case was registered in the morning and the accused were arrested within hours. Police said mother of the child had a bigger role in the murder as she wanted to get rid of him before having the baby of her lover. She hated her husband, a native of Bihar, and the child born of marriage with him, they added.

“Rajni held the child’s legs, while her paramour strangulated him,” said a cop.
