A 36-year-old scrap dealer was shot dead allegedly by two masked bike-borne in northwest Delhi's Wazirpur after he resited their robbery bid, police said Friday.

The deceased, identified as Mohammad Nasim, is a resident of Nangloi and the accused could not rob Rs 1.75 lakh the victim was carrying, they said.
