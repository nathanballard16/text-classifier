Up to $15bn a year needed to control TB as world urged to 'mobilise' against the disease

The world needs to apply the same urgency to tuberculosis as it did to Ebola if it is to wipe out the deadly lung disease, a leading TB expert has said.

At the launch of a global plan setting out how to eliminate the world’s biggest infectious killer TB scientists and campaigners have called for more than $15 billion a year between now and 2022.

Some $2.6 billion a year is needed for research and development and $13bn is needed for care and treatment of people with the disease, which infected 10million people in 2018 and killed 1.5million - figures that have barely shifted over the last few years. If the plan is fully funded this would mean that 40 million people would get on TB treatment.

Dr Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the Stop TB Partnership which is spearheading the new plan, called for faster development of a new TB vaccine, better diagnostics and the urgent roll-out of new TB drugs.

In October, scientists unveiled the results of a new vaccine that showed it protected half the people who were given it.

“We have a promising vaccine - very good results were announced in October - but we need to invest around half a billion dollars to have that vaccine ready by 2026,” she said, adding there was currently no funding to take the vaccine from early-stage research out into the field.
