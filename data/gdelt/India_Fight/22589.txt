“It was very hot today, hotter than yesterday. The sun was intense right from morning, and it was very difficult to go outside. And in the afternoon, the sun was literally a fireball. Fearing sun-stroke, I didn’t step out of my office before evening. To prevent myself from dehydration, I had fluids, including juices,” said Rishi Kumar, a trader from BRS Nagar.
