India should realize that war between two nuclear-armed neighbors can result into massive catastrophe:

Major General, retired, Farooq Malik (Defence Analyst): India deserves befitted response to recent uncalled act of war and violation of the LoC. We will retaliate with full strength at right time. It is imperative to involve international community to de-escalate the tension because escalation leads towards war. Prime minister Imran Khan rightly mentioned that war has no end. India must realize that war between two nuclear armed neighbors can result into massive catastrophe. Attacking terrorist’s camp in Pakistan is India’s falsification of facts. Pakistan Air Force effectively took action against the intruders before any damage.
