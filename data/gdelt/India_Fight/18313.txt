NIA arrests Jaish terrorist Nisar Ahmed Tantray from UAE in 2017 CRPF terror attack case

New Delhi:

The National Investigation Agency (NIA) arrested Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist Nisar Ahmed Tantray, who was absconding in the 2017 Lethpora CRPF terror attack case, from the UAE. He had escaped to the UAE on February 1 this year. Nisar is the younger brother of Jaish commander Noor Tantray. The government of India brought him back to the country on March 31, according to news agency ANI.

Tantray is being interrogated by the NIA at present.



The terrorist attack on the CRPF group centre in Lethpora was carried out on the intervening night of December 30-31, 2017, by three terrorists of the proscribed terrorist organisation, the NIA said. During its investigation, the terrorists were identified as Fardeen Ahmad Khandey and Manzoor Baba, both from Pulwama, and Abdul Shakoor from Rawalakot area of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir. All three were killed in the encounter.

In February 2019, the NIA arrested an operative of the JeM in connection with the attack. According to an NIA statement, the accused, Fayaz Ahmad Magray, is a key conspirator who gave logistical support such as providing shelter to the terrorists and conducting reconnaissance of the CRPF group centre in Lethpora before the attack. He was detained under the Public Safety Act (PSA) by the Jammu and Kashmir Police earlier in 2001 and he remained under detention for 16 months, it said.
