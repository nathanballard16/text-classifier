Cowardly acts of terror can't defeat spirit of Sri Lanka: PM Modi plays consummate statesman as he expresses solidarity

Ever since after the Easter bombings in Sri Lanka, PM Modi is the first world leader who has visited the nation after attacks.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Sunday met his Sri Lankan counterpart Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena as he was in the country for a short 3-hour visit while returning from Maldives. Sri Lankan PM Wickremesinghe received PM Modi at the Bandaranaike International Airport in Colombo.

Ever since after the Easter bombings in Lanka, PM Modi is the first world leader who has visited the nation after attacks.

Meeting President Maithripala Sirisena, the two leaders discussed bilateral issues of mutual interest. Sirisena had attended PM Modi's swearing-in ceremony on May 30 which was also attended by BIMSTEC leaders and other important dignitaries around the world.

Modi is the first foreign leader to visit Sri Lanka after the Easter attacks in April. His visit is considered as a sign of India's affirmation of solidarity with Sri Lanka in the aftermath of the deadly Easter terror attacks in April.

PM Modi in India's solidarity message to Lanka said, "I am confident Sri Lanka will rise again. Cowardly acts of terror cannot defeat the spirit of Sri Lanka. India stands in solidarity with the people of Sri Lanka."
