Pakistan starts to distance itself from militant outfits

ISLAMABAD: Madrassas, or religious seminaries, have long been considered as institutions responsible for the spread of religious extremism in Pakistan. Several attempts were made by successive governments since the country was ruled by military dictator Pervez Musharraf to bring these Islamic schools under the ambit of the government, but all such efforts were in vain.The mushrooming of madrassas and their radicalisation in Pakistan started in the 1980s. It was the brainchild of former military dictator General Zia-ul-Haq . With the financial backing of Saudi Arabia and the US, Haq and his spy network, Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), established training and arming centres for thousands of mujahideen fighting Soviet forces in Afghanistan.After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan and its formal disintegration, the seminaries that were formed to run jihadist training camps were tolerated by the Pakistani state for strategic reasons — to use jihad as an instrument of influence in Afghanistan and Kashmir.The idea to reform seminaries and reverse the policy of his predecessor was first conceived by Musharraf after the US invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of a series of massive terrorist attacks by Al Qaeda on US soil on September 11, 2001.While Musharraf had banned scores of militant outfits operating from Pakistan, he had failed to take any drastic step to restructure the madrassas.In January 2015, after a terrorist attack on an army-run school in Peshawar that left more than 140 people dead, mostly students, the military and all political parties had finalised a 20-point action plan, known as the National Action Plan (NAP), a policy aimed at elimination of terrorism and extremism. Some proposals related to the military, like military offensives, the establishment of military courts and capital punishment for those convicted in cases of terrorism, were implemented. But madrassa reform, one of the most important parts of the NAP, remained ignored.Movement on the NAP proposal related to action against extremist elements was witnessed earlier this year when Pakistan, confronted with a deepened economic crisis and pressure from global powers, had banned the Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) and its welfare wing, Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), the two organisations headed by Hafiz Saeed, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks. Since the designation of JuD and FIF as proscribed groups, the government had clamped down on its facilities and sealed its seminaries, besides taking administrative control of its pharmacies, health units, schools and ambulances across the country.“The government has arrested dozens of our workers to please India and the US. Thousands of our workers have become jobless since we can’t pay them salaries. The government has choked all means of our earnings, we are barred from raising funds to continue our welfare activities,” a senior JuD leader told TOI on condition of anonymity.The acceptance of responsibility for the February 2019 suicide attack on Indian troops in Pulwama, Kashmir, by the Jaish-e-Muhammed (JeM), a Pakistan-based outfit, had further intensified pressure on Pakistan.Observers believe the announcement by Islamabad that it will introduce “madrassa reforms” and disassociate itself from banned organisations could be the way forward to convincing the international community that the country was serious about tackling terrorism and religious extremism.“It seems Pakistan is now serious about cutting back its connections with hardliners and their outfits due to compulsions. It may not be in accordance with the wishes of Islamabad but it has no other option. Even friends of Pakistan, like China and the Gulf countries, aren’t supporting Islamabad’s design of harbouring militants,” said Nazr ul Islam, a Pakistani journalist working on militancy in the region.According to official figures, Pakistan currently has 30,000 registered madrassas attended by approximately 2.5 million students. There are also believed to be thousands more that are unregistered, including single-room schools with a handful of students studying the Quran. All members of militant groups were groomed, trained and indoctrinated in some of these schools which are responsible for promoting violent extremism and maintaining ties to transnational terrorist networks.This year, Pakistan has taken some action indicating that the country is gradually distancing itself from the ideology of extremists and hatemongers. Just last week Islamabad had banned at least 11 groups for having links to the JuD and JeM.Previously, Islamabad would only reluctantly go against some small outfits or individuals when pressured but now it is acting against the “untouchables” — JeM, JuD, FIF and groups linked to them.This transformation can be seen in other areas as well. Pakistan had witnessed extreme violence last year after the Supreme Court had ordered the release of Aasia Bibi, a Christian woman who had spent nearly a decade on death row for a false blasphemy accusation. There was not a single protest anywhere in Pakistan when she left the country for Canada last week.
