It is being done on the instructions of those in power ... People are watching everything and they (those in power) will have to face the consequences of people's anger."Hindustan Awam Morcha Manjhi(S) president Jitan Ram Manjhi said "We severely criticize and condemn the manner in which Lalu Prasadjee is being ill treated in jail.
