New Delhi: The customs officials at New Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport has seized gold worth Rs 79 lakh, officials said on Friday.

The gold was hidden in the washroom at the airport.

According to a report in PTI, a 21-year-old man has been arrested for his alleged involvement in gold smuggling.

Acting on a tipoff, the accused was intercepted by customs officials when he arrived at the airport from Abu Dhabi in United Arab Emirates.

The accused has admitted having brought gold to India during the inquiry.

"The passenger informed that he had hidden the gold in one of the washrooms at the airport. Based on his information, 20 gold bars, collectively weighing 2.49 kg, were recovered," a customs official was quoted as saying.

A number of people have been arrested from Delhi airport in connection with the smuggling of gold from foreign shores.

In February this year, three Afghan men were arrested by customs officials at Delhi airport for allegedly trying to smuggle gold valuing about Rs. 54 lakh. The accused were arrested after their arrival from Dubai.

In March 2017, gold worth Rs 50 lakh was seized by the customs officials at the airport in Delhi. The passenger was intercepted after his arrival from Bangkok. He was reportedly found carrying 435 gms of gold and hid them inside leather sandals worn by him.

In June 2018, a major gold-smuggling racket was busted by the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) at Delhi airport. The syndicate was said to have smuggled in over 100 kgs of yellow metal within 12 months.
