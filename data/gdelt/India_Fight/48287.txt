9 Indian soldiers killed as Pakistan responds to ceasefire violation: ISPR

RAWALPINDI – A Pakistan Army soldier and three civilians were martyred as the Indian army resorted to ceasefire violations from across the restive Line of Control (LoC), the military's media wing said on Sunday.

The firing also left two soldiers and five civilians injured, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said, adding that nine Indian soldiers were killed while two Indian bunkers were destroyed in retaliatory fire.

“Indian unprovoked CFVs in Jura, shahkot & Nousehri Sectors deliberately targeting civilians. Effectively responded,” ISPR chief Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor said in a tweet.

The LoC violations come as tensions remain high between India and Pakistan over the former's move to revoke occupied Kashmir's special autonomy on August 5.
