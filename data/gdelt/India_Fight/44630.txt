Pakistan reactivates Balakot terrorist training camp, says Army Chief

After the Pulwama attack that claimed lives of more than 40 CRPF personnel, the Indian Air Force, in February, carried out air strikes targeting the Balakot terrorist training camp in Pakistan. The camp has been reactivated by Pakistan, said Army Chief Bipin Rawat.

Army Chief stated, “The reactivation of the terror camp highlights the fact that the action taken by the IAF was effective and now they are getting their people back there.”

As many as 500 terrorists were waiting across the border to infiltrate into the Indian territory. Soon after the temperature begins to fall, these terrorists would be pushed into India through areas that have less snow, said Rawat. Adding, “We know how to deal with ceasefire violations. Our troops know how to position themselves and take action. We are alert and will ensure that maximum infiltration bids are foiled.”
