BJP Making Shameless Attempts To Subvert Democracy: Sonia -

(Tribune)

Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Thursday said her party along with the Shiv Sena and the NCP was united in its resolve to defeat BJP manipulations in Maharashtra. Addressing the first meet of the Congress Parliamentary Party in the winter session today, Gandhi hit out at the BJP accusing it of making “shameless attempts to subvert democracy” in Maharashtra and to blatantly sabotage the three-party alliance from coming to power in the state.

She accused Maharashtra Governor Bhagat Singh Koshiyari of acting under the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah, adding “the Governor acted in an unprecedented and reprehensible manner.”Launching an all-out offensive against the BJP, the Congress chief said the party will on December 14 hold a rally in New Delhi against the economic mismanagement of the BJP Government.
