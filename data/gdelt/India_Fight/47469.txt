The police said that a diary note found near the teacher's body had suggested serious differences in the family.

Bandhu Prakash Pal, a 35-year-old teacher, his pregnant wife Beauty and 8-year-old son Angan were found dead in their house at Jiaganj in Murshidabad district on October 8, when Durga Puja festivities were on.

Investigations revealed that Bandhu Prakash Pal had multiple bank accounts and there were a series of transactions. The transactions hinted that he was under stress to return money to people.

According to police, Behra had paid money to Pal for two life insurance policies.

Behra has confessed to having committed the crime, the police claimed.
