Assam to file fresh affidavit on foreigners’ issue

GUWAHATI: A day after the Supreme Court slammed the Assam government’s proposal that foreigners’ tribunals may release declared foreigners who have completed five years in detention centres with certain conditions, the latter on Friday decided to file a fresh affidavit on the matter.On April 9, the apex court had asked the Assam chief secretary to submit an affidavit after holding consultations with the authorities concerned in the state, as well as the Union government, giving ‘measures which could be adopted for release of detenues who are now lodged in detention centres, particularly those who have been detained for a long period.’Chief minister’s legal adviser Santanu Bharali, who was also present in the apex court on Thursday, told TOI, “We are happy that the Supreme Court is taking this matter of detention camps in the right direction. The apex court’s orders on this issue will also help the tribunals in dealing with cases of illegal foreigners in future. We will file a new affidavit.”He said the state government proposed conditional release of the detenues because it has limited powers in dealing with declared foreigners. He added that the present state government is always committed to protecting the interests of the indigenous people of the state.The state government, in its affidavit, stated that a five-member committee headed by the additional chief secretary will consider petitions filed by declared foreigners in detention for their conditional release and the committee will sit once every month.In 2012, three detention centres — at jails in Goalpara, Kokrajhar and Silchar — were set up after an approval from the then UPA government. Three other centres were subsequently set up at district jails in Tezpur, Dibrugarh and Jorhat . Later, the Centre approved another detention camp, a standalone one, in Goalpara district with a capacity of 3,000. The existing detention centres in the state with a combined capacity of about 1,000 are always overcrowded, with reports of inhuman living conditions for the detainees, which include children.Families often get separated. The Goalpara, Silchar and Dibrugarh centres are only for male detainees while the Kokrajhar centre is for females. Only the Jorhat and Tezpur centres house both males and females.
