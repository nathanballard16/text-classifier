Hambran road slaughter house likely to be operational next month

Ludhiana: In a major relief to residents, all the open slaughter houses in the residential areas will be shifted to the new slaughter house being constructed by the civic body at Hambran Road. The construction work of the slaughter house is likely to be completed by October.

The officials will now hand over the maintenance and operation of the slaughter house to a private agency.

A meeting of the Finance and Contracts Committee (F&CC) was held on Tuesday. During the meeting, members of the F&CC gave a nod to float tenders for hiring private player for the operation and maintenance of the slaughter house.

The officials said they would try to hire a private agency in the first attempt so that its functioning could begin from October.

Dr Y P Singh, senior veterinary officer of the MC, said the construction work was completed and machinery was being installed in the slaughter house.

He said there was capacity to slaughter around 500 goats, 32,000 cocks and 150 pigs and sheep. He said there were over 300 meat shops in the city at various places and once the slaughter house would start functioning, they would ask all the meat shop owners to get slaughtering done in the slaughter house only.

The project is important for the city in order to eradicate the problem of open slaughtering in all the localities without caring about the norms. The meat sellers can then take the meat and store in deep freezers for sale.

Notably, the project was announced in 2008, but it kept on delaying due to scarcity of funds. The total cost of the project is around Rs 19.50 crore.
