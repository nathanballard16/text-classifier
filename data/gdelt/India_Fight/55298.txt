Citizenship Bill: Cops open fire in Assam, 3 dead

At least three protesters were killed and many others injured in a police firing in Assam's Guwahati of India amid a raging agitation against the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill this evening.



The incident occurred even as thousands of protesters descended on the streets in defiance of a curfew imposed on the city after the parliament cleared the contentious legislation on Wednesday night, reports NDTV.

Earlier today, the Indian government had extended the suspension of Internet services in 10 districts of Assam for another 48 hours, and deployed army personnel in four areas where clashes between protesters and police were witnessed, the Indian news agency said.



The residences of several politicians, including Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal and Union Minister Rameswar Teli, were also attacked by protesters, it reported.
