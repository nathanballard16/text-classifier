Terrorists shoot Kashmiri girl 8 times from face to abdomen

SRINAGAR: Before pumping at least eight bullets into her body, unknown Kashmiri terrorists forced 25-year-old Ishrat Muneer to admit that she was a police informer responsible for the encounter of several terrorists in south Kashmir . The bullet-riddled body of Ishrat was recovered by the police from Draggad area of south Kashmir’s Shopian district on Friday morning.Ishrat’s brother Showkat Ahmad on Saturday refused to believe that she would have acted as a police informer for money or other considerations as she belonged to a well-to-do family. “Ishrat was pursuing her postgraduation in sociology through Ignou and was attending computer classes at a private institute,” Showkat said.Daughter of a policeman, Ishrat was the maternal cousin of slain Al-Badr commander Zaneet-ul-Islam. She was reportedly in touch with one former associate of Zeenat, Shuji Magray, who has now joined Lashkar-e-Taiba , according to a top police officer, who denied that she was working for police or any other security agency as an informer.In order to not attract public indignation, the assailants forced Ishrat to admit that she was responsible for the killing of several terrorists, including Zeenat. In line with the practice of terrorists, the assailants released a 10-second admission video of Ishrat before she was shot at least eight times, from her face down to her abdomen, at the same spot where funeral of Zeenat was held. The 10-second video that was posted on social media shows the girl wearing pheran and headscarf seeking pardon with folded hands before she was shot dead.According to intelligence sources, Ishrat was shot in an orchard in Cherbagh area of Dragged in Shopian district on Thursday evening.Zeenat and Shuji Magrey fell apart after the former parted ways from Hizbul Mujahideen and joined Al-Badr. Shuji Magray later joined Lashkar, an intelligence officer said, adding that this could be the reason behind Ishrat’s murder since her relations with him had strained since then.Ishrat was travelling to Shopian in a shared taxi to attend computer classes on Thursday morning when a few gun-wielding youths stopped the vehicle and abducted her, police said, quoting the vehicle owner.Describing the murder of Ishrat horrifying, former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah on Saturday said it deserved the strongest condemnation. However, another former chief minister, Mehbooba Mufti, refused to comment on it when asked by journalists in Jammu.
