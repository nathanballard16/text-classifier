V Hanumantha Rao visits Hajipur; gives `10K each to kin of victims

Hyderabad: All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretary V Hanumantha Rao on Wednesday visited the families of the girls, who were allegedly killed accused Srinivas Reddy, at Hajipur of Bommalramaram Mandal. Hanumantha Rao handed over Rs 10,000 financial assistance to the families of the victims and consoled them. He enquired about the situation in the village after the death of Sravani.

Addressing the media, he demanded that the government give Rs 20 lakh ex-gratia to the families of the victims. He said that there is no transportation facility to this village. There is a rivulet near the village and the residents are unable to go to Bommalaramaram as there is no bridge. They have been walking three and half kilometres to reach Keesara for various purposes.

Taking advantage of the situation, the accused murdered three girls, he alleged. He said that the police did not act on the complaints registered. He demanded that the government construct bridge across the rivulet of the Hajipur village. He demanded that the police encounter the accused to instil confidence in the people.

Meanwhile, he came down heavily on TRS working president KT Rama Rao for calling him a buffoon. He said that KT Rama Rao must mind his language. He said that he has rescued Rama Rao's father K Chandrashekar Rao when he was vice president of the Youth Congress in 1981. Hanumantha Rao said that he too can scold Rama Rao with filthy language, but his culture stops him. He said that he would show what he was once Congress comes into power.
