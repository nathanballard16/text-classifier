Clash Of Claims: Hyderabad Nizam’s Descendants, India Join Hands Against Pakistan In UK Court To Claim 35 Million GBP

A seven-decade-old dispute between India and Pakistan over the 35 million pound sterling (GBP) belonging to the Nizam of Hyderabad at the time of partition which is deposited in the account of a bank in London is witnessing a high drama in the United Kingdom High Court, reports Economic Times.

Joining hands with the Indian side in the legal battle against the Pakistan government, the Nizam's descendants, Prince Mukarram Jah, the titular eighth Nizam of Hyderabad, and his younger brother Muffakham Jah are claiming the funds lying with the Natwest Bank in London.

The dispute revolves around an amount of around 1,007,940 pounds and nine shillings which was transferred in 1948 from the then Nizam of Hyderabad, Osma Ali Khan, to the High Commissioner of the newly formed Pakistan in Britain. The disputed amount has since grown into millions.

“His Exalted Highness Nizam VIII and his younger brother have waited decades to receive what their grandfather gifted them. Pakistan has blocked access for 70 years and we hope the recent trial will mean a final resolution at last,” said Paul Hewitt, partner in the law firm which is representing the eighth Nizam in the Royal Courts of Justice in London.

According to the report, the judgement in the case, which is being fought between the High Commissioner of Pakistan in UK and seven others including the Union of India and the President of India, is expected in six weeks.
