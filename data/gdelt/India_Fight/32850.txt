This is why Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao’s Judgmental Hai Kya will have two trailer launch events

Kangana Ranaut and Rajkummar Rao’s Judgmental Hai Kya’s trailer will be launched today. The thriller comedy is all set to blow your minds with its eccentricity but there’s a small change in plans. The trailer which was earlier supposed to happen only in Mumbai will now take place in two places simultaneously. Reason? Rains and the havoc it created.

A source informs, “While the rains have now come to a halt in Mumbai, the heavy rainfall since yesterday has affected the airport services very badly. Rajkummar, who was in Delhi for a shoot, was supposed to return to Mumbai for the launch today but due to suspended air services, he won’t be able to make it. Given this, the makers have now decided to go ahead with the trailer launch scheduled in Mumbai along with a impromptu trailer launch event to be arranged in Delhi as well where Raj is present. So, while Ranaut launches the trailer in Mumbai, Raj will launch it in Delhi.” Well, we would say brace yourselves for a roller-coaster ride with the Judgmental Hai Kya trailer.

Meanwhile, the movie ran into a number of controversies before its release but is finally releasing on 26th of this month. The movie will see Kangana and Raj in a never seen before avatar unfolding a murder mystery. This is the second time Raj and Kangana have come together post Queen and we can only expect fireworks from the dynamic duo.
