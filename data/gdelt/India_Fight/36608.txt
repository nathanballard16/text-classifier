Merciless Mom turns enemy, throttles toddler to death

Vadodara: A mother is God’s gift to a child but what if she turns on him? Unfortunately, a 30-year-old mother turned to be the murderer of a one-and-half-year old who throttled him to death and later threw away his body into a canal.

The incident is reported from Gujarat in neighboring Kaira District. After a probe was setup to search for the mother revealed accused Asha Rathod committed the heinous crime as the boy was born out of wedlock. The minor victim’s body was found on May 23 according to officials.

Kathlal police station official DK Raol said the woman was married in 2009 and had two children, but was fighting a court case with her husband and was staying separately since 2015.

“When police reached the accused’s house to find out the whereabouts of her son, she at first said he was undergoing treatment at a hospital. However she confessed after sustained questioning,” he said.

“She has told us that the infant was born out of a relationship she had with another man. To avoid censure from society, she claims to have throttled the child and dumped his body in the canal,” he said.

The police has taken the woman into custody and a case of murder has been registered against her.
