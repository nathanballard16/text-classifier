A day after cyclone Fani ravaged parts of Odisha, killing at least 16 persons, a massive restoration-and-relief work was launched on war-footing today across 10,000 villages and 52 urban areas.

The Eastern Naval Command of the Navy launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation process. Two maritime recce sorties were undertaken by the Dornier aircraft of the Navy, revealing widespread destruction localised around Puri.

Nearly 2,000 emergency workers, along with civil society organisations, personnel of the NDRF, the Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force and 1 lakh officials were engaged in the restoration work, Odisha CM Naveen Patnaik said, before leaving for an aerial survey of the affected areas.

The NDRF deployed 44 teams in the worst-affected parts of Odisha and nine teams in West Bengal, three in Andhra Pradesh, two each in Jharkhand, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and one each in Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Meghalaya.

The teams are working in collaboration with other state agencies to restore power supply, communication set up and clear roads by removing the uprooted trees, poles and debris. They are also assisting the local authorities in distributing relief material. The toll due to the calamity, which stood at eight on Friday, mounted to 16. (With PTI inputs)
