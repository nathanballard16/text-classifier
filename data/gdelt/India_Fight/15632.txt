Soldier killed, 3 injured in ceasefire violation in Jammu and Kashmir

An Army soldier was killed and three others injured as Pakistan violated the ceasefire for the second consecutive day along the Line of Control in Jammu and Kashmir's Rajouri district on Monday.

The incident occurred in Keri Battal forward area in Sunderbani sector, sources said.

Around 5.30 am, the Pakistani Army initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation by resorting to shelling mortars bombs and firing of small arms along the LoC in Sunderbani Sector of Rajouri district Monday, a defense spokesperson said.

The ceasefire violation in Jammu and Kashmir came after Pakistan violated ceasefire on Sunday evening.

On March 16, the Pakistani Army had violated ceasefire by resorting to unprovoked firing along the LoC in Poonch district of Jammu and Kashmir.

"The mortar shelling and small arms firing from across the border started in Mankote sector around 1.30 pm, prompting effective retaliation by the Indian Army," he had said.

The spokesman said there was no report of any casualty on the Indian side in the cross-border firing which was still continuing when last reports were received.

The border skirmishes witnessed a spurt after India's preemptive air strike on a Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camp in Balakot on February 26 following the February 14 Pulwama terror attack in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed.

Four civilians, including three members of a family, were killed and several others injured as Pakistan targeted dozens of villages in over 100 incidents of ceasefire violations along the LoC in the state, especially in the twin districts of Poonch.
