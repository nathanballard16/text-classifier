Mumbai: Mother of PMC Bank depositor dies of cardiac arrest

‘PMCB was close to home’

MUMBAI: Another family from Mulund Colony was bereaved by the PMC Bank scam on Sunday, reports Bella Jaisinghani. Bharati Sadarangani (73), whose daughter and son-in-law hold vast deposits in the bank, passed away after a cardiac arrest in Solapur. She was reportedly deeply anxious about her family’s future.Her son-in-law Chandan Chotrani said, “She did not suffer from any ailment, so this instantaneous cardiac arrest that killed her was most likely precipitated by the bank collapse. My wife Hema would share her worries with her over the phone, and we suspect my motherin-law took this hard.”Chotrani runs an import business.Bharati Sadarangani died around 2pm on Sunday and the last rites were conducted in Solapur. Chandan Chotrani said all his funds were held up in PMC Bank, Mulund. “I had no greed of earning high interest. I just saved all my money there because it was so close to my residence. There was no trouble of finding parking space for the car either, which is such a luxury in Mumbai. Little did I know the fairytale would end this way,” he rued.Chotrani and one of his sons will be back in their Mulund home on Wednesday while another son will stay over with his grandmother's family. The family does not have hope in the government’s handling of the situation given its tepid response so far.The Sindhi community of Mulund Colony has borne the brunt of the PMC Bank deaths, with three casualties related to the issue in the locality. Earlier Fattomal Punjabi and Murlidhar Dharra passed away in the same vicinity. Both owned deposits in the local branch.
