The Goa Police today raided three locations in north Goa and seized liquor estimated to be worth Rs 1.5 crore. The raids police say were based on intelligence and involved a call on unusually large quantity being stored without license. With elections around the corner, police are also probing if it was being sourced to be distributed.

“These three storage places under the garb of selling soft drinks were storing huge quantity of liquor illegally without any excise permit or licence. Given the fact that the elections are round the corner possibility of illegal transportation to bordering states or use within the State cannot be ruled out,” said Chandan Choudhary SP north Goa.
