Wanted criminal arrested in Ghaziabad

Ghaziabad, March 15 : Ghaziabad Police on Friday arrested a wanted criminal against whom at least 30 cases were registered.

Police said they got hold of Anoop Mavi following an encounter in the early hours of Friday after a patrolling team received information about his movements.

When police asked him to stop at a check point, he sped away on his motorcycle. However, he was eventually forced to stop due to a hurdle in his way.

After abandoning the motorcycle, he opened fire at the police team. In the retaliatory police firing, Mavi sustained a bullet injury on his right leg following which he was overpowered and nabbed.

While screening his crime record, he was found involved in 30 criminal cases registered in Sahibabad and Delhi police stations.

"The police recovered a pistol and motorcycle from his possession," said Superintendent of Police (City) Shlok Kumar.
