Uttar Pradesh: The meeting which shaped BHU's future

ALLAHABAD: Much before Banaras Hindu University (BHU) shot to fame for its reputation to groom scholars like Harivanshrai Bachchan and Jagjivan Ram, it was at a meeting convened at freedom fighter Sir Sunder Lal's Elgin Road residence in 1914 that the institution's vision was conceptualised."When Mahamana Madan Mohan Malviya decided to establish BHU, he constituted a committee with Satish Chandra Banerji as its chairman to draft the constitution of the proposed varsity. A meeting was convened at the residence of Sir Sunder Lal at Elgin Road in 1914 to discuss the document," said former head of Allahabad University's chemistry department MC Chattopadhyay.Lal, a dynamic lawyer back then, went on to become one of the founding members of BHU."My great grandfather was the chairperson at the meeting which was convened on January 14, 1914. He was also the first signatory of BHU's constitution," said SC Banerji's grandson Arnab Banerji, who is a practising lawyer in Allahabad high court Apart from Malviya and Lal, the meeting was also attended by freedom fighters Tej Bahadur Sapru and Motilal Nehru and Sachidanand Sinha The Banaras Hindu University (BHU) Bill was later introduced in the Imperial Legislative Council on March 22, 1915, and the foundation stone of the varsity was laid by the then Governor-General and Viceroy on February 4, 1916.However, SC Banerji couldn't live to see his efforts fructify as he died an early death at 44."The constitution drafted for BHU was secular in all aspects. It only sought to encourage an atmosphere of learning. The document was in tandem with the spirit of the Indian Constitution, which does not differentiate among citizens on the basis of religion," said Arnab.Talking about the protest by BHU students over the appointment of a Muslim Sanskrit professor, Arnab said, "I think it is a matter of pride if a scholar practising a religion other than Hinduism teaches Sanskrit. It should not create any controversy."On Thursday, BHU chancellor and grandson of MM Malviya Girdhar Malviya also supported BHU administration's decision to appoint Feroz Khan.Lal's grandson Rajeev Dave said, "If we go by the inane logic that a Muslim cannot teach Sanskrit, then a Hindu should also be stopped from learning or teaching Urdu. My grandfather and eminent leaders who drafted BHU's constitution were great visionaries. Never in their wildest thoughts would they have endorsed any kind of discrimination on the basis of religion."
