MP CM Kamal Nath writes to PM Modi, asks for MSP support for coarse grains

BHOPAL: Chief minister Kamal Nath last week shot a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , asking for MSP (minimum support price) for traditional coarse grains, some of which like kodo-kutki is grown by tribals in the state.In the letter dated November 29, the chief minister wrote, “Nutri cereals are important food crops which meet nutritional needs of large sections of the population and they also promote sustainable agriculture through low water requirement.”The letter argued that the Union ministry of agriculture announces MSP for various crops that include nutria cereals like maize . However, MSP support to nutri cereals is through the Union ministry of consumer affairs, food and public distribution under the food subsidy scheme, CM Nath argued. “This scheme does not consider surrender of surplus coarse grain in the central pool like that in wheat or rice,” he said.Under the provisions of the PM-AASHA (Pradhan Mantri Annasaata Aay SangraksHan Abhiyan), the price differential payment for crops like oilseeds, does not cover nutri cereals. “The provision of ensuring minimum support price to the farmers of nutria cereals has not been correctly addressed and current interventions are inadequate,” CM Nath’s letter said.It was further argued in the letter that in the absence of any concrete interventions, the traditional coarse grain areas may get converted to other foodgrains thereby, impacting agriculture diversity and promote increase the already “strained high buffer stocks of wheat and rice”.CM Nath’s letter added, “I request you to review the current policy of procurement support to the farmers of coarse grain by either including it under PM-AASHA like oilseeds or modifying food subsidy scheme support to coarse grain at par with wheat and rice.”
