A Year Since Their Wedding, Did Deep-Veer Up Their Style Quotient?

This weekend I read an article in the Financial Times’ Life and Arts section that in the milieu of so many dating apps, less people are having sex and getting married than our grandparents’ generation! So to start off with the coming together of two superstars from reel life at least gives real life romantic goals to a generation that does not have much patience with the ‘baggage’ that love brings with it!

Case in point, we all admired the beautiful finery from Sabyasachi and Angadi Galleria in Bangalore, that was worn by Deepika and Ranveer Singh during their nuptials in Italy. But scratch the surface and you realise that they had two wedding ceremonies – Anand Karaj and a Konkani style wedding. Deepika is Konkani and her groom is a loud and proud Sindhi. Deep-Veer embraced each other’s cultural differences, while the young millennials in a world full of apps and options finds being accommodating a task, and ‘swipes left’.
