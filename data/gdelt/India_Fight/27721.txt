Vadodara: Truck carrying LPG catches fire at petrol pump

VADODARA: A major disaster was averted near Dumad crossroads as a cabin of a truck carrying LPG cylinders caught fire at a petrol pump on Tuesday evening.Late on Tuesday evening, short-circuit in the truck’s battery terminal sparked fire which quickly spread to the truck’s cabin. The truck carrying 348 LPG cylinders meant for domestic use was parked on the exit way of Hare Krishna petrol pump as the driver and cleaner decided to go for dinner. Fire officials said that the driver had to refuel the truck for going all the way to Ahmedabad so he went to the petrol pump located on Savli Road near Dumad crossroads. But before refuelling the duo went for dinner.As passers-by saw the flames in the cabin, they immediately alerted the fire department which dispatched fire tenders from Chhani fire station and emergency response centre. The fire was doused within 30 minutes as it had not propagated towards the carriage. “There were no casualties as nobody was present in the truck, but had the fire spread further the incident could have been devastating,” said fire officer Om Jadeja of Chhani fire station.He added that the petrol pump attendants reacted very callously as they closed their petrol pump’s operations and left from there. There was also a tanker carrying 20,000 litre fuel at the petrol pump. “After dousing the fire when we checked the fire extinguishers of the petrol pump, most of them were not in working condition and the pump did not have an NOC,” Jadeja said.The pump owners have been asked to shut their operations and will be given notice on Wednesday.
