Mumbai: Maharashtra state BJP chief Chandrakant Patil, on Wednesday, took a jibe at Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray over farm loan waivers and said that 'U-turn' will henceforth be known as 'Uddhav-ji Thackeray turn'. Speaking to reporters, Patil said that Thackeray had promised a complete farm loan waiver, but announced a waiver of only Rs two lakh.

"He announced loan waiver up to only Rs 2 lakh. We know that there are some limitations. But now he must have understood the difference between announcement and implementation," Patil said. "U-turn will now be known as Uddhav-ji Thackeray turn," he said.

Meanwhile, former CM and leader of opposition in the Assembly Devendra Fadnavis, on Thursday hit out at Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP over the delay in forming a cabinet. "The government which is formed with opposition parties has not been able to form a cabinet also. It's been so many days, but still, no cabinet has been formed. They can't form a simple cabinet together. What work will they do?" he questioned.

In the October 21 Assembly elections, BJP emerged as the single largest party. However, despite having fought together, Shiv Sena opted to go with Congress and NCP to form a government in Maharashtra. The two allies - BJP and Shiv Sena - have since been at loggerheads. On Wednesday, Thackeray hit out at Fadnavis saying NCP chief Sharad Pawar had taught him how to “form a government with less member of MLAs in the legislative assembly”.

Thackeray's response came after Fadnavis asserted in the Assembly that that BJP was the single largest party in the House.
