Telangana Forest Officer Booked Under SC, ST Prevention Of Atrocities Act

Hyderabad: A woman forest officer attacked on June 30 by some people over a land issue case, has been booked under the SC, ST Prevention of Atrocities Act on a complaint from a tribal woman that she and her staff abused some of them while working in their fields that day.

C Anitha and 15 others were booked under Act on Saturday, police said.

The Deputy Superintendent of Police (Kagaznagar) Satyanarayana said the case was registered on a complaint from Saroja, a tribal woman from Sarsala village in Komaram Bheem Asifabad district.

"They came to the fields where we were working. They were trying to plough our land, to which we objected. We (tribals) were abused and kicked with boots while fleeing out of fear from the fields. They used casteist remarks against us," the complainant said.

Anitha was not available for comments.

The woman forest officer was injured on June 30 when she was attacked by some people, allegedly led by the brother of a ruling TRS MLA, at the village over a land issue.

She was hospitalised and later discharged.

As a video footage of the attack on her went viral, police arrested Koneru Krishna Rao, brother of Sirpur MLA Koneru Kannappa, and 13 others on attempt to murder and rioting charges among others.

Two senior police officials were also suspended for negligence in duty.

Anitha had gone to the village with some officials to plant saplings as part of the government's 'Haritha Haram' green initiative programme when she was attacked by some people, who claimed that the land belonged to them. (PTI)
