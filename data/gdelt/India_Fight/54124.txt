Students of local schools took out a protest march here on Thursday, demanding stern action against men accused of raping and murdering a veterinarian in Hyderabad last month.

Congress MLA Surender Pawar, who was part of the march, urged the Telangana Government to take women’s safety seriously.

“There is resentment among people over rising incidents of crime against women in every part of the country,” he said. He demanded exemplary punishment to the accused.
