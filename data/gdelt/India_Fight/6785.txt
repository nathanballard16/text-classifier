ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs website was continuously being attacked by Indian hackers on Saturday, Geo.tv reported.



The website currently cannot be accessed in Norway, United States, United Kingdom, Holland and Australia.



In this regared, Foreign Office spokesman Dr Muhammad Faisal said, “Half of our website was down in several countries following which we started to take action. We had anticipated this action, we know they [India] were panicking and would do something like this. The website has started being restored and would be completely restored soon."

He added that India’s policy had no clarity.

Dr Faisal further said that a hacking attempt was also made on his phone through a Twitter account two weeks ago. However it was foiled.

Journalists and analysts anywhere in the world can access this news from the MoFA website and the attempt is to stop this access," he added.
