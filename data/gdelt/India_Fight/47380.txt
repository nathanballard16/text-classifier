Jiaganj Police slowly closes in on killer motive

Kolkata: Even after six days have passed after the brutal murder of three persons at Jiaganj in Murshidabad, the police are still in the dark about the killer and his motive. During the probe, police came to know that Banik was very close to Bandhu Prakash and had also borrowed money from him. On Sunday, the police found certain messages sent to Banik where Bandhu Prakash requested him to give back the money. After a few months, Bandhu Prakash, in a conciliatory mode, promised not to continue his friendship with Banik. Despite several ambiguities found in his statement, Banik did not disclose how much money he had taken from Bandhu Prakash and why.
