Pimpri Chinchwad Police Commissioner Sandeep Bishnoi told The Indian Express, “Initially, a labourer fell into the trench dug up for PCMC work. Two local residents descended into it to rescue him. While they were trying, a fire brigade team reached the spot and three firemen too descended into the trench. Primary reports show that all six people were trapped after a mass of soil fell into the trench. A rescue operation was launched and NDRF was also called in. Two local residents and three firemen were taken out in the joint effort. One of the firemen has succumbed to his injuries. The rescue operation for the trapped labourer is still on.”
