Ayushmann Khurrana begins shooting for Bala in Kanpur

2019 seems to be like a great year for Ayushmann Khurrana. With some great films lined up, Ayushmann has got the audience super excited. Continuing with his busy schedule, Ayushmann has now started shooting for his next – Bala along with co-stars Yami Gautam and Bhumi Pednekar. The actor kicked off film’s first shoot schedule in Kanpur today and shared pictures of his trip to Kanpur. He shared the same saying, “New Beginnings, Bala.”







In another post, the Badhaai Ho actor wrote, “Hum Kanpur Jayengey,” further adding in another one, “Hum front profile mein bhi Kanpur Jaayengey.”







We are guessing that Ayushmann is quite excited about the film. For the unversed, Ayushmann will play the role of a man who balds maturely while Bhumi will be seen as a small-town dusky tone girl who is at odds with the society for being obsessed with fair skin.



The film reportedly also stars Saurabh Shukla, Jaaved Jaaferi, and Seema Pahwa in important roles. Bala is produced by Dinesh Vijan and helmed by Amar Kaushik. The film is expected to hit the screens in September 2019.

Other than Bala, Ayushmann will also feature in Article 15 and Dream Girl in which he stars opposite Nushrat Bharucha.
