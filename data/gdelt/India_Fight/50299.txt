New Delhi: In an unprecedented revolt by Delhi Police personnel, hundreds of policemen in uniforms and plainclothes gathered outside Delhi Police Headquarters at ITO protesting against the alleged vandalism against them by lawyers at the Tis Hazari Court on November 2. While repeated appeals by Police Commissioner Amulya Patnaik had yielded no outcome, it was only after Devesh Srivastava, Joint Commissioner of Police (Southern Range) announced that the demands have been accepted that the protestors began dispersing. The protest was finally called off later in the evening - news agencies confirmed.

"All your demands will be accepted. FIRs have also been registered in connection with Saket and Tis Hazari Court incidents. No departmental action will be taken against those who are protesting," Srivastava said. Earlier today, Karnataka, Kerala, Telangana and other IPS associations extended support to the protestors.

Meanwhile, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal promised 'best possible treatment for injured advocates and police personnel'. "Suitable ex-gratia compensation to be given to the injured officers of Delhi Police as well," he said.
