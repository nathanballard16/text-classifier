Unidentified persons damage 400 KV electricity tower in Shopian

Srinagar: Unidentified persons suspected to be militants on Friday have cut out a portion of two limbs of 400 KV electricity transmission tower in Chitragam village of Shopian district in south Kashmir, a report by Economic Times said.

Soon after the incident, the armed forces noticed the damage in tower number of 348 of Kishenpur-Wagoora transmission line when they were on a search operation in Chittragam villagein wake of the killing of two non-local truck drivers-Ilyas Khan and Zahid Khan from Rajasthan – who were shot dead around 7:30pm on Thursday. The two spots are just few hundred meters away in Chitragam village.

The report further added that if the tower was damaged and sabotage was successful, most of the areas in Kashmir Valley could have been pushed suddenly into darkness for many hours and amplified load shedding for many days to come.

in this regard, police have registered a case for destruction of public property and are investigating the matter.

This transmission line, which comes under Power Grid Corporation of India Limited, is one of the major electricity transmission lines that connects Kashmir Valley to northern power grid. “This is a major incident of its kind and most probably militants could be behind this. But we are investigating the details,” ET quoted a senior CRPF official as saying, the report added.
