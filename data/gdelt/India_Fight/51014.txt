Why Are JNU Students Protesting, What Are Their Demands?

New Delhi:

Shouting slogans and raising banners, thousands of Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) students clashed with the Delhi Police on Monday outside the campus as they raised their voices against the administration's "anti-student" policy. The protests started in the morning and escalated as the day progressed with angry crowds of students pushing against police personnel in anti-riot gear.

The students wanted to march to the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) auditorium, about three kilometres away from the campus in south Delhi, where Vice President M Venkaiah Naidu was addressing the university's convocation. But they were stopped a short distance away.

Union Human Resource Development Minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' was inside the AICTE auditorium since morning as protests by JNU students escalated, officials said.

'Nishank' along with the Vice President had gone to the AICTE to attend the JNU's third convocation. While Naidu left the premises before the protest escalated, Nishank had to stay inside for hours.

"He is inside. But the situation has been handled. The minister has spoken to JNUSU president and assured their demands will be addressed," a senior HRD Ministry official said.

The minister had two cancel two events at Shastri Bhawan scheduled after the convocation, the officials said.

Hundreds of students gathered outside AICTE headquarter protesting against hostel fees hike. The police had to use water cannons to disperse the protestors.
