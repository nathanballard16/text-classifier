New Delhi's 'gas chamber': Smog reaches worst levels of the year in Indian capital

Air pollution in New Delhi has been declared the worst level so far this year and has made the capital of India a “gas chamber”, the Daily Mail reports.

Doctors have seen a spike in patients with respiratory related issues, according to Sachin Taparia, head of Local Circles, as the capital's air quality index deteriorated to more than 900 - 400 above the level deemed “severe”, on Sunday.

New Delhi has been declared a public health emergency and school's have been forced to close.

More than 30 flights were diverted from Delhi airport due to poor visibility and roads were left deserted as people chose to stay inside instead of bracing the toxic air.

Delhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said it has reached “unbearable levels” across northern India, on Twitter.

However no relief is expected for the next couples of days because humidity caused by overnight rain had exacerbated pollution which had been driven by burning of straw, known as stubble, according to the monitoring agency SAFAR.

As wind speed is “picking up” it could take 24 to 48 hours before pollution level reduces to around 500, Mahesh Palawat, vice president of Skymet, said.

A reading above 400 poses a risk for people with respiratory illness and can affect even those with healthy lungs.
