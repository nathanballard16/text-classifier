21 Sarfarosh co-actors Pippa Hughes and Mukul Dev to collaborate for a historical film

MUMBAI: TellyChakkar exclusively brings to you another piece of news about the telly world.

It is rightly said that content is the king in today’s time. It seems like Discovery Jeet’s 21 Sarfarosh - Saragarhi 1897 actors are all set to come together and create something for the masses.

Pippa Hughes, who played the prominent character of Teresa in the show, gained much appreciation for her role and has enjoyed being a part of the industry ever since she started her journey.

Our sources confirm that the beauty is all set to collaborate with her co-star from Saragarhi, Mukul Dev, who was seen playing the role of Pathan Gulbadshah in the show.

We got in touch with Pippa, who confirmed the news with us and seemed elated on bringing a trilogy. ‘Well the story isn’t for the faint hearted and full of intense moments. The film will focus on various historical issues, and I am ecstatic that I am coming up with it along with Mukul Dev, whom I bonded with quite well in my previous show,’ shares Pippa.

TellyChakkar even got in touch with Mukul, who confirmed collaborating with Pippa for the movie. ‘Yes, I am collaborating with Pippa, and we are excited for the movie. The movie is going to be in a series. That’s what we are aiming at and are still working on finalizing the script for the same,’ shares Mukul.

The actor further added, ‘There won’t be only one director for the movie, as I believe multiple people have a different point of view and we would love welcoming different creative angles to our story with multiple directors.’

Throwing some light upon the idea behind the concept of the movie, Mukul shares, ‘Well, the idea was Pippa’s, and you might get to see her act in the movie also, but in my case, I have no plans on acting in the movie.’

The actors plan to start shooting in September, and both seemed excited and gleeful about their first collaboration together.
