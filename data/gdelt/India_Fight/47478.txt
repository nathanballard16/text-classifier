A student pursuing law was allegedly murdered and buried six feet under in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. The police are suspecting the involvement of student's former landlord and his family.

The landlord and his family are absconding and the police have been deployed at their house in Ghaziabad's Girdhar Enclave.

The student -- Pankaj Singh -- hailed from Baliya, Uttar Pradesh and was a law student in Ghaziabad. Pankaj was missing since Dussehra.

Pankaj stayed in his former landlord's house for 15 days. Then he shifted somewhere else. But, Pankaj went missing on Dussehra.

The police found his body buried deep down in the basement of the same house where he stayed for 15 days.

Pankaj's father Narendra Singh said that the landlord and his family are absconding which suggests their involvement in his son's murder.

People close to Pankaj alleged that the accused are absconding due to the negligence and apathy of the police.

The police have assured a quick arrest of the accused and said that if there are policemen found at fault then a strict action will also be taken against them.
