Man nabbed for murders of four BJP members

MYSURU/BENGALURU: The Bengaluru Central Crime Branch (CCB) claimed they have arrested the prime accused in the murders and attacks on BJP members in Mysuru in 2009. Ateeq Shareef alias Timber Shareef, 39, was picked up on Thursday. Police said he was on the run for years.Shareef was wanted for the murders of Shashikumar in 2008, Ramesh Pai and Sathish in 2009 and Raju in 2016, besides being an accused in the attempted murder of Giridhar, who survived the 2009 attack. The police had identified all four victims as members of the BJP.Police believe Shareef’s arrest will help them zero in on other conspirators and get to the root of the crimes. Shareef, who was arrested by the CCB police, has been remanded to judicial custody.The murder of Pai on Ashoka Road in Mysuru had remained a mystery for years, while his brother Anand Pai had escaped. Ramesh was grievously assaulted and died on the spot. His murder led to communal tension in parts of Mysuru. Thereafter, the attack on Giridhar in front of his house behind Mysuru Central Prison aggravated the situation.Two armed bike-borne men had stopped at Giridhar’s house and attacked him. He was shifted to a hospital and initially it was believed that he would not survive, but he recovered. He was in hospital for three months and underwent multiple surgeries.A host of BJP leaders had staged protests condemning the attack on their workers. Police say the latest murder was that of Raju, who was hacked near a tea shop in Udayagiri in 2016. He was killed with one stroke with a butcher’s knife. This again led to tension in Mysuru. BJP national president Amit Shah visited Raju’s house, further sensationalising the murder.Police said Shareef was involved in the attacks from 2008 to 2016. He was absconding since August 8, 2016 and took shelter at different places in Karnataka and Maharashtra. A senior police officer confirmed his arrest, but didn’t divulge details of how he was nabbed.
