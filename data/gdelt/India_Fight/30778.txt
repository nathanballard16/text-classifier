Anantnag encounter

NEW DELHI, Jun 18: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Army Chief Gen Bipin Rawat Tuesday paid homage to Major Ketan Sharma who died fighting militants in Anantnag district.

The 29-year-old officer was killed in an encounter in south Kashmir district Monday. A militant was also killed in the gun fight which broke out after the security forces launched a cordon-and-search operation in the area. Singh and Rawat laid wreath on the body of Sharma at the Palam Technical Area here.

“Paid tributes to Major Ketan Sharma who made the supreme sacrifice while fighting against the terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. Major Sharma fought valiantly like a true soldier. My heart goes out to his bereaved family,” Singh tweeted.

Later, thousands turned up to pay their last respects to Major Ketan Sharma, who was killed in an encounter with militants in Anantnag, as his mortal remains were brought to his hometown Meerut in Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday.

Sharma’s mortal remains were flown from Jammu and Kashmir to Delhi. The slain Army man, who will be cremated in Surajkund later, was accorded a gun salute by his colleagues here.

A pall of gloom descended on the slain officer’s residence in Kanker Kher area. Senior Army officers consoled Sharma’s family. State minister Suresh Rana also visited his house.
