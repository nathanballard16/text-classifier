Popular actress Asin Thottumkal, who shot to fame with Aamir Khan starrer Ghajini welcomed her bundle of joy in 2017 but it was only last year when she introduced her daughter Arin to the world. On the occasion of her first birthday, mommy Asin shared pictures of her baby girl. Now, as Arin is 18-months-old, the doting parents organised a photo shoot for her and we have to say, the result is beyond words.

Asin shared photo shoot pictures with the caption, ''Sugar & spice.... All of 18 months ARIN #babybiker #babyballerina''. Baby Arin can be seen in two avatars. While in the first look, she is the bike baby with black leather jacket, matching sunglasses, demin and tee, in the other look, she looks sugary sweet. In powder pink frock, Arin is donning the avatar of baby ballerina. Check out the post.

As soon as Asin shared the pictures, comments started pouring for the baby girl. Her Instagram followers can't resist from showering praises on Arin who is posing with swag. Earlier, Asin also thanked Raveena Tandon on behalf of Arin for the birthday present and wrote: "Thank you Raveena Tandon maasi for this gift." She accompanied the post along with the hashtags "#Arin" and "#Arinturnsone". The baby girl is a spitting image of her mom and we couldn't stop gushing over her. Check out some more pictures of Arin below.
