Honour Killing Case: Two Indian-Origin Canadian Citizens Extradited to India

Investigations revealed that the murder was an instance of honour-killing and was planned by Malkit Kaur and Badesha in Canada using hired killers. The police have 266 phone calls as evidence.

The first Indian request to extradite the duo went to Canadian authorities in 2005. In 2014 the British Columbia Supreme Court at Vancouver ordered them to be deported to India for trial.

On appeal by the accused, British Columbia's Appeal Court overturned the deportation order citing the allegation that India's record for treatment of prisoners was "appalling" as a reason.

The Indian authorities persisted, and in September 2017, the accused were on the verge of being deported when a Canadian court ordered a last-minute stay. The court took cognizance of some unverified Facebook posts alleging that the accused would be subjected to prejudice and would not get a fair trial in India as committed to by Indian authorities.

Subsequently, the nine-judge bench of the Supreme Court of Canada, through a unanimous decision, overruled the lower court's stay on the extradition of the honour-killing victim's mother and maternal uncle to India.
