Cutting of trees in Aarey Colony in Mumbai has sparked protests, which led to blocking of roads and detaining of several activists. Reportedly, 29 activists have been arrested. Indian police detained protesters demanding that the Mumbai Metro Rail Corp Ltd (MMRCL) not cut some 2,700 trees to build a train parking shed for an upcoming subway line, a spokesman for the Mumbai police said on October 05, 2019. More than 400 people gathered on October 04, 2019 and tried to hug the trees, located in the Aarey Colony suburb, in an attempt to stop officials from cutting them. Police eventually removed the protesters and shut entry to prevent further inflow of people, activists said. "They have been charged with obstructing a government servant from doing his duty and unlawful assembly. Around 200 policemen have been deployed at the location," Pranaya Ashok, a spokesman for the Mumbai police, told Reuters. The Bombay High Court had dismissed on October 04, 2019 all petitions opposing the cutting of the trees, clearing the way for authorities to build a parking shed for Line 3 of a broader train network that aims to reduce traffic congestion in one of the world's most densely populated cities. Ashwini Bhide, the Managing Director of the MMRCL, accused the protesters of trying to bypass the law. Environmentalists, politicians, Bollywood stars and business leaders have opposed the felling of trees in one of the city's last green spaces, saying destroying green cover could exacerbate pollution.
