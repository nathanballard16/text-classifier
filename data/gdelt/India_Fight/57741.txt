BJP government should declare Shraddhanand Martyrdom Day as public holiday without adding new holiday

Dear Editor,

BJP led central government should honour Swamy Shraddhanand by declaring his martyrdom day of 25th December as gazetted holiday to respect sentiments of millions of Arya Samajists, without practically adding a holiday because the day is already a holiday for Christmas Day. The building where Swami Shraddhanand breathed his last is in congested Shraddhanand Marg (Naya Bazar) of Old Delhi. Government should acquire this building to convert into a national monument in memory of this great freedom-fighter whose activities were of prime importance not only for the freedom struggle but also for uplift of downtrodden, dalits and women.

Swami Shraddhanand though being disciple of Arya-Samaj-founder Mahrishi Dayanand Saraswati, was an icon of national integration against British regime. He was the only non-Islamic leader having been invited to address from the historic Jama Masjid of Delhi as unity-symbol of all Indians to fight for independence of country against British regime. His boldness to challenge British police to fire on his bare chest in front of Town Hall at Chandni Chowk in Delhi, made Congress party to gather round him for its Delhi session in the British era where leaders like Motilal Nehru, Dadabhai Noroji acknowledged him as bravest leader of those times.
