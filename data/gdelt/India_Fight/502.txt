SCOOPS: Akshay Kumar to begin Rohit Shetty's Sooryavanshi in April, Abhishek Bachchan won't produce a web show

4/4

One of the most anticipated films of 2019, RSVP’s Uri: The Surgical Strike has created excitement among movie buffs as they will get an opportunity to witness on screen a landmark event in the history of the Indian army. The war drama is based on the 2016 surgical strikes that were initiated by our soldiers in retaliation to the terrorist attack by Pakistanis in which 19 of our jawans were killed. The Aditya Dhar directorial, which opens in cinemas on January 11, traces the men in uniform’s heroic triumph against the militant bases of Pakistan and draws parallels with the international hit Zero Dark Thirty (2012).

Just like our soldiers entered the land of the enemies to wipe away the terrorists, a similarly-fashioned attack was witnessed in 2011 as US army officials infiltrated Osama Bin Laden’s territory and killed him. Zero Dark Thirty received appreciation from across the globe for its fierce and authentic portrayal of real-life events.

The promos of the Vicky Kaushal-starrer showcase the dangerous operation and the story of the night that shook the entire nation. The action-packed film boasts of an ensemble cast including Mohit Raina, Paresh Rawal, Yami Gautam and Kirti Kulhari.
