PM Modi lashes out at opposition over Pulwama attack

Prime Minister Mr. Narendra Modi attacking the opposition over their comments on the Pulwama attack and the military exchanges between India and Pakistan said that while ‘they are busy targeting me, and I am busy targeting terrorists’. While addressing a rally in Vastral, Gujarat, he said while I am busy working towards the welfare and empowerment of farmers and workers, the opposition has been deforming facts for ‘removing Modi’.

“They are distorting facts and Modi is busy working for the welfare and empowerment of farmers and workers. They are carrying out a strike on Modi, and Modi is busy striking terror”, he said in his speech.

Earlier, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad attacked Congress over its questioning of the air strikes carried out by IAF in Balakot, Pakistan. “There is a growing competition between senior leaders of the Congress party as to who is more vocal in lowering the morale of the security forces,” Prasad said.

“Has Digvijaya Singh reduced himself to such a low level that he will call the most heinous terrorist attack on 45 CRPF jawans as an accident? This is their thinking,” Prasad said referring to Congress leader Digvijaya Singh’s remarks in which he called the death of 40 CRPF personnel an ‘accident’.

“BJP would like to know is all this tweeting (by Congress leaders on Pulwama Terror Attack) a part of a conspiracy? Because whatever is being said here is being shown in Pakistan,” he said.
