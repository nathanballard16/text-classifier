Pakistan Says Modi's Nuclear Threat Disregards Strategic Stability in South Asia

Narendra Modi earlier on Sunday, during an election campaign, sensationally referred to the night of 27 February and the missile related threat from India as "Qatal ki Raat" (the night of murder).

"It clearly contradicts the position of Indian officials, who had tried to give an impression that there were no such plans from India and instead had blamed Pakistan for 'whipping up war hysteria'", the ministry added.

Pakistan once again called for dialogue and said such nuclear brinkmanship needs to be discouraged.

"It is in the interest of the region that both countries resume dialogue and discuss confidence building and restraint measures for the long-term strategic stability in South Asia", the ministry stated.

India and Pakistan clashed on 27 February after the Indian Air Force conducted an aerial strike against terror infrastructure in Balakot inside Pakistan in retaliation of the Pulwama terror attack of 14 February, in which more than 40 Indian soldiers were killed. During the clash on 27 February, India claims to have shot down one F-16 fighter jet with a MiG-21 Bison, before the latter was shot down by defences inside Pakistani territory.
