RTHK: Three get life for girl's rape and murder in India

An Indian court has sentenced three Hindu men, including a police officer, to life in prison for the kidnap, rape and murder of an eight-year-old Muslim girl in 2018, in a case that provoked horror and exacerbated religious tensions.

Three other policemen were sentenced to five years in prison for destroying evidence. Another defendant was acquitted. An eighth suspect, a minor, will be tried separately by a juvenile court. All had pleaded not guilty.

Sexual violence, including against children, is rife in India and outrage over the Kathua case, named after the district where the atrocity happened, contributed to the government introducing the death penalty for child rapists.

The girl was abducted while she was out grazing horses and taken to a village in Jammu, the Hindu-dominated part of the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir, on January 10 last year. In an ordeal lasting five days, she was drugged and held in a Hindu temple, repeatedly raped and then strangled and bludgeoned to death.

Investigations suggested that the girl was targeted in order to strike fear in her nomad community and drive them out of the area.

Thousands of members of a radical Hindu group had demanded the release of the defendants, insisting they were innocent.

The trial was shifted to Pathankot, a town in neighbouring Punjab state, following accusations that local Hindu leaders and politicians were trying to block the investigation.

Prosecutors said that they would study the verdict before deciding whether to appeal the sentences, saying the girl's family had hoped that all six would be given the death sentence. (AFP, AP)
