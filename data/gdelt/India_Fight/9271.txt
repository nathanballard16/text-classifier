Supreme Court dismisses petition seeking probe into Pulwama, Uri terror attacks

New Delhi:

The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed the petition seeking an investigation into alleged administrative lapses in the Pulwama and Uri terror attacks. The Bench of Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi and Justice Sanjiv Khanna said that the court was not inclined to entertain this plea filed by advocate Vineet Dhanda. He also sought stern legal actions against those who attacked the armed forces in any form in Jammu and Kashmir.

In his plea filed on February 18, Dhanda had sought direction from the Centre to constitute a commission headed by a retired Supreme Court judge along with the army, intelligence, and local administration to conduct an inquiry in the two terror attacks.

The petition also sought details of action taken against separatists so far. While suggesting freezing of bank accounts of the separatists, the plea urged the top court to put a ban on the separatists from contesting elections.

On February 14, around 40 CRPF personnel were killed when a suicide bomber rammed into a convoy while moving from Jammu to Srinagar in Lethpora area of South Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Pakistan based terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) claimed the responsibility of the attack.

On September 18, 2016 militants attacked the Army’s Uri base camp and killed 19 unarmed soldiers.
