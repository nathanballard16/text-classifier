HC relief for two for withdrawing Rs 1.2L via cheques during demonetisation

MUMBAI: In a relief for two Nashik firm executives booked for withdrawing Rs 1.2 lakh from a bank through cheques two days after demonetisation, the Bombay HC has struck down the FIR against them, ruling that continuing the criminal case would be an abuse of the process of law.The CBI’s anti corruption bureau had booked the finance manager and director of Reliable Auto Tech for cheating and criminal breach of trust as they had signed three cheques totalling Rs 1.2 lakh that were submitted to SBI on November 10, 2016. The CBI said they flouted an RBI circular dated November 10, 2016 — two days after demonetisation — which limited cash withdrawal to Rs 10,000 per person and Rs 20,000 per week.A division bench of Justices Ranjit More and Bharati Dangre said, “The allegation... can merely be referred to as ‘absurd’ and would not lead to an inference that the accused persons could be held guilty... Since the allegations... would not finally result in establishing the guilt since the basic ingredient alleged is the dishonest intention.”
