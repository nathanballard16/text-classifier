Vijayawada: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday conducted raids on the offices and residence of former Telugu Desam Party (TDP) MP Rayapati Sambasiva Rao in various locations of Andhra Pradesh. The raids were conducted in an alleged case of defaulting loans amounting to Rs 300 crore taken from banks.

According to reports, the former TDP MP's construction firm Transstroy India Limited had taken loans amounting to Rs 300 crore which later turned into NPAs due to non-repayment.

The CBI officials conducted raids on the offices and residences of Sambasiva Rao in Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Guntur, and also on the buildings belonging to Transstroy Managing Director Sridhar Cherukuri and others.

Sources suggest that a case has been registered against Sambasiva Rao after a consortium of banks led by Union Bank filed a complaint. The banks have claimed that the former TDP MP's firm has defaulted loans to the tune of Rs 300 crore.

Sambasiva Rao, who is a five-time MP from Andhra's Narsaraopet Lok Sabha seat, managed to secure the prestigious Polavaram multi-purpose irrigation project contract during the previous TDP regime. However, his firm backed out from the project despite procuring a loan for it, said reports.
