He will never tweet like this about Islam: BJP slams Shashi Tharoor's 'everyone is naked jibe' at Yogi Adityanath

The Congress MP from Thiruvananthapuram had posted on twitter, "Ganga bhi swachh rakhni hain, aur paap bhi yahi dhone hain. Iss Sangam mein sab nange hain. Jai Ganga Maiya ki!" (Ganga has to be kept clean and sins also have to be washed there. In this Sangam everyone is naked. Hail Goddess Ganga!).”

Congress leader Shashi Tharoor has come under fire from the BJP for his “everyone in naked in this Sangam” jibe at Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s holy dip in the Sangam at Prayagraj on Tuesday.

Speaking to ANI on Wednesday, BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli said such comments on Hindu practices by an educated person like Tharoor is very unfortunate.

"This is very unfortunate. An extremely educated and respected person like Tharoor always comes up with such kind of comments related to practices of the Hindu religion" Kohli said referring to the tweet posted by Tharoor yesterday.
