GUWAHATI: Morigaon Police and CID sleuths, in a joint operation with Bihar Police, have rescued 13 people, which includes 12 girls, from the clutches of sex traders in the Motihara area of Bihar on Sunday night.Two persons, identified as Anil Kumar and Deepak Kumar, have been arrested in connection with the case.SP (Morigaon) Swapnaneel Deka said, "Our team had arrested two human traffickers from the Kamakhya railway station on September 11. Based on their revelation, the joint team raided some areas in Bihar and rescued the victims from the state." He added that there are five minor girls and a 12-year-old boy among those resued. The victims hailed from Morigaon, Golaghat and Nagaon districts."They were trafficked to Bihar where they were given some dance training and then forced into sex trade. The two arrested persons were suspected to be agents of the illegal business. Their interrogation will reveal more," the SP added.Assam Police, in cooperation with other security agencies, have been working relentlessly to combat human trafficking rackets in the state. Police believe that the racketeers remain highly active after the flood season as many people lose their valuables and are forced to go out of the state for a living."Since January alone, some 463 minors, including over 170 girls, were rescued by the NF Railway's Railway Protection Force (RPF) sleuths. In 2018, 669 minor boys and girls were rescued from various railway premises by the RPF," said Subhanan Chanda, chief public relations officer.Recently, a minor girl from Assam was rescued in New Delhi from the clutches of human traffickers.In August, the Assam Police received the Special Jury Award, 2019 by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) under the category -'Human Trafficking' - for its work and practices in this field. The practices include establishing and strengthening of anti-human trafficking units (AHTUs), training, sensitization and capacity building of field-level police officers, coordination with other stakeholders, creating awareness, preparation and circulation of resource materials.
