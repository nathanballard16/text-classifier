With deadline for withdrawal of nominations ending, stage set for stiff contests

BENGALURU: With the deadline to withdraw nominations expiring on Thursday, battle lines are drawn for the December 5 byelections to 15 assembly constituencies in the state. Unlike the Lok Sabha elections where the Congress and the JD(S) were allies, these byelections will largely be a three-cornered contest.The BJP is expected to go full throttle in its bid to save its four-month-old minority government, but it faces several hurdles in its ‘Mission 7-plus’. On the positive side for the saffron party, the polls come at a time when opposition parties are in disarray. The JD(S) is facing an existential crisis, while Congress is battling factionalism and infighting.With barely a fortnight left, senior party leaders will campaign at full steam from Friday. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa is expected to address two rallies a day on an average, covering all 15 constituencies. Congress leader Siddaramaiah and JD(S) leader HD Kumaraswamy — both former CMs — already launched their campaigns from Hunsur.For the ruling party, achievements of the state and central governments will be poll issues, while opposition parties are targeting the disqualified MLAs, calling them “traitors” who need to be taught a lesson.A controversial circular issued by the state government which said “Dr BR Ambedkar alone did not draft the Indian Constitution” and the alleged remarks made by law and parliamentary affairs minister JC Madhuswamy against a Kuruba pontiff have also come in handy for the Congress and the JD(S). Some Dalit and Kuruba organisations have already made a clarion call not to vote for BJP.
