The ruling BJP on Friday launched a new Twitter campaign, the #5YearChallenge, to highlight the changes it brought into India during its tenure. The Twitterati, along with BJP leaders, also cited media reports to showcase the change brought about by the Modi government.

Ahead of Lok Sabha polls less than six months away, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party on Friday launched a new Twitter campaign, the #5YearChallenge, to highlight the changes it brought into India during its tenure. Party leaders, along with the national and state BJP Twitter accounts, used cartoons and visuals to emphasise the Narendra Modi-led government's achievements.

Among the schemes mentioned were the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), Beti Bachao, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and other infrastructure developments. The saffron party in its Twitter campaign also launched an attack on the Congress over the National Herald and Bofors scams among others.

Corruption & scams were hallmarks of previous government where every deal & scheme was marred with cheat & loot.

This really encapsulates the entire spirit of #5yearchallenge and the difference the 5 years of Modi government has brought. From 'Fragile Five' to the "Fastest Growing' in a span of five years. pic.twitter.com/uHAYXiVbAK — Akhilesh Mishra (@amishra77) January 18, 2019

This #5YearChallenge has not just been cosmetic but has made real life transformation possible. Maternal mortality rate is a topic which never excites the talking heads in media or becomes an agenda for the divisive Congress party. But it did become an action point for Modi govt. pic.twitter.com/dXTRrj2cv8 — Akhilesh Mishra (@amishra77) January 18, 2019
