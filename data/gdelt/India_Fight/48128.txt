It Was A Misunderstanding, Will Talk To Amit Shah: Bangladesh HM On BSF Jawan's Killing

"Yes, we have received a complaint from the BSF. A case has been registered and investigation is on," Murshidabad Superintendent of Police Mukesh Kumar said. The BSF officials, too, confirmed that police have lodged an FIR against the BGB.

Bangladesh Home Minister Asaduzzaman Khan on Saturday exuded confidence that the unfortunate killing of a Border Security Force (BSF) jawan by a Bangladeshi border guard will not have impact on the bilateral ties between the two countries and said that he would talk to his India counterpart Amit Shah, if need to defuse the situation. Khan also stated that an Indian fisherman, who was arrested on Thursday for trespassing into Bangladesh waters, will be released, in accordance with the norms. A report by news agency PTI quoted Khan saying that a "misunderstanding between the forces" led to the killing of BSF head constable Vijay Bhan Singh. "Steps would be taken to ensure that such incidents don't recur. If needed, I will talk to Amit Shah to diffuse the situation," he said. A BSF statement said the incident took place in Murshidabad district around 9 am when a force party approached the BGB troops, standing at a "char" or a riverine in the middle of the Padma river, to resolve an issue linked to Indian fishermen.
