NC founder’s anniversary off J&K holiday list

SRINAGAR: The J&K administration has removed National Conference founder Sheikh Abdullah’s birth anniversary on December 5 and Martyrs’ Day on July 13 from the official holiday list for 2020.It has added a new holiday on October 26 to mark the day that the erstwhile state of J&K acceded to the Indian Union in 1947, reports Saleem Pandit. Sheikh Abdullah, a former chief minister and the father of NC president Farooq Abdullah , is credited with playing a key role in the accession of J&K.The annual Martyrs’ Day commemorates the death of 23 people who were killed in police firing during Dogra rule in 1931. According to the order, 27 public holidays will be observed throughout the UT in the new calendar year.This is the second time that Sheikh Abdullah’s birth anniversary has been removed from the holiday list, the first time in 2002 when Mufti Muhammad Sayeed became chief minister. NC expressed anguish over the order and sought a review of the decision, saying: “The contribution of Sher-e-Kashmir (Sheikh Abdullah) in the democratic awakening of his people cannot be undermined as it stands acclaimed nationally and internationally.”“Sheikh Abdullah was a visionary mass leader and statesman who rejected the two-nation theory of Mohammed Ali Jinnah over the secularism of Mahatma Gandhi ,” NC provincial president Devender Singh Rana said.Meanwhile, there was also a demand from a section to declare the birth anniversary of the last Dogra ruler, Maharaja Hari Singh, a holiday stating that he was instrumental in the accession of the erstwhile state.
