A few hours ago, Srinidhi shared a picture with Sanjay Dutt as her Instagram story and wrote, "Finally with our #Adheera. Monster on screen n sweetest in person" - (sic) We couldn't help but notice how happy she looks, standing beside the Bollywood star.

Sanjay Dutt's presence on the sets of KGF Chapter 2 has gotten fans super excited. They couldn't contain their excitement when a picture of Yash and Sanjay Dutt started making rounds on the internet. Needless to say, every KGF fan is waiting to watch the face-off between Rocky Bhai and Adheera.

The makers who only introduced Adheera in the original film will show most of his character in the latter. Yash's statement from an old interview established that the Bollywood actor has a pivotal role to play in Chapter 2.

As far as KGF's shooting is concerned, the team is currently based in Hyderabad, according to reports. Now that the Karnataka High Court has issued permission to resume shoot in Cyanide Hills, we could expect to see them at Kolar Gold Fields soon.
