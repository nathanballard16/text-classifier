Court observesandwere active members of the banned CPI (Maoist) and there is ample evidence against them.The Bombay High Court on Tuesday rejected the bail applications of activists Sudha Bharadwaj, Vernon Gonsalves and Arun Ferreira in the. The court observed that prima facie the three were active members of the banned organisation, CPI (Maoist).Justice Sarang Kotawal said as the police had prima facie established that academician and social worker Sudha Bharadwaj was on important committees of CPI (Maoist) and booked under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the other grounds for bail like “academic record, achievements, social work, family background, health issues and her continued detention in jail cannot be taken into consideration”.As for Ferreira and Gonsalves, the judge observed that they were involved in the process of recruiting cadres according to the literature of the banned organisation. While the court had earlier asked Gonsalves to explain the type of literature he kept at home, no observation was made on the aspect as the Pune police made no submissions about it.The Pune police has alleged that some members of Kabir Kala Manch, the purported front organisation for CPI (Maoist), were responsible for spreading hatred through dance, song and music during Elgar Parishad on December 31, 2017, which finally led to violence in Bhima-Koregaon on January 1, 2018, killing one person.The police said they later widened the scope of the investigation to unearth a “much larger conspiracy”. They alleged that Indian Association of People’s Lawyers (IAPL) was also a front organisation of CPI (Maoist). While Bharadwaj is the vice-president of IAPL, Ferreira is the treasurer and Gonsalves is also a member, the police said. The charge-sheet mentioned some more organisations – Anuradha Ghandy Memorial Committee, Kabir Kala Manch, and Persecuted Prisoners Solidarity Committee – as the front organisations of CPI (Maoist).The court rejected all the arguments made by the defence. It said there was sufficient evidence against the activists and the questions should be argued during the trial. “It’s a very sad decision. The most important documents are the letters, but the court is not commenting on their admissibility, saying that it would be decided at the time of the trial.We have repeatedly raised the issues of authenticity of these letters which read like a Bollywood script,” Vernon’s son Sagar Gonsalves told Mirror.“I haven’t had time to read the 68-page judgment yet, but the dismissal of Sudhaji’s bail is deeply disappointing to all of us in Chhattisgarh. The factory workers and the farmers whose cases she had been fighting were all looking forward to having her back,” Bharadwaj’s colleague Shalini Gera said.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The Supreme Court on Tuesday extended by four weeks the interim protection from arrest granted to civil rights activist Gautam Navlakha in the Elgar Parishad case. A bench of Justices Arun Mishra and Deepak Gupta, however, asked Navlakha to approach the court concerned to seek pre-arrest bail in the case.When the Maharashtra standing counsel, Nishant Katneshwarkar, objected to the grant of further interim protection to Navlakha, the bench questioned the state as to why they had not interrogated him for over a year.The court took note of the fact that one of the co-accused has been granted similar relief recently by the apex court and said that Navlakha was granted interim protection from arrest since August 28, 2018.The bench said that a review plea is pending before the apex court against the slapping of provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and therefore it would not like to pre-judge the case at this juncture and prejudice the case of either party.“The question of active member and passive member of an unlawful association is pending before a larger bench and therefore we would not like to comment on this issue at stage,” the bench said.
