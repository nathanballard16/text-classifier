Moto Will Re-Launch Its Iconic Razr Flip Phone At Rs 1 Lakh Price, But Will You Really Buy It?

There was a time, way back in 2004, when the Moto Razr was the pinnacle of phone design. With the latest features, and a flip shell design, it was very sleek, and very coveted.

So Motorola figures it might be time to give it another shot and revive the device for round two.

According to the Wall Street Journal, Motorola's owner Lenovo is bringing back the Razr in a new avatar, and it might launch as early as February this year. It seems the company is following in the footsteps of Nokia, which brought back the 3310 in a new form in 2018.

The new Razr is expected to keep the foldable design, but will this time feature a $1500 price tag (approximately Rs 1.07 lakh). There's no guaranteed launch date so that probably means the phones are still being tweaked. And based off that price, it might be the company is trying to imitate the latest trend and either give the phone two separate touch screen displays or a foldable one.

Indeed, that's what had seemed the when patent drawings emerged last year.

If that's the case, it'll be maybe the third flexible display on the market, after the FlexPai and the yet-to-debut Samsung Galaxy F. And if things carry on as we believe, it won't be the last this year either.
