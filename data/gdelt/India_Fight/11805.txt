New Delhi/Islamabad: Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) chief Masood Azhar is undergoing regular dialysis for renal failure at a Pakistan military hospital in Rawalpindi, the news agency PTI said quoting officials. The statement comes a day after Pakistan's Foreign Minister (FM) Shah Mahmood Qureshi in an interview with CNN admitted that the JeM chief is in Pakistan and keeping unwell.

A senior official told PTI that Azhar is undergoing treatment at the army hospital in Rawalpindi, the headquarters of Pakistan Army. The official also said the JeM chief was a close associate of Osama Bin Laden, abetted terrorist acts in several African countries and introduced Jihad into the religious discourse in UK mosques.

The JeM chief was released by then BJP government in exchange for the hostages of the hijacked Indian Airlines flight IC-814 on December 31, 1999. Speaking to CNN about Azhar, the Pakistan Foreign Minister said, "he is in Pakistan, according to my information".

"He is unwell to the extent that he can't leave his house, because he's really unwell," he added.

Azhar was arrested in Jammu & Kashmir for preaching Jihad in 1994. One of his British recruits, Omar Shaikh of the Harkat-Ul Ansar terror outfit, kidnapped four British tourists in 1994 to blackmail India into releasing Azhar. The Indian security forces, however, were able to secure their release and arrest Shaikh.

JeM was formed after Azhar’s release and carried out its suicide attack in April 2000 in Srinagar on an Army cantonment. We have asked them, they have denied: Pak FM Shah Mahmood Qureshi admits ‘contact with JeM chief Masood Azhar’
