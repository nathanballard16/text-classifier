‘Too much Odomos’: Omar Abdullah says India suffering from ‘Overdose of Only Modi, Only Shah’

Former Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister and National Conference leader Omar Abdullah on Monday quipped that India is suffering from an overdose of Odomos – Overdose Of Only Modi Only Shah – in response to BJP National President Amit Shah’s attack on the Congress at a rally in Una, Himachal Pradesh.

Amit Shah had said that for Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and his sister Priyanka Gandhi, the One Rank One Pension scheme for Army veterans, or OROP, means “Only Rahul Only Priyanka”. “[Prime Minister] Narendra Modi gave OROP to our jawans, Congress gave ‘Only Rahul Only Priyanka’,” he claimed.

The Congress appointed Vadra to the post of general secretary for the Uttar Pradesh East region on January 23. She is expected to take charge from the first week of February ahead of the upcoming Lok Sabha elections, expected to be held in April and May.

Shah also accused Rahul Gandhi of paying lip service to eradication of poverty in the country. “I want to ask Rahul Gandhi what did the Congress government do for 55 years?” Shah said. “It’s only us who are taking measures for eradication of poverty.”
