Pulwama Attack: “Ready to sacrifice other son for India,” says father of killed jawan

NEW DELHI: In a heart-wrenching message, the father of a CRPF personnel who was killed in the terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama said that he is ready to sacrifice his other son as well for the country.

When the convoy of security forces in Kashmir carrying around 40 CRPF was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway, Ratan Thakur was among the 40 victims in the attack.

Ratan’s father has not bowed down to terrorism. He said he is going to send his other son to fight for the country even after losing one son “in Mother India’s service.”

On Thursday, in the deadliest terror attack on security forces in Kashmir, around 40 CRPF personnel were killed when their convoy was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for the attack.

The White House has strongly condemned the Pulwama terrorist attack and asked Pakistan to immediately end support and safe haven to all terror groups.

However, Pakistan rejected allegations of the attack and called it a matter of grave concern, the government of Pakistan stated they have “always condemned acts of violence” anywhere in the world.

Prime Minister Modi while paying tribute to CRPF personnel said “I pay tribute to soldiers who lost their lives in Pulwama Attack. Our security forces have been given full freedom. We have full faith in their bravery. The forces behind this act of terrorism and those responsible for it will be definitely punished.”
