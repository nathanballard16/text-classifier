He didn't even know how to wear his pants when Indian Army was formed: Kamal Nath attacks PM Modi

Lashing out at PM Narendra Modi for his radar and clouds comment on Balakot airstrike, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath said PM Modi didn't even know how to wear his pants and pyjamas when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi formed the country's army.

Kamal Nath made the comment while addressing a rally in Ratlam.

"5 saal ka jawaab nahi de sakte, kya baat karte hain? Desh ki suraksha ki baat karenge.... (How can PM Modi talk about the country's security when he can't even answer for the five years of BJP rule)," he said.

"Modi ji jab aapne pant-pyjama pehen'na nahi seekha tha tab Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru ne aur Indira Gandhi ji ne humare desh ki fauj banayi thi. (Modi ji didn't even know how to wear his pants and pyjamas when Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Indira Gandhi formed the country's army.)," Kamal Nath added.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been drawing sharp criticism from opposition leaders for his remarks that a cloud cover could actually hide Indian planes from the Pakistani radar system.

"We were weighing crucial aspects. Experts were re-thinking the (Balakot) airstrike due to bad weather, but then I said so much cloud cover and rains could be beneficial. We can escape their radar. This was my raw wisdom. I said there could be a benefit. Then I said, there's cloud cover, please go ahead," he said. PM Modi made the remarks during an interview to a TV channel.

The military escalation between India and Pakistan that followed the Balakot airstrike brought the two nations to the brink of war; the escalation took place after a suicide bombing claimed by Jaish-e-Mohammed killed dozens of Indian paramilitary soldiers in Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14.
