Male tiger found dead in Nilgiris

Udhagamandalam: A male tiger was found dead near a tribal habitat in Parson’s Valley range in the Nilgiris division on Sunday evening.

Forest watchers had found the carcass during routine patrol, assistant conservator of forests Saravanakumar said. “The animal, 12 years old, might have died a day ago.”

Veterinarians conducted postmortem on Monday in the presence of forest officials and NGOs as per the guidelines of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA). “We could not come to a conclusion on the cause of death of the big cat. It might have died due to infighting or some disease. It might have been poisoned also. We could ascertain the cause of death only after the lab report is obtained,” Saravanakumar said.

Nails and canines of the tiger was found intact, the official said.

The carcass was later burnt inside the forest area.
