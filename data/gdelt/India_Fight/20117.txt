SOTY 2 Trailer: Twitterati still root for SOTY, while Tiger, Ananya & Tara get a mixed response

The trailer of the film SOTY 2 which stars Tiger Shroff, Tara Sutaria and Ananya Panday is out. The very first scenes set the tone for the film which showcases the theme of the movie of competing students and their complicated relationships. We also get to see how the students will battle it out to win the prestigious Dignity Cup. While Tiger has major chunks in the trailer showing off his action and dancing skills, Tara and Ananya barely have scenes in the first trailer.

Tara's role appears to be of an aspirational girl, and on the other hand, Ananya comes across as a spoilt brat. The movie also has the reprised version of Kishore Kumar's Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani. Twitter users, as usual, were quick to give their reviews on the micro-blogging site. From the comments, it seems that they are not really impressed with the film.

One of the Twitter users wrote: "Student of the year was a cult classic #SOTY2Trailer. Another commented: "A heartfelt thank you to my guardians for sending me to a real school and not some circus. Kaun sa school/college aisa hota hai baba?" Check out the reactions right here:

For the unversed, the same is the sequel of Karan Johar's Student of the Year (2012). The movie also marks the debut of actresses Ananya Panday and Tara Sutaria. The film is produced by Karan, Hiroo Yash Johar and Apoorva Mehta under the Dharma Productions banner and is directed by Punit Malhotra of I Hate Luv Storys and Gori Tere Pyaar Mein fame.
