SC Blow to Tejaswi Yadav; Asks Him to Vacate Current Bungalow

Patna: The Supreme Court of India dealt a setback to senior Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejaswi Yadav on Friday as it rejected his plea to allow him to retain his government bungalow on 5 Deshratna Marg despite not being the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar any longer.

Directing Yadav, the younger son of party chief Lalu Prasad Yadav and Rabri Devi, to vacate the bungalow that was allotted to him when he was the Deputy Chief Minister of Bihar immediately, the court also ordered him to move into the bungalow that has been designated for the leader of the opposition in Bihar.

The court comprised of Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi, and Justices Deepak Gupta and Sanjeev Khanna also ordered him to pay Rs. 50,000 in fine for wasting the precious time of the court.

It may be recalled that the Nitish government had asked Tejaswi Yadav to vacate the bungalow to make room for the new Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi but the RJD leader had chosen to defy the order and instead seek Supreme Court’s intervention in the case to allow him to stay in the bungalow that, he said, had been remodeled to suit his needs.

Earlier the Patna High Court had refused to listen to Yadav’s plea that led him to knock the door of the Supreme Court.

Reacting to the Supreme Court ruling, Yadav said he respected the highest court’s order and will start making arrangement to move into the bungalow allocated for the leader of the opposition in Bihar.
