Fat paycheque to Michael Madsen for Anushka Shetty’s Silence?

After scoring the first blockbuster of 2018 with the horror-thriller ‘Bhaagamathie’, Anushka Shetty took her time and recently signed another thriller opposite pan-Indian actor Madhavan . Titled ‘Silence’, the big-budget project is touted to be a silent film featuring acclaimed actors and technicians. Written and co-produced by Kona Venkat, the crossover film will be majorly shot in the United States and the hunt for locations is currently going on. While the makers earlier announced that a few Hollywood actors would be a part of this bilingual project, turns out that they are talks with ‘Kill Bill’ star Michael Madsen . According to a report, the makers of ‘Silence’ have reportedly decided to shell out Rs 3 crore to bring the 61-year-old talented actor on board. Though Michael is quite excited after listening to the storyline, he is yet to sign on the dotted line. ‘Vastadu Naa Raju’ fame Hemant Madhukar will be directing the film.Apparently, Anushka has lost oodles of weight for ‘Silence’ after undergoing an intense weight-loss program in Austria. The 37-year-old actress has recently attended SS Rajamouli’s son wedding in Jaipur and had a gala time with her Baahubali co-star Prabhas . Along with the lead cast, ‘Silence’ stars Anjali, Shalini Pandey and Subbaraju in pivotal roles.
