Brain-dead student’s organs benefit three in Pune

PUNE: The vital organs of a brain-dead student from Yerawada gave a new lease of life to three persons, including a 65-year-old professor, suffering from end-stage heart, liver, pancreas and kidney diseases on Wednesday.The student had suffered severe head injuries in an accident in Vishrantwadi on September 15. He was rushed to the Sahyadri hospital ’s Ahmednagar Road branch and could not be revived despite all efforts. He was declared brain-dead on September 17, following which his parents decided to donate his vital organs, including heart, liver, pancreas and kidneys, which were harvested and brought to the Sahyadri hospital’s Deccan branch for transplant around 6.25am on Wednesday.“His heart was successfully transplanted into a forensic medicine professor from Kothrud. The surgery took two hours,” heart transplant surgeon Manoj Durairaj said, adding that a completely in-house team of surgeons, cardiologists and anaesthetists performed the complex surgery.The hospital’s liver and multi-organ transplant surgeon, Bipin Vibute, said, “The student’s pancreas and one kidney were successfully transplanted into a 55-year-old patient from Chennai, who was suffering from kidney and pancreas failure due to prolonged type-II diabetes for 20 years. His another kidney and liver gave a new lease of life to a 32-year-old IT professional from Karad who had been suffering from end-stage liver and kidney diseases.”“This is the first time that we performed transplants of five donated organs simultaneously on three different patients at our two hospital branches,” medical expert Ketan Apte, head of the Sahyadri hospital’s Deccan branch, said.He emphasized on the role played by the members of the Zonal Transplant Coordination Committee (ZTCC) and the traffic police for the success of the transplants. “We would also like to salute the student’s family members and relatives who donated the organs to help the needy.”Medical social worker Sharmila Padhye and transplant coordinators Rahul Tambe, Arun Ashokan and Aman Bele counselled the brain-dead student’s relatives for the organ donation. The donor’s parents are small-time workers and the student used to work as an autorickshaw driver in free time to eke out a living.Multi-organ transplant surgeon Senthil Kumar and anaesthetists Dinesh Babu were among those who played a key role in the surgeries.
