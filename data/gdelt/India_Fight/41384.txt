The Indian Army gave a befitting reply to the unprovoked firing by Pakistan forces.

This comes after Pakistan test-fired surface to surface ballistic missile Ghaznavi, which is capable of delivering multiple types of warheads up to 290 kilometers.

Pakistan has also adopted a high-pitched vitriolic diatribe against India ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led government abrogated Article 370 and Article 35A from Jammu and Kashmir which ended the state's special status.

Also, there has been a surge in the ceasefire violations from Pakistan after the decision to revoke the special status of J&K.
