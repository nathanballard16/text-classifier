Christopher Nolan shoots for ‘Tenet’ near Gateway of India

The Oscar-nominated filmmaker and actor Robert Pattinson are in Mumbai for close to 10 days

Hollywood director Christopher Nolan has started shooting for his next spy epic Tenet in Mumbai near the Gateway of India.

Several onlookers glimpsed many boats arranged near the Gateway of India, ready for a sequence to be filmed. The team has shot at the Royal Bombay Yacht Club as well.

The director of films such as Interstellar, Inception and the Dark Knight trilogy landed in Mumbai on Saturday along with actor Robert Pattinson, who stars in the movie.

Nolan was spotted at the airport, while some of the other cast and crew also obliged fans for pictures and autographs. The Tenet team is expected to spend around two weeks in India, before flying out for their next schedule.

Very little has been revealed about the film except that it is an action epic revolving around the world of international espionage with a sci-fi twist, and will be shot in around seven countries globally.

Tenet is also rumored to involve the time continuum. It has a cast of several A-listers such as Robert Pattinson, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Kenneth Branagh, Clémence Poésy, Elizabeth Debicki and Michael Caine. Indian veteran actor Dimple Kapadia also plays a role in the film that is set to release on on July 17, 2020. Nolan is directing the film from his own screenplay.
