New Delhi: The Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the violence in Uttar Pradesh's Bulandshahr that took place on 3 December 2018 on Saturday filed a chargesheet against 38 people, charging 5 of them with murder. The charge-sheet includes the name of Bajrang Dal leader Yogesh Raj, Vishva Hindu Parishad (VHP) leader Upendra Raghav and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Shikhar Agarwal.

The SIT charged Prashant Natt, Rahul, David, Johny, and Lokendra for the murder of inspector Subodh Kumar Singh of Syana police station while the rest, including the right-wing leaders, were charged for attempt to murder, inciting violence, arson, damaging public property. The investigation is still underway in the case.

The Bulandshahr violence took place last year after some locals approached the police alleging that they had found around 40 cow carcasses in an open field. As soon as the reports of the carcasses spread, an angry mob tried to block the Bulandshahar-Garhmukteshwar road. Inspector Kumar was at the spot trying to pacify the villagers but the attempt went in vain.

When the police tried to remove the mob forcefully, a clash ensued with the crowd resorting pelting stones. It was during this clash that Inspector Kumar sustained injuries and died. A local youth identified as Sumit also sustained bullet injury in the violence and died on way to the hospital.

During the investigation, more than a dozen people were arrested, including an Army jawan Jeetu Fauji, who was suspected of firing the shot that killed Inspector Kumar.

After the violence, UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath faced criticism for the law and order in the state and focusing on cow slaughter rather than arresting the accused in the violence.
