Shilpa Shetty On Her Bollywood Comeback

Earlier when the actress was quizzed about her comeback in her interview, the actress had replied, "When was I gone? I am doing TV, brand endorsements. Out of the five scripts which came to me, I read three and I didn't like them. I hope I like the rest two... "It should be worthwhile, to leave the house going for work, to leave my baby. I really want to make a movie, very soon. Let's hope there is somebody out there who gives me a role enticing enough". With the latest film announcement, it looks like our wait is finally over.
