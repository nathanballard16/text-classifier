Murshidabad: The political clashes in West Bengal denies to die down soon as another incident of violence has been reported in the state’s Murshidabad district.

Two TMC workers were reportedly killed after some unidentified people hurled a bomb at their residence in West Bengal's Murshidabad district on Friday night.

The deceased, identified as Khairuddin (55) and Sohel (19) were from the same family. Khairuddin's son alleged that Congress was behind the attack.

"We were sleeping. Suddenly our house was bombed. They shot my father. A few days back my uncle was also killed. Congress is behind this," news agency ANI quoted Milan Sheikh as saying.

The state of West Bengal has been witnessing a surge in incidents of political violence and murders after the just-concluded Lok Sabha elections in which ruling TMC in the state displayed a dismal performance.

Last week, one TMC worker and two BJP workers were killed during clashes in North 24 Parganas' Sandeshkhali. Both parties blamed each other for the alleged murder while claiming that many of their supporters have gone missing after the violence. Besides North 24 Parganas, several other districts including Howrah, Cooch Behar, and West Burdwan were marred by violence.

Earlier, the Ministry of Home Affairs, in an advisory had expressed “deep concern” over continuing incidents of violence and asked the state government to maintain law and order.

Retorting to MHA advisory, Banerjee said that the violence was planted and that the central government and the (BJP) party cadre was trying to incite violence in West Bengal.
