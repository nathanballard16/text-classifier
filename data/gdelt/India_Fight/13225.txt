Eight persons killed, 10 injured in van-bus collision

Overloading of the van said to be a contributing factor

Eight persons were killed when a mini van in which they were travelling collided with a Telangana State Road Transport Corporation bus at Mall, nearly 60 km from Nalgonda town, on the Nagarjunasagar road on Wednesday.

The exact reason for the accident was yet to be ascertained but the Kondamallepally police, after preliminary probe, said the mini van driver lost control after one of its tyres burst. There were 16 passengers on board the seven-seater mini van.

It was carrying passengers from Mall to Kondamallepally, which was 40 km away, when the accident occurred around 1.30 p.m. “It is suspected that the driver lost control as the tyre burst; overloading of the van too is said to be a contributing factor to the accident,” the police said.

The van collided with the Hyderabad-bound bus near Chennaram village. Residents of the village had to struggle to take out the bodies from the mangled van. Death was instant for seven victims. Another died on the way to hospital.

Six victims were identified as Eddeti Narayana Rao, 54, an employee in the irrigation department in Mahabubnagar district, Baikani Govardhan, 27, of Mallareddypalli village, Akula Srinath, 22, of Hyderabad, Peddipally Ramulamma, 45, of Nelvapally village, Nelam Venkateswarlu, 55, of Chintapally and K. Mahesh, 32, driver of the vehicle hailing from Chandur.

The injured persons were shifted to the Devarakonda hospital. Minister for Education G. Jagadish Reddy reviewed the situation with district officials.
