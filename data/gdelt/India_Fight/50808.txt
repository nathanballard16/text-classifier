CM Punjab terms Indian SC’s decision regarding Babri Mosque as murder of justice

Punjab Chief Minister, Sardar Usman Ahmad Khan Buzdar has termed the decision of Indian Supreme court regarding Babri Mosque as murder of justice, saying it is tantamount to sprinkling salt on the wounds of Muslims.

In a statement in Lahore on Saturday, he said it is proven with the today’s verdict of the Indian apex court that there is no place for Muslims in India.

He said that the decision has hurt the sentiments of the Muslims and it has been given under the duress and pressure of the Modi government and Hindu hardliners.
