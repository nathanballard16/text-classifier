Duo held at illegal gutkha unit denied bail

VADODARA: Two persons who were arrested in a GST raid at an illegal gutkha manufacturing unit in Halol were denied bail here on Wednesday.Mohammed Rafiq Chhipa and Dharmaram Bavaria were arrested by a team of central GST from Vadodara during a raid to unearth tax evasion. The duo claimed innocence on the basis that they worked at the facility as manager and a worker since past couple of months and there are no allegations that they have evaded tax.Their bail pleas were opposed by the public prosecutor who argued that the kingpin who ran the illegal unit is yet to be arrested and since there is a tax evasion to the tune of Rs 110 crore, the duo cannot be allowed bail. It was also argued that if they will be granted bail, it will affect the ongoing investigation of the case.The sessions court upheld the arguments and denied bail to both of them. The duo was not allowed earlier too by the court of chief judicial magistrate.Chhipa and Bavaria were held by the Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST) officials during the raid at the factory on January 16.
