Kareena Kapoor Khan keen to work with Saif Ali Khan on a specific story; details inside

Before being in a relationship, Saif Ali Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan worked together in two movies - LOC Kargil and Omkara. The couple started dating in the year 2008 after falling in love on the sets of Tashan. Soon after that, they gave a voiceover to the animated film, Roadside Romeo. Until now, Saif and Kareena have shared screen space in the movies namely Kurbaan, Agent Vinod and Happy Ending where the latter had a special appearance.

There were reports making the rounds that Kareena is likely to have a cameo in Saif's forthcoming film, Jawaani Jaaneman for which he extensively shot in London. But it seemed to be nothing but a mere rumour. Now as per reports in The Times of India, Bebo is keen on working with Saif but conditions are applied. A source told the daily, "Kareena is going through a lot of scripts and offers. But she is keen for that one specific story where she can romance Saif Ali Khan on the big screen. After ‘Agent Vinod’ (2012) the couple hasn’t worked together and Kareena is eager to explore their real-life chemistry on the silver screen once again."

We hope filmmakers are listening!

Currently, Kareena is busy judging the dance-based reality show, Dance India Dance Battle Of The Champions and only a few weeks are left for the grand finale. Talking about her films, the actor will next be seen in Good Newwz alongside Akshay Kumar, Diljit Dosanjh and Kiara Advani. The film is releasing on December 27, 2019.
