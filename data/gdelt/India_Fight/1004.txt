No end to fury, Allahabad farmers lock cattle in school

ALLAHABAD: Farmers of Bhadiwar village in Shanakargarh block, 45km from Allahabad city, locked stray cattle in a government primary school late Sunday night to protect their crops, just days after three policemen were injured in a clash with farmers who had locked stray cattle in a school in Kanpur’s Bidhnoo area.With the stray animals locked inside, students were compelled to attend classes outside the school on Monday.On Sunday night, farmers from Bhadiwar chased around 50 cows and bulls from their fields and locked them up in the primary school. On seeing them, villagers from nearby villagers also took stray cattle from their fields to the school.The villagers said that they were tired of chasing away the stray cattle from their fields during the cold night. They said that the cattle often strayed to their fields because of the absence of a cow shelter.The irate villagers refused to open the school’s gates till the block education officer, police and district officials assured a temporary shelter home to accommodate the stray cattle on a piece of land owned by the gram sabha.Sub divisional magistrate DS Pathak, said, “A shelter home would be constructed to keep stray cattle from damaging the crops and people from disrupting the working of the school.”The incident happened days after the Yogi government imposed a 0.5% cess for welfare of cows.
