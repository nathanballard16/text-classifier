Jharkhand: Woman beat up by mob for suspected kidnapping

A woman was fiercely beaten by a mob and taken hostage on the suspicion of being a child lifter in Mufassil area near Akdoni village after she was found with a baby and accused of kidnapping him by the mother.



The police, who came in to rescue the woman, Lilavati Devi, also faced attacks by the mob and had the windows of their vehicle broken due to stone-pelting.



Lalitha Devi from Akdoni, went to a Union Bank of India branch in Baniyadih on Monday afternoon with her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old son and kept them waiting outside the Bank. When she came out, she noticed her boy wasn't there and caught sight of another woman who had taken her child on her lap. She suspected her of kidnapping and took her to Akdoni where the stir happened.



A team led by Naresh Kumar Haldar rushed to control the situation. Overpowered by a mob of 200 people, the police failed to bring Lilavati to safety and themselves came under attack by the angry mob.



Later a larger force led by SDPO Jitbahan Oraon and Police Officer-in-charge Ratnesh Mohan Thakur rescued the woman and brought her to the police station. Lilavati claimed that she was just playing with the child after she found him outside the Bank and repeatedly tried to explain this to the mother and the mob but no one listened to her.
