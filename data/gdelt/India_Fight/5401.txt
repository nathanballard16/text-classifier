Films like 'Ab Dilli Dur Nahi', 'Boot Polish' have been part of my inspiration says Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra

Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra says his inspiration for 'Mere Pyaare Prime Minister' includes classic that he grew up watching like, 'Ab Dilli Dur Nahi' and more.

The director interacted with media at the trailer launch of the upcoming film 'Mere Pyaare Prime Minister' on Sunday in Mumbai.

Talking about his inspiration, asked if he was inspired by the classic film, 'Ab Dilli Dur Nahi', he said, "That is one of the best film made in Indian cinema and yes, I have taken some inspiration from that film and 'Boot Polish', 'Do Aankhen Barah Haath', 'Kagaz Ke Phool'. We have grown up watching those films so obviously, they are inspirational. They are part of a collective consciousness that will come out in our work and films for the new generation."

Anjali Patil, who plays the mother of the lead child actor in the film said shooting for the film was in the slums was like living with a huge family. "By the time we were done shooting it was hard to tell who is the crew member of the film and who isn't. People living there already live like its a big family and shooting there a long while gave us the same feeling too."

Starring National award-winning actress Anjali Patil, Makarand Deshpande, Rasika Agashe, Sonia Albizuri, Atul Kulkarni and Nachiket Purnapatre.

On working with a younger costar, Om Kanojia, she added, "We didn't have any trouble getting along. Of course, we fought a lot and that was the part of it. Working with him was like having a friend, he was equal to me rather than a younger actor. And that's our relationship in the film too. Sargam and Kahnu are each other's best friends so there was no other way to do this."

Directed by Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra the film is produced by PEN and presented by PVR Pictures.

'Mere Pyaare Prime Minister' is set to release on 15th March.
