Alia Bhatt’s dilemma with dates

Alia already has films like Sadak 2, Inshallah, Takht and Brahmastra among others to film this year.

Alia, who is currently in New Delhi shooting for Rajamouli’s film RRR has finally allocated dates from her busy calendar to Masaan director Neeraj Ghaywan. Neeraj, who was already signed up by Karan Johar’s Dharma Productions to direct a film for them, has made time by the end of the year to shoot for the film based on the life of mountaineer Arunima Sinha. “It’s really going to be tough for Alia to manage her dates with her busy kitty, but she has been managing well and allocated dates immediately for Rajamouli’s RRR at a short notice and has also managed to give dates to Ghaywan for the biopic. As majority of her films are being bankrolled by Dharma Productions, it was easier for her to allot dates because the producers will know how to manage with her dates, as they are well aware of her calendar. Karan and team can also juggle the dates around for her films,” says a trade source.

Neeraj in the meantime has been busy with the second season of Sacred Games and will start prep for the Arunima Sinha biopic once he wraps up the shoot. Alia already has films like Sadak 2, Inshallah, Takht and Brahmastra among others to film this year.
