Dance India Dance 7: Karisma Kapoor reveals why ‘Jhanjhariya’ is the most memorable song of her career

The 7th season of dance reality show Dance India Dance Battle Of The Champions is one of the most loved and watched shows on TV. Hosted by Karan Wahi, DID gives a chance to professional as well as amateur Indian dancers to showcase their talent. This year, the judge panel includes the gorgeous Kareena Kapoor Khan, the talented Bosco Martis and the powerhouse Raftaar. Every now and then, Kareena’s beautiful sister Karisma Kapoor steps in as a special judge, much to the delight of fans.

During the shoot of an episode, the actress opened up about one of her most iconic songs, Jhanjhariya from the 1996 Sunil Shetty starrer Krishna. She shared, “There were two versions of this song - male and female. The male version was shot in a desert in 50 degree heat while the female version was shot over three days in Mumbai. While shooting in the desert, the cast had to dance on the sand which kept flying into our eyes making it very difficult to shoot the song.”

Karisma went on to reveal why the song is memorable for her. The actress stated, “When we started shooting for the female version, I realised I had 30 outfit changes for that one song. Every look was different with different hair and make-up. The steps were quite tough. So, Jhanjhariya was not only an iconic song but also the most memorable song of my career.”

Clearly, a lot of hard work went into the making of the song and it sure paid off. The track Jhanjhariya is and will remain one of the most iconic songs of Bollywood.
