Popular American DJ Marshmello was in India to collaborate with some Indian music composers. He also performed at VH1 Supersonic Festival that took place in Pune. While performing, Marshmello observed 2 minute silence to honour the CRPF personnel who were slain in the dastardly terror attack that took place in Pulwama district of Jammu & Kashmir. The Indian flag was projected in the background while DJ Marshmella said, “Two-minutes silence for the Indian soldiers who lost their lives in a terrorist attack."

On Thursday, February 14th, 40 CRPF soldiers were killed when a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist rammed a car loaded with 60 kg of RDX into a security convoy carrying around two thousand soldiers. It is touted to be one of the deadliest terrorist attack on an army in decades.

Later, DJ Marshmello tweeted his condolences for the families of those affected by Pulwama attack.

Audience joined the DJ in paying the tribute to the CRPF jawans who lost their lives in the terrorist attacks.

"So many artistes performed at the festival, but it was only Marshmello, who remembered the jawans. I respect him even more now," a fan told IANS.

After wrapping up the show, DJ Marshmello left India and signed off with a tweet dedicated to his Indian fans. He wrote, “My last day in India today! I’m going to miss it.”

DJ Marshmello also collaborated with Pritam Chakraborty to compose track Biba which was a tribute to Bollywood and King of Romance Shah Rukh Khan. The superstar even featured in the video with the iconic Marshmello headgear.
