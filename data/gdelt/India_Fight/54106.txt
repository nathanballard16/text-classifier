On Friday morning, India woke up to the news that all four lorry workers arrested for brutally gangraping and killing a young woman veterinarian near Hyderabad had been killed in police firing.

That happened when they tried to escape during a crime scene recreation, the police said.

Cyberbad police chief VC Sajjanar said the accused had been killed in an encounter between 3 and 6 am on Friday. He said more details would soon be revealed.

DCP Shamshabad Prakash Reddy said the accused snatched a weapon and fired at the police during the crime scene re-construction. This, Reddy said, prompted the police to fire back in self-defence, killing the four men.

Family members of the victim have expressed joy.

Her father congratulated the Telangana police and government, and said his daughter must be at peace now.
