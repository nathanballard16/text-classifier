Lucknow, August 1

After the Supreme Court rap, the BJP today finally expelled Bangarmau MLA Kuldeep Sengar from the party, the development coming after a day of guessing about the imprisoned leader’s status.

BJP spokesman Vijay Bahadur Pathak confirmed that the state leadership had expelled the MLA following instructions from the central leadership.

Speaking to a news channel, BJP state president Swatantra Dev Singh also admitted that Sengar had been expelled. The stance differed from his earlier position that “Sengar is suspended, and not expelled”.

Earlier in the day, Pathak categorically denied being aware of any decision on the expulsion. His colleague Chandra Mohan said he had “been hearing the news since morning and wondering where it was coming from”.

With the apex court coming down heavily on the state government, the BJP was probably finding it difficult to continue defending the incarcerated MLA. — TNS
