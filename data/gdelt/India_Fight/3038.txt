Mumbai Man Killed In Saudi Journalist Style, Cut Into 200 Pieces And Flushed Through Waste Pipe

When a few cleaners arrived at a Virar residential building to find out what had been blocking the establishment’s drainage system, they were not expecting 200 pieces of flesh and bones in it.

In a spine chilling incident, Pintu Sharma in his 40s killed his 58-year-old friend Ganesh Kolhatkar, after both of them got into a fiery argument. The murder took place last week in Bachraj Paradise Society, Virar in Mumbai.

According to reports, Sharma had lent Rs one lakh to Kolhatkar out of which he had only returned Rs 40,000. According to a PTI report, Dy SP Jayant Bajbale said the killing was the outcome of a dispute over financial dealings between Ganesh and Pintu.

Pintu rented a flat in the building and called Ganesh to the house on January 15. According to media reports, an argument erupted between the two over the unpaid amount following which Sharma pushed Kolhatkar and he died on the spot.

To avoid getting caught, Pintu cut his friend’s body into 200 pieces using a hexa blade over the next four days. He then pulled out the flesh and dumped them into the toilet and flushed it following which the sewage system got blocked.

Bajbale informed that the body parts were recovered on Tuesday. The police then started checking all closed flats in the building and found a closed room from where a foul smell was emanating. The accused has been arrested and booked under IPC sections related to murder and causing disappearance of evidence of offence, the police officer told PTI.

While Sharma is an investor in stock markets, Ganesh used to run his printing press business in Mira road.
