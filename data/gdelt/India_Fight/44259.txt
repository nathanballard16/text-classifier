“We were told that robbers did not find anything from Baljeet, following which they shot him in the abdomen. Baljeet called Avtar Singh in injured condition. After this, he was taken to a nearby hospital where he was declared dead,” Fumman Singh said.

Prince’s father Inderjeet Singh, a farmer, said that he came to know about the incident around 11 am on Thursday. He added that Baljeet went to the USA around one-and-a-half years ago and has two sisters.

“Our dreams are shattered. We cannot believe it. We spoke to him two days ago. We do not know when his body shall come to India,” Inderjeet Singh said.

A family member said that they had spent Rs 45 lakh on sending Baljeet to the USA. He had studied up to matric level and wanted to go abroad.
