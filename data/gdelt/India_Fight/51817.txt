Sena MPs on opposition benches, join chorus against government

NEW DELHI: Shiv Sena , one of the oldest BJP allies which severed ties with the ruling NDA over government formation in Maharashtra , played its role in the opposition benches to the hilt on Monday as Parliament opened for the winter session.In Lok Sabha, where the Sena’s sitting arrangement redrew the line between the opposition and the treasury benches, saw the 18-member contingent down in the Well several times and shouting slogans against the government demanding relief for farmers in Maharashtra and joining other opposition parties in protesting against National Conference leader and Lok Sabha MP Farooq Abdullah’s detention. The party's MPs also demanded that the government stop attacking opposition and foisting false charges against their leaders.In Rajya Sabha, where four Sena MPs had their seats re-allocated, signed up with the Opposition parties – Congress, Trianmool Congress, Left parties SP, RJD, AAP and others – to notices for short duration discussion on the slowdown in the economy. One of the notices have been given by TMC and the other by Congress. Sena’s Sanjay Raut is one of the top signatories to a discussion on “The grave economic crisis in India and how to improve the situation.” The discussion will include issues like “present economic conditions, hiding government data and disinvestment ,” said TMC leader in Rajya Sabha Derek O’Brien.Members of Sena, one of the oldest allies of BJP, raised slogans and demanded relief for farmers in Maharashtra. Later, they walked out of the Lok Sabha. In the House, Sena MPs demanded that the government declare unseasonal rains in Maharashtra as natural calamity.In the wake of differences over formation of government in Maharashtra, the Shiv Sena parted ways with BJP with its lone minister resigning from the Union Cabinet.The sitting arrangement of the Sena MPs – 18 in Lok Sabha and four in Rajya Sabha – has also been redrawn to the government to demarcate the role of the erstwhile ally in the opposition benches.Sena is hopeful of tying up with Congress and NCP to form government in Maharashtra, after having fought the polls in alliance with BJP.
