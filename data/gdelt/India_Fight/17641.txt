Katrina definitely loves beaches and more than anything else, water. And her Instagram feed is the proof. This hottie often posts pictures of herself in the bikini on some of the other beaches in the world.

Katrina is currently working with Salman Khan for Bharat directed by Ali Abbas Zafar which is all set to release on Eid this year.
