BJP using Pulwama for poll gain, says Sitaram Yechury

CPM national general secretary Sitaram Yechuri speaks to the media along with the party’s state secretary T. Veerabhadram at MB Bhavan on Wednesday.

Hyderabad: CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury alleges that the Pulwama terror attack was being utilised by the BJP to benefit in the upcoming elections.

Criticising the absence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the all-party meeting, Mr Yechury said the nation was united as far as security was concerned.

Speaking to mediapersons on Wednesday Mr Yechury said, “The entire nation has strongly condemned the terror attack in Pulwama. It is sad that the Prime Minister himself was absent in the all-party meeting when all political parties stood with the BJP to support the country. The BJP government should teach a lesson to the terrorists immediately.”

He appealed to the youth of Kashmir not to fall into the trap of terrorists. “The highest number of armed forces were killed in the tenure of this government,” Mr Yechury said.

He said that a Grand Alliance at the Centre before the general elections will be premature.

Mr Yechury said, “There are many insignificant political parties, and an alliance after the elections is a better idea. Federal Front type of alliances are seen before every election,” he said.
