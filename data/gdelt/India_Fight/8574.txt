Week After Pulwama Attack, Pakistan Bans 26/11 Mastermind Hafiz Saeed's Terror Group Jamaat-ud-Dawa

Days after the deadly Pulwama attack carried out by Jaish-e-Mohammad based in Pakistan, Hafiz Saeed’s Jamat-ut-Dawa has been banned by the country. Hafiz Saeed is the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks mastermind.

The decision was taken in the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan to review the National Action Plan in detail. He formed Jamat-ut-Dawa after Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned by the Pakistan government.

"It was decided during the meeting to accelerate action against proscribed organizations. It was further decided that Jamat-ut-Dawa and Falah-e- Insaniat Foundation be notified as proscribed organizations by the Ministry of Interior," a statement by Government of Pakistan said.

As the tensions between India and Pakistan have heightened following the terror attack in Pulwama that killed 40 CRPF personnel, Pakistan PM Imran Khan chaired a key meeting of the National Security Council (NSC) during which the country’s security situation was discussed.

The decision is a culmination of a series of events, starting from February 14, when India came down heavily on Pakistan following the attack.

Pakistan drew condemnation from across the world and India decided to withdraw the 'Most Favoured Nation' status given to Pakistan and curb trade ties.
