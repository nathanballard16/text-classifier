Darbar team to shift to Chennai soon

After the stupendous success of his last venture Petta, Superstar Rajinikanth is now doing a film called Darbar, with star director AR Murugadoss. This is the first time the duo is working together and hence, there are huge expectations on it. Nayanthara is playing the female lead in it.

The film is being shot in Mumbai from last one month. As the story is set up in the same city, the makers have decided to shoot more portions there. We now hear that the team will head to Chennai to shoot a few key sequences. The Mumbai schedule will be wrapped up by this week.

From the month end, the crew will start shooting for the next schedule in Chennai. Even Rajini is expected to take part in that schedule. Darbar is being produced by Lyca Prodictions and the music is being composed by Anirudh Ravichander.
