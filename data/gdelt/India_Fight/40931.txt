Post rains AQI improves to 'good' in Delhi

In a major relief for the people of Delhi, the air quality in the national capital improved to "good" condition this weekend as Delhi received good rainfall over the past two days.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) said in a press release that the maximum temperature in Delhi was 33.9 degrees Celsius. It is to be noted that the IMD has already issued an orange alert in Delhi for Sunday.

The rainfall in last two days has come as a respite for many in Delhi because the city was battling with poor air quality due to stubble burning in Haryana and Punjab.

Though heavy rainfall played an important role in bringing down the temperature in the city, the water level of Yamuna touched the 206.60 metre mark earlier this week, causing trouble for thousands of people living near the bank of Yamuna river.
