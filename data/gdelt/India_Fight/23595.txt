'Ransomware' hits TS, AP power utilities

Hyderabad: A malicious software has attacked the computer systems of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh State power utilities, police said Thursday.

All the servers were down, and work has begun to rectify the glitch, which would be restored perhaps by Friday, they said. 'Ransomware' has attacked the systems, police said.

It is a malicious software that enters the victim's computer system, and the attackers threaten to publish the data or block access to it unless a ransom is paid.

Following a complaint, cybercrime wing of the Hyderabad police has commenced a probe.

A staff of the Power Distribution Company of Telangana received a mail from an unknown person and the staff inadvertently clicked on it and the virus attack took over the entire systems, they said.

"We have registered an FIR and are investigating," Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (Cyber Crimes) KCS Raghu Vir said.

Along with the Telangana systems, the computer systems of power utilities in Andhra Pradesh also came under the malware attack because it is linked with each other, the official said.

Asked if the cyber attackers sought ransom, police said the investigation was at a preliminary stage and they were verifying.
