Is it true Imran Khan called PM Narendra Modi to defuse tensions? What Arun Jaitley said

Did Imran Khan really try, as he claimed in Pakistan's National Assembly, to phone Prime Minster Narendra Modi this week in an attempt to defuse tensions?

Asked about the Pakistan premier's remarks, Union Minister Arun Jaitley said he was not privy to this information.

"Even if I were", he said, "what is to be shared in such situations, in a larger national interest is shared in a particular manner by government spokespersons."

The skyrocketing tensions between nuclear-armed rivals India and Pakistan seemed to cool briefly on Friday as Pakistan released Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, an Indian Air Force officer captured during a dogfight earlier in the week.

#NobelPeacePrizeForImranKhan flooded Twitter, and a resolution calling for Imran Khan to be given the prize was submitted in Pakistan's National Assembly Secretariat.

Ties between New Delhi and Islamabad deteriorated after a terrorist attack carried out last month in Kashmir by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based terrorist group. India carried out airstrikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistani territory within two weeks.

Arun Jaitley, who was speaking at the India Today Conclave in New Delhi, was asked for his reaction to the Pakistani resolution recommending a Nobel Peace Prize for Imran Khan.

"I have absolutely no reaction to it," Jaitley said.

"When you suppress reality and live in a world without complete information, these are the inevitable consequences," he said.
