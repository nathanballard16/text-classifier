Protests erupt across state after assault on NRS doctors

The picture was same everywhere: groups of junior doctors at sit-ins with posters and banners

In Calcutta, on the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital premises, patients lay on trolleys for hours.

Thousands of patients across the state were left in the lurch as the protest of junior doctors of NRS Medical College and Hospital spread to other medical colleges and emergency wards stopped functioning.

At SSKM Hospital, relatives of patients blocked the crossing of Harish Mukherjee Road and AJC Bose Road, demanding doctors check on patients. They said they had been waiting for six hours.

At all hospitals, police officers waited and watched as senior doctors manning emergency wards refused to budge and ambulances with patients started moving out.

The picture was same everywhere: groups of junior doctors at sit-ins with posters and banners in support of the two NRS doctors injured in an attack on Monday night.

Posters had the pictures of the two, Paribaha Mukhopadhyay and Yash Tekwani.

Protesting junior doctors had images of the CT scan that showed a dent in the frontal lobe of Mukhopadhyay.

At Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital, Sohochori Mondal could hardly speak as she lay on a trolley outside the emergency ward.

Around 2.30pm, relatives accompanying her said they had been waiting for close to three hours after reaching the hospital from Chowbhaga near the Bypass.

“It was a tall order arranging for her to reach the hospital. She is more than 100 years old. We reached in the morning and after completing the formalities, we were told to visit the emergency ward,” Maya Sarkar, one of her relatives said.

“At the emergency ward, some junior doctors said she wasn’t a critical a patient. They asked us to return on Wednesday,” Sarkar said.

As Mondal lay outside the ward, junior doctors sat in rows to protest the attack on the two doctors of NRS hospital, about 2km away.
