EWS apartment residents demand immediate repairs of their houses

Surat: A number of residents of Vadod EWS housing colonies on Monday demanded immediate repairs of their dilapidated houses. The residents blocked roads going to EWS quarters at Vadod and shouted slogans against local authorities. Majority of the flats in the eight housing schemes were made for slum dwellers.

There are 60 one room kitchen flats in each building. When allotted seven years ago, out of 480 flats, only 240 were occupied. The others could not be allotted due to faulty construction. Residents of these 240 flats have been complaining of deteriorating condition of their houses for the past few months.

Municipal commissioner M Thennarasan said, “Our structural committee will look into the issue. The committee members will decide if repairs could solve the problem or new construction was needed. The issue will be finalized in a couple of days. Meanwhile, a few flat owners would be shifted to safer places immediately.”

He also said, “We have started a technical analysis of the whole project which came up seven years ago. We will also check if right quality of material was used or not. Action would be taken against people responsible for this problem.”
