This woman sarpanch kicks off anti-drug crusade

PATIALA: Sarpanch of Rohti Channa village Gurpreet Kaur had launched a crusade against the alleged drug smugglers in her village in Nabha sub-division of the district. Along with the villagers, she had conducted raids on alleged drug smugglers in her village and even nabbed the customers. Last month Gurpreet along with the villagers had staged a protest against the police for allegedly not taking action against the drug smugglers supplying drugs to the youth in their village and nearby villagers. The village panchayat also passed a resolution in this regard.“The police are hand in glove with the drug smugglers in Punjab. Most drug smugglers in our village are illiterate and they do not have any employment. The suppliers are already booked in several NDPS cases registered against them in the past two years,” said Gurpreet Kaur who was elected as the sarpanch after achieving victory in the panchayat elections held in December 2018.She was forced to stage a protest against the police after one of the villagers, a baptized Sikh, was assaulted by the alleged drug smugglers for his only fault to stop them from selling drugs to village youth.Gurpreet said she had written to Nabha SDM, Patiala SSP, Punjab DGP and even the STF team to check the drug menace but all in vain. The police, however, refuted all the allegations and claimed that police was already on job and had nabbed several accused involved in drug smuggling.
