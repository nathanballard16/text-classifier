Sony A7R IV 61MP full-frame mirrorless camera announced

A week after launching the RXO II compact camera in India for Rs 57,990, Sony has introduced the Sony A7R IV 61MP full-frame mirrorless camera. The successor to the Sony A7R III, the new mirrorless camera comes with the world’s first 35mm 61MP BSI sensor with 5-axis in-body image stabilisation. The Sony A7R IV will be available for $3,500 (approx. Rs 2,41,000).

The A7R IV features a 61MP back-illuminated CMOS image sensor with a focal length of 35mm. The sensor’s back-illuminated design will allow room for increased sensitivity and reduced noise levels. The camera also comes with a 5-axis optical in-body image stabilisation which will be able to capture images at a 5.5 step shutter speed.

The Sony camera comes with a 5.76 million dot UXGA OLED EVF viewfinder with the ability to support 120 fps and 60 fps refresh rates. The device equips an improved Pixel Shift Multi Shooting mode which can capture 240.8MP by creating 963.2MP of data from 16 full-resolution images.

Powered by the BIONZ X image processor, the Sony A7R IV is capable of shooting in full resolution of 61MP at 10 fps frame rate with continuous AF/AE tracking for seconds. The camera comes with 567 phase-detection AF points which cover 74 percent of the image area alongside real-time Eye AF for Still, Movie, Human, and Animal photography.

On the video side, the Sony A7R IV can record 4K videos with the sensor’s full width without pixel binning. It can use the Real-time Eye AF for movie shooting, meaning the camera is capable of fixing its focus point on where you’re looking. Other options include 120 fps Full HD recording, Slow motion, time-lapse and Quick motion.

For connectivity, the Sony A7R IV features a USB Type-C 3.2 Gen 1 port, dual-band WiFi and dual UHS-II memory slots. Additional features included are the tilting touchscreen display, 670 images per charge battery, weather sealing with a magnesium alloy body and battery grip for additional batteries.

The Sony A7R IV 61MP full-frame mirrorless camera will be available for $3,500 (approx. Rs 2,41,000) from September 2019.
