JeM terrorist Sajjad Khan sent to judicial custody till April 26

Patiala House Court on Friday sent Sajjad Khan, an alleged associate of Pulwama terror attack mastermind Mudassir Ahmed Khan, to judicial custody till April 26.

Additional Sessions Judge Rakesh Syal had earlier sent him to the custody of the Investigation Agency (NIA) for seven days, till March 29.

He was produced before the special court today at the end of the remand period. NIA also pressed that they do not wish to interrogate him further.

On March 22, the Special Cell of Delhi Police arrested Jaish-e-Mohammad operative Sajjad Khan near Red Fort.

"He was arrested under sections 120B and 121A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and sections 17, 18, 18A, 18B, 20, 38 and 39 of Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA)," an NIA statement said.

The statement further claimed, "In furtherance of this criminal conspiracy, Sajjad Ahmed Khan was specially sent to Delhi to set up hideouts in Delhi NCR. This was done to select specific targets and also to radicalise and recruit Muslim youths to further terror activities."

The accused is believed to be a close associate of Pulwama terror attack mastermind Mudassir Ahmed Khan who was gunned down by the security forces in an encounter in Jammu and Kashmir on March 11. Huge quantities of ammunition and automatic weapons were found during the encounter.

Forty Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel were killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama on February 14 after a JeM terrorist rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into their bus, which was a part of the convoy.
