By Abhishek SharanMurdered rationalist Dr’s son and daughter submit statement to CBIAssassinated rationalist Dr Narendra Dabholkar’s children have urged the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to expand its probe to cover the conspiracy and the conspirators behind the August 2013 murder.In a joint statement submitted to the CBI, Dabholkar’s son and daughter, Hamid and Mukta, said that while an accused in the case had referred to Amol Kale as a key conspirator and “higher authorities” on whose behest he was acting, the agency has not charge-sheeted him yet nor has any attempts been made to uncover his masters.Hamid and Mukta’s joint statement was recorded as per the instructions of the Bombay High Court, which is monitoring the Dabholkar probe and the February 2015 Govind Pansare murder case.Kale, the statement said, has allegedly prepared a list of people to be eliminated as per the orders from “higher authorities.” The statement said that while Kale was let go of after interrogation by the CBI, two more rationalists -- Govind Pansare and– have been killed in a fashion similar to the Dabholkar murder.Dr Dabholkar was shot dead by two bike-borne shooters atBridge in Pune in August 2013. The CBI, which took over the probe from the Pune police in May 2014, made its first breakthrough when it arrested the alleged mastermind Dr Virendrasinh Tawade in June 2016. Around two years later, the CBI, acting on an intimation by the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad that stumbled upon the role of Dabholkar’s alleged shooters ---Sharad Kalaskar and Sachin Andure ---while probing the Nalasopara arms haul case, arrested the duo and charge sheeted. Two suspected shooters -- Sarang Akolkar and Vinay Pawar -- who were named in the CBI’s 2016 Dabholkar charge sheet were given a clean chit.Kale and two more suspects, allegedly involved in the September 2017 Gauri Lankesh murder, were granted bail after the agency’s failure to file a charge sheet against them within the stipulated 90 days. Hamid and Mukta’s statement demands to know why Kale -- despite his alleged role in guiding the killers in collecting and disposing off the guns and bikes used in the murder – has not been named an accused in the case.The statement reads: “The charge sheets do not name any particular person as a mastermind, co-ordinating all the acts. As citizens, we feel that such large-scale activities to meet the purpose of a particular thought process cannot be carried out by a handful of persons unless there is an organisational support.” It further states: “We are sure you must have noticed that even after the arrest of Tawade on June 10, 2016, Ms Gauri Lankesh was murdered on September 5, 2017.”Hamid and Mukta have also asked as to why the testimonies of two eye-witnesses, whose details were given in the February supplementary charge sheet, were not recorded under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which they will be admissible as evidence in courts.The siblings requested intensification of probe to find out who all are part of the pan-India network that arranged for training in arms and explosives and provided vehicles to the accused. Speaking to Mumbai Mirror on Monday, Hamid said: “We have submitted our joint statement to the CBI, seeking an intensification of its probe in finding out the murder’s mastermind/s and the wider conspiracy.”The CBI, despite attempts by Mirror, did not offer a response to Hamid and his sister’s statement. Tawade, Kalaskar, Andure and Kale have denied CBI’s charges.
