Stating that Bejoy and he had been trying to join hands since the last two and half years, Harshvardhan said, “We were supposed to do a remake of ‘Agni Natchathiram’, but that didn’t happen. I am excited to work with him on our next film.”

Harshvardhan has also been signed for ad filmmaker Lloyd Baptista and Mini Films’ multi-series project, “K7 – The Story of Seven Immortals”.

He said, “It’s based on Indian mythology. It’s a modern take on Hindu Chiranjeevis. We look for international stories to make films, but I think we have a stock of stories in our own country. I am excited about the film and feeling proud that I am working on an Indian story.”
