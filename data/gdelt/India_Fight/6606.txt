The Central Reserve Police Forces (CRPF) condemned the Pulwama attacks and issued a firm warning to the terror forces by saying that it won't ‘forget and forgive’ but will ‘avenge’ the death of 40 of its jawans in one of the worst terror attacks on its troops in the state of Jammu and Kashmir.

India’s most massive force put out a tweet from its official handle saying, “We will not forget, we will not forgive.” “We salute our martyrs of Pulwama attack and stand with the families of our martyr brothers. This heinous attack will be avenged.”

Furthermore, the CRPF forces observed two minutes of silence in memory of the martyrs of the terrorist attack, reports Tribune India.

The toll crossed 40, and many more are injured.
