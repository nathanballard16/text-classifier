Pakistani army spokesman posts misleading clip

The spokesperson of Pakistani army was found peddling fake news via his Twitter account on Sunday. Asif Ghafoor, who is the Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), tweeted a video at 9.37 am which he claimed showed Indian Airforce veteran Air Marshal Denzil Keelor's "admission of Indian failure and losses" on February 27, 2019.

The video is a four-year-old clip of the Air Marshal speaking about the 1965 war with China. It is available on YouTube under the title, 'Nehru lost India the war: Air Marshal Denzil Keelor speaks about India's battle losses'.

Once it became known that video is old, Ghafoor tweeted about five hours later that the video had been "doctored".

DISINFORMATION On Feb 27, Ghafoor claimed Pak had captured two IAF pilots but later said only one, Abhinandan, was in their custody

In 2017, Pak envoy Maleeha Lodhi showed the UN a photo of ‘Indian brutality in Kashmir’, but it was from Palestine

Without offering an apology, he said, "Admission and expression were too identical to differentiate. Unintentional omission is acknowledged, especially to Indians."

On February 27, Pakistani forces attacked Indian military installations in response to India's strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammad terror camps in Balakot across the border just the day before. India had conducted counter-terror strikes in response to the February 14 Pulwama terror attack that killed more than 40 Indian paramilitary forces.

Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad, listed by United Nations as a terror oufit, claimed responsibility for the attack.
