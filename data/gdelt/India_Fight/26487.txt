US Plans to Have 355 Battle Force Ships in About 10 Years - Vice President Pence

"Actually, the request from the budget — of our budget — would give the United States Navy the resources to buy 12 new battle force ships. We'll fund 55 ships over the Future Years Defense Program, and we'll bring the United States Navy to 355 battle force ships in a little bit more than a decade", Pence said during his meeting with service members, as quoted by the White House late on Monday.
