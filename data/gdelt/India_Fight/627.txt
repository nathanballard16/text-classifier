Converting Anna movement in to political party was wrong: HS Phoolka

Senior lawyer HS Phoolka, who resigned from the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Thursday, said the turning of Anna movement into a political party wasn’t a right decision.

While addressing reporters at the Press Club of India in Delhi, Phoolka said the reason for his resignation is because he wants to re-launch an agitation similar to the Anna movement.

Phoolka stressed the need of this movement so that political parties don’t take people and their issues lightly.

Phoolka condemned the distribution of drugs during the last SGPC elections in Punjab and said that the SGPC being a religious body should be free from the hands of politically motivated people.

Phoolka said he will launch a movement in Punjab against drug abuse and will rope in like-minded people and other non-political organisations in the country that are working on social issues.

Talking about his future plans, Phoolka refused to contest SGPC and Lok Sabha elections and said he would carry on his struggle for justice to 1984 anti-Sikh riots victims.
