A 41-year-old businessman was found dead at his residence near Bashyam Circle in Rajajinagar on Sunday.

Police officials investigating the incident suspect that it is a case of murder made to look like death due to an accidental fire. They also suspect the involvement of his 15-year-old daughter and her friend, a college student, after she changed her version of events while informing the police about the incident.

The businessman Jai Kumar Jain, hails from Rajasthan and managed an apparel shop near his residence. His wife and son were attending a function in Tamil Nadu when the incident occurred.

Following a preliminary investigation, police said killers stabbed the businessman to death before setting the body ablaze in the bathroom, reported Times of India (ToI).

The body of the victim was discovered at 10:30 am on Sunday when neighbours noticed that smoke was coming from the house and called the fire control room. Police said that traces of blood were found on the floor of the bedroom and that the daughter's friend sustained burn injuries, as per Deccan Herald.

Police further added that attempts were made to destroy evidence of the crime in the house. The daughter of the businessman claimed that she left for her relative's house on Sunday morning and noticed the fire when she returned. She later stated that she returned home after a morning walk.

“We are also questioning Kumar’s daughter to know more details about the incident. We will share the information on Monday,” said N Shashikumar, deputy commissioner of police (north), speaking to ToI.
