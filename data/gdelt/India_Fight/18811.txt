Report says U.S. count shows no Pakistan F-16s shot down in Indian battle

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - All of Pakistan's F-16 combat jets are accounted for, U.S.-based Foreign Policy magazine said, citing a count by U.S. officials, contradicting an Indian air force assessment that it had shot down one of the jets in February.

India and Pakistan engaged in an aerial battle over the disputed region of Kashmir a day after Indian jets crossed over into Pakistan to attack a suspected camp of anti-India militants.
