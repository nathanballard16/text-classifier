TSPC rebel surrenders

Ranchi: A Tritiya Sammelan Prastuti Committee (TSPC) rebel identified as Mukesh Kumar Mahto surrendered before Ranchi police on Thursday. Ranchi SP (rural) Ashutosh Shekhar said Mahto carries a reward of Rs 1 lakh on his head. Shekhar said Mahto has been handed over a cheque with the reward money as per the surrender policy of the state government.“We were continuously sending messages to Mahto’s parents to urge their son, who is the only child of the family, to surrender. Due to family pressure and the lucrative provisions of surrender policy, the extremist decided to join the mainstream. He was also disgruntled with the manner in which TSPC was functioning in the state,” Shekhar said.Mahto is wanted in at least half-a-dozen cases registered with Kotwali, Sikidri and Ormanjhi police station areas in connection with murder, arson, extortion, and indiscriminate firing. He had murdered one Mahendra Karmali under Sikidri police station area in December 2014. Moreover, he had created panic by indiscriminate firing in the air to threaten workers of the Kasturba Gandhi School.TSPC is a rebel organisation active in the tri-junction of Hazaribag, Ranchi and Chatra districts.
