The slender model shares three children with Chris Hemsworth, who is best known for his role in the Thor film series.

Chris and Elsa met in early 2010 and married shortly after in December that year.

The couple have a daughter, six-year-old India, and twin sons Tristan and Sasha, four.

In a recent interview with Hola's USA magazine, Elsa revealed that her three children don't realise their parents are famous.

Elsa told the magazine in February that the kids think 'that their parents maybe appear in movies or on TV every once in a while, and for them it's the most normal thing in the world.'

She added: 'They think their parents are like the other parents, and that's what I think they have to think all their lives.'
