Pranay’s widow delivers baby boy

Family in mixed emotions

Amruthavarshini, widow of Perumalla Pranay Kumar, the Dalit man who was hacked to death in the inter-caste marriage killing in Miryalaguda in September 2018, delivered a baby boy on Wednesday evening.

“Today is also their first wedding anniversary, and it is a boy. But we are all in tears, in mixed emotions right now,” a family member told The Hindu over phone.

Sources said Amrutha was shifted to Hyderabad by the Nalgonda police last month after assessing threats to her in the small town. Her pre-natal care was continued at an undisclosed private hospital.

Pranay and Amrutha, classmates from school loved each other, and last year when they were 23 and 21, they had left Miryalaguda and got married at the Arya Samaj in Hyderabad on January 30 — much against the wishes of the girl’s father. Pranay was killed in the fifth attempt in a conspiracy hatched by Amrutha’s father T. Maruthi Rao, on September 14, when the couple was leaving a hospital after pre-natal checkups.
