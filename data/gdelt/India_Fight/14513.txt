Abhinandan ki photo choti aur Modi ki badi. This is BJP's politics: Kapil Sibal

Congress MP and senior lawyer Kapil Sibal on Tuesday asked why Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been taking credit for airstrike carried out by the Indian Air Force in Balakot, Pakistan.

"This government has always tried to divide India. IAF went across the border to attack terrorist camp but Modi took credit. Wing Commander Abhinandan ki photo choti aur Modiji ki badi. This is BJP's politics," Sibal said during the Aaj Tak suraksha summit here.

Earlier, Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had said questioning the armed forces and demoralising them was equivalent to anti-nationalism.

The union minister, when asked to define anti-nationalism, said, "When you start questioning the armed forces, demoralise them, that is anti-nationalism."

Hitting out at the Centre, Kapil Sibal added that a strong leader should keep its people together, "unlike Prime Minister Modi". "Had this government been strong, it would have taken people into confidence," the MP said.

Kapil Sabil added, "We need to put security of the country first and not mix it with politics." He said everyone needs to understand that blood isn't of BJP or that of Congress.

On BJP leaders slamming those questioning the government over airstrike, Kapil said, "If asking questions is anti-national, then, I am an anti-national."

He said it was the BJP leaders who claimed that over 300 soldiers have been killed. "How did party leaders know about the figure when they are not part of the government? This is why we have been asking for evidence," Kapil Sibal said.

He said the Congress stands with the army, but alleged that the BJP has been politicising the issue.
