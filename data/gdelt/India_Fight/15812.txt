"Unki (Prime Minister) marzi apne naam ke aage kya lagaen. Mujhe ek kisan bhai ne kaha ki 'dekhiye chowkidaar toh ameeron ke hotey hain, hum kisan toh apney khud chowkidaar hotey hain ("It is up to him what prefix he uses in his name. Yesterday I met a group of farmers. One of them told me, chowkidars are for the rich. We farmers are our own chowkidars)," she said.

Citing BJP's promises which have remained "unfulfilled", she asked: "Have two crore jobs been given...has our prime minister ever come here...he has been travelling all over the world." "They think that by misleading you all they will remain in power. All institutions are being destroyed...the country cannot run like this...," she said. "I could have also sat at home. I have come out as the country is in danger, the country's Constitution is in danger...so vote wisely," Priyanka said.

"We have the intention, not 'jumley' (rhetoric) and we worked and showed it in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan on loan waiver promise," she said and asserted that "my brother Rahul Gandhi does what he says".

Priyanka, who kicked off the Lok Sabha election campaign with her three-day visit to eastern Uttar Pradesh, will cover a distance of 100 km by boat in Ganga from Allahabad to Varanasi, the parliamentary constituency of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and will also visit several temples while literally testing the political waters in UP where the Congress has been in wilderness for nearly three decades.
