Unnao Rape Case: CBI Raids Multiple Locations Including Kuldeep Singh Sengar’s Residence

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has carried out raids at the residence of the expelled Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Kuldeep Singh Sengar and the other accused in connection with the Unnao rape survivor's accident case, reports Times of India.

The CBI has sent its teams to at least 17 locations spread across four districts -- Lucknow, Banda, Unnao and Fatehpur.

Apart from Sengar and nine others, 15-20 unidentified persons are also booked under the murder charges by CBI in the case.

On 30 July, the rape survivor met with an accident as the car she was travelling in was smashed by an over-speeding truck. While the rape survivor and her lawyer were critically injured in the accident, two of the survivor's aunts were killed on the spot.

The victim has accused Sengar of raping her in his residence on 4 June 2017, while the former had gone to the MLA seeking his help to get herself get a job.

The Supreme Court recently shifted the cases related to the incident out of the state, to Delhi, and asked CBI to finish investigation in the road accident within 15 days.
