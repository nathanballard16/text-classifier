Heart-wrenching to see India's treatment of Kashmiris: AJK minister

Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Minister Tariq Farooq says his heart bleeds for the way the people of occupied Kashmir are being treated by New Delhi."My heart reaches out to the young minds booked under bogus charges," he said while speaking to the media in Muzaffarabad on Wednesday.He called upon the federal government to give free admissions and accommodation facilities in varsities to students of the held valley because they "were being stopped from getting an education"."People are being thrashed and humiliated with their belongings vandalised by Hindu hardline mobs in different parts of India with police watching on as silent spectators," he added.Farooq said Pakistan had nothing to do with Pulwama attack.Indian media continues to whip up war hysteria since the killing of nearly three dozen Indian soldiers in a suicide attack in IoK earlier this month.Indian politicians are also giving out belligerent statements and enraging the public against Pakistan, which they allege for being behind the suicide attack.As a result, Kashmiri students in different cities of India have complained of mob attacks and discrimination.
