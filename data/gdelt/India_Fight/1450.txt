LIVE Updates: Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh convicted in journalist murder case

Why is there so much security ahead of the verdict announcement?

While Ram Rahim Singh stands accused of the murder of journalist Ram Chander Chhatrapati, he was also prosecuted for raping two of his women followers in 2017. Violence had erupted in Panchkula and Sirsa in Haryana in August 2017 following the conviction of the Dera sect head, leaving over 40 persons dead and scores of people injured.

Ram Rahim Singh is currently serving 20-year-sentence after being found guilty of rape and criminal intimidation of the two female disciples at his sect headquarters at Sirsa in Haryana.

Hence, as a preventive measure, elaborate security arrangements have been made in Haryana especially in Panchkula, Sirsa (headquarter of Dera Sacha Sauda) and Rohtak districts to deal with any law and order situation which may occur during the course of the day.
