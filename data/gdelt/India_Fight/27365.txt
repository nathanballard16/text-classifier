Blaming senior congress-leaders for projection of sons overlooks about himself

Pre-scripted drama of resignation-rejection of Rahul Gandhi by CWC

Dear Editor

It refers to post-poll meeting of Congress Working Committee CWC held in New Delhi on 25.05.2019 where happenings were on expected lines that Rahul Gandhi owning responsibility of big poll-defeat would offer to resign to be subsequently rejected by CWC.

It was despite the fact that Rahul Gandhi himself admitted his big fault by succumbing to pressures of its three senior leaders Ashok Gehlot, Kamalnath and P Chidambram by giving their sons party-tickets. It is noteworthy that out of very few Congress-wins in north India, son of Kamalnath was able to win. At the same time, Rahul Gandhi overlooked his own case that he himself as Congress President was product of dynastic party-tradition.

Congress has history that its most successful Prime Minister was PV Narsimharao who was perhaps the only rare example to run a minority government for full five-year term but was insulted after his death by not allowing his dead body to enter Congress headquarters. Everyone knows that Bharast Ratna Pranab Mukerji despite being the most capable Prime Ministerial candidate, was not crowned on the post because party-owner Nehru-Gandhi family did not trust him to be a loyal to the great political family of India. Even Sardar Patel who was not given due respect by his own party, was honoured adequately by BJP.

Rahul Gandhi can only be replaced practically as Congress President only if either Priyanka Gandhi accepts the responsibility or her son become age-wise eligible to hold the post.
