Key accused in Bodh Gaya blast case arrested

Kolkata: The Special Task Force (STF) of Kolkata Police arrested Saturday an alleged operative of terror outfit Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), said to be directly involved in last year’s Bodh Gaya blast, an officer said, Sunday.

Ariful Islam, 22, a resident of Panpara village in Assam’s Barpeta, was apparently plotting a conspiracy for securing the escape of Kausar – one of the key accused in Burdwan’s Khagragarh blast case of 2014 – from the Presidency Correctional Home (as jails are called in West Bengal). Islam was taken into custody from the Babughat area here.

According to the police officer, Islam was in contact with senior members of the JMB including Kausar, Kalu, Adil, Hassan alias Umar, Paigambar, Kader Gazi and others.

“In January 2018, he, along with Adil, Hassan, Chota Kareem and Kausar, had been to Bodh Gaya in Bihar… they conducted a recce, planted explosives and were directly involved in the Bodh Gaya blast,” the officer stated.

Two crude bombs were recovered near the Mahabodhi temple in Bodh Gaya district where Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, was camping at that time.

According to district officials, a low intensity bomb blast had taken place near the site where the two crude bombs were found. After the Bodh Gaya blast, Islam fled to Bangalore.

“Islam had come to Kolkata for ‘some specific work’ regarding preparations for a plot to secure escape of Kausar from custody on way to court from jail,” the officer said. Some papers, including a map of Kolkata, have been seized from him.

Charges under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, waging war against the Indian government and conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code and under the Explosive Substances Act have been slapped against Islam.
