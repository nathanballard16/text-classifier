“Those Who Cannot Win Wars Against Us Are Trying To Break Our Unity,” Modi’s Veiled Attack On Pak

The Prime Minister made the statement at a day when Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh officialy became Union Territories.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Thursday, indirectly slammed Pakistan and said that those who cannot win wars against India are attempting to destroy the country’s unity, by fuelling separatism and terrorism. PM was addressing a gathering in Gujarat’s Kevadia during the celebration of 144birth anniversary of India’s first home minister Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel. “They try to break our unity and try to groom separatism. Our unity is being challenged. They forget that no one could defeat this unity,” Modi said.
