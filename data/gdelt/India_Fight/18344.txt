Health Care, Brexit, Joe Biden: Your Tuesday Evening Briefing

1. Health care is off the table, but in Democrats’ war chest. Above, Democrats at a health care rally at the Supreme Court on Tuesday.

President Trump announced that Republicans would drop efforts to overhaul health care until after the 2020 election. The move, set in motion by the usually sharp strategist Mitch McConnell, ensures the issue will be central in the campaigning. (Note: A new study found that Americans borrowed $88 billion to pay for health care last year.)

Mr. Trump also had words for Puerto Rico. He cast its leaders as “incompetent and corrupt,” increasing partisan tensions over aid bills blocked in Congress. Democrats object to the limits on aid to the U.S. territory, while Republicans insist on more aid for Midwest farmers.
