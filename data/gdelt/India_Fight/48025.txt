Kamlesh Tiwari, leader of the Hindu Samaj Party and former member of the Hindu Mahasabha, was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the Naka area of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh.

Initial reports suggested that Tiwari's death was caused by a gunshot. The doctors, however, said that his throat had been slit with a sharp weapon. He succumbed to injuries during the treatment.

According to reports, the attackers entered his office on Friday on the pretext of handing over a gift. They opened fire on him and fled from the scene.

Tiwari was in the news recently for giving a controversial remark on Prophet Mohammad. Police have also recovered a revolver from the site.
