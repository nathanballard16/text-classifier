This is the distressing moment an injured antelope gets buried alive after the Indian government ordered them to be killed.

The government ordered 300 nilgai to be shot to death by local hunters.

Farmers in Bihar, India, complained that nilgai antelope were damaging their crops so they ordered for 300 of them to be shot to death by local hunters

However, one of the antelopes didn't die so the hunters decided to bury it alive after dragging it into a hole.

Footage shows the injured antelope unable to move or resist the actions of the hunters as soil is poured on top of it.

It stands still looking stunned as hunters use a JCB to cover its body in more and more soil.

Just the antelope's head is left peeking out of the soil before the hunters finally cover it completely.

Once the nilgai has been completely covered, a bit of movement can be seen coming from beneath the layers of dirt before it becomes still.
