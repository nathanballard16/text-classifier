The court of the additional chief judicial magistrate, Manoj Kumar, noted the contention of lawyers for the arrested that they did not have criminal history. Satendra Bhati, advocate for an arrested person, told TOI the court had asked for criminal histories. “They do not have criminal history. Arrest under sections 60/63 of Excise Act should have been restricted to owners and party organisers.”District magistrate B N Singh told TOI one person was granted eight-hours of parole on Saturday as his grandmother passed away.
