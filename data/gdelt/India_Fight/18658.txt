Political agenda: Top economists lay out agenda for the first 100 days of next government

Top economists, on Thursday, laid out political and economic agenda for the first 100 days of the next government as the political parties gear up for the big battle with their election manifesto.While former RBI governor Bimal Jalan said political reforms should be the priority of the new government, Columbia University economist Arvind Panagariya said economic reforms is the need of the hour if India wants to grow at double-digit. Jalan and Panagariya were speaking at the annual session of the Confederation of Indian Industry on the agenda for the new government."The new government should look at the enormous political powers and the vested interest of its ministers who should be made accountable for all the policies and schemes announced," Jalan said adding that political reforms are needed if India wants to release it's full growth potential.According to Jalan, the union cabinet has become a for a approval authority and there seems to be erosion of collective responsibility of the Cabinet."Besides, new government should ensure that implementation of policies should lie with autonomous institutions with separation of power between ministers and civil servants," Jalan said questioning the political role of the government in the economy.Jalan is of the view that amendment of the anti-defection law as well as transparent policy for funding of state elections should be other key political reforms for the new government.However, Arvind Panagariya, the former vice chairman of NITI Aayog , said focus should be on economic reforms, major being trade liberalisation, cheaper land acquisition, privatisation of banks, reforms of higher education and privatisation in general, beginning with privatisation of Air India "The new government should bring down tariffs and rationalise them at 7%, bring down the enormously high land acquisition cost for faster infrastructure development in the country and bring about reform in the labour markets which has been a long standing problem in India," Panagariya said.Commenting on privatisation, Panagariya said government should distance itself from banks as well as other enterprises where there is no public purpose and Air India is telling first entity whose privatisation should come to the forefront in the new government.According to Panagariya, educational reforms should be another high priority of the government that comes to power. "The University Grants Commission should be abolished and replaced by the higher education commission empowered to give degrees as against the existing inefficient system," he added.
