KARACHI: At least three people were killed and two sustained injuries due to firing during a scuffle at a toll plaza at Super Highway in Karachi. According to reports, the staff at a toll plaza near Kathore More Link Road stopped overloaded trucks and trawlers, resulting first in an altercation between drivers and toll plaza officials followed by a scuffle.



During this brawl, some unidentified men opened fire which severely injured five people, who were shifted to Jinnah Hospital. Three of the injured later succumbed to their wounds. After this violence, truck drivers started a protest and blocked both sides of M-9.



Due to this protest, the traffic between Karachi and Hyderabad remained suspended for around 10 hours, causing great inconvenience and difficulties for commuters particularly the elderly, the sick and women and children.



Police tried to hold talks with the protestors but after their failure they used tear gas and baton-charging to disperse the protestors who also pelted the police with stones.
