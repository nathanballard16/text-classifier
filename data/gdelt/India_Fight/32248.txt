Shraddha preps for Bollywood film after Saaho's shoot in Austria

Bollywood actress Shraddha Kapoor has her hands full with several exciting, big budget films. After wrapping up a long schedule in Dubai for her upcoming dance film, Street Dancer 3D, Shraddha is currently shooting for Saaho in Austria.

In Austria, Shraddha is canning a song and mini action sequences along with Prabhas. And after wrapping up each day’s shoot for Saaho, she’s rehearsing for Street Dancer 3D’s climax sequence in her hotel room.

Apparently, Street Dancer 3D’s choreographer is accompanying Shraddha in Austria and is helping her learn the moves. Shraddha will be wrapping up Saaho’s shoot today and she will return to India to kick-start Street Dancer 3D’s climax shoot on the 29th of June.
