AAP continues attack on BJP over power subsidy

What is the ‘secret deal’ between BJP leaders and electricity companies, asks MP

The Aam Aadmi Party on Tuesday continued its attack on the BJP over a statement by its MP Vijay Goel who, during a recent interview, said that the BJP would end Delhi’s electricity subsidy if it comes to power. AAP MP Sanjay Singh wrote a letter to Union Minister Prakash Javadekar and asked what was the “secret deal” between BJP leaders and electricity companies.

“Why does the BJP want to end the decision to provide up to 200 units of free electricity in Delhi? Why do you want to end the relief given to the people of Delhi by eliminating half price rebate up to 400 units?” Mr. Singh asked. “Please make public the secret deal between the leaders of the BJP and the power companies,” he said.

Mr. Singh also asked the Minister whether the BJP will end the relief, which the people are getting and “increase” electricity rates in Delhi like other BJP-ruled States. “If not, then when will the electricity be free up to 200 units in BJP ruled States?” he asked.
