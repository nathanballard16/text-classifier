Bullet-riddled bodies of a man and a woman, who were supposed to get married soon, were recovered from Ghaziabad on Monday morning, police said.

The GT Road Kotwali police recovered the bodies in Sai Upvan near Hindon river. An investigation is on to probe multiple angles, including whether the couple committed suicide or somebody else killed them, a police officer said.

Police could not recover any weapon from the spot which creates suspicion that a third person might have shot them, the officer said.
