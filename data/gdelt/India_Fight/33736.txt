They joined the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) in the presence of its chief Poonam Mahajan and national media in-charge Anil Baluni at its head office here.

Youths from family members of BJP members who were killed during violence in Jammu and Kashmir, West Bengal and Kerala also joined the party.

Mahajan said the youth wing aims at reaching out to 60 per cent youth across the country to motivate them to join the party.

The BJYM chief had initiated the party's membership drive from Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), which is considered as a stronghold of Left party student organisations.

Describing JNU as 'Ganga' of the country, she said India's integrity is safe under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The membership campaign is needed because the party wants to take along every common manas it believes in a democratic system, Mahajan said.

She added that similar events will also be held on other campuses across the country till August 11 to reach out to maximum students.
