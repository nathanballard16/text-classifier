Not kept in loop, Ghaziabad SHO says on raid by Noida cops

NOIDA: The SHO of Khoda police station in Ghaziabad has said he had no information that a group of cops from Noida’s Sector 20 police station had raided the house of a property dealer on Saturday on the suspicion that he kept a gun illegally.The response comes a day after Navin Prajapati, a Khoda resident, alleged that he had paid Rs 2.5 lakh to the cops who threatened to frame him in an Arms Act case. He was picked up along with his friend Ramu on Saturday.However, a day after he levelled the allegations in a video, Navin and his father went incommunicado. Navin’s wife Anu told TOI that the allegation that the cops had demanded Rs 3.5 lakh was true and that her husband had paid Rs 2.5 lakh to them. “They have not informed me where they were going. I don’t know,” she said.Noida police have said the raid was conducted after receiving a tip-off from a Ghaziabad-based chain snatcher, Saurabh, that Navin and Ramu were in possession of an illegal pistol.Sandeep Singh, the SHO of Khoda police station, said he had no knowledge of any raid by Noida police. “I don’t know anything about this. We were not informed,” he said.Noida police chief Vaibhav Krishna claimed his force was not at fault.“His friend had misled him into making the video (in which Navin makes the allegations) so that police come on the backfoot. Police are nowhere at fault,” he said.
