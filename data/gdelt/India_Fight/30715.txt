Vadodara: 36 vehicles detained for risking children’s lives

VADODARA: The traffic police conducted a drive against the vans, rickshaws and buses carrying schoolchildren on Tuesday and detained 31 vehicles from different areas.The crackdown came a day after three school children fell off from an overloaded van in Nikol area of Ahmedabad. While one of the students suffered injuries in the accident, it yet again exposed the complete disregard for safety of school kids by vehicles ferrying them.“We conducted a drive to crack down on the school buses, vans and autos flouting safety norms in the city. During the drive, we found several vehicles that were not meeting the norms. Thirty of vehicles were detained and we will also seek reply from the schools,” said Amita Vanani, assistant commissioner of police (traffic).Interestingly, the police for the first time detained six school buses three of which belonged to reputed schools.Rickshaws and vans were detained as the number of students travelling in them were more than permitted. Some of the autos and vans were modified without necessary permissions and gas kit they used were also not standardized.“We also sent the police inspectors and sub-inspectors of every area to the schools in their jurisdiction. The school principals were given a copy of the notification that states all the safety norms that have to be followed by the vehicles. The schools too are responsibility for the safety of their children,” Vanani told TOI.“Driver of one detained school bus wasn’t even carrying his license,” she added. The cops have also been asked to collect details of the vehicles that ferry schoolkids and how many kids each vehicle carries. From Wednesday, police teams will visit every school and inspect the vehicles ferrying the kids. “We are also issuing a separate notice to the school principals and asking them why action shouldn’t be taken against them for lack of the students’ safety,” Vanani said.
