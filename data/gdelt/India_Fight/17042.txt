Four persons awarded life for murder

Members of Maoist Communist Centre killed Thali panchayat union chairman in 2002

A special court in Poonamallee on Tuesday convicted and sentenced four members of the Maoist Communist Centre (MCC), a banned outfit, to life imprisonment for the brutal murder of Thali panchayat union chairman Venkatesan in 2002.

Venkatesan was a member of the Communist Party of India, which was supported by the accused, when he was elected a councillor. He became the chairman in 1996.

Venkatesan shifted to the DMK and worked to strengthen the party. He began opposing the MCC and advised the public not to donate to the party. Venkatesan was cited as an accused in the murder of Murali, a member of the outfit. Due to the simmering enmity, the group once made an attempt on his life.

Brutal murder

According to prosecution, on May 8, 2002 at 9.45 a.m, 13 persons came in a jeep to the Thali bus stand and attacked Venkatesan, lobbing country-made bombs at him and others. Even after he collapsed, they continued assaulting him.

Two of the accused opened fire at him and cut his neck with a sword. They threw acid on his private parts before leaving. Venkatesan was declared brought dead at Government Hospital, Hosur.

At the conclusion of trial on Tuesday, the special judge P.Chenthoorpandi pronounced the judgement. N.Vijayaraj, Special Public Prosecutor told The Hindu, “Over 15 persons were cited as accused in the brutal murder case. During the trial, three of them were murdered and the remaining were tried for offences including murder, criminal conspiracy.
