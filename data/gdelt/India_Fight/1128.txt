Leopard Captured After String of Deadly Attacks in India

On January 7, the leopard was located by authorities hiding in a farm and was tranquilized after a group of 150 forest officers set up eight cages with traps throughout the Pavi Jetpur forest area to catch the big cat. The cages emitted goat sounds to attract the leopard, and five shots of tranquilizers were fired at it by officials before animal went down.

The leopard was then transferred to a local rescue center. The cages will remain in the forest for the time being in case there is another leopard responsible for the attacks.

"The leopard has been sent to Pavagadh rescue center. We will now examine the pug marks and the bite marks to confirm if the same leopard had attacked all the four people. We will continue to place our cages in the forest range if there is a possibility of presence of another leopard," Divisional Forest Officer Nilesh Pandaya recently told Indian Express.

The Indian Forest Service did not immediately respond to Sputnik's request for comment.
