Hunt for 'mirchi gang' leader in Noida, Ghaziabad, Hapur

NOIDA: With multiple cases of snatching and loot plaguing Noida, Ghaziabad and Hapur, police of at least three districts are on the lookout for the notorious “mirchi gang” active across western UP. The gang is led by Ashu Jaat, who has as many as 45 cases of murder and loot lodged against him.While four members of the gang were arrested by Hapur police on Sunday, including two after an exchange of fire, Jaat remains elusive. Cops say Jaat, who is wanted for the murders of two BJP functionaries in Hapur, does not carry mobile phones with him, making it difficult to nab him, and keeps switching places between Greater Noida, Ghaziabad, Hapur and Meerut.Originally from Kazipura, Jaat managed to give cops a slip twice. “Both he and his wife don’t keep phones with them. His wife Poonam belongs to Dhaulana due to which his movement has been traced here multiple times,” said Yeshveer Singh, SP (City), Hapur.
