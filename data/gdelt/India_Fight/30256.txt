Naga Shaurya Injured on the Sets of His Next While Performing Stunts in Vizag:- Tollywood hero Naga Shaurya has suffered injuries while shooting for a fight sequence for his upcoming film in Vizag. The mishap took place Friday evening while he was performing a risky stunt in the absence of any ropes or a body double.

The film’s team has planned an 11-day action-packed schedule in Arilova, Vizag, under KGF’s stunt coordinator Anbhariv’s supervision. While performing a parkour sequence, Shaurya jumped off a 15 feet tall building and mistimed his landing and sustained a severe injury on his left knee.

The actor was rushed to a nearby hospital, where doctors advised him 25 days rest. The Vizag schedule has been canceled and Shaurya has returned to Hyderabad on Friday night.

The film, tentatively titled Ashwathama, has Mehrene Pirzada as the leading lady. Debutant Ramana Teja is directing the film. Airtel 4G ad girl Sargun Kaur will be seen in a key role in the film. Naga Shaurya’s home banner IRA Creations is bankrolling the film.
