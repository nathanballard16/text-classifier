The body of a 16-year-old girl was found beheaded with her breasts cut and doused in acid in a suspected 'honour killing' in India.

The girl's family claim she was raped but police suspect her father handed her over to be killed.

Hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets after her body was found on Sunday, close to the family home.

The girl, who activists are calling Anjana, was found dead in the holy city of Gaya, Bihar, in northeastern India.

Her father filed a police report on January 6 claiming she went missing on December 28, NDTV reports.

However, senior police officer Rajiv Mishra says her mother and sisters told them a conflicting story.

They said she returned home on December 31 and her father sent her away with a man known to them at 10pm that night.

The Times of India reports police said they have detailed the victim's mother, father and another relative.

A post mortem will determine whether the girl was raped before she was murdered.

Protesters have held candlelight vigils on Tuesday and Wednesday and are said to be furious over the lack of arrests in the case.

India has a chilling record when it comes to sexual violence.
