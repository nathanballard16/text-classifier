A group of seven men on Sunday launched a sudden attack on a petrol bunk located at Alapakkam near Perungalathur in Chennai. It was close to 10 pm when they came riding on bikes and started attacking the people at the bunk. The staff at the bunk can be seen running away from their stations.

With makeshift masks on their faces and machetes in their hands, the men threatened employees and customers in the petrol bunk, slammed bright orange traffic cones to their faces, and kicked vehicles present there. One customer was holding on to his bike in fear, as the men hit him on the head with a traffic cone and kicked his vehicle. The entire episode was videotaped by a passerby from across the road.

(While it was initially believed to be six, a total of seven perpetrators were involved in the attack)

Speaking to TNM, an investigating officer said the problem started in the evening.

“It seems like there was tussle earlier in the day and these men were made to sit in the petrol bunk by the owner of the bunk and his son. So these men came back with friends to attack them,” he said.

According to reports, earlier in the day, one of the accused Mani and his friends, picked up a fight with Ilavarasan, a staffer at the bunk. The latter was allegedly disinterested in filling petrol and was scrolling through his phone when Mani came to the bunk. The two then got into a verbal spat, which soon became a physical tussle and other employees at the bunk too got involved.

Mani and his friends managed to leave the spot but came back a while later with weapons and more people. After the police began to search for them, all seven of the perpetrators have surrendered at the George Town court.
