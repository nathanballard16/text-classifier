Over the past few years lynching across various states have seen a rise.

In the recently concluded budget session of the Madhya Pradesh assembly, the opposition BJP’s lawmakers had condemned rising cases of lynching in the state.

Former chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and BJP lawmakers had questioned the Kamal Nath government why it brought a bill seeking punishment to those who kill in the name of cow protection, but not other lynching over other reasons.
