[ J&K: Restrictions eased for Friday prayers, strict instructions not to harass people]

Jammu and Kashmir remained on high alert though restrictions were lifted in the Valley to allow people to offer Friday prayers in local mosques. However, they won't be allowed to congregate at Srinagar's historic Jama Masjid.

The Kashmir valley has been under lockdown since Sunday midnight, a day before the government moved to divide the state into two Union Territories and also scrapped Articles that granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir. The President okayed the move soon after both houses of Parliament passed it.

The Centre is monitoring the situation and on Thursday, National Security Advisor Ajit Doval reviewed the situation in a meeting held in the Police Control Room of the J&K Police.
