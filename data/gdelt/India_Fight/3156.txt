Modi fighting political battle through enforcement agencies: Arvind Kejriwal

New Delhi: Attacking the BJP-led Central government of misusing its powers, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief Arvind Kejriwal on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi was fighting the political battle through enforcement agencies and had spared no opponent.

“Modiji is fighting political battles through enforcement agencies. From Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati in UP to Mamata Banerjee in Bengal and AAP in Delhi, Modi-Shah duo has spared no political opponent,” the Delhi Chief Minister tweeted.

His remark came in a response to a tweet by West Bengal Chief Minister Banerjee where she wondered if the BJP was desperate ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.

“From Akhilesh Yadav to Mayawatiji, nobody is spared. From north to south. From east to west. Political vendetta by BJP. Are they scared? Are they desperate?” she said.
