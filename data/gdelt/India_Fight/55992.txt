Tension in south Kolkata as police stop BJP march

Kolkata, Dec 16 : There was tension in Jadavpur area in the city's southern outskirts as BJP activists clashed with the police after the security forces stopped the party rally in support of the Citizenship Amendment Act.

The BJP activists broke a police barricade at Bagha Jatin and came to Sulekha crossing, where they were again stopped by the police.

Several BJP activists were seen jostling with the police, who chased them with batons.

BJP leader and former MP Anupam Hazra accused the police of "brutally attacking" the rallyists and baton charging even women activists.

"Ours is a peaceful procession. But look how the police are behaving. Even our women activists were not spared. Contrast this with the way they remained inactive for the last three days when a certain community carried out atrocities.

"There has not been a single arrest during the disturbances. And they have huge problems when the BJP brings out a peaceful rally. Common people of Bengal are not going to accept all these any more," he said.

"President's rule is the only option left for the people to survive," said Hazra, as the BJP activists squatted on Sulekha crossing, refusing to disperse.

The rally began from Garia and was scheduled to go to the 8B bus stand at Jadavpur, where the Jadavpur University students had planned to bring out a rally protesting against the police action on the Jamia Milia Islamia students in Delhi.

Police sources said that the BJP leaders were informed in advance that they won't be allowed to proceed up to the 8B bus terminus in view of the JU students' planned protests.
