Aligarh (UP), June 8

The police today arrested two more persons for the murder of a toddler here and confirmed that one of the men held earlier for the crime is an alleged sex offender who targeted children in recent years.

Shagufta (32) and Mehndi Hasan, the wife and the brother of Zahid, who was arrested on Tuesday, were picked up this morning by the special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the killing of the two-and-a-half-year-old girl in Tappal township.

With this, the total number of arrests has gone up to four in the case. Other than Zahid (27), the police had arrested Aslam (43) on Tuesday after the girl’s decomposed body was found in a garbage dump around 200m from her home.

The body was discovered on June 2, three days after she was reported missing. The girl’s father had alleged she was killed because he failed to repay Rs 10,000 taken as loan from the accused.

Aslam was charged under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act in 2014 and 2017, the police said. He also faced charges under the Uttar Pradesh’s Goonda Act.

The second POCSO case, in Delhi’s Gokulpuri, also involved abduction of a minor. Two separate cases of POCSO are pending against him and he had gone to jail in connection with an abduction case in Delhi, Aligarh SSP Akash Kulhari said.

Meanwhile, the Aligarh Bar Association announced that no lawyer would appear in the court on behalf of any of the accused charged with the toddler’s murder.

The SSP said the post-mortem examination found “no proof of sexual assault”. The incident has triggered massive outrage. Candlelight protests were held in Aligarh city and by AMU teachers and students. — PTI
