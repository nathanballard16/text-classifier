'Dabangg 3': Salman Khan set to be back with a bang

MUMBAI (Online): After seven years Salman Khan is set to be back in the avatar of Chulbul Pandey for the third instalment of Dabangg franchise. The first part of the film was directed by Abhinav Kashyap while Dabangg 2 was helmed by Arbaaz Khan.



Now, the third part is being directed by Prabhudheva. Apart from Salman and Arbaaz, Sonakshi Sinha will be reprising her role as Salman’s onscreen wife Rajjo. Dabangg 3 goes on floors in Indore, which is Salman and Arbaaz’s birthplace.



Talking about the same, Salman took to his Instagram page and shared a video with Arbaaz. In the video, the superstar says, "Arbaaz Khan and I have just landed in Indore where we were both born and we are going to Mandleshwar and Maheshwar to shoot for Dabangg where our grandfather was posted when he was in the police force." While Arbaaz adds, "That’s right. So, we are going to have our first day of shoot tomorrow. Dabangg 3starts tomorrow."



Salman posted the video with a caption stating, "Back in our birthplace for #Dabangg3 shoot @arbaazkhanofficial"

Talking about the antagonist in Dabangg 3, a source had stated to Mumbai Mirror, "Unlike the last two films, this one is more contemporary, as Salman’s Chulbul Pandey engages in a cat-and-mouse game with his antagonist, Kannada actor Sudeep, whose character is almost like a parallel lead with extreme dark shades."

Dabangg 3 will hit the screens in the month of December this year.
