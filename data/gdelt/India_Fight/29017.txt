RBI issues fresh circular for defaulting companies

The Reserve Bank of India issued the much-anticipated, revised circular on dealing with defaulters that retained the original spirit of its efforts to discipline borrowers and banks but sought to make the rules compliant with the Supreme Court’s observations. The central bank put the onus on lenders to act quickly to preserve the value of assets instead of waiting for directions.The original February 12, 2018, circular had tightened the screws on those who missed loan repayments and scrapped all debt recast plans in favour of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code ( IBC ). The circular had been struck down by the Supreme Court in April over banks being forced to start insolvency proceedings within a stipulated period. Instead of this, the RBI has ratcheted up provisioning norms. Under the revised rules, the longer it takes to come up with a resolution plan, the higher the amount the lender will need to set aside.The regulator also extended the rule to other entities such as nonbanking finance companies and has said that lenders will have one month to review a loan account after the borrower misses a payment and have to come up with a resolution plan within 180 days after that watch period.The one-day default rule, which had exercised banks and borrowers, stays although the language of the previous rule has been diluted with “review period” of one month replacing “shall initiate steps to cure the default.”“One-day default norm stays,” said State Bank of India deputy managing director Prashant Kumar. “An additional 30-day window has been given to review the asset.”The 180 days will start from the end of the review period. Relief may only apply to some borrowers.The new rules also distinguish between term loans and revolving credit , making it easier for the latter. The new rules are applicable for loans above Rs 2,000 crore immediately while for those between Rs1,500 crore and Rs 2,000 crore, it will take effect on January 1 next year.“Only customers availing cash credit and overdraft have got relaxation, because if there is a mismatch it can be adjusted if the default continues for more than 30 days… then we need to review it,” Kumar said. “But for any term loan, it will be a single-day default.”The regulator retains the right to direct any lender to initiate insolvency proceedings as per the law and has made provisioning norms expensive for lenders that don’t proceed immediately to resolve the default.“RBI will issue directions to banks for initiation of insolvency proceedings against borrowers for specific defaults so that the momentum towards effective resolution remains uncompromised,” the central bank said in the circular posted on its website. “It is expected that the current circular will sustain the improvements in credit culture that have been ushered in by the efforts of the government and the Reserve Bank of India so far and that it will go a long way in promoting a strong and resilient financial system in India.”Governor Shaktikanta Das had to come up with a new set of rules for banks to deal with defaults with the February 2018 circular termed ultra vires by the Supreme Court after several power sector companies challenged it. The circular had mandated banks to treat payments missed by a day as a default and initiate insolvency proceedings.Although the SC did not question the bankruptcy process, it did not find merit in RBI using a particular section (35 AA) of the Banking Regulation Act to issue blanket orders to banks to initiate bankruptcy proceedings.The new rules have been designed to ensure that these lacunae have been addressed and, at the same time, retain their effectiveness.“Lenders may decide on the resolution strategy, including the nature of the resolution plan, the approach for implementation of the plan, etc.,” RBI said. “The lenders may also choose to initiate legal proceedings for insolvency or recovery.”The latest circular clears up the contentious issue of how the RBI can direct banks to initiate insolvency proceedings on all cases where banks couldn’t come up with a resolution plan.“The revised framework has much larger room for discretion to lenders, and unlike the February 2018 circular, does not mandate referral of the borrowers en masse to insolvency resolution,” said Vinod Kothari, a resolution professional. “While the RBI has reserved the rights to refer specific borrowers to the IBC, it gives liberty to the members of the joint lenders forum to decide the resolution plan.”RBI also made it financially difficult for banks if they don’t draw up resolution plans on time. It has proposed 20% provisioning if a viable plan has not been formulated within 180 days and an additional 15% if not done in a year’s time.“Any action by lenders with an intent to conceal the actual status of accounts or evergreen the stressed accounts, will be subjected to stringent supervisory, enforcement actions as deemed appropriate by the Reserve Bank, including,’’ the RBI said.
