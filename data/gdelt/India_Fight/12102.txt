‘Cong, allies question IAF’s valour, ask proof of air strike,’ PM slams opposition at Patna rally

Now they have even started asking for proof of the air strike. Why are Congress and its allies demoralising our forces? he asked.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi today launched a thundering attack on Congress and its allies over politicisation of the India-Pakistan tensions, while addressing a public rally of NDA in Bihar’s capital Patna. Slamming the opposition parties for giving “distasteful” statements against India’s IAF Strike, Prime Minister said that while the country’s soldiers were battling enemy at the border, some within the country were giving statements capable of weakening the integrity of the nation. Prime Minister said that the questions posed by those within the country on the valor of the IAF, are being shown in the enemy country and are eliciting applause from them. “At a time when the entire nation should have stood as one and should have spoken in unison, the 21 opposition parties met to condemn the move”, Modi said.
