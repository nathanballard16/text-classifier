Kashmir's First IAS Topper, Shah Faesal Resigns Over Unabated Unrest In Kashmir, Likely To Join Politics

In a surprise move, Shah Faesal, an young Kashmiri IAS officer has announced that he is resigning from service.

In a Facebook post, the 2009 civil service topper said was resigned as a "protest against the unabated killings in Kashmir".

While he has not announced his future plans, there are rumours of him entering politics.

A tweet by former Jammu and Kashmir CM and National Conference Chief "The bureaucracy’s loss is politics’ gain," many believe is an indication of his next stop.

Faesal has hit the news headlines for various reason on the past, even for things that had nothing to do with him.

In July 2016, Faesal had threatened to resign after he was widely compared against Hizbul terrorist Burhan Wani.

"By juxtaposing my photos with the images of a slain militant commander, a section of national media has once again fallen back upon its conventional savagery that cashes on falsehoods, divides people and creates more hatred," he had then said.

Last year he hit the headlines once again after the government issued a show cause notice against him for his rape tweet.

“Patriarchy+Population+Illiteracy+Alcohol+Porn+Technology+Anarchy = Rapistan!,” Faesal had tweeted in April over a story titled “Porn addict rapes 46 year old mom, arrested in Gujarat,” he had tweeted.

He responded with another tweet.
