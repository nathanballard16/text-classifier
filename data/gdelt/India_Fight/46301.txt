Christian Birthday Celebration Attacked by Radicals in India

10/06/2019 India (International Christian Concern) – On October 2, a Christian birthday celebration was attacked by Hindu radicals in Vasalamarry village, located 40 miles outside of Hyderabad in India’s Telangana state. According to local reports, the mob of 30 radical nationalists stormed into the Christian home where guests had gathered for the birthday celebrations. The radicals vandalized decorations, terrified the guests, and destroyed several household items owned by the Christian family.

Pastor Steven was leading prayers at the birthday celebration when the mob broke into the home of one of his church members. The radicals claimed the Christians did not have permission to hold prayers and have a birthday celebration.

“They were shouting at us with filthy language about Jesus being immoral,” Pastor Steven told International Christian Concern (ICC). “They claimed that was the reason he was crucified.”

According to Pastor Steven, the radicals also told the Christians that they didn’t have the right to live in India and that they should go to Israel. The radicals then chased the Christians from the house and warned them not to hold any more prayers in the village.

The next day, October 3, the same mob went to Pastor Steven’s home and demanded he stop doing any Christian work in the village. A delegation of pastors from Yadadri Bhongir district met with district police officers on October 4 and submitted a complaint against the attackers.
