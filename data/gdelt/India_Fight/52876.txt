Heavy rainfall leads to cancellation of semester exams in Tamil Nadu

Several Universities have cancelled the semester examination which was scheduled to be held today, in the wake of heavy rainfall since Wednesday night in Kancheepuram, Vellore, Thiruvallur and Chennai districts of Tamil Nadu.

Heavy rainfall in the region has affected life, forcing the district administrations of Vellore including and Kancheepuram to declare holidays for schools and colleges. Water, after the heavy rain, had logged on roads that has led to severe traffic jams in Tambaram. Two major localities in the Chennai suburban, Tambaram and Selayur, were highly surrounded with rainwater, draining more than 100 houses in the Tambaram Municipality region.

The Meteorological Department stated, “The coastal Tamil Nadu and Puducherry will get heavy rainfall from upcoming Friday.”
