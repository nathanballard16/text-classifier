Don’t know about IAF’s Balakot airstrikes or Indo-Pak relation: Sunny Deol

Bollywood actor-turned-politician Sunny Deol, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) 2019 Lok Sabha election candidate from Punjab's Gurdaspur, said on Tuesday that he does not know much about the Balakot airstrikes carried out by the Indian Air Force (IAF). Sunny Deol admitted that he does not know much about the Balakot airstrikes or India-Pakistan relations.

The airstrikes in Pakistan's Balakot were conducted on February 27, days after Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) carried out a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama.

When Sunny Deol was asked about Balakot airstrikes during a campaign rally on Tuesday, he said that he does not know anything about "these things". "What strikes? I don't know anything about these things or India's relations with Pakistan. I only want to win and serve the country," he told a news site.

The BJP candidate also said that if he wins the Gurdaspur Lok Sabha constituency, he "maybe would have an opinion". "Right now I don't," Sunny Deol said.

Praising Narendra Modi, Sunny Deol said that the prime minister has done a "good job" in last five years.

When he was asked if he was banking on the popularity of PM Modi, Sunny Deol said that he just wants to work for the country. "If I win, I will try to do good work," he said.

Sunny Deol is pitted against sitting Congress MP and Punjab Congress President Sunil Kumar Jakhar. The BJP in the state has an alliance with the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) in Punjab. It is contesting three Lok Sabha seats (Amritsar, Gurdaspur and Hoshiarpur) while the Akali Dal is contesting the remaining 10 seats.
