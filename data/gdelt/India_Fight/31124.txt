International Yoga Day: Shilpa Shetty spills the beans on her fitness regime

There's no denying that Shilpa Shetty is one of the fittest actresses in Bollywood. She is known to be a fitness enthusiast. And yoga is a very big part of her fitness regimen. Shilpa, who started practising yoga 18 years ago, to cure cervical spondylosis, can easily be called the unofficial torchbearer of this ancient practice. In her latest interview, reportedly, the diva expressed her love for yoga and how it has changed her life.Speaking about the same, the star reportedly said that Yoga is one of the mantras that work on the ageing process. But for Shilpa, yoga is just not about ageing gracefully and she doesn’t do yoga just to look younger. She adapted it as a way of living and it makes me calm.Shilpa strongly feels that Yoga should be made a compulsory subject for kids. Yoga is a science and one must start doing it at a younger age, so when they grow up, they can put it into use and continue practising it as they get older.Recently, the diva launched ‘partner yoga’ under her newly launched 'The Shilpa Shetty app' with her sister, Shamita Shetty . And it was the first time Shamita and Shilpa did yoga together and they had a blast shooting for the programme. The actress recently took to her Instagram handle to share a video in which she is seen leading a crowd of more than 3000 people doing yoga in Surat ahead of the International Yoga Day On the professional front, Shilpa Shetty has been away from doing films for quite some time now.
