New Delhi: Like the rest of the automobile industry, clouds of gloom over the tractor industry persisted in the month of July. For the sixth time in the trot, domestic tractor sales dropped by 13 per cent last month in the calendar year 2019, according to the latest data released by Tractor and Mechanization Association. Additionally, the figures also revealed that tractor production and exports declined by 4.6 per cent and 2.5 per cent respectively in July 2019.Although, the higher-than-normal rainfall in July have compensated the 33 per cent deficit of June, but inter-state variations exists. According to corporate rating agency ICRA, the distribution hasn’t been favourable with floods in states like Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat and deficiencies in select north eastern as well as north western states."Weakness in farm sentiments led by depressed crop prices and weak rabi crop cash flows. Additionally, fears of an adverse monsoon precipitation (amid a delayed monsoon onset) and a tightened liquidity scenario have also impacted demand," Anupama Arora, Vice President & Sector Head, ICRA told ETAuto.Besides, part of the rapid slowing in fresh farm equipment purchase and consumption reflects tightness on the financing front. The auto loans available to the customers is directly proportional to the new vehicles sold and produced in the country.Both banks and non-banking finance companies (NBFCs), which are prime source of credit for this sector, took a cautious approach in lending to the end consumers post the fallout of IL&FS in September last year. This has increasingly affected the buying sentiments of farmers."Even as delinquency levels have remained under check in recent months, channel check indicates that financiers have become more prudent in lending. With NBFCs remaining the preferred financiers on account faster processing times, recent RBI (Reserve Bank of India ) rate cut unlikely to be of any material impact for the industry," Arora said. On August 7, the central bank slashed the repo rate by an unconventional 35 basis point to deal with the consumption slowdown in the economy.With the improvement in monsoon and upcoming festive season industry is expecting to see some nascent signs of green shoots from October onward. Experts, however, warn that intensifying rainfall may result in flash flooding that can damage the farm yields in certain pockets of the country."Excessive rainfall could impact the crop output in coming months. This along with limited hike in minimum support prices and benign growth environment could further delayed or dampened the buying sentiments of the farmers in the short-term," said Naveen Kumar Dubey, Research Analyst at Narnolia Financial Advisors.Source: TMA, CRISIL
