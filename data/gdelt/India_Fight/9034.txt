Mumbai, February 23

The Shiv Sena has sacked four members of the Yuva Sena after they allegedly beat up two Kashmiri students of Dayabhai Patel Physical Education College, Yavatmal, earlier this week.

Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray took to social media on Friday to say that the party was expelling those who attacked the Kashmiri youth. “As of Thursday evening, the party has sacked those involved in the act. J&K is a part of India and no Indian, or for that matter, nobody should face the brunt of anger that is towards terrorism. We understand the angst but it must be against terror, not innocent people,” Thackeray tweeted.

Video footage of the event showed the Sena workers attacking the Kashmiri youth outside their rented accommodation. Apart from being asked to chant Vande Mataram, they were asked to leave Yavatmal immediately.

Ajinkya Motke, who led the group of party workers, was sent to magisterial custody for 14 days. His three accomplices were released on bail on Friday, the police said. At least 19 J&K students have returned home following the incident. — TNS
