Pragya Thakur’s remarks against Hemant Karkare despicable: ex-DGPs

‘Country owes Hemant Karkare a huge debt’

Bhopal Lok Sabha BJP candidate Pragya Thakur’s remarks against police officer Hemant Karkare, who was killed in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, were “despicable and regrettable,” said eight former DGPs in a statement on Sunday.

“He [Hemant Karkare] would probably be alive today had he not volunteered to return to the Maharashtra cadre from a plum posting at the Centre with the specific intention of working with the Anti-Terrorist Squad to prevent and probe the activities of terrorists so that the rest of us could sleep safe in our beds. The country owes him a huge debt of gratitude. Anything that detracts from this is worthy of strong condemnation,” they said.

Ms. Thakur, an accused in the 2008 Malegaon blasts case, had said the late Karkare falsely implicated her and because of her curse, he lost his life. This drew sharp criticism from several quarters after which she retracted her comments and apologised.

The DGPs said Ms. Thakur’s statement only served to highlight the need to publicly recognise the supreme sacrifice made by the 35,000 police personnel from all corners of India who since Independence had laid down their lives in the line of duty. “Under-resourced and often working 24x7 in the most challenging conditions, these brave men and women have unflinchingly answered the call of duty, even when it called for the ultimate sacrifice,” they observed.

Appeal to candidates

They urged all candidates contesting in the Lok Sabha poll to seek out and honour the families of the police personnel who laid down their lives. The candidates could adopt one police station each year and make it a model station, ensuring facilities for the staff and families, the former DGPs said.

“That would be a real and meaningful tribute to the supreme sacrifices made by Hemant Karkare and thousands of other valiant police personnel,” they added.
