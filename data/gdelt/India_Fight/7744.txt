Karol Bagh fire: hotel licence holder arrested

His brother Rakesh Goel was arrested at IGI airport on Sunday

A week after a fire broke out at a hotel in Karol Bagh in which 17 people were killed, the police have arrested the 69-year-old licence holder of the hotel on Tuesday. His brother, the owner, was arrested earlier.

Deputy Commissioner of Police (Crime Branch) Rajesh Deo said the accused, Sharadindu Goel, a resident of Karol Bagh, was arrested after his anticipatory bail got rejected.

Bail dismissed

“Sharadindu Goel, elder brother of Rakesh Goel and licensee of Hotel Arpit Palace, has been arrested. Earlier today, his anticipatory bail was dismissed in court. He was produced at Tis Hazari Courts and his police remand was sought for four days,” he said.

The police said Sharadindu Goel, absconding for a week, was travelling across Delhi and Haryana and was staying with relatives. “He is also grappling with health issues like diabetes and back problems,” an officer privy to the case.

Rakesh Goel was arrested on Sunday after he landed in Delhi from Qatar. The Immigration officials at the Delhi airport were alerted as an LOC had already been issued against him. The moment his flight landed and he came out of the airport, he was detained and handed over to the Crime Branch.

In a massive fire that broke out at the four-storey Hotel Arpit Palace in Karol Bagh on February 12, three Myanmar nationals — an IRS officer, a Central government drug inspector and a doctor were among the 17 killed.
