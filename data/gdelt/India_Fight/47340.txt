New Delhi: The Indian Army is creating a database of its equipment such as tanks, guns, and air assets. An automated program, which will give an assessment of the lifecycle of the equipment, along with their serviceability conditions is being created under a project, codenamed — Project Beehive. Being developed by the Indian Army's Electronics and Mechanical Engineers (EME) corps, the centralised system will be based in New Delhi and will be connected to the 2000 EME workshops spread across the country.

“The concept is similar to wasps collecting nectar for their beehive. And then through the program, we can derive data out of this nectar,” Lieutenant General Anil Kapoor, Director General EME, who is heading the development of the program was quoted as saying by a publication. The corps of EME is responsible for the maintenance and overhauling of military equipment of the Indian Army.

The mammoth program which will be a database of the lifecycle of the Army's equipment including guns, small arms, radars, aviation assets such as the Dhruv and Cheetah helicopters, infantry combat vehicles (ICVs) and other mechanised vehicles, will be completed by October next year.

“As DG EME I will have information about critical equipment at the click of a button. This information will include how much mileage is there of a particular type of vehicle or how many guns are due for inspection. We can also know how much life is there in certain equipment. That is the advantage of automation, that at any point of time we know what is happening,” he was quoted as saying by a publication.
