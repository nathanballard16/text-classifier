A UP police constable was among those arrested.While five organisers were held, police are now facing questions over how more than 50 such parties had taken place at the farmhouse right under its nose. Eco Greens farmhouse comes under the purview of Expessway police station.Senior officers of Noida police are now looking at fixing the responsibility on the local station house officer (SHO) of Expressway police station. Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna told TOI that they will write to the Election Commission to recommend action against its SHO Hansraj Bhadoriya.Sources in the police said a similar raid had been carried out on the same farmhouse a month ago but no one was arrested.
