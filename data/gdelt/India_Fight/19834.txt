Jobs, castes and other issues in India’s general elections

NEW DELHI — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014 promising big-ticket economic reforms. But with unemployment rising and signature policies getting panned, Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party has adopted a nationalist pitch ahead of a general election that begins this week.

The last time the BJP sought a second term was 2004, when it spent millions on an ad blitz projecting India as an economic powerhouse.

The voters didn’t buy it. Election results showed that people voted according to their caste, an ancient hierarchy in India that is outlawed by the constitution but still vital in Indian politics.

Hindus comprise about 80 percent of India’s 1.3 billion people, so the BJP is invoking its Hindu nationalist roots, with Modi at the forefront against the threat of Pakistan, India’s Muslim-majority archrival.

Voting will take place in seven phases over six weeks beginning Thursday. Nearly 900 million people, including 15.9 million first-time voters, are eligible to cast ballots in the world’s largest democratic exercise. Around a million polling stations will be set up, and voters will choose 543 members of the Lower House of Parliament.

Major election issues and factors include:

• Jobs: According to the Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy, unemployment reached 7.4 percent in December 2018, its highest rate in more than two years.

• Kashmir: A suicide attack in Kashmir killed 40 Indian paramilitary soldiers in February, helping the BJP hone its nationalist pitch. Analysts say Indian air strikes inside Pakistan in response to the attack gave Modi a pre-election boost. BJP leaders quickly made national security a central plank of their campaign.

• Caste: The BJP is mainly supported by upper-caste Hindus, while struggling to make headway with lower-caste voters and non-Hindus. Successive governments have sought to redress discrimination against those on the lower rungs by setting up quotas for government jobs and university spots.

• Giveaways: Giveaways are essential in Indian politics. Some 270 million people — roughly 22 percent of the country’s population — live in poverty, making giveaways particularly attractive to voters. In the past, farmworkers were offered cows and goats.

• Symbols: A ladder, hand pump, bicycle, bow and arrow, book, are just some of the many objects voters will see on their electronic ballots, symbols of the dozens of political parties and independent candidates. Since only about a fifth of India’s population could read or write at the time of the country’s first election in 1951, the symbols were introduced to help the unlettered cast their votes.
