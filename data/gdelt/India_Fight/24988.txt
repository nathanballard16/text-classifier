West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had accused the BJP government of being intolerant. But now, it seems that it is the same situation in West Bengal as a police complaint was filed against Priyanka Sharma, a Bharatiya Janata Youth Morcha (BJYM) worker as she posted a meme which had a head-shot of Mamata Banerjee superimposed on Priyanka Chopra's MET Gala 2019 picture.

As per some reports, Sharma was later arrested. The move was later slammed by many netizens. One of the Twitter users tweeted,“I don't know her. I never met her. But still, I can feel the pain of Priyanka Sharma who has been arrested for sharing a viral meme on Mamata. Just imagine what her family is going through right now. What if this happens with your daughter or sister?”

BJP’s nominee for Bangalore South Parliamentary Constituency Tejasvi Surya expressed his views on the same on Twitter. In the same, he mentioned how one of the Congress workers had posted a morphed image of Narendra Modi with a Hitler mustache.
