A class X student of G D Birla Centre For Education in south Kolkata was found dead inside the school washroom under mysterious circumstances on Friday afternoon. Police said she was found with her wrist slit and head wrapped in a plastic bag.

According to the police, a group of students found her lying inside the washroom around 2 pm after which she was taken to a hospital in Jodhpur Park where she was declared dead on arrival.

“Those who found her said that her head was wrapped in a polythene bag. A purported suicide note has been recovered, but we are yet to verify whether it is her handwriting. She was a topper and a brilliant student, according to the teachers and classmates. According to the note, she was under immense mental pressure. The note says she had no mental peace and was unable to sleep properly for the last three months,” Joint Commissioner of Police Murlidhar Sharma said.

School authorities were not available for comments.

In their preliminary opinion, the doctors have said they found “self-inflicting hesitation mark on her wrist”. A member of the forensic team which visited the school said, “Her face was wrapped in a polythene bag according to those who saw her lying in the washroom. We have recovered blades, a pen and other items from the spot. There were blood stains too.”

The investigators are also examining the CCTV footage of the school corridors, police sources said. According to an investigating officer, the handwritten note described the process of how she was killing herself. The note says no one was responsible for her death.

While the note claimed that she was under mental pressure, her classmates said she had showed no sign of depression.
