Two Pakistani drones cross over Rajasthanâ€™s Sri Ganganagar, 'bomb' falls in village: Sources

New Delhi:

A day after two Pakistani drones were shot down by India in Rajasthan’s Sri Ganganagar area, sources said two more drones crossed over the Indian territory around 7 pm on Sunday. One unexploded bomb also dropped at a house in village 3 B of Sri Ganganagar area, said sources. However, there has been no official confirmation from the Indian or Pakistan government that it was a bombing attempt.

On Saturday, the Indian Army shot down an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), also known as drone, in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar sector around 7.30 pm. This was the second such incident of the day that took place in Sri Ganganagar. Earlier on Saturday, India shot down a Pakistani drone along the international border (IB) in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar after it violated Indian airspace. This is the fifth time Pakistani drone destroyed by India along the IB since February 26 air strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot inside Pakistani territory.

On Sunday, Pakistan also resorted to heavy firing. Indian forces, however, retaliated to the shelling.

Earlier, a Pakistani drone was detected by a ground-based radar station in Rajasthan's Bikaner and minutes later one of the Sukhoi-30 jets deployed in the area to keep an eye on Indian air space shot it down. The Pakistani military drone was targeted at around 11:30 am in Bikaner-Nal sector in Rajasthan, the sources said.

It was the second unsuccessful attempt by Pakistan to send a spy drone inside India in the last six days. On February 27, a day after the air strike, a Pakistani drone was shot down by India along the Indo-Pak border in Kutch district of Gujarat. The Indian Air Force has kept all its bases in the Western sector on maximum alert after the Balakot strike.
