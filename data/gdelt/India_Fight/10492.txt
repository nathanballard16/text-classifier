Several flights cancelled at Amritsar, Chandigarh airports

Commercial flight services were affected at the Amritsar and Chandigarh airports on Wednesday but authorities said that normal flight operations had been resumed and will continue normally on Thursday.

Commercial flight operations were suspended on Wednesday from the Guru Ram Das Jee International Airport in Amritsar amid rising tensions between India and Pakistan.

Commercial flights resumed services at all the Indian airports where they were suspended earlier in the day on Wednesday, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said.

Over 15 flights to and from Amritsar airport were cancelled, delayed or diverted. Passengers who were in the Amritsar airport terminal to catch flights for various destinations were asked to leave the building.

Personnel from the Army, Indian Air Force (IAF) and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) took control of the airport complex.

"We were inside the airport to catch an international flight. We were asked to leave. We do not know the fate of our flight. No one is telling us anything," said a young woman who was scheduled to leave for Dubai.

At the Chandigarh International Airport, which is under the command of the IAF, at least 10 flights were cancelled on Wednesday.

The cancelled flights included Indigo Airlines (five flights), Jet Airways (three), Go Air (one) and Air India (one).

"Today, Chandigarh airport was open for flight operations for the full day and it will open at its normal time tomorrow onwards also," Chandigarh International Airport Limited (CHAIL) spokesperson Deepesh Joshi said.

The airports at Halwara near Ludhiana and Adampur near Jalandhar, which are both with the IAF, were also put on high alert.
