Guwahati: 'More autonomy to blame for ragging in private colleges'

GUWAHATI: Days after the incident of a Class XII student of RD Junior College in Digboi being brutally thrashed inside the hostel came to light, sources in the directorate of secondary education said ragging and physical abuse of students are rampant in private educational institutions mainly because they enjoy more administrative autonomy.The incident has once again raised the same nagging question that refuses to go away - how active is the government in monitoring new private colleges that have been mushrooming across the state?Though the Digboi incident reportedly took place on March 26, it came to light on April 22 after a video of the incident surfaced on the social media. In the footage, a group of five boys, speaking in Assamese, is seen asking the victim to stand in front of them.After exchanging a few words, the boys are seen asking the Class XII student to dance, after which they rain blows on him.Five students involved in the incident have been suspended from college and a magisterial inquiry has been initiated into the incident, with sub-divisional officer Sumit Sattawan having been directed to submit a report within seven days.Director of secondary education, P Jidung, on Saturday said that the incident, where the student was brutally thrashed by a group of students, will be independently probed by the office of the district inspector of schools (IS). He, however, admitted that monitoring the private colleges have been relatively tougher than the government-run institutions."The authorities of the private junior colleges get conditional permission to run their institutions. Though these institutions are given guidelines based on which they are expected to operate, we cannot, as per rules, interfere much in the internal administration. However, sensing the gravity of the incident, the Tinsukia IS will be asked to get a report on the incident," said Jidung.The Digboi incident was an eye-opener for the secondary education department, as ragging was hitherto considered to be more prevalent among students after the plus-two level.However, with instances of ragging in the state's higher educational institutions shooting up in recent years, Assam had last year earned the dubious distinction of being among the 15 states in the country where the number of ragging incidents in the last eight years have been 'quite high'.After the University Grants Commission (UGC) wrote to the Assam chief secretary last year, expressing concern over the 111 ragging incidents reported from the state during the period, the state directorate of higher education had asked all colleges across Assam to initiate follow-up action to curb the menace.
