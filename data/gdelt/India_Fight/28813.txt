SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, June 6 (Xinhua) -- A fierce gunfight between militants and Indian troops Thursday broke out in restive Indian-controlled Kashmir, police said.

The gunfight erupted at village Lassipora of Pulwama district, about 45 km south of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"A gunfight started this evening between militants and joint contingents of police, paramilitary and army at Lassipora here," a senior police official posted in Pulwama told Xinhua. "Two to three militants are believed to be trapped in the area."

Officials said the village was cordoned off following specific intelligence information suggesting presence of militants.

"Exchange of fire between the two sides is underway and further details are awaited," the police official said.

Authorities have suspended mobile Internet service in the district and closed roads leading to the gunfight site.

The last two weeks have seen a sudden increase in the number of gunfights and militant killings in the region.

Militant groups opposing New Delhi's rule are engaged in a guerilla war with Indian troops in the region since 1989. Gunfight between the two sides takes place intermittently.
