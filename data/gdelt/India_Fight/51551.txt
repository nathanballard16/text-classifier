Essar Steel Judgment: Key Highlights

The effect of this declaration was clarified and it was held that ordinarily the time taken in relation to the CIRP of the corporate debtor must be completed within the outer limit of 330 days from the insolvency commencement date, including extensions and the time taken in legal proceedings. However, on the facts of a given case, if it could be shown to the that only a short period is left for completion of the CIRP beyond 330 days, and that it would be in the interest of all stakeholders that the corporate debtor be put back on its feet instead of being sent into liquidation and that the time taken in legal proceedings is largely due to factors owing to which the fault cannot be ascribed to the litigants before the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal, the delay or a large part thereof being attributable to the tardy process of the Adjudicating Authority and/or the Appellate Tribunal itself, it was held that the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal may extend the time beyond 330 days. Similarly, even under the new proviso to Section 12, if by reason of all the aforesaid factors the grace period of 90 days from the date of commencement of the Amending Act of 2019 is exceeded, the Adjudicating Authority and/or Appellate Tribunal may further extend time keeping the aforesaid parameters in mind. It was stated that only in such exceptional cases, time can be extended.
