"Missing Ludhiana, MP Bittu gets trolled after his get well msg to mayor"

LUDHIANA: Member Parliament from Ludhiana Ravneet Singh Bittu, who has been missing from the constituency for past sometime, especially at a time when it has been battling with floods and an overflowing Buddah Nallah, was trolled on Facebook by city residents after he posted a get-well-soon message for city mayor Balkar Sandhu, who was admitted to a hospital following a heart ailment on Wednesday. The residents were not only questioning Bittu’s absence, but also taunting him by asking to say or do something to improve the prevailing conditions in his area.Amongst those taking barbs at Bittu were a few local Congress leaders too. Commenting on the MPs post for recovery of the mayor, Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee secretary Maninderpal Guliani commented, “Wish him (Balkar) speedy recovery! So Ravneet ji, this Saturday when you will come to see the mayor, do visit the affected areas too and please also meet the flood victims of your constituency.”While taking pot shots at Bittu, some went overboard and even threatened to protest if Bittu visited Ludhiana and their areas now. Facebook user Gaurav Arora commented, “Ludhiana barbaad ho gya tusi kithe ho Shivpuri a ke dikhao je tera jaloos na kdia ta kahi, (Ludhiana has been destroyed, if you dare to come to Shivpuri, we will publically shame you).”Harpreet Singh commented, “Ehna di recovery doctor ne krni hai kise politician ne nhi, n Ldh di recovery politician ne krni hai kise doctor ne nhi (Balkar’s recovery will be done by doctors while Ludhiana’s recovery needs a politician).”Paras Arora wrote, “Eh bs fb te hi dikhde ne, kithe dikh v jaan Ludhiana ch fir bs fotoa khichwa ke page te paadenge..photography krwande ne bs (Bittu is only visible and approachable on FB, if by chance he appears somewhere in Ludhiana, he gets photos clicked and uploads them on Facebook).”Despite attempts, Bittu did not respond to TOI’s calls.
