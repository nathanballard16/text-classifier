Maha: Boy killed, sister injured in wall collapse near Pune

A 10-year-old boy was killed and his younger sister injured on Sunday morning after a wall of their house collapsed in Lonavala, around 90 kilometres from Pune, police said.

The incident happened at around 7:30am when deceased Kunal Ajay Dodke and his 9-year-old sister Nandini were asleep in their house while their father was away, the official said.

He said the wall collapse might have been caused by heavy rains the area has been witnessing over the past couple of days.
