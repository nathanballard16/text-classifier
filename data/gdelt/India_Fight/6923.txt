Pulwama Terror Attack: Ranveer Singh observes a minute's silence for martyred jawans at an award show in Dubai

The horrifying terror attack on Thursday in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama has been widely condemned by Bollywood celebrities on social media. Many addressed the need to put and end to terrorism and take note of the immense contribution of our jawans who lost their lives in the line of service. In a first, actress Shabana Azmi while condemning the attack, said that there was a need to halt cultural exchange between India and Pakistan. Actor Vicky Kaushal, too, said that it felt like a personal loss.

Ranveer Singh on Saturday was felicitated at an award show in Dubai and also received an award. During his speech, Ranveer made sure to remember the CRPF soldiers and observe a minute's silence. Ranveer said, "Like every other India, my thoughts and prayers are with our brave jawans who lost their lives in the line of service, our real heroes. May I request everyone present here to join me in observing a minute of silence for our martyred jawans. Please rise from your seats. Let us all please observe a minute of silence for our heroes."

Take a look at the video below:

At least 40 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed and several others critically injured when an explosives-laden vehicle drove into a bus carrying soldiers in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday.

The repercussions of such terror attacks have largely affected cultural ties between India and Pakistan in the past. In 2016, several outfits sought a ban on Pakistani actors from working in Bollywood films after 17 soldiers were killed in the Uri terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir. Following this, Karan Johar's Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star Pakistani actor Fawad Khan had to bear the brunt and return to Pakistan.
