MUMBAI: TellyChakkar has been at the forefront of reporting updates about Abhimanyu Singh’s Contiloe Production’s upcoming web-series titled Black Torando, which is based on the 26/11 terrorist attacks on Mumbai.



We broke the news about Saqib Saleem and Arjan Bajwa being roped in for the project (read here: Saqib Saleem to play late Indian Army officer Sandeep Unnikrishnan in Contiloe Pictures’ next for ZEE5; Arjan Bajwa bags Contiloe Pictures’ next for ZEE5).



Now, the latest update is that acclaimed actor Mukul Dev has also been roped in for the project for an important role.



We contacted Mukul, who confirmed the news and said, 'Yes, I am a part of the project. I had worked with Abhimanyu Singh’s Contiloe Productions in 21 Sarfarosh Sargrahi, which was a great experience, and I’m totally looking forward to shooting for Black Torando. The makers have put in a lot of effort to recreate the 26/11 scenario, and every character in the project is quite important and detailed. Thus, I wouldn’t want to divulge my character details.'
