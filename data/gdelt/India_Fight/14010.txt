Pro-Khalistani, pro-Modi demonstrators clash outside Indian mission in London

A clash broke out between two rival demonstrator groups assembled outside the Indian High Commission in London on Saturday (March 9). The two groups clashed during a demonstration called to protest against "atrocities on ethnic minorities in India" and counter-protests from groups including the Friends of India Society in the United Kingdom.

According to news agency ANI, pro-Khalistani protesters allegedly supported by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) attacked a number of British Indians who were standing outside the Indian High Commission in London.

The pro-Khalistani protesters attacked a number of British Indians as a revenge for the anti-Pakistan protests that have been taking place in London since a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama and the Indian airstrikes in Balakot.

Scotland Yard said one man was arrested for "breach of peace" during a face-off between UK-based Kashmiri and pro-Khalistan outfits chanting anti-India slogans and counter protesters chanting pro-Narendra Modi slogans.

The Metropolitan Police said the man was later "de-arrested, with no further action".

No injury during the clash has been reported. Images and videos of the clash have since been posted on social media, with either side blaming the other for turning a peaceful protest violent.
