Minor apprehended in connection with killing of property dealer in Delhi's Vikaspuri

Delhi Police on Saturday apprehended a minor in connection with a murder of a property dealer in Vikaspuri, New Delhi.

Before the minor was arrested, he shot at the police and tried to escape but was soon arrested.

When the police arrested him, three pistols and 20 bullets were recovered from him. The car in which the minor tried to escape was also stolen from Rajasthan.

According to the police, the gang behind this alleged murder is Surya Gang.

Surya Gang had demanded Rs 1 crore extortion from victim Amit Kochar.

Amit Kochar refused to pay the extortion sum.

Amit Kochar was at his house on Thursday with his friends. After a while, the house bell rang and Amit opened the door of the house. Two people were standing at the door.

The two persons told Amit that his car was blocking their way. Amit went out to see the car and park it accordingly. The moment Amit opened the car door to sit inside, the two Surya Gang members also stepped inside the car.

The two other persons including the minor also surrounded the car.

After this the Surya Gang asked for extortion sum of Rs 1 crore. Amit told the gang that he does not have money. Upon hearing this, the gang fired nine rounds killing Amit.

Amit's friends rushed to the car and took him to a hospital where he was declared brought dead.

During the investigation, the police came to know that Amit was involved in the purchase of a disputed plot, due to which he came close to a gang and Surya.

Surya soon made the situation work in his favour and tried to extort Amit.

According to the police, there are around 12 miscreants in Surya Gang and the police is in search of all the miscreants including Surya.
