Pulwana: Rtd Major General Bakshi says ‘Pakistan started a war, India will end it’

New Delhi: Retired Major General Gagandeep Bakshi in a sharp reaction to Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan’s statements on the Pulwama attack, has termed the attack “act of war” and it is now for India to finish what Pakistan had started.

Citing Imran Khan’s statements on the Pulwama attack, Bakshi stated that, “On 14th February his Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) network attacked our CRPF convey and killed 40 people. JeM has proudly owned up to it. What they did is not an act of terror; it is an act of war. They started it but we will finish it.”

When asked about Imran Khan’s rhetoric of asking evidence of Pakistan’s involvement in the Pulwama terror attack, Bakshi asserted that “Evidence is only required when the murderer denies the charge but here JeM has already broadcast to the world that they did this attack. The evidence is usually presented when accused pleads not guilty but that’s not the case here.”

Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday said that Pakistan is open to any investigation in the attack “It is in our interest that nobody from our soil spreads violence. I want to tell Indian govt that we will take action if evidence is found against anyone from Pakistan,” he added.

Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad was behind the deadliest terror attack on security forces in Kashmir in which 49 CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday when their convoy was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway.
