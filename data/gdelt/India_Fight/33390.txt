Murder convict arrested 16 years after jumping furlough

After fleeing, he became a popular bodybuilder in Palghar

A convict in the infamous Tanya Koli murder case of 1993, who was on the run since 2003 after jumping furlough, was arrested by the Mumbai Police Crime Branch on Friday.

After fleeing, the convict, Nimesh Ajgaonkar, had moved to Palghar and was well known as a bodybuilder in the area, having won two local competitions.

Ajgaonkar opened fire at Koli at Kalyan railway station in broad daylight on September 9, 1993, while he was being taken back to Nagpur Central Jail after a court appearance in Kalyan.

Koli was one of the top shooters for gangster-turned-politician Arun Gawli, and his murder was sanctioned by gangster Ashwin Naik, who was Mr. Gawli’s rival in the underworld. A police constable, who was part of the escort team, was also killed in the shootout.

Police officers said that Ajgaonkar was caught by eyewitnesses and handed over to the police. He was later convicted in the case and sentenced to life imprisonment. In August 2003, he was released from Amravati Central Jail on furlough and never reported back to prison.

According to Crime Branch officers, police constable Sanjay Nagvekar, attached with the Crime Branch Unit III, after scanning the voters lists across the State, learned that Ajgaonkar was in Dahanu in Palghar district.

A Crime Branch officer said, “We started following up on the information with the help of local informants. We learned that he had married, had a teenage son and had taken up bodybuilding, even winning the local competition twice.”

After verifying the information, a team from the Crime Branch Unit III went to Dahanu and picked him up from his house on Friday evening. He was questioned and inquiries confirmed his identity. He was then placed under arrest. The officer said, “A separate offence of fleeing from lawful custody has been registered against Ajgaonkar. Further inquiries against him are under way.”
