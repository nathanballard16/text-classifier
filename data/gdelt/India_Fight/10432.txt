The air strike came in the wake of a suicide bomber attack on February 14 in Pulwama, Kashmir that killed over 40 security personnel.India has so far emphasised it's air raid on Tuesday was ‘pre-emptive’ and ‘non-military’, signaling it didn't wish to escalate the conflict.India’s external affairs minister Sushma Swaraj told diplomats from China and Russia that “India will continue to act with responsibility and restraint.”On Wednesday, in the wake of the violation of India’s air space, Pakistani foreign ministry also said it “had no intention of escalation” but was “fully prepared to do so if forced into that paradigm” Reuters reported.International flights between India and Pakistan were suspended and at least four airports have been shut in North India amid heightened tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours.Airports in Srinagar, Jammu, Leh, Amritsar and Chandigarh have reportedly been closed for civilian operations following reports that two planes of the Pakistani air force had entered the Indian air space in Nowshera, Kashmir on Wednesday morning.Both US and China have asked the two countries to act with restraint. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo asked India and Pakistan to exercise restraint and to prioritise communication. On Tuesday, China had also urged both countries to exercise restraint, and stressing for “cooperation” by the two countries in the interest of peace and stability in the South Asia region.
