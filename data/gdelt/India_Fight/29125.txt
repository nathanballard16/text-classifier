New Delhi: While most parts of northern India are reeling under an intense heat wave there are those who are battling some extreme climatic conditions to guard the country’s borders. The temperature in Siachen range from 40 to -70 degree Celsius and life is about survival at such extreme conditions.

A video posted by soldiers shot on a Siachen glacier has gone viral in which the jawans documented their struggle to defrost their food which included juice boxes, eggs, tomatoes and ginger before it can be consumed. Armed with a hammer and playful banter, the soldiers demonstrate how they have to put their food in boiling water.

Taking the hammer to the egg, one of the jawans shows how the egg remains unaffected despite several hits. The egg is then thrown at the table by another one and it bounces right back. “These are the kind of eggs you get at a glacier,” one of the soldiers quips.

At the beginning of the video, a soldier stationed at the high-altitude Siachen base rips open a juice box to reveal a solid brick of frozen liquid. The soldiers then explain how they need to boil the juice to consume it.

“The temperature drops to as low as minus 70 degrees; life is hell here,” says another.

The video went viral on social media getting massive respect from netizens who admired the soldier in Siachen who go through extreme hardships in order to protect the borders and civilians.
