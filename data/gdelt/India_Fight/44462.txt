Bangladeshi national with fake documents arrested at KIA

A 41-year-old Bangladeshi national, who was deported from Hong Kong to Bengaluru after he was caught travelling with fake documents, was arrested at the Kempegowda International Airport on Friday. According to officials, he also had a valid Indian passport, which he had procured illegally.

The accused, identified as Lakhin Chandra Kittania, allegedly crossed the border into West Bengal in January this year. While at Siliguri, he met a tout, Linotn Das Kittania, who managed to get him a valid Indian passport under a new identity Laxmon Mondal.

Using the passport, Kittania boarded a flight to Bagdora via Bengaluru, and to Hong Kong on a tourist visa. He told the police that he had planned to fly to Malaysia and settle there illegally. “However, he was caught by Hong Kong immigration officials who deported him,” said the police.

Based on the report, Kittania was arrested and charged under various sections of the Passports Act and also under the Foreigners Act. Efforts are on to track down Litton Das.
