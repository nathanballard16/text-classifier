She told us that she will fly to the UAE in last week of December and will spend a week or more there to enjoy the New Year in a different way. “The shooting for my film will be almost over by the third week of December. Only a few songs will be left. So, I will fly to Dubai with friends and return on January 2. I’ll celebrate New Year there. It will be a much-needed break from work and will hopefully be a good trip,” said the actress with a smile.She said most of her friends are staying in different parts of the country and some, outside India. “One of my friends stays in Dubai. That’s why we have decided to go here and celebrate. Even some of my relatives and cousins are in Dubai. So, I’ll be visiting them too,” she added.Anubha, however, said she will miss her seven dogs, as she would be away from them for a week. She and her mother Puspa Panda, who is also a veteran Odia actress, love the dogs, whose number reached seven after a Beagle joined the pack. “Whenever I come home after a hectic day, they make me happy. They are like kids in our house, as we never tie them or treat them like animals. So, whenever I go out on long trips, I miss them. You will fall in love with them if you meet them; they keep entertaining you in their own sweet way,” the actress signed off.
