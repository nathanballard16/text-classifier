BJP in UP, Cong in MP are examples of 'state terror', says Mayawati

The BSP chief’s statement came in the wake of the AMU sedition case

The BJP government in Uttar Pradesh and the Congress regime in Madhya Pradesh are examples of 'state terror' and should be condemned, Mayawati said on Thursday.

A day after 14 Aligarh Muslim University (AMU) students were booked for sedition, BSP chief Mayawati went all guns blazing against the BJP and the Congress.

Apart from the AMU case, the BSP chief was also reacting to the imposition of the National Security Act (NSA) on Muslims on charges of cow slaughter by the Madhya Pradesh government earlier this month.

'Congress government in MP like BJP slapped atrocious NSA against Muslims for cow slaughter. Now the Uttar Pradesh BJP government has booked 14 AMU students under notorious sedition charges. Both are examples of state terror and condemnable,' Mayawati said in a statement issued in Lucknow.

'People should decide what the difference between the Congress and BJP governments is,' she added.

In Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh, 14 students, including the AMU students’ union chief, were booked under sedition charges after some students and a TV channel crew got into an altercation over reports of a visit by AIMIM lawmaker Asaduddin Owaisi.

In Khandwa, Madhya Pradesh, authorities slapped NSA on and jailed three Muslim men for allegedly killing a cow in Khandwa earlier this month.
