A 39-year-old man in Chennai was forced to treat his bullet wound at his home after he was allegedly shot at by a history-sheeter and warned against approaching the police.

The shooting, which happened in Ennore on June 8, came to light on Monday when Senthil sought treatment at a government hospital after the bullet wound began to fester.

History-sheeter Ramesh and his accomplice Alexander were arrested for the alleged shooting. “Ramesh (33) is wanted for 25 cases, including murder, and had been detained under the stringent Goondas Act thrice in the past,” the police said, adding that a pistol and two bullets were recovered from him.

Senthil was shot at when he tried to intervene in a quarrel involving the accused and another man over some issue, the police said. Ramesh had then warned Senthil of dire consequences if he revealed about the incident, prompting Senthil to treat the bullet wound at home. However, as the injury aggravated, Senthil visited a government hospital on Monday following which the police came to know about the incident.

Based on a complaint filed by Senthil, the police registered a case and a special team arrested Ramesh and Alexander on Tuesday morning. They were produced before a court which remanded them to judicial custody, the police said.
