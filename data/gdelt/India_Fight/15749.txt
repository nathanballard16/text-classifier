Navy Chief in Kochi for TROPEX debriefing

Operational readiness of Indian Navy assessed

Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Sunil Lanba arrived in Kochi on Monday for a debriefing of the recently concluded annual Theatre Level Readiness and Operational Exercise (TROPEX) held earlier this year in the Arabian Sea and north Indian Ocean. The day-long review of TROPEX 2019 was undertaken to examine the conduct of the exercise and to assess the operational readiness of the Indian Navy. A realistic audit of the Navy’s deployment philosophy and fighting capability was undertaken during the review.

Lessons learnt from the exercise will provide the Navy accurate assessments to fine-tune combat deployments, force structuring requirements, operational logistics, and material and training imperatives.

Admiral Lanba congratulated Navy officers and personnel for the high level of professionalism and commitment displayed during the exercise. The CNS urged one and all to maintain the high tempo of operations and keep sharp vigil to ensure safer coasts and secure seas.

The exercise that began in January graduated smoothly into providing the Navy a high operational readiness posture post the Pulwama attack on February 14. Around 60 Naval ships, 12 ships of Indian Coast Guard and 60 aircraft, participated in TROPEX 19.

The exercise also included a Tri-services Amphibious Exercise that saw the participation of the Army and the Air Force. Commanders-in-Chief of all the three naval commands along with a number of senior operational commanders and representatives from the Indian Army, Air Force, and the Indian Coast Guard participated in the discussions held at Naval Base, Kochi.
