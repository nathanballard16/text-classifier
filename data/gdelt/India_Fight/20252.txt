Aunt Gets Lifer For Killing 18-Month-Old Niece

Hyderabad: A local court sentenced a woman from Chandanagar to life imprisonment for murdering her 18-month-old niece by throwing her into a water drum.

On June 30, 2015, the accused T. Rakya Lakshmi (24) took the child and threw her at the water drum and killed her. Second Additional District Court at LB Nagar convicted her of the crime.

A case was registered by the Chandanagar police when a complaint was filed against Lakshmi by the child's mother K. Renuka alleging that her baby was murdered by the former.

Police said that Lakshmi had suffered a miscarriage in May 2014 when she was eight months pregnant. Since then, she started feeling insecure for not getting attention from the family, while her niece, the daughter of her sister-in-law Renuka got the love and attention.

Angry over this, she started harbouring a grudge against Renuka and her child and hatched the conspiracy to murder her niece.

In the afternoon of June 15, Lakshmi went to Renuka's house and sneakily got the baby out while Renuka was in the bathroom. When Renuka came out, she saw that her baby was not there and went searching for her. Upon searching, she found her kid in the water drum near Lakshmi's house.

Lakshmi later confessed to the crime.
