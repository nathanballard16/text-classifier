The bodies of the three villagers were found on Tuesday morning near Kosfundi village, around 4km from Kasnasur.The south Gadchiroli division, a Maoist outfit, claimed responsibility for the killings in pamphlets left behind at the site. The Maoists also abducted Dalsu Pungati, Munshi Madavi, and Venu Talandi but released them later.Earlier, getting wind of the Maoist plan to kidnap and kill villagers in reprisals, many tribals had begun shifting from Kasnasur village to nearby hamlets like Tadgaon, Bhamragarh, and Aheri.Shailesh Balkawade, SP of Gadchiroli, did not respond to TOI's calls and messages.
