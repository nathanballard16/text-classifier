A bullet was found in the man's hand, according to which a probe on suicide will be done.

Prima facie, it appears the man had shot the woman in her chest and later committed suicide by shooting himself.

Upon inquiry, the police found that both the doctors were working together at a private nursing home in the capital. According to the police, the two allegedly had an extra-marital affair, which could be the reason behind their murder or suicide.
