Pakistan may use nukes against India if faced with defeat, says Amarinder Singh

CHANDIGARH: Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Monday warned that Pakistan would not hesitate to use its nuclear arsenal if it felt it was losing against India in a conventional war.Captain Amarinder Singh (retd), even as he asserted that neither India nor Pakistan could afford a full-scale war or the use of weapons of mass destruction, said the two countries were nuclear powers and Pakistan could indulge in a misadventure if faced by defeat.The air strikes carried out in the wake of the Pulwama attack has proven India’s resolve to deal with terror, said Amarinder in a chat with journalists in Amritsar.He, however, refused to comment on the number of terrorists killed in the strikes, saying, “Whether it was one or 100, the message has gone out loud and clear – India will not let the killing of its innocent soldiers and citizens go unpunished.”He said Pakistan could act out of desperation if it found itself cornered.Asked to comment on the Aam Aadmi Party’s (AAP) decision to ally with SAD (Taksali) for the Lok Sabha polls in Punjab, the chief minister said it was their prerogative, but the Congress did not need any alliance. The CM described the AAP-SAD (Taksali) coalition in Punjab “no consequence”. He added that the Congress’s state unit was ready for polls and was placed to win the state on its own.
