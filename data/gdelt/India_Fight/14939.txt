China blocks India's bid to designate JeM leader a terrorist

India's attempt to get the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) to designate Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) leader Masood Azhar as a terrorist has been blocked by China again.

Azhar, who is in Pakistan, is wanted in India for a series of terror strikes in the country including last month's suicide bombing in Pulwama in Kashmir which killed 40 Indian paramilitary troops.

That incident led to a sharp spike in tensions on the sub-continent and Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj yesterday asked Pakistan to deal with terror before seeking talks.

In retaliation for the Pulwama terror attack, for which JeM claimed responsibility, India launched air strikes across the Line of Control against Pakistan, which retaliated in similar fashion. Tensions eased only after Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan announced the release of an Indian pilot whose plane was shot down in a dogfight.

"Some people say Imran Khan is a statesman; if he is so generous then he should hand over JeM chief Masood Azhar to India. Let's see how generous he is," said Ms Swaraj at an event in New Delhi.

"We are ready to engage with Pakistan in an atmosphere free from terror... talks and terror cannot go together," she said. "You not only keep JeM on your soil, but (also) fund them and when the victim country retaliates, you attack it on the terror outfit's behalf."

Acknowledging that Azhar is in Pakistan, Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has said Islamabad would act against him only if India presented credible evidence. India says it has presented evidence on the Pulwama attacks to Pakistan.

Meanwhile, China was the only country in the UNSC to block the proposal to designate Azhar as a terrorist under a resolution that imposed sanctions on supporters of Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden and the Taleban.
