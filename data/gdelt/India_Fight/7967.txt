A Pakistani convict serving a 20 year term in Rajasthan's Jaipur Central Jail was murdered allegedly by other inmates after a fight over TV volume, prison officials said on Wednesday.

50-year-old Shakir Ullah from Sialkot had spent eight years in the jail, since his arrest under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act in 2011 by the anti-terror squad. In 2017, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Officials say four prisoners were watching TV when a quarrel broke out. As the fight escalated, the three convicts bashed Shakir Ullah's head against a stone on the ground, said Laxman Gaur, Additional Commissioner (Crime), Jaipur.

It is not clear yet whether any policemen were around.

Senior police officers, a forensics team and district officials have rushed to the jail. The case will be investigated by a judicial magistrate and the police.

News agency PTI reported that a post-mortem will be conducted in the jail under judicial supervision.

Pakistan, in a statement, has said they have raised the incident with Indian authorities. "We call upon the Indian Government to fulfill its obligations and ensure provision of foolproof security to all Pakistani inmates / prisoners in Indian Jails and Pakistani visitors to India," the statement said.
