George Maryan a part of Indian 2?

The shooting of Indian 2, directed by Shankar, is going on in full swing.

George Maryan, who was seen latest in this year’s Deepavali releases; Bigil and Kaithi, is rumoured to have bagged a role in Kamal Haasan-starrer Indian 2.

In an interview, Maryan had once mentioned he missed a chance to act alongside Ulaganayagan in Virumaandi and if the reports turn out to be true, Indian 2 is a dream-come-opportunity for the comedian-character artiste.

The shooting of Indian 2, directed by Shankar, is going on in full swing, and last week, the team was in Bhopal and shot a couple of high octane sequences, involving 2000 junior artistes for a whopping Rs 40 crore, under the supervision of the National award-winning stunt choreographer Peter Hein.

Up next, the team Indian 2 will be Gwalior-bound for the next 10 days, after which they are expected to leave for Europe and Taiwan to shoot the flashback portions of Kamal Haasan.

A source close to Indian 2 says though Maryan is yet to sign on the dotted line.

Further, unconfirmed sources say Anil Kapoor has been roped in to play the antagonist in Indian 2. However, an official word is awaited.

Bankrolled by Lyca Productions, the film also has Siddharth, Delhi Ganesh, Rakul Preet and Priya Bhavani Shankar in pivotal roles.

On the other hand, George Maryan started his career as an actor in theatre during 1989 and continued to perform in plays until he bagged a role in Azhagi (2002). Some of his best-known performances besides Kaithi, include Madrasapattinam (2010), Deiva Thirumagal (2011), Saivam (2014), Aandavan Kattalai (2016).
