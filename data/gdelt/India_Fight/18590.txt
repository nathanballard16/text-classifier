Expelled BHU student shot dead on campus

Was dismissed last year over campus violence in 2017; BHU chief proctor among 4 named in FIR



VARANASI An expelled Banaras Hindu University (BHU) student, Gaurav Singh, was shot dead outside a campus hostel by some youths on a motorcycle late on Tuesday.



The police have lodged an FIR against four persons, including BHU’s chief proctor Royana Singh. Four others have been detained for questioning. Paramilitary personnel were deployed on the campus and the university was shut after the attack.



Singh was expelled last year for his alleged role in the violence on the campus in 2017 over “harassment” of some students. But despite the dismissal, he apparently stayed with some friends at Lal Bahadur Shastri Hostel on the campus.



While standing outside Birla Hostel and talking to his friends on Tuesday night, some men on a motorcycle opened fire on him, the police said. He was rushed to the trauma centre at BHU’s Institute of Medical Sciences with bullet injuries in the stomach. He succumbed late in the night.



The police registered an FIR on the basis of a complaint by a friend, who said he, too, was targeted.



Preliminary inquiries indicate that the killing was a fallout of enmity between two campus groups. Royana was booked because the youths involved in the attack were allegedly seen with her earlier.
