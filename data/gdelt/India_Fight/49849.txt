School, three vehicles torched in J&K

SRINAGAR/KOLKATA: Miscreants set ablaze a government high school in Shopian and three vehicles, two of them belonging to a BJP leader, in Anantnag district of south Kashmir in the first recorded acts of arson since J&K became a Union territory on Thursday.While the school at Koodanyl village of Shopian was saved from being gutted in the blaze, all three cars targeted early on Friday at Bonigam in Anantnag were destroyed. Two of those vehicles were being used to ferry students of a school run by Abid Khan, president of the local BJP unit. The third was owned by Ghulam Nabi Dar, a numberdar (village head) from the same area.The arson comes on the heels of a series of terrorist attacks in which outstation trucks, drivers and migrant labourers have been the targets, including five labourers from Murshidabad in Bengal who were shot dead in Kulgam district three days ago.On Friday, Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee announced that her government was bringing home 131 labourers who had gone to J&K to work in the orchards there. This was after a video showed four workers talking about their desperation to return home after Tuesday’s massacre in Kulgam. “The labourers will assemble in Srinagar by early Saturday morning and we will bring them back to Bengal by train. Our Delhi-based resident commissioner is working on the logistics,” Mamata said.
