The space program of India is on a high right now. With the recent success of the Mars mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) called Mangalyaan. And now ISRO has undertaken a second Moon mission called Chandrayaan-2. ISRO‘s heavy lift rocket – the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle-Mark III (GSLV-Mk III) – carried the 3,850 kg Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft. It blast off from the Sriharikota spaceport on July 22. At exactly 2.43PM, the Rs 375 crore GSLV-Mk III rocket began its ascent into space. It took off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC).

The fifth orbit raising manoeuvre scheduled between 2.30 p.m. and 3.30 p.m. on August 6. On July 22, Chandrayaan-2 was injected into an elliptical orbit by India’s heavy lift rocket GSLV Mk III. The spacecraft comprises three segments — the Orbiter (weighing 2,379 kg), the lander ‘Vikram’ (1,471 kg) and rover ‘Pragyan’ (27 kg).
