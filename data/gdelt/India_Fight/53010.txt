Naga Peace Accord: What History Tells Us About 70 Year Old Struggle

With the beginning of the 1980s, hostilities between both the parties recommenced. By now, a new generation of leaders had emerged, most important among them being Isak Swu and T Muivah. They set up the ‘Naga Socialist Council’ (NSCN) in Myanmar in 1980, and even tried to enlist Chinese help to finance their cause, something which Phizo had resisted till then. The NSCN further got split into a number of factions, most important among which were the NSCN Issac Muviah (NSCN IM) and NSCN Khaplang (NSCN K).

Along with Nagaland and Myanmar, the Naga rebels also became a source of concern for their activities in Manipur, where they fought for the cause of their brethren residing in the hilly regions, against the ‘Meiti’ Hindus of the plains. The struggle continued into the 1990s.

In the mid-1990s, a collective of Church groups and civil society organisations, called Naga HoHo’, was formed. It persuaded the government and the rebels to declare a ceasefire. In 1997, NSCN IM and in 2001, NSCN K, signed a ceasefire with the government. Talks have been taking place between the rebel groups such as NSCN IM and various other small rebel groups under the banner of ‘Naga National Political groups’ (NSCN K has stayed away from peace talks) and the government since then, but without any conclusive result till now.
