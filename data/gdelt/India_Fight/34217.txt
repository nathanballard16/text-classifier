The Quetta-bound Akbar Express, which collided with a stationary freight train at the Walhar Railway Station in Punjab province of Pakistan, has claimed the lives of at least people and injured more than 70 others, with reports of fatalities continuing to come in.

The accident occurred due to the Akbar Express taking the loop line instead of the mainline track.

Deputy Commissioner Jamil Ahmed Jamil said that ‘heavy machinery was being used to rescue passengers who were stuck in the train.’

Passengers onboard the train were rescued and track clearance operations were carried out with the help of Pakistan Army personnel.
