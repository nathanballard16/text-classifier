Be ‘Pro-active’ to collect ‘Criminal Intelligence’: Mamata to police

KOLKATA: A spate of political murders, mobs turning violent after getting provoked by rumours and increasing cases of child-lifting rumours have made Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee come out with a slew of policing measures to snuff out the sources which are escalating such disturbances in West Bengal.Three Trinamool Congress workers and an MLA died after being shot at in three separate incidents; at least 22 cases of unknown persons being beaten up by violent mobs following rumours of child-lifting; and at least three persons, including a woman, being lynched have raised alarm over the past few weeks in the state.Banerjee has directed the police to play a “pro-active” role by gathering “criminal Intelligence” and making the necessary arrests. She has instructed the police to take strict action, including arrests, even if there is the slightest hint of a communal provocation.In an internal communication, dated February 22, Banerjee is learnt to have instructed the police to submit a report in this regard.She is learnt to have expressed concern over the “violent attacks on public representatives involving use of firearms” and “some motivated groups trying to disturb communal harmony and creating social tension by spreading various rumours”. Criminal intelligence to prevent such incidents must be gathered in a pro-active manner by the senior officers and the superior officers should be made aware of the situation, she said. BJP leaders, however, called these measures a ‘conspiracy’ against their party members.On December 14, a Trinamool MLA was attacked at and three Trinamool workers were shot dead in South 24 Parganas . On February 9, another Trinamool MLA was shot dead in full public view while he was attending a programme in Nadia.On February 19, a Trinamool councilor was shot at in South 24 Parganas and his condition remains critical. In the second incident, a murder complaint was lodged against BJP leader Mukul Roy and three people were arrested.
