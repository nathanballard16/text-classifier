5 dead, 29 hurt as bridge caves in South Mumbai

Mumbai: Five persons were killed and 29 injured after a major portion of a foot overbridge which connects the CSMT station with the building of a newspaper office collapsed Thursday evening, officials said. The bridge is commonly known as ‘Kasab bridge’ as the 26/11 Mumbai attack terrorist passed through it during the terror strike.

All the injured have been rushed to nearby hospitals, a disaster management cell official said. An eyewitness said when the bridge collapsed, there was a red light at the nearby signal, and that prevented the death toll from increasing.

Another eyewitness said the overbridge was being used despite repairs being carried out Thursday morning.

The incident took place around 7.30 pm when a major portion of the bridge caved in, the official informed. Some motorists who were passing beneath the bridge when it came down, were among those injured, he added.

“Fire brigade personnel reached the spot immediately and rescue work is in full swing. We have appealed the motorists to avoid the DN road to JJ flyover section,” another official at the spot said.
