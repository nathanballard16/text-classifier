Once Upon A Time In Hollywood: Not Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise was the original choice for Cliff Booth's role?

Quentin Tarantino is back to thrill us with cinematic pleasure as he gives us his next directorial titled Once Upon A Time In Hollywood. In what could be considered as the casting coup of the decade, Quentin managed to bring together Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio in the same movie, for the very first time! While Leonardo plays struggling actor Rick Dalton, Brad will be seen as Cliff Booth, Rick's handsome stunt double. But, did you know there was another A-List actor in the running for Pitt's role?

During The Happy Sad Confused podcast, Tarantino revealed that he had reached out to Top Gun: Maverick star Tom Cruise to play stuntman Cliff Booth. However, the role eventually fell into the lap of Brad. "We talked about it. He's a great guy, and we really hit it off," Quentin stated. But, don't worry folks because there could be a possibility of a future collaboration between the two Hollywood legends, as revealed by the Oscar-winning filmmaker himself, during the podcast.
