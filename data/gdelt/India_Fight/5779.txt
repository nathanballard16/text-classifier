TMC leader who had gone missing, found dead

Kolkata: Close on the heels of the murder of Trinamool Congress (TMC) MLA Satyajit Dey in West Bengal, the body of another district level leader of the same party, who had gone missing since February 7, was found in East Midnapore district, Monday.

Ritesh Roy, 45, a cooperative society chairman from Marishda village in the district, was found dead near Hooghly district’s Dadpur village, police said. His body was found from a bush beside the highway, two kilometres from Dadpur. He was taken to Chuchura Imambara hospital, where he was declared brought dead.

“There are two external injury marks on Roy’s throat and eye. Post-mortem report said he was killed by strangulation,” police said.

As usual, TMC termed the murder as a ‘political killing’ and said that the BJP was involved behind the incident.

“He was a young leader and an active member of our party. He certainly had political enemies. This is the work of BJP miscreant. Police should thoroughly investigate the matter,” West Bengal Transport Minister Subhendu Adhikari told reporters.

Family members of the deceased said they last heard Ritesh February 7 when he informed that he was in Hooghly district for some personal work.

“After we got the news from police in Hooghly, I went there and identified his body. We want strong action against the murderers,” his son said.

Police said that they have launched a probe into the matter. However, they are yet to come up with any clue.
