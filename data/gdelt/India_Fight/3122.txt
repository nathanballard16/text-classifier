Indian Air Force starts operation at Vijaynagar ALG

Our Correspondent

Itanagar: The Indian Air Force has started its normal operation at Vijaynagar Advance Landing Ground (ALG) in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh on Thursday after locals on Wednesday did not allow an IAF helicopter to land at the ALG alleging breach of agreement between them and IAF authorities.

“The normal operation with IAF load to build up Vijaynagar ALG has been restored on Thursday and based on requisition by state authority, carrying of civilian load and passengers has commenced,” Shillong-based defence spokesman Wing Commander Ratnakar Singh said in a statement.

The spokesman while responding to media reports informed that military aircraft are meant to carry out only military operations which include carrying of military personnel and load only.

“We carry civilian load and passengers, if the need arises, only on the requisition of State authorities,” Singh said.

The spokesman added that IAF has always been supporting the locals around all ALGs and border areas. However, because of some miscommunication, the official request for carriage of civilians and load was not available on Wednesday.

“IAF is committed to revive the Vijaynagar ALG for fixed wing aircraft operation which will bring great support to locals of the region,” Singh added.

The renovated Vijaynagar ALG, located on the tri-junction of India-China-Tibet, since its inauguration by the then Arunachal Pradesh Governor Gen (Retd) JJ Singh on November 18, 2011 after landing of an IAF’s AN-32 transport carrier, had turned a boon for the needy and poor people of the valley. It was one of the eight ALGs, renovated by the defence ministry under 2008 Prime Minister’s package.
