LDF condemns Sangh attack on women’s wall

‘27 people suffered injuries in attack’

The Left Democratic Front (LDF) in the Kasaragod district has alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party has lost its sanity following the massive turnout for the women’s wall.

Condemning the incidents in different parts of the district here on Tuesday, when BJP workers allegedly carried out attacks against women who arrived to join the wall, Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and LDF district convener K.P. Satheesh Chandran said at a press conference in Kasaragod here on Wednesday said that the wall was organised in an unimaginable manner surpassing the campaign of untruth launched by the Sangh Parivar. The Sangh Parivar had unleashed the attack against the women who came to join the wall, Mr. Chandran said.

The CPI(M) leader said that 27 people, including 15 women, four each media persons, police personnel, and LDF workers had suffered injuries in the attack.

The injuries suffered by two women were serious and they had been admitted in a Mangaluru hospital, he said, adding that the other injured were undergoing treatment in Kasaragod.

He said the incidents of attack had occurred mainly at Chettukundu, Kuthirappadi, Thattummal, and Kattumadam.

The troublemakers had also thrown chilli powder at women who assembled for the wall and then set afire the dry grass between the railway track and the National Highway and threw stones and set off bombs, he said.

Many buses that transported the participants of the wall campaign had also come under attack.
