Iran echoes Indian position on role of Pak-supported suicide bombers

NEW DELHI: Iran's all powerful Revolutionary Guards has accused Pakistan of supporting the perpetrators of a suicide bombing that killed 27 troops on Wednesday, echoing similar sentiments as India following suicide attack on CRPF personnel on Thursday."Pakistan's government, who has housed these anti-revolutionaries and threats to Islam, knows where they are and they are supported by Pakistan's security forces," said Revolutionary Commander Major General Mohammad Ali Jafari , referring to terror group Jaish al-Adl ("Army of Justice")."If (the Pakistan government) does not punish them, we will retaliate against this anti-revolutionary force, and whatever Pakistan sees will be the consequence of its support for them," Ali Jafri warned.There is a pattern in back to back terror attacks on Iran and India -- both orchestrated from Pakistan. Both Delhi and Tehran came to each other's support hours after the attack.The Revolutionary Guards chief made the remarks in IIsfahan City on Friday evening during a farewell ceremony held for those killed.Why is it that till now neither PM Imran Khan nor FM Querishi who keep sprouting their wisdom on India have condemned the attack?," an expert on Indo-Pak affairs pointed out.Imran Khan has in fact said nothing at all. It appears that civilian leadership had no clue and appear to be scrambling to put together a response, the above quoted expert noted.Jaish al-Adl was formed in 2012 as a successor to the Sunni terror group Jundallah (Soldiers of God).The Wednesday bombing targeted a busload of Revolutionary Guards in the volatile southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan, bordering Pakistan. Chabahar port operated by India is based in Sistan-Baluchistan.The attack was one of the deadliest on Iranian security forces in recent years and came just days after Iran held more than a week of celebrations for the 40th anniversary of the Islamic Revolution."We will certainly follow retaliatory measures," Jafri said, without elaborating.Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has linked the perpetrators of the attack to "the spying agencies of some regional and trans-regional countries". ET reported on Saturday that Pulwama attack bore the stamp of new ISI head.The troops killed in the bombing belonged to the Guards' 14th Imam Hussein Division based in Isfahan province, according to Tasnim news agency.In early December two people were killed and around 40 others wounded in Chabahar, in an attack which Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif blamed on "foreign-backed terrorists".In October, Jaish al-Adl claimed responsibility for abducting 12 Iranian security personnel near the border with Pakistan.Meanwhile former Pakistani envoy to USA Husain Haqqani not only condemned the Pulwama terror attack but also slammed those Pakistanis who were offering arguments justifying terrorism.
