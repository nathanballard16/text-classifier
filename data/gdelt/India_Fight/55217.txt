The armies of India and Pakistan on Wednesday exchanged fire along the Line of Control in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district on Wednesday.

Reports said that the exchange triggered panic in three villages. Some residents in Silikote were shifted to safer places in Uri.

“A few families were shifted from shelling-hit areas to Uri. They were given accommodation,” reports quoted an official as saying.

The police said intermittent firing and shelling continued for several hours.
