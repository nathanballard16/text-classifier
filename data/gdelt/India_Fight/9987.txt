Chandrababu Naidu hails air strikes

Amaravati: Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday hailed the Indian Air Force strikes across the Line of Control targeting terrorist camps. "Hail the efforts of Indian Air Force," tweeted Naidu.

A senior official said the AP government has conveyed to the Union government that the state government stands firmly behind the Centre in any action taken in the interest of the nation.

According to highly-placed sources in the state Home department, this message was conveyed to the Centre, when New Delhi asked the state to be on alert against the backdrop of air strikes on the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror campus.

The source said, "The alert is specific to keep the state apparatus along the nine coastal districts in a state of preparedness to meet any contingency since the state has strategic assets like ports on its 900-km maritime corridor.

The alert keeps free intelligence flow between the state and the Centre," he added. Following this, both the private and state ports located at Krishnapatnam, Kakinada, Visakhapatnam and other small towns have been put on alert.

On the other, the coastal police and state and central intelligence wings are working in tandem on the shore-side to verify any unusual or suspicious activities along the coastline, he clarified.
