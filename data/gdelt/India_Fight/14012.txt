The attack by opposition parties in Indian politics has continued over the February 26 air strike in the terror camps of Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan occupied Kashmir.

Addressing to a rally in Greater Noida prime minister Narendra Modi said Saturday the strike surprised Pakistan as the neighbor was expecting another surgical strike could be on card following Pulwama attack by JeM terror outfit on February 14.

Modi accused previous government for not responding to the 26/11 Mumbai attacks in which more than 200 people were killed.

Modi asked – What did the previous government do? Should they change their Home Minister or their policy?

Following the 26/11 terror attacks the UPA government had to change Home Minister.

Modi added, “Pakistan is saying that Modi attacked. And here, people lost their sleep. They began at 7-8 am asking, is Balakot in India or Pakistan? Is it in PoK or next to our Kashmir? It has not even been investigated.”

The prime minister praised government for surprising neighboring nation with changed tactics in attacking terror camps in PoK.

Modi said, “We answered the terrorists and their leaders in the language they understand, after the Uri attack. Will you accept a government which sleeps? Will you accept a chaukidar who sleeps? You need a chaukidar who is awake.”
