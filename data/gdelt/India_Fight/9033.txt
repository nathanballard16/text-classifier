Jammu, February 23

The Concerned Citizens Group (CCG) has appealed to the Central government to safeguard the Kashmiris living across the country.

In a statement issued here on Saturday, the CCG said: “At a time when the nation is passing through trying circumstances, we appeal that the government must not take any steps which detract from the constitutional framework of the country or the universally accepted principles of rule of law.”

Former Union Minister Yashwant Sinha, Wajahat Habibullah, Sushobha Barve, Air Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak and Bharat Bhushan are part of the group.

“It is imperative that no innocent Kashmiri, within J&K or in the rest of India, is made to feel insecure or unsafe. In this context, the recent pronouncements of the Supreme Court have brought much solace,” the statement read.

Former minister’s vehicle torched

Angry youth on Saturday torched the vehicle of former minister and People’s Conference leader Abdul Gani Vakil in Baramulla district. The police said the vehicle was attacked by a mob when it passed through a village in Baramulla district, where the funeral of a militant was being held.

“Vakil escaped unhurt with the help of the police. The mob, however, torched the vehicle,” the police said. IANS
