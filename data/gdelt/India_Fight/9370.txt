When 'Yeh Un Dinon Ki Baat Hai' actors Randeep Rai and Ashi Singh almost got MARRIED in real life

Sony TV’s ‘Yeh Un Dinon Ki Baat Hai’ is one of the most loved shows on the small screen. The romantic saga starring Randeep Rai and Ashi Singh is currently focusing on the wedding track of Sameer and Naina. Fans have been eagerly waiting for the two lovebirds to get married. The cast and crew are shooting non-stop to deliver entertaining episodes for the viewers. A hilarious incident took place on the sets of the show, leaving the actors in splits. Randeep and Ashi would have got married for real if Randeep’s brother didn’t intervene. The two actors were deeply engrossed in shooting and they didn’t realize they had to stop after three rounds during the pheras. It was Randeep’s brother, who reminded the director that Randeep and Ashi were about to complete five pheras. In case, he wouldn’t have informed the director, Ashi and Randeep would have got married in real life. This is what we call- ‘When reel turns into real’, isn’t it?
