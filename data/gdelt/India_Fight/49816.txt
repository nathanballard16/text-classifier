Train fire leaves 73 dead in Pakistan

ISLAMABAD: At least 73 people were killed and 45 injured when a train travelling from Pakistan ’s southern port city of Karachi to the garrison city of Rawalpindi caught fire on Thursday morning.The accident took place in Liaquatabad near the town of Rahim Yar Khan, about 150km from the city of Multan, in the south of Punjab province. Many passengers were Islamist preachers heading to Raiwind in Lahore for one of Pakistan’s largest annual religious congregations, organised by the Tableeghi Jamaat, a missionary movement of Sunni Muslims.Railways minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the fire was caused by the explosion of a portable gas cylinder carried by the passengers for cooking meals during their travel.“Two gas cylinders exploded. The passengers were preparing breakfast. They had cooking oil which added fuel to fire,” Ahmed said, adding that people using stoves in trains to cook meals on long journeys is a common problem.While some officials claimed that many of the victims had died when they tried to jump off the train after a fire engulfed it, Ahmed said many people saved their lives by jumping off the train.In a video message, the railways minister announced a compensation of Rs 1.5 million for the heirs of the dead and Rs 500,000 for those who were injured.District deputy commissioner Jamil Ahmed said some of the victims were so badly burnt they could not be identified, and they would need to use DNA to find out who had died.Prime Minister Imran Khan said he was “deeply saddened by the terrible tragedy”.In a post on Twitter, Khan said that he had ordered an immediate inquiry.The train running from Karachi to Rawalpindi, is called Tezgam. It is one of Pakistan’s oldest and most popular train services, which runs daily and covers the distance between Karachi and Rawalpindi in 25-and-a-half hours.Pakistan’s aging railway system, which is still based in many areas on colonial-era infrastructure, has a history of accidents with multiple deaths. The casualty figures are often so high as trains usually carry far more passengers than they were actually designed for.This was the third major train accident in the country in the past five months. In July, a train collision in Sadiqabad had killed more than 20 people.In June, three people were killed when a passenger train hit a freight car near Hyderabad in Sind province. At the time, Rashid had accepted responsibility and sought an apology from the nation.
