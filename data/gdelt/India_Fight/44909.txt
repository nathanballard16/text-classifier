Air Force bases in Kashmir on high alert after intel inputs on terror strike

New Delhi: India is on high alert after intelligence inputs have come in regarding a terror plan which targets Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and National Security Adviser (NSA) Ajit Doval. Home Ministry sources stated here Wednesday that the terror threat is for 30 cities in India. Indian Air Force (IAF) sources have also confirmed a serious security threat to frontline bases following multi-agency inputs.

An ‘orange alert’, which is a notch lower than the highest state of emergency, is in place at important installations and security has been tightened on IAF bases in Srinagar, Awantipora, Jammu, Pathankot and Hindon.

According to the intelligence inputs the Pakistan-based terror group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has been plotting a suicide attack on air bases. The inputs include a threat letter dated 10 September, received by the Bureau of Civil Aviation Security. The letter has been written in Hindi by Shamsher Wani of JeM and he has said that he will take revenge for the government’s Article 370 decision.

Sources have said that the JeM is angling for high-value targets in retaliation. They said that there is a possibility that at least one important installation may be hit and it could likely be an air base, if only to slow down activity.

It has been reported that a large number of AK-47 assault rifles, grenades and sat phones were dropped in Amritsar by heavy-lifting drones that came from Pakistan. Punjab police sources say the consignment was meant to stir trouble in Jammu and Kashmir.

The drones carried out eight ‘sorties’ in the last week or 10 days to drop weapons and satellite phones, on Indian soil. The recovery of the satellite phones, which are banned in India for civilian use, is a giveaway that the weapons were meant to be delivered to terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir.
