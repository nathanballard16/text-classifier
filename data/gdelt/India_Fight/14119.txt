First Indo-Pak Kartarpur meeting on March 14

The first meeting between India and Pakistan to discuss and finalise the modalities for Kartarpur Corridor would be held at Attari-Wagah (Indian side) on March 14.



India has also proposed that a technical level discussion on the alignment of the corridor be held on the same day on the sidelines of this meeting, said the Ministry of External Affairs in a statement.

Pakistan has said that it would send a delegation to India on March 14 to discuss a draft agreement for setting up a corridor to facilitate visa-free visit of Sikh pilgrims to Gurdwara Kartarpur Sahib. The development comes at a time when the relationship between the two countries is fraught with tension over a militant attack in Pulwama that killed 40 CRPF troopers, subsequent Indian airstrikes in Pakistan, and a fierce air engagement between the two countries.
