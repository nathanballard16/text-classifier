Seven held in Noida farmhouse for raping three women

NOIDA: Seven persons have been arrested for allegedly raping three Delhi-based women at a farmhouse in Noida’s Sector 135 area, close to the venue of a pool party from where 192 youngsters were arrested last month.The women, who police said were sex workers, had been brought to Noida by two of the accused, but they were later joined by seven others, who forced themselves on to the women against their wish. Seven of the men were arrested from HPS farmhouse area in Chhaprauli village.Police said the farmhouse belongs to an official in Delhi’s transport department, Panchpal Singh.One of the arrested men, Lovkesh Yadav, works as a security guard at the farmhouse, which was sealed by the police under Section 102 of the CrPC.The women lodged a complaint at Expressway police station on Wednesday morning, alleging that around 11.30 pm on Tuesday, they were standing near Lajpat Nagar metro station when two men arrived in a cab — a white Swift Dzire (DL1ZC0576).“The women told police that they reached an agreement for Rs 9,000,” Gautam Budh Nagar SSP Vaibhav Krishna said.The men apparently told the women they would take them to Sector 18 and handed over an advance of Rs 3,600, but instead took them to the HPS farmhouse in Sector 135. There, seven people joined them, which was not part of the deal, police said.“Seeing nine men, the women raised objection and asked the men to leave them back to Delhi. However, the accused men forcibly had sex with them,” the SSP said.After much pleading, one of the accused left the women on Pusta road on a bike, after which they approached the cops.Based o the complaint, an FIR was lodged against the accused men under IPC sections 376(d) and 323.A team from the Expressway police station raided the farmhouse and arrested seven of the accused — Akhilesh Yadav, Lovkesh Yadav, Bhola Yadav, Anjan Yadav, Rajesh Yadav , Satish Pal and Rajkumar Maurya.
