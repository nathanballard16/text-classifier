Female constable dies in mysterious circumstances in Bihar

A 30-year-old female constable, posted at Police Lines in Patna, was found dead at her ancestral home here on Tuesday under mysterious circumstances, police said.

The deceased has been identified as Arti Kumari, who was supposed to get married in December this year, and her family members have claimed that she died upon slipping off a ladder leaning against her house in the districts Kahalgaon sub- division, said Sub Divisional Police Officer Reshu Krishna.

As per the statements given by her family members, Artis parents were agriculturists by profession and out in the fields while she was at home along with a younger, mentally unstable sister, Krishna said.

They said she had come home a fortnight ago after obtaining leave from July 23 to August 08, but was not keeping well and had hence sent an application for extending her leave on medical grounds, Krishna said.

Prima facie, no injury marks were found on her body which makes us doubt the family members claim that she had fallen off a ladder. We will be able to ascertain the cause of her death after receiving the post mortem report, the SDPO said.

Meanwhile, speculations were rife among residents of the locality that the policewoman had been depressed for some time and may have committed suicide by hanging herself from the ceiling.
