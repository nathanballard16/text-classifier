Leaders who looted J&K for 40 years will be behind bars now: BJP working president JP Nadda

Launching an attack on People's Democratic Party (PDP), National Conference (NC) and the Congress, BJP working president Jagat Prakash Nadda on Friday said that leaders who looted Jammu and Kashmir for 40 years will now be behind bars.

"106 Indian laws were not applicable in Kashmir. Only three families were looting J&K and used to incite separatism as there was no Prevention of Corruption Act. There was no auditing system in place. Now, the enquiry of J&K Bank has started. Those leaders who have looted J&K for 40 yrs will be sent to jail," Nadda said while addressing an election rally in Jharkhand.

Jharkhand will go to polls in five phases from November 30.

On August 5, the Narendra Modi government made the monumental decision to change the status of Jammu and Kashmir. Through a Presidential Order, the government declared that Article 370 would cease to be operative, and specifically overrode a previous order that made Article 35A a part of the Constitution of India, thereby ending the special status accorded to the region.

Soon after the Article 370 abrogation, several regional political leaders were put under detention by the Jammu and Kashmir administration and restrictions imposed on the movement of people, vehicles, telephone, mobile phones and internet.

On October 31, Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) and Ladakh officially became two Union Territories, three months after the Centre bifurcated the J&K state into two union territories, revoking J&K's special status.
