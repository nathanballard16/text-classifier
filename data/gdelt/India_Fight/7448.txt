Rajasthan: Khetri braveheart among martyrs in J&K

Days after forty jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were killed in a terror attack by a fidayeen terrorist, the Indian Army initiated an operation to neutralize terrorists hiding in Pulwama area of Jammu. While the operation successfully neutralized Jaish-e-Mohammad terrorists, it resulted in loss of four armymen, including a hawaldar from Jhunjhunu district of Rajasthan.

The security forces had received inputs about presence of terrorists in Pinglena village of Pulwama district where the operation was launched in the wee hours.

Four army officials – Major Vibhuti Shankar Dhoundiyal, Sepoy Hari Singh, Sepoy Ajay Kumar and Hawaldar Sheo Ram – attained martyrdom after suffering gunshot injuries.

Of the martyrs, Hawaldar Sheo Ram was from Rajasthan. Sheo Ram was a native of Tibba Basat village under Khetri tehsil of Jhunjhunu district. The four armymen are from the 55 Rashtriya Rifles and after the news of his martyrdom reached his village, the whole village is drowned in a sombre mood.

Villagers stopped cooking food since morning, an act undertaken when someone in the family passes away and made a beeline for Sheo Ram’s home where they tried to console the family members. Sheo Ram’s wife – Sunita Devi – is in a state of shock as are the other family members of the hawaldar.After Sheo Ram sustained gunshot injuries, he was rushed to Army’s Base hospital in Srinagar, however the jawan could not be saved, army sources said.

The mortal remains of Hawaldar Sheo Ram were sent by plane to Jaipur where the plane landed around 8 pm. After a wreath laying at the airport, the mortal remains were taken to his native village by road. The cremation of the martyr will be conducted on Tuesday with full military honours.

Notably, in the past one week, six jawans – all natives of Rajasthan – have been martyred in Pulwama.
