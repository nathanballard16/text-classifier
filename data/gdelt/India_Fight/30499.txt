Indian army vehicle attacked again in restive India-administered Kashmir

An army vehicle was targeted with an improvised explosive device on Monday in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama, where a convoy of the Central Reserve Police Force was attacked by a suicide bomber in February. There is no report of casualty. An encounter is on, sources said.

The armoured vehicle of the 44 Rashtriya Rifles was attacked near the Arihal village of Pulwama.

Reports say the Casper vehicle got damaged in the attack. Soon after, heavy firing and stone pelting started.

The attack comes hours after an encounter with terrorists in Anantnag in south Kashmir, in which an Army major was killed and three soldiers were injured.

The soldiers came under fire during a cordon and search operation in Achabal.

The injured, among whom there is another Major, have been rushed to the 92 base hospital of the Army in Srinagar, officials said. The encounter is still on.

A police inspector who got injured during an encounter in Anantnag last week, died at a Delhi hospital yesterday. Arshad Ahmed Khan, who sustained a bullet injury, was sent to the premier All India Institute of Medical Sciences for treatment.

Terrorists had opened fire on a CRPF patrol team in the city on Wednesday, killing five soldiers. Mr Khan reached the spot in a bullet-proof vehicle. As soon as he stepped down, he was shot at.
