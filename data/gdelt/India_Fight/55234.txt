A gym owner from Delhi, on the run after allegedly murdering his girlfriend and a cab driver, has been arrested from Gujarat.

Hemant Lamba, an international-level bodybuilder and a fitness expert, had allegedly shot his 22-year-old girlfriend in the head four times in Haryana's Rewari district on Saturday. After disposing the body in a secluded area, he fled in a cab, police said.

The girl, a native from Hanumangarh in Rajasthan, was living with her father at their relative's house in Delhi's Rohini area.

After the murder, Hemant Lamba, who was traveling in the cab, forced its driver Devendra at gunpoint to take him to Jaipur, police said. The bodybuilder then shot the cab driver as well.

He then drove down to Valsad in Gujarat and wanted to sell the car. He came in contact with a local car dealer named Alpesh, who was alarmed after seeing the urgency of Hemant Lamba to sell the car.

The dealer noticed a phone number on the rear windscreen of the car. When he called that number, the wife of the cab driver, picked up the phone. After coming to know the reality, the dealer contacted the police, who then arrested the accused, police said.
