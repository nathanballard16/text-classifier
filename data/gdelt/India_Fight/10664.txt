#BringBackAbhinandan: Tweeple demand Narendra Modi government to bring back Indian Air Force Wing Commander

#BringBackAbhinandan: After Pakistan shared the video of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, people of Indi started demanding to bring him back from Narendra Modi-led Indian government. The hashtags #Abhinandan, #BringBackAbhinandan and #BringAbhinandanBack have been trending on the internet and people are tweeting to bring him back safely.

#BringBackAbhinandan: As the news of the Indian Air Force Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman’s arrest went viral, the people of the country started demanding to bring him back. The demands seem to have been taken into consideration as the Indian High Commission on Wednesday summoned Pakistan High Commission to ensure their demand is taken care of. In response, Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has told the Pakistani media that Abhinandan will be released after de-escalation of the India-Pakistan situation.

The tweeple have been requesting the Indian government to bring Varthaman back using hashtags like #Abhinandan, #BringBackAbhinandan and #BringAbhinandanBack. Indian Air Force soldier was flying the fighter jet, which was hit by Pakistan and later they captured by pilot, reports. To back their words, Pakistan’s Imran Khan government also shared a video on social media sites. The reports say that the Wing Commander Abhinandan took off in a MiG 21 Bison jet on Wednesday.

The Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Raveesh Kumar today said that one Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft was shot down by Indian Air Force. In this engagement, India lost one MiG 21 fighter jet and a Pilot was missing after the action. Pakistan had claimed that the missing Wing Commander is in their custody.

Previously, during the Kargil war in 1999 Indian Air Force pilot Captain K Nachiketa was captured by Pakistani soldiers after he ejected himself from aircraft due to engine failure. India had approached the United Nations to ensure Nachiketa’s safe release. After eight days of strenuous torture, the Air Force pilot was released. Post his release Nachiketa spoke about the torture inflicted on him by Pakistan to decipher confidential information from him.

The video released by Pakistan government shows Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman refusing to answer all the questions asked by Pakistan’s officers. The Braveheart did not share any details related to his operation, the fighter jet he was flying and other secret information about the country.”I’m sorry, sir… That’s all I’m supposed to tell you,” said the Abhinandan Varthaman.
