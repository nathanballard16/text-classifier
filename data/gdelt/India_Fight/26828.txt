Teenager found hanging from tree, kin cry foul

Ghaziabad: The body of a 15-year-old youth was found hanging from a tree amid sugarcane fields at Nidori village in Ghaziabad’s Masuri area on Wednesday. While police said that he had committed suicide, his family alleged that he was murdered.

The deceased, identified as Kishore, was a student of Class X at a private school.

A farmer informed police at 3 pm about the body hanging from a tree, Om Prakash Singh, SHO, Masuri police station, said.

“It looks like a suicide case. Police did not find any external marks of injuries. The boy used his gamchha (shawl) to commit suicide,” he said. He added that the body had been sent for an autopsy, and police will take further action once the report comes.

Singh also said that no suicide note had been found and the reason behind the death was not yet clear.

Kishore’s relative Raghu told TOI that the teenager had told the family he was going to meet a friend in the vicinity. He left his house around 1 pm, he added. “Around 4pm we came to know that he committed suicide by hanging himself from a tree,” he said.

Raghu raised suspicions over Kishore’s death. “Someone has killed our child. Why would he take this extreme step when he was living his life comfortably? Police should find the culprit, otherwise we will protest,” he said.
