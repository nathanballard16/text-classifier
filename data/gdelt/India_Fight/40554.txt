Congress alleges ‘murder of democracy’ as it steps out in PC’s defence

NEW DELHI: A combative Congress attacked the Modi government on Thursday, accusing it of committing a daylight murder of democracy and the rule of law by arresting in a “vindictive, selective and malicious manner” former finance minister P Chidambaram After it’s show of solidarity for Chidambaram hours before he was arrested by the CBI, Congress alleged brazen personal and political vendetta against Chidambaram, and claimed that the government was resorting to such dramatic measures to divert attention from the failing economy, the growing job losses and big and small businesses shutting down.“With the narrative on a sinking economy spiralling out of their control, massive and unprecedented job losses, shocking devaluation of the rupee as Asia’s worst performing currency and unfathomable crisis in all sectors leading to shutting down of factories and trade, we now see the depths to which a desperate Modi Government 2.0 will stoop to divert the nation’s attention,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.The party also reiterated Chidambaram’s defence of the day before, that neither he nor his family were accused in the INX media case.“A seasoned man with 40 years of dedicated public life is jailed on the basis of a comment by a woman who is convicted for murdering her own daughter,” Surjewala said, adding that even after more than five years, the authorities are unable to come out with any clear or precise allegation or a compelling case against Chidambaram.Even as other political parties like Trinamool Congress and CPM said the law should take its course and refrained from defending Chidambaram, commenting only on the objectionable manner in which Chidambaram was arrested, Congress reiterated the former minister’s innocence.“We have faith that the Rule of Law, which is under attack from the ruling BJP government, shall prevail and the life and liberty enshrined in the Constitution will not become a dead letter,” Congress said.
