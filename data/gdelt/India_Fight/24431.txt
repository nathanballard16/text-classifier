MUMBAI: Donkeys don't seem to be living for donkey's years in the state. The state animal husbandry department has written to all collectors alerting them about the dwindling donkey population and asked them to take preventive measures.According to the animal census in 2012, the latest year for which figures are available, there were 29,135 donkeys in Maharashtra , a fall of over 9% from 32,070 in 2007. The circular issued on May 4 says if steps are not taken, one day donkeys may become extinct.Donkeys are sometimes worked to death. "Donkeys are often over-exploited by their owners, who do very little towards their upkeep. It is one of the biggest reasons for their early deaths," said an official.But there seems to be several more dangers lurking for the ultimate beast of burden. In a meeting, Union minister Maneka Gandhi, who is also an animal rights activist, had raised the issue of illegal slaughter of donkeys. The circular mentions that there have been cases in which donkeys have been illegally slaughtered and their blood and organs used in animal feed.Also, their skin and blood are used in some countries to treat cancer and for other medicinal purpose. "We have not found any such case in the state, but have asked police officials to be alert," said the official. Illegal slaughtering of any animal is a crime under the Prevention of Cruelty Act, 1960."We have informed the collector as he heads the district-level Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA). The collectors will take police assistance to ensure that donkeys are saved in the state," said Dr Prashant Bhad, deputy commissioner of the animal husbandry department.
