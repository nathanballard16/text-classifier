Rajasthan Districts That Were Facing Acute Water Crisis Now Have Enough Supply For Two Years

Residents of Tonk, Ajmer and Jaipur in Rajasthan, who were staring at acute water crisis just about a month ago, now have enough to last for over two years taking care of their drinking and irrigation needs.

In July, the water level of Bisalpur Dam stood at a meagre 5 per cent and is now certain to breach the mark and force authorities to open dam gates.

Authorities in Tonk district have been alerted and have asked residents of low-lying areas to remain cautious.

Currently, there is 890.844 cusec metres against the full capacity of 1095.840 cusec metres, which translates to almost 81 per cent.

People were seen parking their vehicles along the pipeline as they thronged the dam in large numbers. People from several districts flocked to the dam site site in anticipation that all the gates of the dam would be opened.

“It was drizzling all the way from Ajmer to Bisalpur and we thought that authorities might open dam gates,” Ashok Jain who came with his family told The Times of India.

Dam authorities have told the district administration and local police that it might open the gates as the level was still rising. “We have alerted the local blocks, tehsils and officials at low-lying areas that the gates might be opened to release extra water by Sunday evening,” an engineer at the dam told TOI.

Authorities of public health and engineering (PHED) and water resources are positive with the current water situation in the area after it had battled severe lack of it.

“Triveni river is our gauge to judge how much water we can receive at the dam. After August 15, the water flow in Triveni had risen by 3 metres to 5 metres. On Saturday morning, it suddenly started flowing at 7.25 metres, which initially gave us an impression that we will have to open the gates by Saturday afternoon,” Manish Bansal, assistant engineer posted at the dam, told TOI.
