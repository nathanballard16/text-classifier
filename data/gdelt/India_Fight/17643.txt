Thane police camp in village close to Bangladesh border to nab bar girl's killer

The Thane police crime branch have cracked a case of a bar girl's murder. The victim, identified as Mim, was found murdered at her house in Mumbai's Dombivali in May last year.

The woman's phone was also missing from the scene. Her neighbours said that she stayed with her live-in partner who had gone missing. This left the investigators with no clues of her killer.



The central unit of Thane crime branch had kept the International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) of Mim's phone on surveillance and as soon as it was switched on they found that it was used early this month.

A team from Thane police left for the village which was located at the Bangladesh border in West Bengal. The police team apprehended a person identified as Raj Mandal who was using Mim's phone.

During the questioning, the accused revealed the phone was handed over to him by his friend Majid Mandal. Investigators found that Majid was in a relationship with Mim, whose real name was Farida Khatun. Mim was the name by which she was known at the bar where used to perform. She was also from the same village as Majid and Raj.

When the police team camped in the village till, they found that Majid was moving towards Delhi and then went to Mumbai. His cell tower location finally revealed that he was in Thane's Mumbra.

The police team left from West Bengal and reached Mumbra where they nabbed Majid. Majid confessed of killing the victim as she was forcing him to marry her but he refused to.

On May 1 last year, the victim and her boyfriend, Majid, got into a heated argument during which he strangled her to death.

He locked the house from outside and left no trace of his clothes or any of his belongings at the house. He also took away the victim's phone so nothing could connect him to the murder.

Majid has been remanded to police custody till April 1.
