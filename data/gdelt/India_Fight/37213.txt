BJP expels lawmaker accused of rape

A 19-year-old who accused a powerful legislator of rape is fighting for her life following a deadly car crash, in a case that has led to an outpouring of support across India after she had warned of a threat to her life.

The woman, who cannot be named under Indian law and was 17 at the time of the alleged rape, was travelling with her two aunts and lawyer from Unnao to Rae Bareli in the central state of Uttar Pradesh when their car was hit by a truck with blacked-out licence plates.

Her two relatives were killed in the accident on Sunday while she and her lawyer Mahendra Singh remain in a critical condition.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is investigating whether Kuldeep Singh Sengar, a member of the legislative assembly in Uttar Pradesh who has been in jail on the rape charge since last year, instigated the crash.

Sengar was expelled from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) yesterday.

The case has shone a light on the struggle of rape victims to get justice in India.

The Supreme Court yesterday ordered federal investigators to conclude a probe into the accident within two weeks and conclude the trial in the cases of rape, intimidation and murder within 45 days.

The court had taken note of a letter written by the victim and her family before the crash to Chief Justice of India Ranjan Gogoi, highlighting intimidation and threats from Sengar.

The Supreme Court also ordered the transfer of the five cases related to rape and murders out of Uttar Pradesh, where the legislator remains an influential political figure, to Delhi and payment of 2.5 million rupees (S$49,700) as interim compensation by the Uttar Pradesh government to the family.
