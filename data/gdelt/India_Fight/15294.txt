HYDERABAD: A 30-year-old software engineer and a 47-year-old restaurateur from India are among those killed in the horrific terror attacks at two mosques in New Zealand on Friday.The death of Fahraj Ahsan, who worked as a software engineer in Christchurch , was confirmed by sources on Saturday as the authorities began shifting the bodies after the preliminary investigation. He is survived by his wife and two children.A pall of gloom descended on his family's house in Telangana after they received the news of his death.“We are aware of his death but were waiting for an official confirmation,” a family member told TOI.His name was listed among those missing on the international red cross's website. Some Muslim organisations, however, put out a list of victims of the mosque attacks which included Ahsan's name.Ahsan graduated as an engineer in electronics and communications from Osmania University and pursued his masters from Auckland University of Technology in New Zealand before settling there.Authorities have also confirmed the death of Mohammed Imran Khan, an Indian-origin man from Telangana, in the attack. Khan was living in Christchurch with his family and owned a restaurant there.Meanwhile, Ahmed Iqbal Jahangir from Hyderabad, who was injured in the attack, is recovering at a hospital in Christchurch following an operation. “He is out of danger,” a family member who lives in Hyderabad told TOI.Family members of Fahraj Ahsan, Mohammed Imran Khan and Ahmed Iqbal Jahangir are travelling to New Zealand.At least 49 worshippers were killed on Friday in attacks on the Al Noor Mosque in central Christchurch and the Linwood Mosque in the city's outer suburb, in what appeared to be the worst attack on Muslims in a western country.
