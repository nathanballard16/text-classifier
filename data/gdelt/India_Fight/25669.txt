Salman Khan took over two hours to look old in ‘Bharat’! Helmed by Zafar, the film is produced by Atul Agnihotri, Bhushan Kumar, and Krishan Kumar. Apart from Salman Khan, the film also stars Katrina Kaif, who plays the female protagonist in the film, and Jackie Shroff, who essays the role of Salman's father. The cast list also includes Sunil Grover, Nora Fatehi, Disha Patani and Tabu in pivotal roles. 'Bharat' is scheduled to release on June 5.

Recreating scenes from the partition of India and Pakistan was the most challenging part of shooting 'Bharat', revealed director Ali Abbas Zafar. Tweeting pictures from the sets of his upcoming Salman Khan-starrer film, Zafar wrote, "Partition was the most challenging part of Bharat_TheFilm shoot, to recreate the scale of this defining moment of history and to keep the emotions Zinda in the middle of that chaos ..is the soul of an extraordinary journey of an ordinary man #BHARAT."The pictures feature Jacky Shroff, among a large group of people, struggling to board a train. A similar scene also features in the trailer of the film.
