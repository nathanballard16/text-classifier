Nokia 2.2 vs Nokia 2.1: What has changed?

The Nokia 2.2 is now official in India and it succeeds last year's Nokia 2.1. As a refreshed model in the Nokia 2 series, we expected to see changes to the design, hardware and software and HMD Global has delivered that and a lot more. The Nokia 2.2 looks like it belongs in 2019 and is a pretty major upgrade in the Nokia 2 series.

Not only does the Nokia 2.2 bring a new waterdrop display to the Nokia 2 lineup for the first time, but it also moves away from Android Go and embraces the Android One program. This also means that the Nokia 2.2 is now the most affordable Android One phone in the market with a starting price of Rs 6,999.

But just how different is the Nokia 2.2 from the Nokia 2.1, and are the changes enough to make Nokia 2.1 users upgrade? Let's take a quick look at what the two phones bring.

-- Starting with the design, both the Nokia 2.1 and Nokia 2.1 use budget materials like plastic polycarbonate to cover the back. The difference is that the Nokia 2.1 offered a matt-like textured finish on the back with copper or silver accents around the frame and he rear camera module, while the Nokia 2.2 gets a plastic unibody cover that is glossy and removable so that you can interchange it with Xpress On covers.

-- The front is where you see the biggest change. The Nokia 2.1 was launched with a 5.5-inch HD dipslay with a traditional 16:9 aspect ratio and plenty of bezels on the top and bottom. The Nokia 2.2, on the other hand, brings a teardrop notch display like the Nokia 4.2. The top bezel has been reduced to a droplet notch, allowing for more screen real estate without increasing the footprint. In fact, the Nokia 2.2 manages to offer a 5.7-inch HD+ display in a more compact form factor compared to the Nokia 2.1.

-- Hardware has been improved as well. While the Nokia 2.1 offered a 1.4GHz quad-core chipset with 1GB of RAM, the Nokia 2.1 gets a 2GHz Helio A22 processor with 2GB and 3GB of RAM. The top variant of the Nokia 2.2 also gets you more storage. Overall, the Nokia 2.2 should offer a faster and smoother performance in comparison to the Nokia 2.1.

-- WIth the upgrade in hardware, the Nokia 2.2 also becomes part of the Android One program like most other Nokia phones. To recall, the Nokia 2.1 with 1GB of RAM was an Android Go phone that shipped with Android Oreo (Go edition) software with preloaded and optimised Google Go-based apps. The Nokia 2.2 now gets a full version of Android Pie with all its bells and whistles.

-- The Nokia 2.2 also gets an extra button on the frame. In addition to the power and volume buttons, the Nokia 2.2 also gets a dedicated Google Assistant button that will launch the AI with a single tap. The Google Assistant button was first introduced on the Nokia 4.2 and Nokia 3.2 and it looks like the company will be bringing it to more and more Nokia phones. Another new feature is face unlock which comes to the Nokia 2 series for the first time.

-- The main camera has been upgraded as well from an 8MP sensor to a 13MP sensor with LED flash support. The front camera of the Nokia 2.2 remains the same at 5MP as the Nokia 2.1.

-- The big highlight, however, is the AI low-light fusion feature that comes to the Nokia 2.2. This is what the company is calling its low-light long exposure mode that will allow for brighter shots in low-light settings by slowing down the shutter speed.

-- The one area where the Nokia 2.2 takes a hit is in the battery department. The Nokia 2.1 offered a 4,000mAh battery, which allowed for a two-day battery life, but the Nokia 2.2 gets a smaller 3,000mAh battery. We won't be able to tell whether this results in a poorer battery life until a full review of the Nokia 2.2 so do stay tuned for that.

-- Apart from the battery, it's easy to see that the Nokia 2.2 is a pretty substantial upgrade over the Nokia 2.1. The introductory pricing looks attractive, but it will be interesting to see how consumers take to the Nokia 2.2 once the actual starting price of Rs 7,699 kicks in.
