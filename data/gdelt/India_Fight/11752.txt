Luka Chuppi full HD movie leaked by TamilRockers for download within hours of release

Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon's Luka Chuppi has got great reviews. The film has also managed to bag Rs 8 crore in just two days of its release.

While Luka Chuppi is setting the cash registers ringing, the film has fallen victim to piracy. The film has been leaked by Tamilrockers.

Recently, films like Gully Boy, Petta, Viswasam, Uri: The Surgical Strike, Manikarnika: The Queen of Jhansi and The Accidental Prime Minister were also leaked on the site.

India Today critic Samrudhi Ghosh gave 3.5 stars to the film.

Lauding Kriti and Kartik for their performances, the reviewer wrote - Kartik Aaryan and Kriti Sanon have an undeniably cute chemistry and deliver competent performances, although they look a bit too slick to be from a small town.

Director Laxman Utekar captures the eccentricities of a small town to perfection and thanks to its crisp run-time, Luka Chuppi hardly has a dull moment.
