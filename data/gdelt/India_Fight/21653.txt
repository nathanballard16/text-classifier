Vistara under social media storm for tweeting, then deleting picture of retired major general on flight

Full service carrier Vistara came under fire on Sunday after it tweeted and later deleted a picture of its staff with a retired major general.

“We do not want our platform to be disrespectful or hurtful to anyone. Our decision to remove the post was driven by the objective of deleting such comments,” Vistara said in a post on its Twitter handle on Sunday.

“Honoured to have Major General G D Bakshi (Retd), a decorated Kargil war hero on-board our flight today. Thank you Sir, for your service to the nation,” the airline tweeted.

Vistara deleted the tweet in the wake of criticism and later issued a statement saying that it does not want to disrespect anyone and it routinely posts happy pictures of its on board customers.

‘#BoycottVistara’ hashtag was also trending on Twitter late on Sunday evening, after getting the fallout from both sides.

“However, a recent such post generated numerous comments that were disrespectful to all parties concerned,” it said.

“@airvistara deleted Honourable @adgpi Officer General GD Bakshi Pic after Anti Army Gang Pressure. I will never travel on Air Vistara till thn they tweet Pic again & apologies, RT if you will #BoycottVistara,” BJP Delhi unit’s spokesperson Tajinder Pal Singh Bagga tweeted on Sunday.
