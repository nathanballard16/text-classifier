A shocking incident has come to light from the Tihar Jail in Delhi, considered to be Asia's biggest and one of the safest prison complexes of Asia. A mobile phone has been recovered from the stomach of an inmate.

According to sources, the inmate, identified as Sundar Rajaram, was lodged in the Tihar Jail a year ago in connection with a robbery and theft case.

Sundar was caught after a prison officer received a tip-off that he was hiding a phone with him. On checking, the officer got to know that Sundar had swallowed a cell phone.

Sundar was admitted to Deen Dayal Hospital immediately and a Chinese cell phone was recovered from his stomach after an operation. However, he is still carrying a micro SIM and a mini charger in his stomach, which will be operated and taken out soon.

There have been several cases of inmates sneaking-in mobile phones inside Tihar Jail. Sometimes a single phone is used by many prisoners inside the jail.

The Tihar Jail administration provides phone facility to the inmates so that they can talk to their families. But an inmate can only be on the phone for five minutes and the number that they dial is also verified by the jail administration. The phone disconnects automatically after five minutes.

The Tihar Jail houses around 16,000 prisoners and quite often during raids, phones are recovered from them.

After the recent incident, the security system of Tihar Jail has come under the scanner.
