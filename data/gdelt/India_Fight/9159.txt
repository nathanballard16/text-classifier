Rejecting prospects of nuclear war between India and Pakistan former Pakistani President General Pervez Musharraf said that if Islamabad attacks India with one atomic bomb then New Delhi “could finish us with 20 bombs.”

Musharraf further said that the relations between the two nuclear countries have reached a "dangerous level". Addressing the press conference in UAE on Friday, Musharraf said: “There will be no nuclear attack. If we would attack India with one atomic bomb, then the neighbouring country could finish us by attacking with 20 bombs. Then the only solution is that we should first attack them with 50 atom bombs so that they cannot hit us with 20 bombs. Are you ready to first launch an attack with 50 bombs?" ANI quoted Musharraf as saying.

Musharraf‘s statement comes at a time when tensions have escalated between the nuclear-armed neighbours over the killing of 40 CRPF jawans after a Pakistan-based JeM terrorist rammed his explosives-laden SUV into the convoy.

Speaking on strong India-Israel ties the former president said that Pakistan should have taken steps to break this alliance and added that Tel Aviv was keen to establish close diplomatic ties with Islamabad.

Musharraf grabbed power in 1999 after he ousted former PM Nawaz Sharif following a military coup.

Meanwhile, Pakistan has decided to move troops from the western border to its eastern border amid growing tensions with India.

PM Imran Khan had earlier authorised the Army to take action if India decides to mount an attack on Pakistan. Earlier in the day, the Pakistan Army violated ceasefire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir's Nowshera sector.
