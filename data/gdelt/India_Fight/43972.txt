Women’s panel summons civic body chiefs over operation of sex rackets in spas

The Delhi Commission for Women (DCW) on Tuesday summoned civic body commissioners over the alleged operation of sex rackets in spas across the national capital.

In its notice to the commissioners of the three civic bodies, the women’s commission has sought information pertaining to inspections carried out by the municipal corporations at the spas. The DCW also sought details of the licences issued to them since 2016.

Earlier, the DCW had issued notices to the civic bodies and the Delhi Police following raids carried out by the commission.

DCW chief Swati Maliwal said: “Why were these spas allowed to mushroom in the first place? While the south civic body has claimed that it has issued an advisory in the matter, they must ensure that all points listed by the DCW are incorporated.”

The commission said that in a previous meeting held with officials of the civic bodies and Delhi Police, it was directed that manual checks of spa centres will be carried out before issuing licences instead of issuing the same online “without any checks.”

Officials were asked to appear before the commission on September 20.
