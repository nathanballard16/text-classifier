Will win this David vs Goliath fight, says Poonam Sinha

The city of Nawabs, Lucknow is witnessing a fierce battle between newcomer Poonam Sinha, wife of superstar Shatrughan Sinha, and a leader who has been into the UP politics for long, Union Minister Rajnath Singh. Making a debut into politics, Poonam is accompanied by son Kush Sinha on campaign front, along with SP-BSP cadre. Zee catches up with Poonam, when she said she will win this David vs Goliath fight. Excerpts:

On row over Shotgun campaigning for you...

He campaigned in the capacity as my husband, though he’s a Congress candidate in Bihar. It was purely a ‘family trip’ while filing nomination. I don’t want to comment on (Congress candidate Pramod Krishnan taking objection) to it.

How you find your entry into politics...

Many may be thinking that I am new to politics. It’s not so. I have been part of a political family and has seen politics very closely.

How you find taking on a formidable rival...

He has done nothing for the city (Lucknow) in last five years of his tenure. With the support I am getting from Samajwadi Party and BSP, I am sure I will win the elections. Many big leaders have fallen... faced defeat from hands of new-comers and I will prove to be one.

How you find your acceptance among voters

I’m now a Lakhnawi. People must not think I am an outsider from Mumbai. I have come here and will be here for five years.

What are your key campaign points

I’m seeking votes on the development done by former UP chief minister Akhilesh Yadav. The metros, roads, Taj Expressway, Gomati riverfront are only a few works carried out by Akhilesh govt.
