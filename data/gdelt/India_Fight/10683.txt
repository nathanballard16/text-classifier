Modi Didn't Take All Parties Into Confidence for Pakistan Operation - Opposition

The political leaders "urged the government to take the nation into confidence on all measures to protect India's sovereignty, unity and integrity", according to a statement.

The opposition leaders fired a salvo at "leaders of the ruling party" for their politicisation of the "sacrifices of the armed forces" —in a veiled reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech attacking the opposition on 25 February on the occasion of the inauguration of the national war memorial in New Delhi.

Nevertheless, the leaders passed a resolution which said the opposition will stand with the country and against the enemy at this moment.

After Tuesday's air strikes by India targeting terrorist camp in Balakot, the Pakistan government promised to respond "at the time and place of its choosing."

On Wednesday morning, Pakistan shot down an Indian Air Force jet flying over Kashmir and detained the pilot on the ground, as later confirmed by New Delhi.
