Magazine covers to red-carpets, Janhvi Kapoor is experimental, chic and extremely glamorous. While we still remember her ice-blue tulle dress that she donned while accompanying her mother, Sridevi for an event, Janhvi has established herself as a fashionista with her seamless and fun sartorial choices. Apart from her spiffy gym wear, we’ve often spotted Janhvi in traditional kurtas and parallel pants. Earlier today, we spotted the Dhadak heroine in a mint green kurta with white pants.

Accompanied by her father, Janhvi looked beautiful with simple jhumkas and no make-up. Pulling her hair back into a ponytail, she completed her look with her favourite Louis Vuitton cross-body bag and multi-coloured juttis. Check her look out.

While we love this pretty look, here's looking back at all the times Janhvi opted for traditional kurtas only urging us to add a few of them to our wardrobe too. Yellow to ivory, check out all the looks here.





In the last week of February, Janhvi was in Lucknow to shoot for her next film, biopic of Gunjan Saxena. Taking her love for chikankari forward, the diva took some time out shop for kurtas and shararas. A report in TOI reported that her next film, which is titled as Kargil Girl went on a 'shopping spree on Thursday.' The report added, "The actress, who went to a chikan store in Hazratganj, went crazy over a variety of chikan clothes, according to the store owner. The Dhadak actress purchased an exquisite sari, a sharara and a few kurtis for her family and friends. She even placed an order for customised clothes at the store."
