Avoid products made from animals

If you truly care about all animals, please never purchase any clothing, accessories or other items ie. furniture, made from leather.

When you purchaser leather, you are directly supporting the cruelty of factory farming and the suffering of the slaughterhouse. When dairy cows no longer produce milk, their hides are made into leather and the skins of their babies “veal calves” are made into high-priced “calfskin”.

The majority of the animals that eventually end up as coats and couches were forced to endure intense confinement, overcrowding, branding, castration, tail docking and dehorning with no anesthesia. Also they were subjected to inhumane treatment during transportation and slaughter.

Most leather produced in the United States is made from skins of cattle and calves but much is also from horses, sheep, lambs, goats, and pigs that are first slaughtered for their flesh. When you buy leather, you have no idea whose skin it is. Dogs and cats are made into leather in Asia.

The thriving leather industry in India is also the cruelest. Many of the Indian animals killed for leather are so sick and injured by the time they arrive at the slaughterhouse they must literally be dragged inside.
