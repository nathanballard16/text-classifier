Follow us on Beware! Fake call centres duping millions of people; here's how they operate

Delhi Police on Friday raided a call centre operating out of a house in Moti Nagar. As per reports, 32 employees were arrested on charges of threatening and extortion. The gang in Delhi posed as Canadian police and used to call Canadian citizens. They then threatened them of violating non-existent 'Social Insurance Number' (SIN) and asked them to make payments up to 20,000 dollars to escape imprisonment.

They would purchase the data of tax defaulters like a bank account, contact numbers and email IDs and create their target group.

Fifty-five computers, three internet distribution switches, three patch ports, two internet routers, 35 mobile phones, cheating script pages and illegal software were seized by the police.

Police raided one of the two call centres being operated in the area.

The fraudsters were using a broadband connection under somebody else’s identity for the internet connection. They had also created a fake mail id and fake id-cards in the name of a prestigious finance company of America.

A case has been filed against them under the IT Act for creating fake identities and for duping people.
