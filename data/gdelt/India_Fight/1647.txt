Delhi: No casualty in fire at CGO complex office in Pragati Vihar

A massive fire broke out at the office of the power ministry in CGO complex in Pragati Vihar area of South Delhi on Saturday morning. The fire broke out before the office timing and no one was injured in the incident, an official said.



According to fire officials, they received a call at around 9:40 am informing them about smoke coming out from the first floor of the building.



"An employee from the complex area made a call and around 23 fire tenders were rushed to the spot. The fire had broken out on the first floor of block number 14 in CGO complex belonging to power ministry," said Atul Garg, Chief Fire Officer.



The fire was brought under control by 10.30 am.



"We had to vacate some of the adjacent rooms as safety measures. Prime facie, a short circuit appears to be the reason behind the blaze and it started from the mess area of the office," said a senior fire official.
