Mysuru priests accuse Bishop of sexual misconduct, corruption, shoot letter to Pope Francis

A group of 37 priests from the Mysuru Diocese has written a letter to Pope Francis requesting his urgent intervention in the affairs of the Bishop of Mysuru KA William. The priests have demanded that the Bishop be removed over his alleged involvement in criminal offences, misappropriation of funds and sexual misconduct.

The Bishop has also been accused of practising factionalism, favouritism and also getting married.

Melwyn Fernandes of the Association of Concerned Catholics, has released a press note stating, "This is an issue involving crimes of moral turpitude by Bishop William of Mysuru, involving financial irregularities, sexual misconduct, kidnapping and suspected murders."

Speaking to India Today TV, Fernandes said, "There are allegations with regard to children. We demand that paternity tests should be done so that the innocence of the Bishop can be proved. We also demand an enquiry be conducted into the alleged kidnapping of a girl at the behest of the Bishop and how that girl's child was shown to her through a CCTV camera when she was at a different location."

In a letter to the Pope dated July 20, the priests said, "The dark age of our diocese began ever since Bishop Emeritus, Thomas Antony Vazhapilly (2003-2017) unto this day and the current Bishop was brought in. We regret and feel sorry to say that we have got a person who is most immoral, corrupt, unspiritual, materialist, worldly, ill-reputed, disrespected and a dictator as Bishop of Mysuru."

However, KA William, the Bishop denied any wrongdoings and said the allegations against him are far from the truth and the accusers did not even contact or discuss the matter with him.

He has also claimed that this has not only damaged his reputation but also the Archdiocese of Mysuru and the Christian community.
