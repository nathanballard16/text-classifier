11 years of 26/11: Leaders pay tributes to Mumbai terror attack victims

Eleven years ago, on the evening of Thursday, November 26, 2008, terror struck Mumbai, the financial capital of India.

On November 26, 2008, 10 Pakistani terrorists arrived by sea route and opened fire indiscriminately at people killing 166, including 18 security personnel, and injuring several others, besides damaging property worth crores.

Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, Hotel Taj Mahal Palace and Tower, Hotel Trident, Nariman House, Leopold Café, Cama Hospital and Wadi Bunder were attacked, inflicting huge damage to public and private properties.

After an attack that lasted 60 hours, nine of the 10 terrorists were gunned down in the combined security operations and one was caught alive.

President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi pay tribute to the lives lost during the attacks.

On the 11th anniversary of the Mumbai terror attacks, we remember everyone who lost their lives and mourn with their families. A grateful nation salutes the security personnel who made the supreme sacrifice. We remain firm in our resolve to defeat all forms of terrorism. — President of India (@rashtrapatibhvn) November 26, 2019
