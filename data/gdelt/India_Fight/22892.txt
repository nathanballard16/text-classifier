India is in the middle of national elections to decide the next 543 seats of Lok Sabha, the lower house of Parliament. With 900 million voters eligible to cast a ballot paper - out of a total population of 1.3 billion - the elections have to be staggered. The latest phase of democratic elections in Indian is the fourth phase of a seven-stage process. But they were marred by street clashes between rival voters broken up by security forces firing warning shots.

At least seven people were injured in the skirmishes in West Bengal’s Dubrajpur area after voters were barred from taking in mobile phones to polling stations.

Last week saw one person die and three others injured in West Bengal during the third phase of voting.

A junior minister in Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Hindu nationalist party, Babul Supriyo also said his car was attacked by rival voters outside a polling station in West Bengal’s Asansol district.

He said he had been refused entry by the same group of people.
