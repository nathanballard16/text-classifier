Gujarat: Crocodile Commandos deployed in Harami Nala

AHMEDABAD: To counter an anticipated attack by Pakistan-trained commandos the Border Security Force (BSF) has deployed teams of ‘ Creek Crocodile Commandos ’ along the along the 22km stretch of Harami Nala , a water channel near in the Sir Creek area close to the border between India and Pakistan.The state has been put on a high alert following intelligence inputs that Pakistan-trained SSG commandos or terrorists ‘would try to enter Gulf of Kutch and Sir Creek area using small boats’.The two main ports of the state, at Kandla and Mundra in Kutch, were on the alert after being warned by central intelligence agencies that “Pakistan-trained commandos” are likely to enter Indian waters to carry out ‘underwater attacks on port facilities’. Intelligence sources said there were inputs that Pakistan-trained marine commandos or potential terrorists from Pakistan-based outfits would try to infiltrate through the Harami Nala.“That is why this elite force of the BSF has been deployed in the marshy creek area. It is difficult to patrol these areas in boats and all-terrain vehicles (ATVs) have been posted at border outposts in the creek area,” said a senior BSF official.These commandos are well-trained in battle on water and land and can thwart any any misadventures from across the border. The Creek Crocodiles, BSF’s first commando unit, was formed in 2014, the official said. They man the hostile creek area where India shares a border with Pakistan.The creeks are hostile terrain, made up of raised ground with mangroves and numerous channels that are usually quite shallow, about knee deep.Top BSF officials said additional forces have also been dispatched to the border to strengthen the defence.Defence forces have also been put on high alert and navy commandos have also been deployed at all vital ports, defence sources said. Gujarat police has enhanced its capabilities on the coastline and marine police has begun round-the-clock patrolling.“Officials of the Gujarat ATS, who were recently assigned the responsibility of coastal security, are on constant vigil,” said a senior Gujarat police official.
