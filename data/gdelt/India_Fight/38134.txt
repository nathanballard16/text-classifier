Geeta, who Sushma Swaraj rescued from Pakistan, pays tribute in sign language

Geeta, the 27-year-old deaf and mute woman, who was rescued from Pakistan and brought back to India after being stranded there for 15 years, has paid a moving tribute to Sushma Swaraj, who instrumented her return in 2015.

Geeta, who was brought back to India in October 2015, has failed to find her family although many claimed to be her parents. On Wednesday, hours after the sudden demise of Sushma Swaraj at the age of 67, Geeta paid tributes to Sushma Swaraj in sign language.

Then external affairs minister, Sushma Swaraj even tried to play a matchmaker for Geeta and sought marriage proposals for her, who she called India's daughter.

After she failed to find her family even after DNA testing, Sushma told reporters in Indore, "Geeta is the daughter of India. Even if she does not meet her family, she will never be sent back to Pakistan. The Indian government will foster her."

Geeta was about 11 years of age when she inadvertently crossed the border into Pakistan in 2003. She was spotted by the Pakistan Rangers in Lahore and was handed over to Edhi. Bilquis Edhi, who runs the Edhi Foundation, named her Geeta.

Sushma Swaraj, who steered her return, passed away at the age of 67 in Delhi on August 6. Swaraj suffered a massive cardiac arrest on Tuesday evening and died, sending shockwaves across party lines.

The much-loved former minister and BJP leader has left a legacy of being the affable politician who was available for help to any Indian in distress abroad as well as in India.
