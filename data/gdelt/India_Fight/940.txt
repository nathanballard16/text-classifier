ISLAMABAD, Jan. 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani military said on Monday that one civilian was killed in Indian forces' firing along the Line of Control (LoC) in the disputed Kashmir region.

An army statement said the Indian forces "resorted to unprovoked firing" in Bagsar Sector along the LoC, "targeting civil population."

A 26-year-old citizen was killed while a woman got injured, the statement from the army's media wing the Inter-Services Public Relations said.

"Pakistan Army troops responded effectively to those posts targeting civil population. Cease Fire Violations along LoC are on the increase yet again," the statement said.

Pakistan and India have declared ceasefire along the LoC and the working boundary in 2003. Both, however, routinely accuse each other of violating the ceasefire.
