The Shiv Sena has sacked four members of the Yuva Sena from Maharashtra's Yavatmal district after they allegedly beat up two Kashmiri students of the Dayabhai Patel Physical Education College earlier this week.

Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray took to social media on Friday to say that the party was expelling those who attacked the Kashmiri youth. “As of Thursday evening, the party has sacked those involved in the act. J&K is a part of India and no Indian, or for that matter, nobody should face the brunt of anger that is towards terrorism. We understand the angst but it must be against terror, not innocent people,” Thackeray wrote on Twitter.

Video footage of the event showed the Shiv Sena workers attacking the Kashmiri youth outside their rented accommodation. Apart from being asked to chant “Vande Mataram”, they were asked to leave Yavatmal immediately.

Later police officials said they have identified the four Yuva Sena workers who were arrested. Ajinkya Motke, who led the group of party workers, was sent to magisterial custody for 14 days. His three accomplices were released on bail on Friday, police said.

Meanwhile reports from Yavatmal said at least 19 students from Jammu and Kashmir have returned home following the incident.
