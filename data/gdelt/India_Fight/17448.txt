At least 17 people have died and about 50 others have been injured in a massive fire that engulfed FR Tower in Dhaka's Banani on Thursday (March 28).

The fire broke out on the fifth floor of the multi-storey building at Kamal Ataturk Avenue around 12:45 pm, said an official of the Fire Service and Civil Defence control room.

Many people are believed to be trapped in the building. Many people sustained injuries as they tried to jump off the building to escape.

Many of the injured were taken to Kurmitola General Hospital.

Director of Kurmitola Hospital Brigadier General Rafiqun Nabi said a Sri Lankan national named Niras Chandra was killed in the tragedy.

Several firefighting units rushed in to douse the flames. The Navy, Army and the Air Force have also joined the rescue operations.

Two helicopters of the Bangladesh Air Force have joined the operation to assist firefighters.

As huge black fumes were seen coming out of the building, residents of the adjoining buildings left their flats fearing danger.
