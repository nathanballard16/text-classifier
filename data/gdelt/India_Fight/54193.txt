Hyderabad rape accused killed: P Chidambaram wants inquiry to check if encounter genuine

Former Union Home Minister P Chidambaram says a thorough inquiry should be held to determine if the killing of four Telangana men accused of gang rape and murder was a genuine encounter.

The four men, all lorry workers in their early twenties, were accused of raping and killing a young woman veterinarian, now known as Disha, near Hyderabad last week.

The police say they shot the men dead in self-defence during a crime scene reconstruction this morning, when the accused snatched a weapon and used it against them in an attempt to escape.

A number of public figures have questioned the circumstances of the operation, including its timing: early in the morning, and more than a week after the crime was committed.

P Chidambaram said on Friday he didn't know the details of the police action, which the victim's parents and a large section of the public have welcomed.

"As a responsible person," he said, the police's actions must be thoroughly inquired into to find out if the accused were trying to flee and if the encounter was genuine.

Chidambaram was released from prison on Thursday after the Supreme Court granted him bail in the INX Media money laundering case.
