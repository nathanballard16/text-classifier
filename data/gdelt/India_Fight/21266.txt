Wild elephant in Odisha crushes 5 people to death

A wild elephant strayed into human habitation in different villages of Angul district on Friday crushing five people, including a woman and two girls, officials said.

The tusker entered Sandha village late on Thursday night and trampled three members of a family to death, who were sleeping in the verandah of their house.

A man and his two-year-old daughter were among those killed.

A woman was also killed by the elephant in the same village while she was asleep in the verandah of her house. Proceeding to Santhapada village, the wild elephant crushed to death a 70-year-old man, the official said.

Agitated and angry over the incidents, residents of the two villages blocked the roads on Friday morning demanding adequate compensation to the families of the deceased.

The blockade was lifted after financial assistance was provided.

Efforts were made to drive away the wild elephant into the forest, a forest official said.
