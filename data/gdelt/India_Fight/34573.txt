Hrithik Roshan heads to Patna

A huge security detail is being arranged for Hrithik’s visit to Bihar’s capital, where he is expected to land within two weeks.

Post the massive success of Super 30, based on the inspiring life and struggle of world-renowned mathematician Anand Kumar, the film’s leading man Hrithik Roshan will finally make it to Anand’s hometown of Patna soon.

The actor will visit Patna for the first time ever, which is of note considering that the film is mostly Patna-based (though shot in Varanasi).

Confirming this, a source from the film’s production team informs, “Hrithik has never been to Patna. After playing Anand Kumar, his popularity in Bihar has reached hysterical proportions. So it’s only fair that he visits the city.”

A huge security detail is being arranged for Hrithik’s visit to Bihar’s capital, where he is expected to land within two weeks. Anand is expected to join Hrithiks in meeting and greeting fans.

Incidentally, the film’s tainted director Vikas Bahl, who was called out for alleged sexual harassment, remains distanced from the public eye in spite of the film’s success.
