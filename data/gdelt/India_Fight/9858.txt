India launches airstrikes on Pakistan across Kashmir border

India has carried out aerial bombing over the disputed ceasefire line in Kashmir for the first time since it went to war with Pakistan in 1971, and claims to have hit a large militant training camp.

The country’s foreign secretary, Vijay Gokhale, said in a briefing that Delhi had received credible intelligence that the militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), which killed 40 Indian security personnel in a suicide bombing this month, was training fighters for similar attacks.

“In the face of imminent danger, a pre-emptive strike became absolutely necessary,” Gokhale said, according to The Guardian.

The attack was celebrated in India, but it was unclear on Tuesday whether anything significant had been struck by the fighter jets, or whether the operation had been carefully calibrated to ease popular anger over the 14 February suicide bombing without drawing a major Pakistani reprisal.

Pakistan, which was the first to announce the incursion of Indian fighter jets early on Tuesday morning, said the war planes made it up to four miles inside its territory before they were rebuffed, dropping their payloads without casualties or damage.

Pakistan’s armed forces spokesman, Maj-Gen Asif Ghafoor, tweeted on Tuesday morning that the Indian jets had dropped their bombs in an empty forested area. “No infrastructure got hit, no casualties,” he wrote.
