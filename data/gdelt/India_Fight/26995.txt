John Abraham who after completing the London and Leeds schedule, was shooting Anees Bazmee’s upcoming comedyat Mumbai’s, had a freak accident on Wednesday.While filming an action sequence in a truck, he ended up with a muscle tear in his arm. He will not be able to shoot for the next few weeks.A source from the set says, “John has been advised rest for the next 20 days to avoid aggravating the injury. His co-actors Anil Kapoor, Arshad Warsi,, Ileana D’çruz and Kriti Kharbanda were also a part of the scene.”Kumar Mangat who is producing the film withand son Abhishek Pathak, confirmed the news, saying, “It was a simple shot, but mistiming caused the injury. Ninety per cent of our shoot has been completed in London and Leeds. This is the last schedule in Mumbai which we will have to reschedule now. After a week, we will decide when to resume depending on how quickly he recovers. We will wrap up the film by June end.”The film has John playing a down-on-luck commoner, Raj Kishore, who is constantly changing jobs, but failing all the time. Ileana is Sanjana, his lady love who constantly lands in trouble because of her ill-fated beau. As Mirror had earlier reported (April 24), the team is already working on a sequel even before the release. The multi-starrer went on the floors in London in February and wrapped up the UK schedule in April.
