A Japanese student on an exchange programme at Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati has committed suicide, officials at the institute said Friday.

Kota Onoda, 22, who had come from Gifu University, was doing his internship at IIT-G, which was scheduled to end on November 30. On Thursday afternoon, at around 3.30pm, he was found hanging in a bathroom of Lohit hostel, an IIT-G spokesperson said.

“It is with profound grief that we share the news of the death of a student from Japan, an intern at the Department of Biosciences and Bioengineering, IIT-Guwahati. The institute has informed the police and the Japanese embassy. The institute is fully cooperating with the police in their investigation. The institute stands in solidarity with the family and friends of the student,” IIT-G said in a statement.

Kamrup (Rural) Additional SP Sanjib Saikia on Friday said, “Prima facie it is a case of suicide. It happened yesterday afternoon. He has left a note, but it does not point towards anyone.” Saikia added that processes to send the body back were on in coordination with the Japanese embassy.
