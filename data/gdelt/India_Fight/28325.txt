“It is my ode to Sridevi.” – Boney Kapoor on Mr. India’s remake



It was recently reported that Boney Kapoor will be remaking Mr. India with a contemporary twist. Mr. India starred Anil Kapoor and Boney Kapoor’s wife, late Sridevi in the lead roles and was a massive hit in its time. Now the ace producer has come out and spoken about how it was back then to shoot with Sridevi. Talking about it during a recent interview, he revealed, “The most special memory is, of course, meeting my wife Sridevi for the first time for the film and the first day of shooting with her.” He added, "My only condition was that I needed 60-65 days, but we ended up shooting for 125 days because she was passionate about the project and knew it needed that kind of time."











Boney Kapoor also went on to reveal how this project will be his tribute to his late wife. He said, “It’d be my ode to Sri and to Veeru (who died recently) and Amrish Puri and everyone who contributed to the film. But the most to Sri, because she was the sole selling factor of the film. Of course, Anil will be a part of the film. In fact, I’d want most people from the original to be a part of this. It’d mean a lot to me if they contributed to the film.” We are super excited about this one, what about you?
