Indian, Pakistani Troops Exchanging 'Heavy Fire' Along Line of Control - Sources

Tensions between India and Pakistan remain dangerously high despite efforts to deescalate the conflict, including Islamabad's decision to hand over an Indian fighter pilot whose MiG-21 jet was shot down over Pakistani airspace on Wednesday.

New Delhi has accused Islamabad of failing to fight Islamist extremists holed up in its territory. Multiple jihadist groups, including the Jaish-e-Mohammed* terrorist organisation, are thought to be situated in Kashmir, and to have been involved in attacks on Indian security personnel on the Indian side of the line of control. Earlier this month, the group claimed responsibility for a deadly bombing which killed over 40 Indian security personnel. In response, India carried out an airstrike on a suspected Jaish-e-Mohammed base on the Pakistani side of the border on Tuesday. A day later, the Pakistani military reported shooting down two Indian aircraft. India's defence officials later revealed that a Pakistani Air Force F-16 was also downed during a dogfight with IAF planes. Islamabad insists it did not use F-16s in the air battle, and has accused New Delhi of violating its sovereignty and territorial integrity with its strikes.
