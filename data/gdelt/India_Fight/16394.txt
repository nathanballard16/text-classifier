Guddan battles aquaphobia while shooting for Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega

MUMBAI: The cast of Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega recently shot for the Holi special episode in Goa.



Lead protagonist Guddan (Kanika Mann) is always up for challenges and believes in trying out new things. She suffers from aquaphobia and fears being near water. In the Holi special episode, Guddan gets caught in the water current and starts drowning when Akshat (Nishant Singh Malkani) comes in the nick of time and saves her.



Shooting for the water sequence was nothing short of a nightmare for Kanika. She recalls that she had to step inside deep water to make the sequence look more authentic. She said, ‘When I was told that I have to shoot a water sequence, I got jitters and was extremely sceptical about it. But the crew members spoke to me and convinced me to give it a shot. I chanted prayers and jumped into the water. My biggest motivation was my own character, Guddan, and I told myself, ‘Tumse bhi ho payega’. I am glad that I opted to do it, as it helped me overcome my fear, and of course, the appreciation I received from everyone was worth it.’



As per the show’s plot, Durga’s (Mahadik) brother Rocky (Manan Joshi) invites the entire Jindal family to celebrate Holi with them in Goa. But during the course of the event, Rocky turns rogue and tries to act fresh with Lakshmi (Sehrish Ali). When Guddan realizes this, she takes a stand against Rocky’s misbehaviour without knowing what is in store for her. Akshat too gets involved as he tries to save Guddan, leading to a lot of drama.



Amidst all the revelries, will Guddan and Akshat be able to pin down Rocky and save Lakshmi?
