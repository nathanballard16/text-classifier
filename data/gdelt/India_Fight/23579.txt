Court convicts two men in 2014 murder case

They killed neighbour after the wife and sister of one of the accused were teased

A Delhi court has held two persons guilty of murdering a neighbour after the wife and the sister of one of the accused were teased, in a slum cluster in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh area in 2014.

Additional Sessions Judge Pooran Chand convicted accused Sanjay and Ashok on the basis of deposition by a lone eyewitness of the crime.

The police had lodged the case on the statement of the eyewitness before whom the accused persons had killed deceased Manoj.

The court also dismissed an argument by the counsel for Sanjay that the eyewitness was a motivated witness and that he had falsely deposed in the case when his demand for money was first turned down by Sanjay’s wife and later by the accused.

“When Sanjay’s wife was aware that this witness was demanding money from her to depose in their favour, she should have approached this court to inform about the conduct of this witness. At this stage, when this witness has deposed against them, is clearly an after-thought and not at all appears probable and as such, does not inspire the confidence of this court,” the judge said.

“From the facts and circumstances of the case and the documents including the post-mortem report, it is abundantly clear that both Sanjay and Ashok, in furtherance of their common intention, gave beatings and caused bodily injuries on Manoj which caused his death,” the judge said.

“This court is of the considered opinion that prosecution has been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that both the accused persons are guilty of committing murder of Manoj... this court holds Sanjay and Ashok guilty for offence punishable under Section 302/34 IPC,” the Judge said.
