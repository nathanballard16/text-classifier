Nepal strongly condemns Pulwama terrorist attack

Nepal on Thursday strongly condemned the terrorist attack in Kashmir's Pulwama district and said such heinous acts of terrorism cannot be justified on any ground.

"The Government of Nepal strongly condemns the terrorist attack in Jammu and Kashmir today that has resulted in the loss of many precious lives," the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement here.

It extended heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims as well as the Government and people of India.

"In line with its principled position, Nepal unequivocally condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and believes that such heinous acts of terrorism cannot be justified on any ground," it said.

In one of the deadliest terror attacks in Jammu and Kashmir's three decades of militancy, a suicide bomber from the Jaish-e-Mohammed terror group rammed an explosives-laden vehicle into a CRPF bus in Pulwama district on Thursday, killing at least 39 personnel and leaving many critically wounded.
