Avtar Grewal trial: Man accused of murdering his wife in 2007 found guilty

PHOENIX — A verdict has been reached in the case of a man accused of murdering his wife in 2007 and then fleeing to India.

After a weekslong trial, the jury found Avtar Grewal guilty of first-degree murder.

Grewal, who was extradited to the U.S. in 2011, was accused of killing Navneet Kaur in 2007. The two were in an arranged marriage but had a long-distance relationship. The prosecution says Kaur wanted a divorce, so Grewal traveled from Canada to her Ahwatukee home so they could talk about it.

Prosecutor Juan Martinez, who's known for leading the case against Jodi Arias, led this case as well. He says after Grewal killed Kaur, he wrote a note admitting to the murder. The defense says while there was a fight between the two, Kaur's death was not premeditated.

Grewal chose to take the stand during the trial. His attorney questioned him on Thursday, where Grewal discussed a prior arranged marriage back in 2002 which did not work out, and the couple divorced around 2004.

Grewal's sentencing is scheduled for August 23rd.
