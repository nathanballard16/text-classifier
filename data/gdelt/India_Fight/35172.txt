Sunset at the Afternoon

The Afternoon Despatch and Courier, a tabloid that brightened weekends during the last three decades has announced closure. This weekend is the last date for employees to report to work, according to a internal letter sent yesterday by the organisation.

The newspaper started by renowned editor Behram Contractor and his wife Farzana chronicled Mumbai like no one else. Contractor, who wrote under the pen name of Busybee had a special following for his last page editorial, Round and About, that had as Busybee put it "a few stray observations, all my own work" and had a Bulldog Bolshoi that could talk but not bark as one of the prominent fictional characters.
