I-T raids in Tamil Nadu, check suspect poll cash

Suspicious of alleged illegal cash being pumped in to lure voters in the poll-bound state, the Income Tax Department on Friday conducted raids at several locations in Tamil Nadu, officials said.

Raids in 18 locations in Chennai, Namakkal and Tirunelveli are being conducted since early morning, they said.

In the first instance, tax sleuths are carrying out the searches at the premises of a contractor firm – PSK Engineering Construction Company on charges of routing and possessing alleged “unaccounted cash”.

Three premises in Chennai and four linked to the company in Namakkal are being raided, they said.

In the second case, the Chennai investigation wing of the department carried the raid on a group of cash handlers and financiers against whom the information was obtained that they are allegedly “mobilising cash for possible use in elections”.

The locations linked to two individuals identified as Akash Baskaran and Sujai Reddy are also being searched, they said.

Polls on 39 seats of Tamil Nadu and the lone seat in Puducherry will be conducted in the second phase of the general election on April 18.
