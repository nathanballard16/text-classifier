Station house officer helps gangster get bail from high court, booked for forgery

GREATER NOIDA: An inspector, who last year was the SHO of Jarcha police station, has been booked for allegedly helping Umesh Pandit, a sharp-shooter of Anil Dujana gang, by not disclosing his criminal history before the Allahabad high court.In his report submitted to the high court on June 12 last year, inspector K K Rana allegedly withheld the criminal history of Umesh Pandit in as many as 20 cases lodged against him in different police stations of NCR. This resulted in Pandit getting bail, though he was booked under Gangster Act.Rana has been booked on the basis of an inquiry conducted by the office of the SSP, Gautam Budh Nagar. In December, Rana was transferred to Kushinagar and is currently undergoing training with other inspectors.While granting bail to Pandit, the high court had remarked that the applicant was being granted bail because apart from the gang-chart, no other criminal history of the accused had been mentioned in the inspector’s report.In 2012, Umesh Pandit was arrested by the crime branch of Delhi Police in connection with a murder case in Delhi and had been incarcerated in Tihar jail . Meanwhile, he moved a bail application in another case registered under Gangster Act at the Allahabad high court last year on which the court had issued orders granting bail on September 25, 2018.However, the court noted that the bail was being granted because the police had not attached any criminal history except for the gang-chart – this even though he has nearly 20 cases registered against him including 13 in Gautam Budh Nagar and seven in other districts.Following the remarks of the high court, the then SSP Ajay Pal Sharma initiated an inquiry into the case which revealed that former SHO KK Rana had not attached Pandit’s criminal history.Prabhat Dixit, the current SHO of Jarcha, who is the complainant in the case, told TOI that the latest complaint was filed at Jarcha police station on January 17.In the FIR lodged under sections 218 (public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture) and 417 (cheating) of IPC, it has been mentioned that the incharge of the police station had not mentioned about the cases “deliberately” and presented an “erroneous” report before the court “which benefitted the accused and due to no other criminal cases shown in the report, he was granted bail by the high court.”Since the FIR has been registered at the Jarcha police station on the complaint of the current SHO Prabhat Dixit himself, the case will now be probed by an investigating officer from another police station.Circle officer of Dadri , Avnish Kumar told TOI that the he will write to the Gautam Budh Nagar SSP to know under which police station the matter can be transferred.There are only two police stations under Dadri circle—Dadri and Jarcha. Pandit was allegedly involved in the murder of his collegemate following an argument at Loni in Ghaziabad in 2005, murder of one Vinod Goel to settle a property dispute in 2009 and indiscriminate firing at Sunder Bhati and his gang at a wedding function in Sahibabad in October 2011.
