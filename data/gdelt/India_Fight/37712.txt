Mishal Malik terms India's move to abolish Article 370 as open terrorism

ISLAMABAD: Mishal Malik the wife of Hurriyat Leader Yasin Malik has termed India’s decision to revoke the special status of occupied Kashmir as open terrorism.



“India has openly disregarded international laws, humanitarian laws, international conventions and United Nations resolutions. They are trying to bring all of India here,” Malik said in a video statement released on Monday.

The Indian government rushed through a presidential decree to abolish special status granted to occupied Kashmir under the constitution.

“In 1947 500,000 Muslims were slaughtered by RSS thugs in Kashmir. The Modi regime which is the follower of RSS has scraped 35A and 370 and it has been signed by the president,” she added.

Mishal Malik called on Pakistan to raise this issue immediately in the United Nations Security Council. “An emergency meeting should be called and sanctions should be placed on India.”
