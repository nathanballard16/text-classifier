Counterpunch from Smriti Irani as Congress accuses her of 'falsifying' educational records

Congress spokesperson Priyanka Chaturvedi also accused Smriti Irani of misusing her influence and power as a Union minister.

Irani on Thursday submitted to the Election Commission that she did not complete her graduation from Delhi University.

In her affidavit for 2014 polls, she had reportedly said she graduated from the university in 1994, triggering a row over the veracity of her claim, with opposition parties alleging she was not a graduate.
