Maharashtra Polls: 26 Shiv Sena Corporators, 300 Workers Resign Over Distribution Of Seats

New Delhi:

Maharashtra Assembly Elections 2019: Citing their 'unhappiness over the distribution of seats' for the upcoming polls, 26 Shiv Sena corporators and around 300 workers of the party have sent their resignation to the party chief Uddhav Thackeray. According to reports, these corporaters and workers are from Kalyan (East) area. They submitted their resignation to Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray in support of the party's rebel candidate Dhananjay Bodare.

Local Shiv Sena workers are reportedly upset after being ordered to support BJP candidate Ganpat Gaikwad in the assembly elections. Local Shiv Sena workers wanted party to contest this seat but it went to BJP in the seat-sharing arrangement.

On Tuesday, senior Shiv Sena leaders had convened a meeting and directed workers to support Gaikwad.

Earlier this month, more than 200 Shiv Sena workers in Navi Mumbai had resigned over Airoli and Belapur seats being offered to the BJP. Sandeep Naik, son of NCP defector Ganesh Naik, was given the ticket by BJP from Airoli seat. The Navi Mumbai area has traditionally seen a poll battle between strongman Ganesh Naik and the Shiv Sena.
