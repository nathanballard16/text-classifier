News Queensland: Police speak with person of interest in investigation of pregnant Gold Coast nurse's murder

Australian Federal Police have spoken with the mistress of a Gold Coast businessman as a person of interest in an investigation into the murder of his wife.

Keran Kaur was seen leaving the Surfers Paradise Police Station late last night after speaking with detectives about the death of Ravneet Kuar, whose body was found in a canal in India on March 25 .

Ms Kuar, 29, worked as a registered nurse at Tricare on the Gold Coast before she travelled to India on February 25 to visit family and friends with her four-year-old daughter.

Indian authorities have alleged that Keran Kaur was having an extra-marital affair with Ms Kuar’s husband, Jaspreet Singh, and had conspired with him to kill her.

9News reported last month that Mr Singh – who had stayed behind in Australia - said he took a phone call from his wife on March 14 and that was the last that he had heard from her.

“She said I’ll ring you back in 10 minutes, went back to her home and I don’t know what happened,” he said at the time.

“I don’t know, I just want my wife back.”

Keran Kaur was allegedly in Punjab the day Ms Kuar vanished.
