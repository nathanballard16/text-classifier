SC paves way for Ruia exit, Mittal entry in Essar Steel

NCLAT ruling created hurdle for Mittal deal

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday cleared the takeover of Essar Steel by global metals magnate LN Mittal’s ArcelorMittal after a protracted legal battle, which will pave the way for banks to recover Rs 42,000 crore in dues and oust the Ruias, once among the most powerful business families in the country.The money paid by Mittal will go to banks, mostly state-run, whose loans the Ruias had defaulted on.In terms of the money involved, this figure is among the biggest insolvency resolutions. The outcome, significant for banks and the government which are keen to recover NPAs, came after a tortuous journey which marked intense litigation, raising doubts whether insolvency law can successfully recover lakhs of crores loaned to chronic defaulters.The SC order breathes fresh hope into the process by emphasising that the Committee of Creditors will have the decisive say in resolutions, with the role of National Company Law Tribunal and the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) confined to reviewing whether process is in harmony with the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code.Essar Steel was among the first batch of a dozen high-profile bad debt cases referred by the Reserve Bank of India for insolvency action in June 2017. Although the law provides for resolution in a maximum 270 days, a series of cases in various forums resulted in the entire resolution process stretching to nearly 28 months.ArcelorMittal’s proposal to take over the Indian company had been approved by Committee of Creditors (CoC), led by banks, but fresh hurdle arose following a ruling by NCLAT, which held that a financial creditor such as banks and an operational creditor such as a vendor be treated equally while settling dues.Under IBC, it is the Committee of Creditors that is tasked with taking major decisions along with the resolution professional once proceedings have been initiated by National Company Law Tribunal.The lenders moved the apex court and a bench of Justices Justice R F Nariman, Surya Kant and V Ramasubramanian set aside the NCLAT order. In a 164-page judgment, the bench demarcated the role of resolution applicants, resolution professionals, CoC and the adjudicating authorities in insolvency proceedings.There was setback for the government too as the court struck down the provision under IBC making it “mandatory” to complete the insolvency proceedings within 330 days.However, it seemed to be pleased with the fact that the Essar case had finally gone through. Finance minister Niramala Sitharaman said the verdict reinforced the credibility and substantive nature of IBC and would help improve the process of resolution.“This much-awaited judgment also settles to rest numerous points of law under IBC, which were tested in various courts. This should significantly reduce the scope for long drawn litigations under IBC and would eventually lead to faster resolutions of stressed assets,” SBI chairman Rajnish Kumar added.Emphasising the primacy of the Committee of Creditors, the SC bench said the adjudicating authority cannot interfere with the commercial decision taken by the CoC and the limited judicial review available to it is to see whether the panel has taken into account the fact that the corporate debtor needs to keep going during the insolvency process, if it needs to maximise the value of its assets, and that the interests of all stakeholders, including operational creditors, have been taken care of.Further, the court said that tribunals should restrain from interfering in the commercial decision taken by CoC and they can at most ask the committee to re-examine the resolution plan. “It is clear that when CoC exercises its commercial wisdom to arrive at a business decision to revive the corporate debtor, it must necessarily take into account these key features of the Code before it arrives at a commercial decision to pay off the dues of financial and operational creditors. There is no doubt whatsoever that the ultimate discretion of what to pay and how much to pay each class or subclass of creditors is with the Committee, but, the decision of such Committee must reflect the fact that it has taken into account maximising the value of the assets of the corporate debtor and the fact that it has adequately balanced the interests of all stakeholders including operational creditors,” it said.“The NCLAT judgment which substitutes its wisdom for the commercial wisdom of Committee of Creditors and which also directs the admission of a number of claims which was done by the resolution applicant, without prejudice to its right to appeal against the aforesaid judgment, must therefore be set aside,” it said.On the issue of equality for all approach recognising the rights of different classes of creditors, the bench said if it is allowed then secured financial creditors will, in many cases, be incentivised to vote for liquidation rather than resolution, as they would have better rights if the corporate debtor was to be liquidated rather than a resolution plan being approved. “This would defeat the entire objective of the Code which is to first ensure that resolution of 89 distressed assets takes place and only if the same is not possible should liquidation follow,” it said.
