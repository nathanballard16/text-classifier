India on Friday shot down another drone along the international border in Rajasthan's Sri Ganganagar after it violated Indian airspace around 07:30 pm, according to Army sources.

This is the third time drone has been destroyed by India along the IB since February 26 air strike on Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) terror camp in Balakot inside Pakistani territory.

Earlier, a Pakistani drone was detected by a ground-based radar station in Rajasthan's Bikaner and minutes later one of the jets deployed in the area to keep an eye on Indian air space shot it down.

The Indian Air Force has kept all its bases in the Western sector on maximum alert after the Balakot strike.

Amid this tension between India and Pakistan, Army Chief Bipin Rawat on Saturday visited the Western Command Headquarters and reviewed the operational preparedness along the western front.

During his visit, the Western Army Commander, Lieutenant General Surender Singh, briefed the Army chief on the current operational situation, prevailing security environment and preparedness of the formations, specially in Amritsar and Samba sectors, a statement said.

The Army chief directed the formations to ensure continued state of vigilance and to be prepared to decisively deal with emerging challenges that may develop, it said.
