A court on Monday sentenced three men to life imprisonment for the rape and murder of an eight-year-old girl in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua district last year, a lawyer for the defence said, in a case that sparked outrage across the country.

The girl, from a nomadic Muslim community, was drugged, held captive and sexually assaulted for a week before being strangled and battered to death with a stone in January 2018.
