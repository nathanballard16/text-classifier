Raj Thackeray says no to campaign for BJP rivals in other poll-bound states

After Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray grabbed headlines for his attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and BJP president Amit Shah, BJP's rivals invited Thackeray to hold rallies in many poll-bound states beyond Maharashtra. However, Raj is unlikely to go out of state to campaign against the BJP in ensuing Lok Sabha polls.

Though he did not field any candidate, he had addressed 10 rallies across the state despite not openly campaigning for the Congress, NCP and their allies. Owing to his hard-hitting style and use of videos to substantiate claims, Raj received invitations from the Congress, Janata Dal (Secular), Haryana Vikas Party and a couple of community organisations in Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Karnataka to address rallies.

"Raj saheb received the invitations from various parts of the country for campaigning. However, he has decided to stick with Maharashtra only. His aim was to create a ripple in Maharashtra and he was successful in his attempts," said Sandeep Deshpande, an MNS leader.

Another MNS leader on the condition of anonymity said that the Raj Thackeray is a very powerful orator in Marathi. "His speeches in Marathi are spontaneous and are impactful. However, when it comes to Hindi, he has limitations," he added.

A local political observer said that Thackeray has badly damaged the image of BJP and Shiv Sena during this polls. "BJP was not prepared for Thackeray campaign and his style of speeches. Therefore, they could not counter him and failed to give answers to the questions raised by him," said the observer.
