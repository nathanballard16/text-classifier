The actor had announced earlier that the film’s shoot would begin in Indore on April 1.And, strictly sticking to the schedule, the movie went on floors in Indore on April 1. Well, the shoot is even more special to Salman and his brother Arbaaz (who is also the producer of the film) for another reason — Indore is the city where both of them were born.On day one of the shoot, Salman didn’t travel to the set like a star, in a swanky car. Instead, he and Arbaaz cycled their way to the location. Salman has earlier shared a video on Instagram, in which he talked about reaching Indore, and how special the city is to both of them. He had said, “Back in our birthplace for ‘Dabangg 3’ shoot. Arbaaz and I have just landed in Indore, where we were both born. We are going to Mandleshwar and Maheshwar to shoot for Dabangg. Our grandfather was posted there when he was in the police force.”Check out this video of Salman and Arbaaz:
