Dog squad helps crack murder within 24 hours

35-year-old man’s body found at Wadi Bunder railway yard

The Mumbai Police cracked a murder case with the help of a dog squad, within 24 hours of the case being registered. The Dongri police arrested two men for killing a 35-year-old man, whose body was found lying near Wadi Bunder railway yard.

The victim could not be identified as the accused had used a cement block to smash the victim’s head. “The body was extremely difficult to identify as no wallet or documents were found on him. We suspected that he was a local and summoned the dog squad to the spot. The dogs led us to a nearby slum at Bhaucha Dhakka,” Abhishek Trimukhe, Deputy Commissioner of Police (zone 1), said.

The Dongri police initially registered a case of murder against unknown persons. The police questioned residents of the locality and circulated photos of the body. Investigations revealed that the victim was Abdul Rehman, a resident of Thiruvananthapuram, who was doing odd jobs on docked ships. The police also found that the victim was often sighted with two other men and would frequently eat and drink with them.

The Dongri police checked the CCTV footage of the area, which showed Rehman coming out of Sameer Bar with two men. “All three men were in an inebriated state and the footage showed they were headed towards the railway yard,” Mr. Trimukhe said. The accused were identified as Shivanand Kattali and Raja Haldar, who used to work with Rehman at the docks.

The accused confessed that they had had a fight with Rehman on Sunday night over financial issues, the police said. As the fight escalated, the victim began abusing them. The two then smashed his head and returned home.

The accused were arrested and booked under Section 302 (murder) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code. They were produced in a local magistrate court and sent to police custody till April 3.
