“India has suffered owing to infiltration but now with NRC, we will uproot it. I promise before the end of 2024, India will be rid of infiltrators and illegal residents. The NRC will be implemented with an iron fist,” declared Union Home Minister and BJP president Amit Shah at a rally here today.

He claimed Congress leader Rahul Gandhi was jealous of PM Narendra Modi’s fame. Addressing him as Rahul ‘baba’ in his speech, he said, “He may not like it, but Modi has created a place in history and the name shall echo for ages to come, thanks to the firm step taken on Kashmir.”

He challenged Hooda and ‘Rahul baba’ to publicly clarify their stand on abrogation of Article 370.

“It takes grit to protect one’s motherland. When Moni (Manmohan Singh) was PM, Pakistan would kill our soldiers and humiliate us, but Modi has given a befitting reply.”

Shah claimed the UPA government was all about 3 Ds — damaad (son-in- law), dalaal (middlemen) and darbari (courtiers ), “but for us its development, development and development”. Seeking support for candidate Sundhir Singla from Gurgaon and Manish Yadav from Badshahpur, he said: “Hooda was busy serving a family and not the state. Look around, assess development and vote Khattar government back to power.”
