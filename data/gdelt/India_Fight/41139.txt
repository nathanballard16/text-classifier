Two held with 23 pistols, 50 cartridges

New Delhi, Aug 27 : The Delhi Police have arrested two men with 23 pistols and 50 cartridges, which were being smuggled in for criminals in Delhi-NCR, from Shanti Van bus stop.

According to the police on Tuesday, the accused Akshay Adhawade (23) and Chandpasha Seikh (28), both residents of Pune, were arrested on August 24.

"We had received a tip-off that two men would be coming from Pune to supply firearms to criminals. A trap was laid and the two accused were held at the bus stand," said P.S. Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell).

The police said Adhawade was arrested in 2017 by the Pune Police in an attempt to murder case. He and his friend, Sunny, had tried to kill one Mukesh to establish their dominance in the area.

"In jail, Adhawade befriended some gangsters and came in contact with arm manufacturers of Madhya Pradesh through one Sandeep Pawar and started procuring arms from them. Initially, he operated in Pune and nearby areas, but with time he made contacts with gangsters in NCR and also started operations here," Kushwaha said.
