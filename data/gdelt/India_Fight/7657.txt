KSU offers to bear educational expenses of slain YC workers’ sisters

The Kerala Students Union (KSU) has offered to bear the educational expenses of Amrutha, the sister of Sarath Lal, and Krishnapriya, the sister of Kripesh, the Youth Congress workers who were murdered at Periya in Kasaragod district on February 17.

K.M. Abhijith, KSU president, told the media on Tuesday that Amrutha was an M.Com. student and Krishnapriya, a Plus Two student.

He alleged that Sarath Lal had been falsely implicated in a criminal case when he supported KSU activists during a campus face-off. There had been efforts to implicate Kripesh too in the case, but he was exempted because he was out of town at the time. Mr. Abhijith claimed that both the activists were threatened by local functionaries of the Democratic Youth Federation of India too. He alleged that the police had ignored the complaints filed by the Congress activists. The Chief Minister himself was inspiring activities which were leading to political murders, Mr. Abhijith added.
