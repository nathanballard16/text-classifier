Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan on Thursday urged youth to foil conspiracies being hatched by enemy against their motherland.While addressing the 17th Convocation of University of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (UJAK), he reminded students that their brothers and sisters in Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) are facing barbarism at the hands of occupation troops and looking forward to the youth in the liberated territory for the realisation of their supreme struggle for freedom.“Indian barbarity and its evil designs are not confined to IOK rather the government in New Delhi is hell-bent on attacking and occupying AJK and persecuting Muslims in India. You will have to prepare for warding off this threat from the enemy by politically, diplomatically and militarily strengthening Azad Kashmir and Pakistan,” President Masood said.He added: “You [youth] must be ready to fight a war against India at Washington, New York, Brussels, and London and at frontiers of the country.While emphasizing on honing skills, he said: “You need to hone your communication skills to plead your case at the political and diplomatic front and strengthen your military prowess to fight any sort of aggression from the enemy against your country.”The AJK president congratulated students, their parents and teachers on the successful completion of their degrees while expressing his delight on their accomplishments. "It is an important day for the passing out graduates especially for those who have grabbed gold medals... it is the beginning of a new journey into their practical life."He also appreciated and acknowledged the untiring efforts of the faculty who enabled the graduating students not only to succeed but also to attain distinctions in various academic disciplines.Emphasizing on imparting character building education, President Masood underscored that education should be holistic and life giving. "Education without character and moral values is meaningless."While praising Vice-Chancellor of the university, Professor Dr Kaleem Abbasi, for achieving goals like hiring proficient faculty and acquiring required funds to build requisite infrastructure of the university, he also applauded the UAJK for holding seminars, conferences and workshops to highlight issues of national significance including the Kashmir issue — all in its true perspective.Earlier in the day, Dr Abbasi expressed his profound gratitude to the president and chancellor of the varsity for his guidance that helped university to achieve its desired targets.He also felicitated the successful students and urged them to broaden their knowledge and skills and use their acquired expertise for the progress and prosperity of their motherland and the nation.“It is a matter of great pride that 91 scholars of different departments are being honoured with M. Phil degrees and 10 with doctorates,” he said, adding that it is a significant breakthrough in the educational history of Azad Jammu and Kashmir.The ceremony was also attended by Vice Chancellors of AJK public sector universities, secretaries to the government, registrar, deans, directors, heads of departments and a large number of students and their parents.The AJK president, who is also the chancellor of the university, was the chief guest of the ceremony.
