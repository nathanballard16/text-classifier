The actor on his journey to Manali stayed at Bilaspur Circuit House where he received a warm welcome by the entire staff.

The Ayan Mukerji directorial film has been pushed to a summer 2020 release.

The movie was earlier set to release in this December, but Ayan said he decided to postpone the date as he did not want to compromise on the technical aspects of the VFX-heavy film.

'Brahmastra' is first part of a sci-fi trilogy which has been created by Ayan. The film has been extensively shot in Bulgaria, New York, and Mumbai, among other places.

The film also stars Mouni Roy and Tollywood actor Nagarjuna.
