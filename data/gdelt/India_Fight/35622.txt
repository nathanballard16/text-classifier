cop probing mining hit: Odisha: Coal thieves try to run over cop in Bhadrak

BHUBANESWAR: A constable was hospitalized after two coal thieves allegedly hit him with their van when he tried to intercept the vehicle in Bhadrak district of Odisha on Sunday. Rajendra Panigrahi, the constable, is battling for life at SCB Medical College and Hospital in Cuttack.Panigrahi, along with three other constables of Bhadrak Rural police station, had gone to raid the van following intelligence input of coal theft. “Investigation has revealed that Panigrahi asked the van’s driver to stop. The driver and helper fled by hitting the constable with the van. We have seized the van and are looking for the accused,” SP (Bhadrak) Rajesh Pandit said.The district police chief said he launched a special drive against the coal mafia in Bhadrak recently. At least 100 persons were arrested during the last one year on charges of stealing coal from train rakes. Police said most of the thefts occurred when the coal was being transported by goods trains to Dhamra Port in the district.“We have been taking stringent action against the coal thieves. A few months ago, we registered a case against a security adviser of the port for his alleged nexus with coal mafia. Investigation is in progress to bust the entire network,” Pandit said. Sources said middlemen purchase one bag of coal weighing nearly 55 kg for only Rs 120 to Rs 150 from small thieves. The middlemen sell the coal to mafia at Rs 20,000 per bag.
