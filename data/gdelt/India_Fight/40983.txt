I arrived in Kashmir as India’s crackdown began. It was terrifying.

The crackdown prevented people from accessing medical care. While we were there, I saw a mother bring her feverish toddler to my cousin’s home seeking medical help, as she could not get her child to a doctor. My 75-year-old father bicycled to three pharmacies seeking injectable pain medication for his sister’s husband, who was sleepless and suffering after a recent heart surgery. My relatives — a pediatrician, a shopkeeper, dentists — did not go to their jobs. Seeing Kashmiris out of work and unable to earn a living was heartbreaking; the state’s economy is tourism-based, and many people try to earn their keep for the entire year during the summer. My 9- and 12-year-old nephews were trapped in their homes, unable to go to school. I asked their father if time would be added onto the school calendar to make up for days missed, but apparently, they would simply skip those units and move on.
