Anshuman Jha: Nursing mother through cancer increased my patience

Mumbai, Nov 20 : Actor Anshuman Jha's mother is battling cancer, and he is actively involved in getting the best treatment for her.

"My mom is a fighter and I have tried everything in my power and been by her side. From Anurag Kashyap sir suggesting kernels for Vitamin B-17 to Ayurveda to Chemotherapy to Tibetan medication from Dharamsala to targeted therapy from Cambridge UK... My journey through the past 13 months has taught me one thing that I don't try to fight cancer or look at it as a scary disease because it is in our body so it is a part of us. Instead, gently try to strengthen the body to help it repair from inside by trying to curing the root of the problem. And hope. For that's beautiful," he said.

Anshuman's mother was diagnosed with cancer in October 2018.

On the film front, Anshuman is awaiting the release of his film "Hum Bhi Akele, Tum Bhi Akele", which is a mainstream Bollywood film with a gay man and a lesbian woman leading the narrative.

He has also stepped in the shoes of a director with the upcoming film "Lord Curzon Ki Haveli".

'I guess my patience levels have increased and maybe, therefore, I can direct now," he added.
