A 24-year-old man was stabbed and shot dead in south Delhi’s Tigri on Wednesday night, the police said on Thursday. They have registered a case and begun probe.

Additional Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Parvinder Singh said that the victim has been identified as Rohit, a resident of Tigri’s JJ Camp, who had two cases of causing hurt registered against him.

The police said that they received a call at 11.10 p.m. regarding a person who was shot at. When they reached the spot, they were told that the victim had been taken to a private hospital by his relatives. “When the police reached the hospital, they were told that the man, identified as Rohit, has succumbed to injuries,” Mr. Singh said.

During investigation, it was revealed that Rohit was killed by another resident of Tigri, identified as Akash, and his accomplices. “Rohit and Akash had an altercation in the afternoon over some petty issue. Later in the night, Akash came along with his brother Annu, Kapil and a few others. They stopped Rohit when he was on his way home and stabbed him eight times before shooting him twice from a close range,” the Additional DCP said, adding that the accused then managed to flee from the spot.

The police said that Akash has one case of murder and another of causing grievous hurt registered against him earlier.
