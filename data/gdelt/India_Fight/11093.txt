India is Fighting Against Terrorists, Not Pakistani Citizens or Army – Journo

Earlier, on 14 February, Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM), a Pakistan-based Islamist terrorist group, attacked an Indian security convoy in the India-controlled Phulwama district of the Jammu and Kashmir state, killing 45 Indian paramilitary officers. The assault is the biggest terrorist act in India since 2008.

"First of all, India's war is on terror and not against Pakistani citizens or its army," Dhillon highlighted. "The recent escalation is a retaliatory action by India against Pakistan-based JeM terrorists who themselves claimed to carry out the attacks on Indian soil (Phulwama) killing 40 Indian soldiers. India secures all the rights to retaliate against an act of terrorism carried on Indian soil".

She admitted that "the Indian Air Force crossed the Line of Control (LoC) and even the international borders to Balakot which falls in Pakistani territory carrying out strikes against the JeM terror camps".

However, Dhillon voiced concerns over the fact that in contrast to the IAF that attacked the terrorist facilities on the ground in Pakistan, the PAF targeted Indian military bases.

She elaborated that in the eyes of Indians, Islamabad's strikes on Indian military assets looks nothing short of an effort to shield JeM.

According to the journalist, "this move escalates the already mounting tensions, as now the Indian Armed Forces may include Pakistani forces in their targets along with the terror groups based in their territory. This clearly is disastrous for the peace in South Asia".
