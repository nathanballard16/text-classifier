Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is not in violation of constitutional provisions: Amit Shah

Home Minister Amit Shah

The Citizenship (Amendment) Bill is not in violation of constitutional provisions, Home Minister Amit Shah asserted on December 9 night as he responded to a debate on the contentious legislation in the Lok Sabha.

It will give relief to people living a painful life after facing persecution in neighbouring countries, he said.

Had India not been divided on religious lines, there was no need for the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, he said targeting the opposition Congress.

The Bill is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution as it aims to give citizenship to persecuted people, he said.

Replying to the Opposition's allegations that the proposed legislation is divisive in nature, Shah said that the Bill seeks to make citizens out of minorities.

"This Bill is not unconstitutional and it is also not a violation of Article 14," Shah said while referring to the Opposition's attack that the proposed legislation was against the basic principles of the Constitution as it "discriminates" on the basis of religion and would alienate Muslims, the largest minority community in the country.

"This bill does not violate articles of Articles 12, 21 or 25... We have done no discrimination on the basis of religion and in future also there will be no discrimination based on religion," Shah said.

According to the Bill, members of Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi and Christian communities, who have come from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan, till December 31 2014, facing religious persecution there, will not be treated as illegal immigrants but given Indian citizenship.

The bill, which has been opposed by the Congress, Trinamool Congress and other opposition parties, was introduced after a division of votes for which 293 MPs voted in favour and 82 against it.
