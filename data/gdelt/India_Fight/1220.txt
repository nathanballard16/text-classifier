Trinamool Congress MP Saumitra Khan joins BJP, party expels him, another MP

Khan’s move comes a day after he alleged that a section of officers of the district police was hatching a conspiracy against him through social media.

Trinamool Congress’s Lok Sabha MP from Bishnupur, Saumitra Khan, joined the BJP on Wednesday afternoon. The TMC subsequently expelled him and Bolpur MP Anupam Hazra for “anti-party activities”. Party sources said Hazra, like Khan, spoke out against the party on social media. Meanwhile, Khan’s personal assistant was arrested by West Bengal police under the Arms Act on Wednesday.

Khan joined the BJP at the party headquarters in Delhi in the presence of Union Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha and senior party leader Mukul Roy.

He is the first Lok Sabha MP to quit the TMC and join the BJP. In November 2017, Roy, once ‘number two’ in the TMC and a Rajya Sabha MP, joined the BJP. Khan is known to be close to Roy.

Explained Unlikely to impact TMC poll prospects

“There is a syndicate raj and police raj in Bengal… The law and order situation of Bengal is deteriorating day by day and Trinamool Congress is supporting goondas,” Khan said.

“What is the definition of ‘anti-party activities’? I hope they tell me. How can writing on Facebook on contemporary issues be dubbed as ‘anti-party activity?’” said Hazra.

“For nearly a year, he (Khan) was seen posting statements on social media and getting involved in some activities which the party did not support…. He had no relation with the organisation. We have also decided to expel Anupam Hazra… for similar anti-party activities,” TMC secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.
