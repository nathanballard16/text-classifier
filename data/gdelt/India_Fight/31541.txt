The Indian army has planned celebratory events across the country for the same.

The celebrations of India's win in what came to be known as "Operation Vijay" will be conducted on a nationwide platform from July 25-27.

Earlier on May 28, Kargil war veteran Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa paid homage to the IAF jawans who lost their lives when a Mi-17 helicopter was shot down by Pakistan during the 1999 battle.

Dhanoa paid the tribute by flying a 'Missing Man' formation at Sarsawa base in Uttar Pradesh. 14 Corps Commander Lieutenant General YK Joshi and Western Air Commander Air Marshal R Nambiar were also a part of the team.

The 'Missing Man' formation is an aerial salute accorded to honour the fallen comrades-in-arms.
