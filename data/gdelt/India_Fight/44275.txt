HYDERABAD: A 26-year-old auto driver, who went missing on Wednesday night, was allegedly burnt alive on the pyre of a housewife by her family members who suspected him of having caused her illnesses and death by black magic at Adraspalle village near Shamirpet on Wednesday.Hours later, Shamirpet police arrested four of the woman’s relatives — G Balaram (52), G Kistaiah (55), B Sriramulu (35) and G Narsimha (30) from Adraspalle village — for the gruesome murder of B Anjaneyulu. Around 8pm on Wednesday, Anjaneyulu, who was also from Adraspalle, went missing after leaving his house. His brother B Ganesh, in his complaint, said Anjaneyulu went out of the house to attend nature's call.At 8.30pm, villagers told him that family members of the woman, G Laxmi (45), had burnt him on her pyre suspecting he might have done sorcery on the housewife.Ganesh and other family members went to a village graveyard and found his footwear near the pyre of the woman who had died while undergoing treatment at Osmania General Hospital on Tuesday night.According to the Cyberabad police, Laxmi had been unwell for the past five years and had various ailments, including blood pressure, diabetes and kidney issues.“As some part of the body was still burning on the pyre at 10pm, the family members pulled it aside suspecting that it was Anjaneyulu's,” assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Pet Basheerabad, AVR Narasimha Rao said.The auto driver’s family alleged that Laxmi's family members had burnt Anjaneyulu alive on her pyre, suspecting that he had performed black magic on the housewife and caused her death.Shamirpet inspector B Naveen Reddy said they took some suspects into custody. On interrogation, the accused confessed they suspected that Laxmi might have died of sorcery and waited at the graveyard anticipating that the sorcerer would come to perform some occult practices.“They noticed Anjanayelu at the tank near the graveyard and caught hold of him. Subsequently, they informed other relatives/villagers over phone. The accused beat him with sticks, axe and stones. Later, they threw him on the burning pyre of Laxmi and killed him,” DCP, Balanagar, PV Padmaja, who visited the crime scene, said.During the crime scene inspection, police found blood-soaked soil near the pyre and some other items. “We have found a handkerchief and blood-soaked soil apart from footwear. All the items were seized for forensic analysis,” the DCP said.Forensic experts collected the charred body parts from the crime scene and sent them to Gandhi Hospital for preservation.“The blood samples from Anjaneyulu’s family members will be sent for DNA analysis to verify if the charred body parts were his,” the inspector said.A murder case was registered under Section 302 of the IPC.
