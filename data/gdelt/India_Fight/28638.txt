The rowdy sheeter Sushank is a resident of Banashankari in the city, and he has multiple cases filed against him including two for murder, two attempts to murder, and two robberies.

Sushank along with his associates Raki, Revanth and Salman abducted software engineer Kinkar Kumar Thakur, stabbed him and fled with his wallet, gold and an ATM card on May 13. Kiran alleged that he was left bleeding profusely by the accused after attempts to make him withdraw money from his ATM card did not go as planned due to lack of money in the ATM kiosk.
