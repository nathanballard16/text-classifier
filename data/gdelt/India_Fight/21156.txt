Driver's seat of MAHB vehicle that collided with aircraft was reclined

PUTRAJAYA: The driver’s seat of the Malaysia Airport Holdings Bhd (MAHB) vehicle involved in an accident with an aircraft at the Subang airport last month was found to be in a reclining position.

However, it is too early to determine if the employee, Mohd Ruzaimi Iskandar Ahmad Razali who was killed in the incident, was asleep when the accident on the runway happened on March 18.
