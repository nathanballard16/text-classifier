Pakistan WARNS India's Arms Deals, Including S-400, Can Encourage Misadventure

Last October, India inked a $5.43 billion defence contract with Russia to purchase of five S-400 air defence systems despite the threat of US sanctions. Pakistan has immediately reacted by claiming that the purchase "is a part of their efforts to acquire a Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) System through multiple sources," adding that the move could destabilise strategic stability in South Asia.

India has denied the accusations, deeming the purchase as necessary for national security.

India's massive acquisition of conventional arms coupled with offensive doctrines, such as Cold Start, and its expansion of strategic assets, including nuclear submarines, are developments with serious security implications for Pakistan and the region, Qureshi opined.

He also mentioned that the recent ASAT test conducted by India on 27 March raised concerns in Islamabad. Qureshi warned the international community against providing concessions and sharing high-end technology with India.

"The country-specific exemption by the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), has had negative implications for strategic stability in our region," Qureshi stated.

Qureshi urged global powers to remain mindful while dealing with countries in the region as the strategic stability of South Asia is impacted not only by regional developments but also by the approach of the international community.
