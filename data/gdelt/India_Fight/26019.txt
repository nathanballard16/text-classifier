In J&K, Terror Groups Plan to Avenge Teacher’s ‘Custodial Killing’

Indian Air Force (IAF) bases in Awantipora and the Srinagar airport have been put on maximum alert after the security and intelligence agencies in New Delhi learned about militants’ plan to strike in a big way on 23 May (17th of Ramzan) to commemorate the historic Battle of Badr with revenge of the ‘custodial killing’ of a private schoolteacher Rizwan Assad Pandit.

Twenty-nine-year-old Rizwan, with post-graduation in chemistry, was found dead in police custody two days after he had been picked up by the Special Operations Group of the Jammu and Kashmir Police from his home in Awantipora on 17 March.
