'Game of Thrones' Season 8 Episode 3 Promo: "The Dead are already here"

The second episode of Game of Thrones season eight was finally dropped today. Titled 'A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms', the episode was kind of calmness across the Winterfell before the big battle to be fought against the White Walkers in the next episode. In the episode, we saw Jaime Lannister joining hands with the Stark to fight against the Dead. Well, Arya Stark is an adult and finally loses her virginity to Gendry, she wasn't ready to die a virgin.

Soon after the second episode was aired, the makers of Game of Thrones dropped the promo of the third episode which is all about the battle. It's dark and no one is going to sleep at night. The promo starts with the army being assembled on the battleground to fight the dead and Sansa Stark's voice can be heard in the background. She says, "The most heroic thing we can do now is look the truth in the face." Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, Samwell Tarly, Sansa Stark and Arya Stark stand near the wall and keep a watch while the White Walkers approach.

Jon is all sweaty as he is fighting the dead while Arya is seen running. There comes the dragon, but which one?! The promo ends with Dany saying to Jon, "The Dead are already here".
