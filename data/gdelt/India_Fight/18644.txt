In interesting news for cinephiles, Sunny Pawar, who shot to fame with the 2017 release Lion, will next star in a film titled Chippa. Directed by writer-director Safdar Rahman, the film is all set to have its North America Premiere at the upcoming 17th Indian Film Festival of Los Angeles 2019 (IFFLA).

Starring Sunny in and as Chippa, the film is a heartwarming tale revolving around a boy, a letter, a night on the streets and the people he meets. The film's teaser sees Chippa's story coming to life when on the eve of his 10th birthday, he receives a letter addressed to him by his long-missing father. Soon after, Chippa takes to the streets unaware of what adventures the night has in store for him.

Co-starring Chandan Roy Sanyal, Sumeet Thakur, Veer Rajwant Singh and Masood Akhtar, the film has been shot by Ramanuj Dutta and edited by Manas Mittal. Produced by Celine Loop, Rajat Agrawal, Sushilkumar Agrawal and AVT Shankardass, the film's music has been composed by Cyrille de Haes.

About the film's North America premiere, director Rahman said, “Chippa is a small film shot in the by-lanes of Calcutta by a crew made up of friends and family, and it’s amazing to see it travel the world. It’s a really intimate story about the dreams of a kid who lives on the pavement and the flight his imagination takes. I am intrigued to see how audiences outside the country will respond to a story like this.”

While Celine Loop, one of the producers of the film, added, “To shoot nights with a child - not to mention a puppy as well- with our constrained resources was not easy. But I am happy that we managed it well, and have come out with a film we are all proud of.”
