Terrorists Abduct Indian Army Soldier in Central Kashmir - Police Sources

According to police, Mohammad Yaseen Bhat, an Indian infantryman, was kidnapped from his residence in the village of Qazipora, Budgam, about 115 km from the Line of Control separating Indian and Pakistani-controlled Kashmir, on Friday evening.

A massive search operation has been launched across the district, with Daesh (ISIS)* suspected of involvement in the kidnapping, police said. Officials said family members informed law enforcement about the abduction after unknown people came to Bhat's home and took him away.

Bhat had been on leave from military service since February 26, with his leave expected to last until March 31, according to local media.
