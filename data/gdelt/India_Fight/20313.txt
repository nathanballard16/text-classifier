Parrikar quit as Defence Minister over Rafale deal: Pawar - Jammu Kashmir Latest News

MUMBAI: Former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar relinquished his post at the Centre and returned to Goa because he did not agree with the Rafale fighter jet deal, NCP chief Sharad Pawar claimed on Saturday.

Addressing reporters in Kolhapur, the Maratha strongman also slammed Prime Minister Narendra Modi alleging that he had failed to fulfill the promises made during the 2014 poll campaign and was, therefore, diverting people’s attention.

“The Rafale deal was not acceptable to Manohar Parrikar. He therefore resigned from the post of Defence Minister and returned to Goa,” claimed Pawar.

Parrikar, who took over as Defence Minister in November 2014, was sworn in as Goa Chief Minister on March 14, 2017. He died on March 17 this year after a long battle with a pancreatic ailment. (AGENCIES)
