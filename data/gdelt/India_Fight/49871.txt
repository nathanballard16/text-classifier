Thousands of communists rally after party activists killed

THOUSANDS rallied in protest at political attacks on the Communist Party of India (Marxist) [CPI(M)], which has seen two party workers killed in the past month and the arrest of a senior party leader.

Safiur Rahman was shot dead in Nakashipara, West Bengal, on Thursday, an act which the CPI(M) blamed on the “goons of the TMC [the All India Trinamool Congress].”

It followed the murder of another party member Babulal Biswas last month. Nadia District Committee secretary Sumit Dey demanded the immediate arrest of the accused.

In a statement the CPI(M) expressed its deep condolences and vowed “the struggle will continue — red salute, comrade.”

On Thursday former government minister Badal Chowdhury was arrested while in a Tripura hospital on trumped-up corruption charges.

The CPI(M) claimed the move was a politically motivated attack on the party and condemned the “barbaric action of the police against an ailing leader.”

Mr Chowdury collapsed with breathing difficulties after he was arrested. He was transferred to a state-run hospital where he remains.
