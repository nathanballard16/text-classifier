Mumbai: Exam dates clash, pupils in tight spot

Students of Second Year Bachelor of Commerce (SY BCom), Mumbai University (MU) who failed in some subjects in their first year are in a tight spot. The reason behind it is the clash of dates for SYBCOM exams with ATKT(Allowed to Keep Terms) FYBCOM exams.

Senate members of Mumbai University from Yuva Sena received complaints from many SYBCOM students who urged that if the schedule is not altered then they will be forced to skip one of their exams.

"After receiving a complaint from the students we met Mumbai University's Dr Ravindra Kulkarni, Pro Vice-Chancellor and have submitted the complaint to him in writing. The Mumbai University exam department will soon come out with a revised timetable for the same so that students don't miss out their regular as well as ATKT exams," said Pradeep Sawant, MU Senate Member from Yuva Sena.

The exam in question is the FYBCom semester II Foundation Course exam and SYBCom semester IV Business Law exam. Both the exams are scheduled on May 2, from 2:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Hence SYBCom students with ATKT in FC would not be able to attend one of the exams. Similarly, on May 3, the date for FYBCom Accountancy and Financial Management exam is clashing with SYBCom Advertising II putting several students in dilemma.

Following the initial gaffe, University has promised action.

"There are a couple of papers, dates for which are clashing. We have received the complaints on same and the exam department will soon revise the time table and come out with changes," promised Vinod Malale, Deputy Registrar, Exam department of Mumbai University said.
