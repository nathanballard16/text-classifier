Man found dead at foot of HDB block, while mum found dead in flat

A 54-year-old man was found dead at the foot of a Housing Board block in Little India yesterday morning.

The police, who were alerted to the case at about 7am, also found the body of his mother in their 11th-floor unit in Block 637 Veerasamy Road.

In response to queries, they said the 82-year-old woman was found lying motionless.

Both mother and son were pronounced dead by paramedics at the scene.

The police said they are investigating the unnatural deaths.

A neighbour in a nearby unit, who declined to be named, said the man had lived in the flat for about 40 years.

After his father died about 10 years ago, he and his mother were the only occupants of the flat, said the 60-year-old retiree.

"He loved his mother. He would take her to see the doctor and will go out to buy food for her daily," he added.
