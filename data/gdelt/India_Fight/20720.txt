Lok Sabha polls cancelled in Tamil Nadu's Vellore

NEW DELHI: President Ram Nath Kovind , acting on the Election Commission’s recommendation, on Tuesday cancelled the Lok Sabha election in Vellore constituency of Tamil Nadu over “unlawful activities” of DMK candidate Kathir Anand and some workers of the party as part of a systematic design to influence voters through large-scale distribution of cash.A notification issued by the law ministry on Tuesday said the EC, while making a recommendation to the President on Sunday, informed him that “allowing the current electoral process to proceed and conducting the poll in the said constituency on April 18, 2019... in such a vitiated atmosphere would severely jeopardise the conduct of free and fair election”. The poll body accordingly recommended to the President to rescind the notification insofar as it relates to Vellore.The cancellation of Vellore poll — a first for a Lok Sabha constituency on grounds of voter bribery and corrupt practices — follows days after a massive stash of Rs 11.48 crore cash was unearthed during income-tax raids at premises owned by DMK functionary Poonjolai Srinivasan’s brother-in-law Damodaran in Vellore. Srinivasan later claimed the ownership of Rs 11.48 crore and in his statement recorded u/s 131 of IT Act stated that the cash was meant to influence voters in favour of DMK’s candidate.The Rs 11.48-crore stash was packed in plastic packets with ward wise details. In addition, unused labels, loose sheets with details of ward-wise breakup of voters and documents related to Kingston Engineering College were found from the residence of Damodaran. IT officials believe this cash was possibly shifted from either the residence of Kathir Anand and his father Durai Murugan, DMK MLA and treasurer, or Kingston medical College run by the Durai Murugan Educational Trust, which they had raided a few days earlier.“The fact that the claimant (Srinavasan) does not have any explained source of income and that the documents found with the cash pertain to an institution run by the family of the DMK candidate lays bare the nexus between the candidate and the sums so found,” the local .Earlier in 2016, assembly polls in two constituencies — Thanjavur and Aravakurichi — were cancelled for the same reason, followed by rescinding of a bypoll to R K Nagar assembly seat in 2017. All these constituencies are in Tamil Nadu.In its report dated April 8 on the raids, special expenditure observer for Tamil Nadu Madhu Mahajan stated that the searches had unearthed a systematic design to influence voters through inducements, which came under the ambit of “corrupt practices” as per Section 123 of the RP Act, 1951.Tamil Nadu chief electoral officer in his report dated April 12 said the cash seizure of Rs 11.48 crore along with evidence in the form of computer printouts detailing proposed assembly segment, ward and booth wise money distribution suggests a clear-cut pattern and design to induce the electors at a large scale across the Vellore parliamentary constituency.As per a report compiled by EC on progressive poll-related seizures till April 16, Tamil Nadu has the highest cash seizures among states at Rs 204.77 crore, which constitute 30% of the total Rs 683.29-crore all-India seizures. Tamil Nadu also accounts for the highest seizures of precious metals valued at Rs 294.38 crore in this election, which is a whopping 57% of the Rs 512.678 crore worth of precious metals seized all over the country till April 16. Even in terms of freebies, Tamil Nadu is second only to Andhra Pradesh and has a 16% share in all-India seizures.
