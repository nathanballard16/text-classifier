NEW DELHI: Family members of one of the martyrs of Pulwama terror attack will be among the invitees to attend the swearing-in ceremony of PM Narendra Modi and his new ministers on Thursday, sources said.It was learnt that one of the invitees is Mamata Biswas from Nadia in West Bengal , whose son Sudip was one of the 40 jawans who were massacred on February 14 when a suicide bomber attacked a CRPF convoy. The martyr’s mother will land in Delhi on Thursday morning. Sources said the 27-year-old constable’s father was also keen to come but he could not travel because of health reasons.Another martyr from West Bengal was head constable Bablu Santra from Howrah. TOI could not confirm whether his family members were also coming to Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony.“Giving this honour to the martyrs and their family members will be a great gesture from the PM to those who lost their lives serving the country and it also shows how the government values their sacrifice. It also counters West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee ’s charge of the government giving political colour to the grand event,” said a source.However, families of martyred CRPF personnel from Punjab and Himachal Pradesh said they had not received any invitation to attend the swearing-inLayak Ram, father of martyr Tilak Raj from Kangra (Himachal) said if invited his family would happily attend the swearing-in ceremony. “These days no male member is at home, as my one son got martyred and the other one is working in Punjab. But still, if an invitation is sent, someone from the family will happily go to attend this,” he said.The Pulwama terror attack was the trigger for the Modi government to carry out the Balakot air strike on February 26, which set the narrative on how the Modi government was more decisive to crack down on terror, even across the border.“Yeh hamara siddhant hai ki hum ghar mai ghus kar maarenge... Main lamba intezaar nahin kar sakta (It is our principle to hit enemies inside their territory.... I don't like to wait for long),” Prime Minister Modi had said at a poll rally in Ahmadabad.
