Minor’s death takes expressway crash toll to 7

Hours after six people of a family were killed in a car-truck collision on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway, the family lost a seventh member, who was admitted at AIIMS, Monday.

The victim was identified as six-year-old Aksa. The accident took place around 9 pm Sunday when 13 members of the family, travelling in a Maruti Eeco, were returning to Bulandshahr after a wedding in Ballabhgarh.

While the family alleged their car was hit by a truck from behind, police, after examining the mangled vehicle, suspect the car may have collided with the truck while overtaking it.

“We had received information that a car met with an accident on the Eastern Peripheral Expressway. It was badly damaged… The truck driver is yet to be traced. Six people are currently undergoing treatment. We are obtaining CCTV footage from a nearby toll plaza to ascertain which vehicle caused the accident,” said an officer from Site 5 police station.

Moin Mewati (20) lost two of his siblings in the accident. Sitting next to his brother Farhan, who survived the crash with a jaw injury, he said, “Almost 30 of my relatives had left Ballabhgarh in three cars. I was in a Santro. As I drove ahead, I saw the Eeco in a mangled condition and the bodies of my brothers and sisters. I lost half my family.” His brother Farhan, asleep after a dose of heavy antibiotics, still wore the newly stitched black sherwani that Moin had got him for their relative’s wedding.

According to police, the impact of the crash was such that a metallic part of the truck’s exterior was embedded onto the driver’s side of the car. The car flipped after the crash, causing fatal injuries to its passengers, police said.
