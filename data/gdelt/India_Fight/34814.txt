Tahira Kashyap Khurrana plans a surprise for husband Ayushmann

Ayushmann Khurrana’s busy schedule sees him making guest appearances at his home in Mumbai. The actor has been shooting one film after another in Lucknow and has barely been home with his kids and wife, filmmaker Tahira Kashyap Khurrana . During his last visit for a special screening of Article 15 , he landed an hour before the screening and flew back to Lucknow the next morning. Looking at that, the actor’s wife planned a little surprise for him on Sunday.

Tahira told us, “It had been months since Ayushmann met the rest of the family. On several occasions, he just came home for a few hours. During a chat on the phone recently, I told him, ‘Wahin ek family bhi bhaade pe le lo. You’ve just parked yourself there.’ It was a fun banter that we were having over an intercity phone call, but the fact is that he’s shot three films back-to-back in the same city. He’s been missing the kids and wanted to see them, but I didn’t want to let them go all by themselves. Luckily, while my parents and kids reached Lucknow, I also managed to make time and get there. Since Aparshakti is also shooting there, I got his wife to join us, too. We all landed in the city while he was shooting. He got a real surprise when he returned to the hotel and was overjoyed to see the entire family.”

The filmmaker adds, “I know how difficult it is to strike a balance between work and family. About three-four years ago, I used to grudge it but in the last few years, we’ve learnt the art of managing time with a sense of gratitude for the work we have. I’m more blessed than he is because I get more time with the children. During this visit, we’re having meals together which we’ve not done in months. He went for a swim with the kids, and we did some fun activities indoors on Sunday. While he’s at work, I plan to take the kids and the family around town, too.”
