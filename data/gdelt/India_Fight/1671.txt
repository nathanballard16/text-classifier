Bharat: Varun Dhawan to play young Dhirubhai Ambani in Salman Khan’s film?

Varun to play young Dhirubhai Ambani in Bharat?

Ever since it was announced, Bharat, that stars Salman Khan in the lead role, has been making headlines. The film, an official adaptation of the 2014 Korean film Ode To My Father, is being directed by Ali Abbas Zafar. It is for the third time after Sultan (2016) and Tiger Zinda Hai (2017) that Zafar has joined hands with Salman for a film.

Even as Bharat is approaching the end of its shooting schedule, inside details pertaining to the film are emerging. For a while now, stories have been doing rounds that Varun Dhawan has a special appearance in the film. Well, if a recent report on Bollywood Hungama is anything to go by, Varun will be seen portraying a young Dhirubhai Ambani in the film.

A source in the report has been quoted as saying, “Ali and team are keeping the details of Bharat under tight wraps. Though we all know that the film is a remake of the Korean flick Ode To My Father, the team has been pretty discreet about their given roles. But yes, Varun Dhawan, who has joined the cast for a small role, will be seen playing the younger version of a well-known Indian businessman.” (Ahead of Bharat's release, Disha Patani shows off her power-packed Kung fu moves - watch video)

“Earlier it was unclear whether Varun’s cameo would be a song or a role, but now it is known that he will be seen playing the younger version of the late Dhirubhai Ambani in Bharat,” the source said further.

A joint production venture between Reel Life Productions, T-Series Films and Salman Khan Films, Bharat is slated to hit the screens on Eid this year.
