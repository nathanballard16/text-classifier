Suicide attack on minority Hazaras in Quetta leaves 20 dead, 50 injured

ISLAMABAD: At least 20 people were killed and nearly 50 injured when a bomb aimed at targeting the minority Shia community exploded at a vegetable market in Pakistan ’s southwestern city of Quetta on Friday.The explosion occurred as members of the Hazara community, Shia Muslims, were busy buying vegetables and fruit in the morning in Quetta’s Hazarganji market, a place that has witnessed similar attacks in the past.Abdul Razzaq Cheema, Quetta’s police chief, said the blast was caused by an improvised explosive device (IED) planted in a sack of potatoes. Later, Balochistan home minister Mir Zia Ullah Langove said at a press conference that it was a suicide bombing.The Hazara community travels from Hazara Town (the residential area of the community), escorted by a convoy of police and paramilitary forces, to Hazarganji market to buy vegetables. Their movement out of the residential area is restricted due to threats to their lives. “Since they are constantly under threat of attack, we provide them with a security escort,” Cheema said.“Among the dead, eight were Hazaras. At least one Frontier Corps (paramilitary force) soldier deputed for their security was also killed in the attack. Others who lost their lives included shopkeepers, businessmen and people working or residing in the area,” Cheema said.Qadir Nayil, a Hazara community leader, asked the government for better protection. “Once again we were the target, and once again we will have to bury our dear ones,” he said, demanding the government punish all those involved in the terrorist attack.While isolated shootings of Hazaras often take place, a major bomb attack targeting them happened at least after a year.Images from the blast scene showed burnt human flesh, blood-soaked clothes, damaged vehicles and scattered vegetables and fruits.The majority of over half a million Hazaras have settled in Quetta, the capital of volatile Balochistan province, Pakistan’s mineral-rich and largest province by area, since fleeing Afghanistan to escape violence in their homeland during the past four decades. Islamist militants who operate in the province often target members of the Hazara Shia community in the region.A separatist insurgency is also on in the restive province with separatist groups of Baloch nationalists demanding autonomy and a greater share in the province’s resources. They frequently target security forces and government installations.Pakistan’s National Commission for Human Rights had released a report last year stating that 509 Hazaras were killed and 627 injured in various incidents of terrorism in Quetta from January 2012 to December 2017.According to members of the community, they refrain from engaging in business or education in other parts of the city because of the risks to their lives.No group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The far-right Ahle Sunnat Wal Jammat and the associated Lashkar-e-Jhangvi militant group have been involved in sectarian violence in Balochistan in the past.
