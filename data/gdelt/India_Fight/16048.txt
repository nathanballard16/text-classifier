China Vows to Support Pakistan Amid Simmering Tension on Indian Subcontinent

The statement is a clear departure from Beijing's earlier stance when on 27 February, in the wake of aerial exchanges between the air forces of India and Pakistan, the Chinese foreign office indicated that it would not take the side of any country as it observed "India and Pakistan are both important countries in South Asia".

"India and Pakistan are both important countries in South Asia. We hope the two sides will bear in mind the peace and stability in the region, exercise restraint, step up dialogue and properly resolve relevant issue, so as to safeguard the fundamental interests of their countries, maintain peace and stability in the region and refrain from actions that might lead to further escalation of tensions", Lu Kang, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson said on 27 February.

The hostilities between India and Pakistan have been simmering since they escalated on 26 February when the Indian Air Force trespassed on Pakistani territory to launch an aerial attack on an alleged terrorist camp in Balakot. The Pakistani Air Force reciprocated by entering Indian airspace and bringing down a fighter plane. On 14 February a terror attack claimed by a Pakistani-based jihadi outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed targeted Indian paramilitary forces in Pulwama.
