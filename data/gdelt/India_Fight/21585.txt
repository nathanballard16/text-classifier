'Vande Mataram' resonates in Amit Shah's Sanand roadshow

BJP president Amit Shah, who is contesting the Lok Sabha elections from Gandhinagar seat, held a roadshow in Sanand town on Sunday, hours before campaigning for the April 23 elections came to an end.

Education minister Bhupendrasinh Chudasama, state BJP president Jitu Vaghani, minister Kunvarji Bavaliya, and hundreds of party leaders and workers, accompanied Shah for what was his third roadshow in his maiden Lok Sabha election bid.

Shah had held a massive roadshow in Ahmedabad on the day of filing his nomination, and another one in Kalol town of Gandhinagar last Sunday.

The nearly two km roadshow commenced from Sanand APMC crossroad and culminated at Gadhia Char Rasta on Bavla road.

The state BJP said in a release that a large number of party workers, supporters, and citizens greeted the Shah during the roadshow. Flowers were showered on him at many places during the event, while he was welcomed with swords and traditional turbans at other places.

Chants of Bharat Mata Ki Jai and Vande Mataram reverberated throughout the roadshow.

Sanand, which was a dusty village until a few years ago, shot to prominence a few years ago when Tata Motors shifted its Tata Nano plant from West Bengal to Sanand.

Today, it is one of the biggest industrial estates in the state. The Sanand Assembly seat is held by Kanu Patel of BJP.

Before the roadshow, the BJP president held meetings with party workers and chairmen-secretaries of residential societies of Ghatlodia, Bodakdev, Thaltej, Vejalpur, and Sarkhej wards of the city, seeking their support for his election bid.

Campaigning for the Lok Sabha elections ended at 6pm on Sunday.
