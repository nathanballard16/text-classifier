Acting on a directive by the Election Commission (EC), the state government on Sunday transferred Mumbai's Joint Commissioner of Police (Jt CP), law and order,, and replaced him with Jt CP Vinoy Kumar Choubey, who earlier led the Economic Offences Wing (EOW).Bharti was in the key post for around four years - he was appointed Jt CP (law and order) in April 2015 - making him the longest-serving officer in the position. He has now been appointed Jt CP, EOW, as per a government order issued by a home department deputy secretary.Choubey, a 1995-batchcadre IPS officer, had been brought in as Jt CP, EOW, in May 2018. Before that, he was the Inspector General of Nashik range.A 1994-batch Maharashtra-cadre IPS officer, Bharti had been with the Mumbai Crime branch for several years and had supervised several high-profile investigations, including those related to terror outfit, when several of its key operatives were arrested, and the 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks, orchestrated by a 10-manteam.The Maharashtra government had earlier sent a proposal to the EC to allow Bharti to continue in the post, given his experience and track record, but this was finally rejected. On Saturday, the EC directed the state government to shift Bharti, following which the transfers were ordered with immediate effect. Two months ago, the EC had asked the state to shift out all officers who had completed tenures of three years, after which the government transferred several IPS officers, but requested that Bharti be retained in his post till the Lok Sabha elections concluded.Though the EC had rejected the proposal, the government had made another plea to retain him, citing that the city already had a new police commissioner as well. The EC had accepted the proposal at the time, but on Saturday asked the state government to move Bharti out.Both Bharti and Choubey were unavailable for comment despite Mirror's attempts to reach them.
