Game of Thrones Season 8: Bran Stark aka Issac Hempstead Wright spills the bean on Bran’s dead creepy stare

Issac Hempstead Wright plays Bran Stark aka The Three Eyed raven in the popular fantasy show Game of Thrones. The actor was just 10 years old when he started shooting for the show and has literally grown up on the sets of the show. He recently opened up about his character on the final season of the show and also explained why often, his character Bran’s stare comes across as creepy on the show. Issac revealed that he is completely blind without his glasses during the shooting so his gaze often comes across as creepy or dead straight.

On a recent interview with Jimmy Kimmel Live Issac Hempstead Wright revealed, “I don't have my glasses and I don't have contact lenses. I need them to see.” He further revealed about a hilarious incident during the shoot wherein he had to share the screen with Sophie Turner who plays his onscreen sister Sansa Stark on the show. He revealed how Sophie went on to praise his deep and intense stare after the scene. He recalled the incident and said, “She said, 'Isaac, your stare is like you're staring into my soul', and I was like, 'I can't see you. That's why."

Issac Hempstead Wright further spoke about whether his character is on the good or bad side of the story. On this he said, “I think he's the Three-Eyed Raven, who is definitely on the side of the living.” There are many theories which suggest that Bran Stark is actually the prime antagonist Night King on the show. Issac spoke on this too and revealed, “I can neither confirm nor deny." Well, his cryptic reaction on this theory has made us even more pumped up about how events will further unfold in the show.
