Parents change statement, say 14-year-old committed suicide

Ludhiana: Mystery continues to shroud the death of 14-year-old Gurdeep Singh, who was found dead at his house in Guru Arjun Dev Nagar on Friday night, with his parents changing their statement on Sunday.

“Earlier, Gurdeep’s parents had claimed that they found him lying motionless on bed and when he was rushed to a hospital, doctors declared him brought dead. But on Sunday they said their son committed suicide by hanging himself from a grill. Their changing statements are adding to the mystery of the case,” said assistant commissioner of police (ACP-east) Devinder Chaudhary.

Gurdeep’s father Davinder Singh had told police on Saturday that around 8:30pm on Friday, he along with his wife and younger son Sukhmeet had gone to a nearby gurdwara after dropping his daughter at a neighbour’s house. Since Gurdeep had to prepare for his Class VIII final exams, they locked him inside the house so that he could study. Davinder claimed that when they retuned after about half-an-hour, Gurdeep was lying lifeless on bed.

“After receiving the autopsy report — which stated that strangulation marks were found on Gurdeep’s neck — when his father was questioned again, he said on returning home, they found him hanging from the stair grills with a dupatta. They brought the body down and laid it on bed. They claimed that they did not speak about it as they were scared,” the ACP added.

On why the boy ended his life, the ACP said, “His parents do not know what made Gurdeep take the extreme step. They said till Friday evening, Gurdeep was happy and playing with other children.”

Police have sent his viscera to a Kharar laboratory for examination.

The autopsy was conducted by a board of three doctors. “On Monday, we will get it in writing from the doctors if strangulation marks were caused by hanging. We will take further action after receiving the report,” the cop added.
