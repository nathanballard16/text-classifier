The car, which was coming at a high speed, overturned after the driver lost control.

Two junior college students preparing to take a medical entrance test were killed after their car overturned during a night ride in Hyderabad on Thursday. There were 10 young people, all below 19, in the car that was being driven overloaded with passengers, the police said.

The students of Narayana College in Hyderabad scaled the wall of the hostel to take the hatchback, which one of the boys had brought, for a spin at night.

The car, which was coming at a high speed, overturned after the driver lost control in Hyderabad's Rajendranagar, killing two of them on the spot, the police said.

The condition of two others, admitted to a hospital, is serious. The rest ran away from the accident site and have reached their hostel, the police said.

Their parents who arrived after being informed about the accident alleged the college did not make efforts or take a head count to find out where the 10 students had gone at night.
