Kasautii Zindagii Kay: Parth Samthaan is all of us complaining about Mumbai traffic; check it out

Parth Samthaan who is seen essaying the role of Anurag Basu in Kasautii Zindagii Kay is a millennial at heart. The actor makes sure to keep his fans updated with his day to day activities and woes as Parth. Given that Mumbai is always reeling under the after-effects of traffic, Parth today shared an image of the Mumbai traffic on Instagram story making us all go, RELATABLE AF!

Parth, in the meantime, is balancing off work and personal life like a pro. The actor will be flying off to Switzerland soon to shoot for an interesting twist for Kasautii Zindagii Kay. He will be joined by Karan Singh Grover and Erica Fernandes for the shoot. Karan made an entry a few episodes before in the show and his role of Mr Bajaj has already created a lot of buzz. Parth's chemistry with Erica is one of the major highlights for the show. Recently, Hina Khan who played the role of Komolika made an exit from the show.

Speaking of Parth, there are rumours that the actor might be participating in Nach Baliye 9 with Erica; however, from what we know, the rumours are false. Given the format of the show which included having exes as dance partners, we are not really sure if Parth and Erica would want to be a part of it. Meanwhile, Urvashi Dholakia is the first contestant to have been confirmed for the show. A promo featuring her with her ex has already gone on air, and honestly, the concept though is alluring, it changes the entire concept of Nach Baliye.
