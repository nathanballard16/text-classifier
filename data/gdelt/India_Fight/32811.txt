Mumbai (Maharashtra) [India], July 2 (ANI): At least 18 people were killed while 13 others sustained injuries after a wall collapsed in Malad area of the city on Tuesday amid heavy downpour.

The compound wall of a building, located in Kurar village, collapsed on hutments on a hill slope in the wee hours.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Minister of State for Urban Development Yogesh Sagar visited Shatabdi Hospital to meet the injured.

Fadnavis also took stock of the situation in the rain-drenched city during a visit to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) control room.

The chief minister told reporters that the administration, police and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams are keeping a close watch on the situation.

"Last night, unprecedented rainfall was witnessed in Mumbai which led to several mishaps. In Malad, slums were destroyed after a wall collapsed and 30-40 people were injured. I personally met them today at the hospital," he said.

Fadnavis said forces are on alert as high tide is expected.

"The western line (of the local train services) is operational, but the central line has been shut due to flooding. This morning, we declared a day's holiday for all so that Mumbaikars can stay safe. Overall traffic is under control. We are trying to pump out water. In the next two days, the India Meteorological Office (IMD) has forecast heavy rainfall, and we are closely monitoring the situation," he said.
