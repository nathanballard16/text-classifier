Two fierce tigers have been snapped fighting over a marked territory - much to the delight of tourists enjoying a safari.

Pankaj Misra, 68, was on a safari in Bandhaygarh National Park, India, when he witnessed the big cats - who are in fact sisters - fighting.

The keen photographer, who is from Lucknow, India, captured the amazing action shots of the dramatic clash from an open jeep.

These two tigers - who also happen to be sisters - were captured in the midst of a fierce brawl in Bandhavgarh National Park, India, after one of them marked the other one's territory

Photographer Pankaj Misra, 68, was on safari when her group spotted one of the big cats near a watering hole and settled down for three hours to watch her

The wildlife enthusiast said: 'On the day of these pictures, we saw a tigress resting next to a pond, so we waited for three hours for some movement.

'Just as we were about to leave the park, we heard a call behind and saw another tigress walking in the same direction.

'She marked her territory which the other tigress noticed and then started pursuing her.

'We were about 10 to 15 feet in front of them, in an open jeep just as both the tigresses descended upon each other in a massive confrontation.

'Interestingly, our guide informed us that both were sisters.

'The fight lasted for a few minutes, which gave us plenty of time to capture some amazing moments.'

Ms Misra said the group was just about to leave when another tiger was seen walking nearby and marking part of the territory, which upset the tiger they had been watching
