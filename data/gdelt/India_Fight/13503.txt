Rajnath discusses J&K situation with governor after grenade blast

Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Thursday talked to J&K governor Satyapal Malik over phone and took stock of situation in the state where one person was killed and 30 injured after a grenade explosion at Jammu bus stand.

He also expressed deep anguish over the death of a 20-year-old youth Mohammed Sharik from Uttarakhand who succumbed to his injuries in a hospital.

"Deeply anguished at the loss of precious life in a grenade attack at Jammu bus stand today. I pray for the speedy recovery of the injured. I also spoke to the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir, Satyapal Malik, over the phone and discussed the situation in the wake of this incident," Rajnath tweeted.

Police said the blast occurred around 11.50 a.m. when a grenade hurled by a militant under a packed parked bus exploded. The bus was headed to Uttarakhand.

The explosion also injured passengers in a nearby bus which was set to leave for Amritsar.

According to police, four others were critically injured.

Soon after the explosion, the area was cordoned off and the militant merged into the crowd and escaped. But, the police later claimed to have caught him, declaring the role of terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen behind the attack.
