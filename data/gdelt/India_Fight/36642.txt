Former UAE resident shot dead in a petrol station robbery in the U.S.

A former UAE resident was recently shot dead in a petrol station robbery in the United States.

Neil Kumar, a 30-year-old Indian national, grew up in the city of Sharjah in the UAE. He was pursuing his master's degree in computer science at Troy University in the state of Alabama — where the shooting took place. Last Wednesday, Kumar opened up the station early morning, where he had been working part-time. Shortly after 6 a.m., just four minutes after opening the station, a masked gunman shot him at point-blank range before robbing cash from the station's mini-market.

The incident was captured on CCTV and showed just how fast the shooting took place.

"After reviewing the camera system we saw…a male person entered the store with their handgun, pointed at the clerk and went behind the counter,” said Moses Davenport, chief of police in the city of Brundidge, according to The National.
