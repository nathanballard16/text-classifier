Slain Karnataka CRPF trooper's family elated over aerial strike against JeM in Pakistan

The aerial strike by the Indian Air Force (IAF) on terror camps inside Pakistan on Tuesday elated the family of Karnataka's martyred CRPF trooper H. Guru, as it came on the 13th day of his death, his younger brother Madhu said.

"All in the family and in the village are 'khush' (happy) and relieved that India struck the terrorists in Pakistan. This counter attack will give peace to my brother's soul and we feel he will be liberated to go swarga (heaven)," Madhu, 26, told IANS from Guru's native village Gudigere in Mandya district, about 100km from here.

Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Constable (General Duty) Guru, 29, was one of the 40 troopers who died in a terror attack while going to Srinagar from Jammu in a convoy in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on February 14.

"Coincidentally, the attack by India was on an auspicious day for us, as we performed Guru's last death ceremony (vaikuntha samradhane) when a departed soul is sent to heaven for liberation. We feel 'dharma' (justice) has been done to him," said Madhu, a lineman in the state-run electricity distribution firm.

The news of the aerial strike came when the family members, including Guru's father Honnaiah, mother Chikka Thayamma, widow Kalavathi, his youngest sibling Anand and other relatives were reading to perform the last rituals at home.

"We are proud of the government for avenging the death of Guru and other CRPF troopers and several people, including soldiers in the line of duty. We hope India will win the proxy war by eliminating all terrorists hiding in Pakistan so that we can live in peace," said an emotional Madhu.
