: At least 44 CRPF personnel were killed in Jammu and Kashmir's Pulwama district on Thursday when a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the bus they were travelling in, officials said.The terror group has claimed responsibility for the incident, they said.Police identified the terrorist as Adil Ahmad from Kakapora in Pulwama. He joined the Jaish-e-Mohammed in 2018, they said.The casualties are likely to go up.Several people were injured in the terror attack, which reduced the bus to a mangled heap of iron. Body parts could be strewn around the area.The vehicle was blown up on the Srinagar-Jammu highway in Awantipora area of the district, a police official said.Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli spoke to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and expressed condolences, concern and condemnation over the attack.Union I&B Ministry has issued advisory for television channels in wake of attack.In a statement, the Goverment of India condemned the cowardly terrorist attack."This heinous and despicable act has been perpetrated by Jaish-e-Mohammed, a Pakistan-based and supported terrorist organisation proscribed by the United Nations and other countries.This terror group is led by the international terrorist Masood Azhar, who has been given full freedom by Government of Pakistan to operate and expand his terror infrastructure in territories under the control of Pakistan and to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere with impunity.The Government of India is firmly and resolutely committed to take all necessary measures to safeguard national security. We are equally resolved to fight against the menace of terrorism. We demand that Pakistan stop supporting terrorists and terror groups operating from their territory and dismantle the infrastructure operated by terrorist outfits to launch attacks in other countries.We strongly reiterate our appeal to all members of the international community to support the proposal to list terrorists, including JeM Chief Masood Azhar, as a designated terrorist under the 1267 Sanctions Committee of the UN Security Council and to ban terrorist organisations operating from territories controlled by Pakistan," the MEA said in a statement.An NIA team with suitable forensic component is leaving on Friday morning for Kashmir to assist the J&K Police in forensic evaluation of the scene of crime.
