— StarPlus (@StarPlus) June 3, 2019 A source told Pinkvilla, “Karan is today shooting for his promo in Malvani. His entry is said to be very daredevil and macho where he jumps off the terrace (whether it is to save someone or just a sport is not known as yet). The channel has planned to make an official announcement either tomorrow or latest by Sunday. Though Karan begins shooting for the show a little later than next week, wherein the team will be flying to Switzerland. Before that, the makers are hoping for the promo to create a stir given that it marks Karan's return to Television after a hiatus.”Are you excited for Karan Singh Grover’s entry in Kasautii Zindagii Kay 2?
