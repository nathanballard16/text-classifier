Kashmir suicide attack kills dozens of Indian security forces

At least 42 Indian forces have been killed in a suicide attack in southern part of India-administered Kashmir, the worst such attack in two decades of Kashmir conflict, Al Jazeera reports.

The suspected attacker, a local rebel, rammed his explosives-laden car into a bus carrying paramilitary troopers in Lethpora village near Awantipora along a highway in Pulwama district on Thursday.

The national highway connects Kashmir's main city of Srinagar with the region's southern parts.

A senior official, who was not authorised to speak to the media, told Al Jazeera that at least 42 paramilitary personnel were confirmed dead in the attack and over a dozen wounded.

"The casualty in the incident is 42," the official said, adding that it was the worst ever attack carried out by the rebels. He said car bomb attacks were rare in Kashmir.

The official said buses carrying the paramilitary troopers were returning in a convoy to Srinagar when a Scorpio car rammed into one of the buses.

"The attack happened late afternoon on Thursday. The wounded have been shifted to hospitals. We are still ascertaining the facts," the official said.

Images from the site of the blast showed a bus completely burned as dozens of bodies lay scattered on the highway.

A statement issued by the Jammu and Kashmir police said 33 troopers were confirmed dead. "The exact number of casualties is being ascertained," it said.

"It was the worst attack in 20 years," a senior police official told Al Jazeera.

Pakistan-based rebel group, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), has claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement to a local news agency.

India has condemned the attack, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi calling it "despicable" and "dastardly". Home Minister Rajnath Singh is scheduled to visit Kashmir region on Friday to take stock of the situation.
