Pakistan Bashes India's Plan to Open Siachen, World's Highest Battlefield, for Tourism

Pakistan has raised serious concerns over India’s decision to open the Siachen region for tourism. Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mohammad Faisal claimed that India forcibly occupied Siachen in 1984 and that it is a disputed territory.

“How can India open Siachen for tourism? It is a disputed territory forcibly occupied by India. We do not expect any goodwill gesture from India”, Faisal said while briefing media in Islamabad on Thursday.

While announcing the decision to open Siachen for tourists, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said last month that Ladakh has tremendous potential for growth through tourism.

"Better connectivity in Ladakh would certainly bring tourists in large numbers. The Siachen area is now open for tourists and tourism", the minister said. "From Siachen Base Camp to Kumar Post, the entire area has been opened for tourism".

The Indian government claimed that the decision was made with consonance of the opinion submitted by the Indian Army, as it believed that people have developed a keen interest in army life and its ways, especially noting the mounting interest by Indians wanting to visit Ladakh and nearby areas.
