Mahadayi river dispute: Opposition slams Goa CM

Goa Chief Minister Pramod Sawant is under fire from Opposition parties over the ongoing tussle between the coastal state and neighbouring Karnataka over sharing of the Mahadayi river water.

In the latest attack, former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardesai on Monday asked Sawant to campaign in Karnataka by-elections and talk about not allowing diversion of the river water there.

"I challenge @DrPramodPSawant to campaign in #KarnatakaByElection and publicly state that he wouldn't allow a single drop of #Mhadei water to be diverted. Last month he canvassed in Maharashtra assembly polls and bought property too," tweeted Sardesai, who headsthe Goa Forward Party (GFP).

Opposition parties have been targeting Sawant, as Union Environment Minister and BJP leader Prakash Javadekar could not withdraw the letter given by his ministry to the Karnataka government.

The letter stated that no Environment Clearance (EC) was required for one of the projects on the Mahadayi river in the southern state.

On November 4, Javadekar had assured an all-party delegation of politicians from Goa in New Delhi that he would clarify on the letter within ten days.
