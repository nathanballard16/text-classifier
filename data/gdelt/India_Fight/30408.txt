Dairy unit worker, 35, found murdered on Hambran Road

Ludhiana: A 35-year-old dairy unit worker was found murdered on Hambran Road on Sunday morning.

Police suspect the man was attacked on head with a heavy stone, as it was found near the body.

With no documents or cellphone on him, cops faced a difficult time to establish his identity until evening, when his wife identified him as Upinder Mahato.

His wife, Kavita, told the police, “Upinder left home around 5pm on Saturday to buy snacks. When he did not return for long, I called him up many a time, but his cellphone was switched off. The entire night we kept looking for him, but to no avail. On Sunday afternoon, I came to know that a body had been found on Hambran Road. I rushed to the spot and identified it as that of my husband.”

Assistant sub-inspector Sukhdeep Singh said, “A stone with blood stains on it has been recovered from the spot. It is suspected that Upinder was attacked with it. From old rivalry to robbery, we are probing the case from all angles. His wallet and cellphone are missing.”

Upinder worked and lived at a dairy complex on Hambran Road. He is survived by his wife and four children.

PAU police have registered a case under Section 302 (murder) of the IPC.

Sources in police said, “A resident of the dairy complex has been rounded up for questioning.”
