Senior citizen’s murder: police doubtful about robbery angle

Investigators found cash, jewellery intact in her safe

A day after a 65-year-old woman was found murdered at her residence in west Delhi’s Punjabi Bagh, the police on Thursday said that it did not appear to be a case of robbery.

Victim Saroj Gupta was found at her residence around 7 p.m. on Wednesday when her husband returned home after taking an evening stroll, the police said.

“The police were immediately informed about the incident after which they reached the spot. They found the woman lying dead in the bedroom. The safe in the room was found open and the key was lying nearby,” said a senior police officer, adding that prima facie, it seemed that the victim had been smothered to death.

Based on the complaint given by the deceased’s family, a case on charges of murder and robbery was lodged. The officer said that while the family suspected robbery was the motive of the murder, investigators found that cash and jewellery in the safe were “intact”. “The role of one of victim’s acquaintances is being probed,” he said.

The victim lived with her husband. Their sons stay in a separate accommodation.
