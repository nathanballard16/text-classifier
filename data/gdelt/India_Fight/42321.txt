NEW DELHI:In the span of just a week, industrial accidents in three factories of different sizes and categories have left at least 40 workers dead and over 100 injured. According to data from the Labour and Employment Ministry, as many as 3,562 workers lost their lives and 51,124 were injured between 2014 and 2016 in accidents in factories across the country. That's three deaths and 47 injured in India's factories every day. Gujarat witnessed maximum number of deaths, followed by Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu.What is common among most of these accidents is ignorance or lax implementation of safety norms. Yet, heads rarely roll at high levels and the matter ends with the announcement of compensation.
