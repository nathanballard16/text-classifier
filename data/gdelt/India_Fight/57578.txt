After repeatedly denying that they fired on protesters, the Lucknow police on Tuesday, for the first time, admitted that a youth died in police firing but claimed that the action was undertaken in self-defence last week.Uttar Pradesh DGP had said that no one died in police firing during the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act. Kanpur police, too, had made a similar admission, saying they opened fire in the air but nobody was injured.Bijnor SP (Rural) Vishwajeet Srivastava on Tuesday said a 22-year-old man was killed when a policeman opened fire while facing a violent mob in Nahtaur area.“On December 20, after Friday prayers, a violent mob attacked a police station and snatched the pistol of sub-inspector Ashish Tomar,” he said. Aconstable was fired at when he tried to get it back.“When the constable opened fire in self-defence, it hit him, and he died,” he added.Congress leadersandVadra were stopped by police from entering Meerut while they were on their way to meet the families of those who died during protests.Even though Rahul told reporters that they were not shown any orders preventing their entry, a police statement stated that they were served a notice as a curfew under Section 144 was in place and the situation in Meerut was sensitive.At least five protesters died in Meerut alone last week during the protests.Going against the party’s official line, BJP Bengal vice-president Chandra Kumar Bose advocated inclusion of Muslims in the CAA.Bose, who is the grandnephew of Netaji, has been at loggerheads with the state unit on a range of issues. “If #CAA2019 is not related to any religion why are we stating - Hindu, Sikh, Boudha, Christians, Parsis & Jains only! Why not include #Muslims as well? Let’s be transparent,” he wrote onMeanwhile, thedismissed a plea alleging telecom services were disrupted in Delhi during the protests in violation of rules. The Centre, however, told the court that the disruption had only been for four hours on December 19 and was no longer in effect.
