If Congress acted wisely, Pakistan wouldn’t be born: Modi

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi today said had the Congress party leadership acted wisely during pre-independence time, Pakistan would not have been born.



"Had Congress leaders acted wisely during the pre- independence era, this Pakistan would not have born," Modi said addressing a poll rally in Latur district of Maharashtra, reports our New Delhi correspondent.



Modi also appeared to ask first-time voters to dedicate their first vote to those who carried out Indian Air Force's strike on a camp of terror group Jaish-e-Mohammed in Balakot in Pakistan on February 26 in response to the attack on Indian paramilitary personnel in Pulwama that left 40 security men dead on February 14, our New Delhi correspondent reports.



"Can your first vote be dedicated to those who carried out air strike?" Modi said, appealing to first-time voters.



Modi alleged the Congress party's manifesto speaks the same language as that of Pakistan. He accused the Congress and its ally Nationalist Congress Party of standing with those who want a separate Prime Minister for Jammu and Kashmir, an allusion to National Conference leader Omar Abdullah's remark in this connection.



Modi said that under the BJP's watch it was the policy of 'New India' that it will kill terrorists barging into their dens.



The Indian prime minister reiterated his allegation that the opposition parties were questioning the valour of the security forces post last month's Pulwama terror attack.
