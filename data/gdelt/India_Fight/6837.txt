Surat Trader Cancels Daughter's Wedding Feast & Donates Rs 11 Lakh To Pulwama Martyrs' Families

A businessman from Surat has donated Rs 11 lakh to the families of martyrs and Rs 5 lakh to service agencies in the wake of deadly attack on CRPF jawans on Thursday that claimed 44 lives.

Dewashi Manek, a diamond merchant from Surat, cancelled a feast for his daughter’s wedding and instead donated the sum as monetary relief to the grieving families in Jammu & Kashmir.

Manek’s daughter Ami got married on February 15 and the wedding feast was due next day after the ceremony. Instead of spending money on the wedding feast, the businessman decided to help the families of the jawans who lost their lives in the dastardly attack.

Political parties across India have united in this hour of grief. Congress called off lunch that was scheduled to be held in honour of the ambassadors of the G20 nations on Friday.

On Thursday, at least 44 Jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were martyred in a terror attack in Jammu and Kashmir’s Pulwama district. Acting swiftly on cross-border terrorism, India, on Friday withdrew the 'Most Favoured Nation' (MFN) status to Pakistan.

In the worst-ever terror attack in J&K, a suicide bomber, recognised as Adil Ahmad Dar, rammed his explosive-laden Scorpio SUV into a CRPF bus. The bus was ferrying over 40 soldiers and was part of a convoy of over 70 vehicles with 2,547 CRPF personnel, moving from Jammu to Srinagar.

Dar has been recognised as a 20-year-old local resident from south Kashmir’s Pulwama district.
