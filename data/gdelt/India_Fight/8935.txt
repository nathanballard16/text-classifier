Pakistani woman dies after shot by Indian forces for mistakenly crossing border

LAHORE - A young Pakistani woman who was shot by Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) personnel died at a hospital in India’s Amritsar city on Friday.

The victim, identified as Gulshan Bibi (22), a resident of district Narowal.

She was mentally ill and mistakenly crossed the Pakistan-India border at Dera Baba Nanak sector of Gurdaspur district on Wednesday.

On this, Indian forces killed her after declaring a terrorist. Indian media outlets quoted their army as saying she was mentally fit and in her mid to early 40s.

The BSF then took her to the Guru Nanak Civil Hospital where she succumbed to her wounds.

Her husband appealed to Prime Minister Imran Khan to have her body returned to Pakistan. He told media that she left his house at night three days ago and crossed the border near the Indian check post.

Tensions between India and Pakistan have gone high following a suicide attack on an Indian security convoy in the India-administered Kashmir town of Pulwama that killed 42 troopers last week.
