Mamata Alleges Human Rights Violations In Kashmir Even As Another BJP Worker Gets Murdered In Bengal

Mamata also claimed that the subject of human rights is very close to her heart and she had participated in protests against their violations 24 years ago.

Incidentally, Mamata Banerjee led Trinamool government has been accused of human rights violations in the state over murders of political opponents especially belonging to the BJP.

BJP has accused the ruling Trinamool dispensation of murdering 77 of its party workers in recent years and facilitating violence against scores more.

A BJP worker identified as Kader Mollah was found dead in Bengal’s Kakdwip on Sunday morning (17 August) with blood stains and injury marks on his mouth. He had gone missing on Saturday. Mollah was the booth president of BJP’s minority cell and had joined the party six years ago.

He and other party leaders reportedly began getting threats after filing a police complaint against “communally sensitive” material being distributed in the area. BJP has alleged that his murder was a result of an altercation with a local Trinamool leader.
