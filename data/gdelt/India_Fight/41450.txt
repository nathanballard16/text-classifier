India Today Exclusive: Pakistan running fake news factory from PoK

Pakistan has set up a control room in Pak-occupied-Kashmir to spread fake propaganda on the current situation in Jammu and Kashmir through social media, sources in the Ministry of Home Affairs have said.

According to the sources, the Pakistani officers are shooting videos of atrocities wearing Indian Army uniform to circulate them on social media. The entire operation is being carried out in the PoK, they said.

Amid controversy, claim and counter-claim between India and Pakistan, security agencies and cyber team are worried that Pakistan's fake news factory, which they are using to incite emotion, cab ignite violence through social media platforms.

The home ministry sources told India Today TV that in the last few days, several such videos have been circulated from several Pak-based social media handles.

As per intel reports, Pakistan's lie factory is using PoK region to create a scene which will convincingly look like it occurred in Jammu and Kashmir.

The edited videos are then circulated on the different social media platform, claiming that the incident took place on the Indian side of Kashmir.

The home ministry discussed this emerging threat at the last high-level meeting, attended by the military intelligence, Information Bureau, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology & Information and Broadcast ministry and MHA officials, a few days ago.

The ministry sources said that a few of the videos in circulation were old, but some fresh ones had been recorded in PoK, using same attire as well as the location.

The MHA is in touch with Google and social media platform providers to check and ban such handles, the sources said.
