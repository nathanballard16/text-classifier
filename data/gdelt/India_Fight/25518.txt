Bengal violence: Who was Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar whose bust was vandalised in Kolkata?

Bengal is alive. But not in the manner one would like to see it. Six phases of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections are over and every phase has witnessed violence. Not that this is the first violence-marred election in West Bengal, but the violence this election season has hogged national headlines.

The latest in the streak of poll-related violence in West Bengal was on Tuesday when Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president Amit Shah's rally was disrupted as BJP and Trinamool Congress workers clashed with each other.

Besides humans, the victim in Tuesday's violence was a bust of Bengal's icon Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar.

Vidyasagar is known for his contribution to philosophy, education and reforming Bengal society. He was a renowned educationist of his time and a social reformer who made significant contributions to the Bengal Renaissance.

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar was born on September 26, 1820. Among his major contribution was his efforts to end the practice under which widows were abandoned. He was successful in persuading the British to pass the Widow Remarriage Act.

Born as Ishwar Chandra Bandyopadhyay he was bestowed with the title of 'Vidyasagar' (in literal terms n ocean of knowledge) for his mastery over Sanskrit and philosophy.

He wrote nearly 10 books on Bengal's history and literature.

Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar died at the age of 71 on July 29, 1891.
