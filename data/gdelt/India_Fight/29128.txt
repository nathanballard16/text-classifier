A 45-year-old alleged gangster was arrested from Delhi's RK Puram area for allegedly killing a member of his rival gang, police said on Saturday.

The accused has been identified as Ravinder Badwasni, a resident of Sonipat in Haryana. He was carrying a reward of Rs 50,000 on information leading to his arrest declared by Haryana Police, they said.

"He was arrested from RK Puram area on Thursday after police got a tip-off," Pramod Singh Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) said.
