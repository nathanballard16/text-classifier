Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif starrer Bharat has been the talk of the town ever since it went on the floors. Helmed by Ali Abbas Zafar, Bharat has been generating a lot of buzz on social media since people associated with the film have gone to great lengths to conceal Salman’s look from the film for quite a long time. The teaser surely left Salman’s fans wanting for more and with the buzz coming in about the trailer, the excitement for everyone is through the roof.

Today, Salman’s film's co-producer, Atul Agnihotri shared a candid shot of Salman Khan which was taken while they were shooting in Malta. In the photo, we can see Salman dressed in an off-white kurta pajama. Along with that, he can be seen sporting black eye-wear. Salman can be seen standing near a river and is gazing at the sunset. While the Bajrangi Bhaijaan actor looked handsome, it was the breathtaking view which added a spark to the still.

Atul captioned the picture as, “#Bharat #candid #onlocation #memories #Malta @BeingSalmanKhan @Bharat_TheFilm.” Bharat stars Katrina Kaif, Disha Patani, Jackie Shroff, Tabu, Sunil Grover and Nora Fatehi.
