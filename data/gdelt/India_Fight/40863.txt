Maharashtra 'Dahi-Handi' Fest Low Key Due To Floods; 119 Injured

Gorakhnath Mahila Dahi Handi Pathak Mandal, an organisation of women Govindas, celebrated the festival to "keep our tradition" alive. "We celebrated the dahi-handi festival, but not with the usual fervour. We celebrate it just to keep our tradition on. We cannot forget the hardships our brothers and sisters are facing in parts of state due to floods," Bhau Koregaonkar, the founder of the mandal, said.

At least 119 Govindas were injured in Mumbai and 14 in neighbouring Thane on Saturday during dahi-handi celebrations, officials said, even as the events to mark the birth of Lord Krishna remained low key in several areas. Most of the Govindas were injured as their human pyramids, to break the 'dahi-handi' or curd pitcher, fell, a BMC official said. The celebrations remained low key in many areas. Several dahi-handi organisers expressed solidarity with the people affected by devastating floods in the state and some mandals decided to donate money for relief work. A civic official said 26 revellers were admitted to civic-run hospitals across Mumbai while the rest were discharged after primary treatment. In Thane, a 10-year-old boy's leg was fractured after he fell from the second rung of a pyramid and was undergoing treatment at a nearby hospital, a civic official said. In another incident in Thane, a teenage girl, enjoying the celebrations, was injured after a pyramid collapsed and people fell on her, the official added. The dahi-handi ritual is part of the Janmashtami festival in Maharashtra, where youngsters (called Govindas), dressed in colourful attire, make human pyramids to reach an earthen pot containing buttermilk suspended in mid-air, and break it.
