I-T Dept rubbishes reports of raids at residence, temple of Deve Gowda's family priest

New Delhi [India], Apr 12 (ANI): The Income Tax (IT) department on Friday clarified that the media reports on raids having been conducted at places linked to the family priest of a 'prominent political leader' in Karnataka and Goa were “false”.

“No such search or checking of any sort has been done by the Income Tax department in Karnataka,” IT Public Relation Officer (PRO) said in a press release.

The statement comes after various media portals on April 12 reported that the IT officials raided an ancient Shiva temple at former Prime Minister HD Deve Gowda's native village Haradanahalli in Hassan district. Reports also mentioned that the residence of the family priest.

“It is unfortunate that media persons connected to reputed media houses are spreading such unfounded stories without any attempt at verification,” the statement read. (ANI)
