NEW DELHI, Jan. 1 (Xinhua) -- At least eight members of a family including women and children were killed Tuesday after a speeding truck rammed into a roadside hut in northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, police said.

The accident took place in Ilia village of Chandauli district, about 368 km southeast of Lucknow, the capital city of Uttar Pradesh.

"Early today in a tragic accident here a truck rammed into the roadside hut and killed eight members of a family," a police official posted in Chandauli said. "Six people were killed on spot, while as two others succumbed to their injuries in hospital."

The victims inside the hut were asleep when the cattle-carrying truck rammed into it and crushed them, officials said.

Following the accident, police teams rushed to the spot and took bodies for post-mortem.

The deaths have enraged locals, who demand stern action against the erring driver.

Authorities have deployed police contingents in the area to maintain law and order.

Police said the driver seems to have lost control over his vehicle and rammed into roadside hutment area.

"A case has been registered in this regard and investigations ordered into it," the police official said.

Deadly road accidents are common in India often caused due to overloading, bad condition of roads and reckless driving.
