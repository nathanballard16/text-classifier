Mumbai: The Food and Drug Administration on Monday raided the premises of Nykaa E. Retail Pvt. Ltd. in Thane and confiscated boxes full of “branded” kajal, lipstick, lip balm, eyeliner and other cosmetics worth Rs 88 lakhs.

The Food and Drug Administration took action against the manufacturer of cosmetics for manufacturing and selling the products without a licence and in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

According to the senior FDA officer who executed the raid, “The FDA seized products during the special raid conducted on the basis of confidential information and confiscated the stock of cosmetics.”

He said that these products were manufactured by Bellezza Italia, Virar (E), Thane and marketed by NELF Cosmetics Pvt. Ltd. without a valid licence, thereby violating section 18C of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940.

The product samples were sent to the laboratory to ascertain their quality. The products sold across the country through a website, added FDA officials.

Food and Drug Administration commissioner Dr Pallavi Darade said that a case will be filed against the manufacturer for violations.

“A license is a must for manufacturing and marketing cosmetic products in India. The products sold had no licence number. The cosmetics are required to be safe for consumer use and should be in accordance with the labelling. The licence is very important as it is given only after the products are tested to ensure the safety of a cosmetic product,” she said.
