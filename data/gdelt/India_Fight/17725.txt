Supreme Court upholds life term for Saravana owner

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Friday upheld the conviction and life sentence awarded to P Rajagopal , owner of popular south Indian restaurant chain Saravana Bhavan , for murdering one of his employees 18 years ago to take the widow as his third wife.A bench of Justices NV Ramana, Mohan M Shantanagoudar and Indira Banerjee took note of the circumstantial and forensic evidence, including DNA reports, to conclude that Rajagopal, with the help of four others, had meticulously planned and executed the kidnapping and murder of Shathakumar in 2001 to enable him to fulfil his desire of marrying Shantakumar's wife."Having regard to entire material on record and totality of facts and circumstances, we find that the evidence fully proves the prosecution case and that the trial court as well as the high court evaluated the material on record in its proper prospective while coming to their conclusion. Thus, the judgment of the trial court as modified by the HC need not be interfered with," the bench said and dismissed the appeal against the Madras HC's decision to award life sentence to Rajagopal and his associates in crime.The SC gave details of Rajagopal's obsession with taking the married woman as his third wife. "Rajagopal is the proprietor of a chain of hotels (Saravana Bhavan). Either upon the advice of an astrologer or having become besotted with the woman, he had evinced a keen desire to take her as his third wife, though she was already married to Santhakumar (the deceased)."In order to fulfil his desire, Rajagopal used to financially help the woman, her family members and her husband. He used to talk to her over the phone frequently, and also gave her costly gifts such as jewellery and silk sarees and even went to the extent of paying her medical bills. In a further bid to gain her love and affection, he frequently interfered in her personal matters," the court said before detailing the manner in which Rajagopal got Santhakumar murdered to fulfil his desire.Writing the judgment for the bench, Justice Shantanagoudar said though the prosecution case hinged mainly on circumstantial evidence and the theory of the deceased last seen with the accused, it was well established that "if the alleged circumstances are conclusively proved before the court by leading cogent and reliable evidence, the court need not look any further before affirming the guilt of the accused. Moreover, human agency may be faulty in expressing the picturisation of the actual incident but circumstances cannot fail or be ignored. As aptly put in this oft-quoted phrase, 'men may lie, but circumstances do not'".Rejecting the defence argument that the superimposition test carried out by police to identify Shantakumar's body was unreliable, the bench said, "We would like to note that the use of the superimposition technique in Indian investigations for identification purposes is not a new phenomenon. Notably, it has been employed in the investigations pertaining to the Nithari murders , the Russian murder incident in Goa in 2008 and even before that in the Morni Hill murder case and the Paharganj bomb blast case as far back as in 1996, and the Udhampur murder case in 2005."
