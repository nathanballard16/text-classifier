Staying Alert At Pakistan Border: IAF To Deploy Chinook Choppers Amid Heightened Tensions Between Two Countries

The Indian Air Force (IAF) is set to induct the Chinook heavy-lift transport helicopters into its fleet on Monday (25 March), reports Asian Age. The Boeing-made helicopter is reportedly capable of transporting artillery guns to high altitudes and troops for action.

According to the report, Air Chief Marshal BS Dhanoa will induct the first unit of four CH-47F Chinook helicopters in Chandigarh where these choppers have been deployed.

The Chinook helicopter is an advanced multi-mission helicopter that will provide IAF with strategic airlift capability across the full spectrum of combat and humanitarian missions. It can deliver payloads to high altitudes and is reportedly suited for operations in higher Himalayas.

As per the report, the Chinook helicopter is capable of handling useful loads up to 10,886 kg and a maximum gross weight of up to 22,668 kg. It can reach up to a speed of 315 kmph.

The heavy-lift helicopter is being inducted amid the tensions between India and Pakistan in the aftermath of IAF air strikes on Jaish-e-Mohammed’s Balakot training camp following the dastardly terror attack in Pulwama of Jammu and Kashmir, in which over 40 Central Reserve Force Personnel (CRPF) were martyred.
