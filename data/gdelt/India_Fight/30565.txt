The two militants killed in an encounter in Anantnag district on Tuesday were identified as Sajjad Khan and Tauseef, affiliated with the Jaish-e-Mohammad, the Army said in a statement. Both are accused of carrying out a terrorist attack on CRPF personnel on February 14 this year in Pulwama. Sajjad had managed the vehicle which rammed into a CRPF convoy, while Tauseef was his handler, the Army said.

One army jawan was also killed in the encounter Tuesday, which broke out in the Bijbehara area after security forces launched a cordon and search operation based on inputs of the presence of militants. The search operation turned into an encounter after the militants fired upon the forces, who retaliated.

The incident comes less than 24 hours after an Army Major and a militant were killed, while another officer and two troopers were injured in an encounter between security forces and the ultras in Anantnag district. An unidentified militant was also killed in the gunfight and his body was recovered.

In a separate incident Monday, an attack took place when a patrol unit of the 44 Rashtriya Rifles was moving towards Arihal village in Pulwama. Two army jawans who were taken to the hospital with severe contusions on Monday have succumbed to their injuries. Four other army jawans and two civilians were injured in the blast.

“Two soldiers, brought to the hospital with severe contusions / concussions, have succumbed to their injuries while undergoing treatment in 92 Base Hospital. We deeply mourn the demise of our bravehearts.”, said Col Rajesh Kalia, Defence spokesperson.
