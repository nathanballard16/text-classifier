AMU VC appeals for peace, justifies police entry into campus

AGRA: Three days after violence hit Aligarh Muslim University (AMU), it’s vice chancellor, Tariq Mansoor , has appealed to the students, their parents, the teachers and the Aligarh community to maintain peace, not to fall prey to smear campaigns and false propaganda, besides justifying the decision of allowing the police to enter the campus on Sunday night.In a letter, the VC said, "we have been informed of allegations of police excesses, including damage to vehicles. We will take all appropriate steps to ensure that these allegations are fully inquired by the competent authorities". He assured that no innocent student is harassed or wrongfully acted against.Justifying the decision of calling the police inside the campus, the VC said that it was a timely and necessary step to prevent loss of lives. "Out of 26 arrested persons, only seven were university students and it has been proved that anti-social and outside elements intermingled with the students and were hell bent on damaging the university property and jeopardising the life and career of the bonafide students," he said, adding that he ensured that no anti-social elements will be allowed to disturb the campus peace and jeopardise the career of students.Recalling the December 15th night, he said, taking advantage of the sensitive situation after wide circulation of fake news on social media of death of two students of Jamia Millia Islamia in police firing, anti-social elements including expelled students intermingled with students, forcibly broke the Bab-e-Syed gate of the university. They resorted to stone pelting on the police after crossing the boundary of the varsity .The mob posed imminent danger to the lives of students and university’s property and the administration was left with no other choice but to call the police to control the situation. He said, "on several occasions in the past, lack of timely pre-emptive action has led to death to innocent students and severe damage to the university property including burning down of official residence of Vice Chancellor, registrar, Proctor’s office and staff club".Addressing the students, the VC, said that the recent unfortunate incident prompted advancing winter vacations and closure of the university, but he hoped that activities would begin from Jan 6.
