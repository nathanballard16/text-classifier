Surat: Gujarat GST raids firms making false ITC refund claim on clean energy

The firms allegedly generate power for personal use through windmills and then fraudulently claim input tax credit.

SURAT: The Surat unit of the State Goods and Service Tax (SGST) department raided offices of the companies that generate power for personal use through windmills and then fraudulently claim input tax credit (ITC).

SGST officials raided premises of about 20 companies located in Surat and surrounding areas after they had claimed ITC on the 18% GST rate for generating power through windmills. These companies have set up wind turbine power projects in Kutch.

Sources said that these companies had applied for ITC refund on power consumption through clean source of energy. However, the companies were not eligible for refund as they were utilising power for their own consumption by supplying the electricity generated in their windmills to the electricity companies.

A senior GST officer said, “We came to know about the fraud after we came across a few ITC refund applications from a few companies generating power through windmills. After detailed investigation, it was found that the companies were using the power for their own personal use. Despite this, they were claiming refund from the government exchequer.”

He further added that they have seized documents from 20 companies related to power generation through windmills and that further investigations are on.
