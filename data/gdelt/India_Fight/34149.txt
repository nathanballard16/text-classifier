Chennai: A man was admitted to hospital after being attacked Tamil Nadu’s Nagapattinam for posting a picture of him consuming beef soup. Enraged by Faizan’s social media post, members of a fringe group Hindu Makkal Katchi entered his home and attacked him.

A native of the Boravacheri village in the Nagapattinam district, Mohammed Faizan, uploaded an image of himself consuming the soup on Facebook on July 9.

Enraged by the post, some members of the Hindu Makkal Katchi got together and entered his house and beat him mercilessly.

The victim’s relatives have demanded an action against the perpetrators of the attack on Faizan.

The police reportedly arrested Dinesh Kumar, Ganesh Kumar, Mohan Kumar and Agasthian and filed a case of an attempt to murder against them.

Such attacks have often been reported in Northern states. However, very few of such cases have been reported from southern states and rarely from Tamil Nadu.
