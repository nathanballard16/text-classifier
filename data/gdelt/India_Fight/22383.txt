Rahul calls Nyay scheme a 'surgical strike on poverty'

SAMASTIPUR: Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Friday called Nyay scheme a surgical strike on poverty and allayed fears that the salaried middle class would have to foot the bill which he said would be entirely funded with the money that "thieves like Anil Ambani have plundered with Narendra Modi's help".Launching a fresh attack on the NDA government at the Centre, Gandhi coined a slogan 'Kuchh nahin sab jhootha hai Narendra Modi ne loota hai', (all promises are proven false. Narendra Modi has robbed people of whatever they had).Addressing a rally in this north Bihar town where he shared the stage, for the first time after general elections were announced, with RJD heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav , Gandhi also deplored the insulting treatment meted out to Lalu Prasad and warned the BJP-led coalition of a backlash in the polls.The Nyay scheme will be entirely funded with the money that thieves like Anil Ambani have plundered with Narendra Modi's help, Gandhi said allaying fears of the salaried middle class.The Congress chief also mocked the Prime Minister for turning military operations carried out after terror attacks in Uri and Pulwama into a poll plank."He carries a teleprompter wherever he goes to deliver his speeches. He keeps getting orders from above such as 'don't talk about rozgar (employment). Do not mention the Rs 15 lakh you had promised to remit into accounts of every poor Indian. You may be booed. Keep harping on surgical strikes,'" he said in a swipe at the PM.Reiterating that if voted to power, the Congress would ensure that no farmer was sent to jail for defaulting on loans, Gandhi said you (Modi) are welcome to help people like Nirav Modi and Vijay Mallya flee the country after defaults, but we stand for the common people, farmers and the working class. And we would share their burden.
