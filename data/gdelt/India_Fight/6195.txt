Pulwama Attack: US asks Pakistan to “Immediately End Support To Terror Groups”

WASHINGTON: The White House strongly condemned the Pulwama terrorist attack and asked Pakistan to immediately end support and safe haven to all terror groups.

In the deadliest terror attack on security forces in Kashmir, around 40 CRPF personnel were killed on Thursday when their convoy was targeted in Pulwama district on the Srinagar-Jammu National Highway. Pakistan-based Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) has claimed responsibility for the attack.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in a late night statement on Thursday stated that “The United States calls on Pakistan to end immediately the support and safe haven provided to all terrorist groups operating on its soil, whose only goal is to sow chaos, violence, and terror in the region.”

In a strongly-worded statement issued by the White House, she added that “This attack only strengthens our resolve to bolster counter-terrorism cooperation and coordination between the United States and India.”

The convoy comprised 78 buses in which around 2500 personnel were travelling from Jammu to Srinagar. A bus, in which 42 CRPF personnel were travelling, was extensively damaged in the blast which was followed by firing on the vehicle.
