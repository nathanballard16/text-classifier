SRINAGAR, Indian-controlled Kashmir, March 21 (Xinhua) -- An Indian army trooper was killed Thursday in an exchange of heavy fire with Pakistan army on the Line of Control (LoC), dividing Kashmir, officials said.

The two sides targeted each other's positions in frontier Rajouri district, about 222 km southwest of Srinagar city, the summer capital of Indian-controlled Kashmir.

"Pakistani forces this morning resorted to unprovoked firing of small arms and shelling of mortars in Sunderbani sector," an Indian army official said. "Our side effectively retaliated to the firing and in the exchange we lost on trooper."

For the past over two weeks, there has been a flare up on the LoC in Kashmir. Both Indian as well as Pakistan controlled parts have suffered civilian and troop casualties during the skirmishes.

The daily firings have forced population on both sides of the divide to migrate to safer locations.

The latest tension between New Delhi and Islamabad grew after India carried out an air strike inside Pakistan, triggering a retaliation. Though the situation has de-escalated to some extent following calls of restraint from several countries, the situation on the LoC is yet to show desired results.
