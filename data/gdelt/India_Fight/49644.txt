MC seizes 100kg plastic bag, issues 8 challans

Ludhiana: The civic officials seized 100kg banned plastic carry bags from various areas falling under zone-C on Wednesday and also issued eight challans to defaulters. The officials claimed that shopkeepers had kept the plastic carry bags for giving it away to customers during the festival season. The plastic carry bags will be crushed at Tajpur Road garbage dump using a crusher machine.

Divulging information, sanitary inspector of zone-C, Jagjit Singh, said, “Due to festival season, we have increased raids and plastic carry bags are even being found from shopkeepers who had stopped storing the same.” He added that on Wednesday, they seized 50kg plastic carry bags from a dairy near the police station at Daba Road alone. He said the remaining was seized from vegetable market near a marriage palace. He claimed that they have imposed fine on the defaulters as well.

Notably, even after carrying out campaign against the banned plastic carry bags, civic officials failed to impose complete ban on the usage as plastic carry bags. The civic officials, however, blamed the Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) officials for their failure in keeping a check on manufacturers who are making the plastic carry bags.
