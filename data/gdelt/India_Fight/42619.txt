On Pak orders, jihadis storm trader's home, injure 2-year-old

SRINAGAR: Four persons, including a 30-month-old girl, were injured when two terrorists barged into the house of a fruit trader in Dangerpora area of Sopore in north Kashmir's Baramulla district and opened indiscriminate fire on Saturday morning.Baby Asma Jan, who was critically injured in the firing, was flown to AIIMS in New Delhi for specialised treatment on the instructions of national security adviser Ajit Doval , police said. The other three injured have been identified as Mohammad Ashraf, Mohammad Ramzan and Arshid Hussain.Talking to reporters in Delhi, Doval said electronic intercepts showed that terrorists were angry with Hamudullah Rather, an officebearer of Sopore Fruit Traders's Association, because he had defied their diktats to suspend business. "Security forces have intercepted conversations where a Pakistan-based caller admonished terrorists for failing to stop the movement of apples from J&K to rest of the country," said the NSA."We should send you bangles instead of guns if you cannot stop movement of apples," Doval said quoting from the intercepts of the conversation between terrorists and their Pakistan-based handlers. He said that the two terrorists who carried out the attack were speaking in "Punjabi Urdu".The J&K administration has been persuading the association to restart normal trading activities. Just a day before, over 750 apple-laden trucks had moved from the mandi.Terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba Jaish-e-Muhammed and Hizbul Mujahedeen have been threatening shopkeepers and traders to not open their establishments. They have been issuing these diktats by putting up posters, police sources said.On August 29, three motorbike-borne terrorists killed 65-year-old Ghulam Mohammad for keeping his grocery shop open at Parimpora on Srinagar 's outskirts. Though Ghulam and his wife, who was present when the assailants opened fire, pleaded for "pardon", the terrorists killed him, sources said.A few days after Ghulam's killing, terrorists threatened the owner of a well-known departmental store in Srinagar that they would kill his son if he dared to open his store again.
