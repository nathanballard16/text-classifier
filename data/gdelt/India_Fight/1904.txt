Kanakadurga, woman who entered Sabarimala temple, attacked by mother-in-law

One of two women who entered Kerala's Sabarimala temple before daybreak on January 2 has allegedly been attacked by her mother-in-law.

The woman, Kanakadurga, returned to her home in Perinthalmanna early on Tuesday morning. Sources close to her family said she and her mother-in-law fought over the fact that she'd entered the temple, whose deity, Lord Ayyappa, is considered by devotees to be eternally celibate.

Kanakadurga's mother-in-law allegedly hit her on the head, but she was not seriously injured.

She was taken to the Perinthalmanna taluk hospital, and is in stable condition.

Until the Supreme Court struck down the Sabarimala temple's entry ban on women aged between 10 and 50 last year, Kanakadurga would have been unable to visit.

And for months after the top court ruled against the ban, protests prevented women of most ages from travelling to the Sabarimala temple.

But Kanakadurga and Bindu went to the shrine this month. Their visit sparked protests in Kerala.

Both women spoke to India Today TV on the day of their visit to the temple. "We followed our legal right as women," Kanakadurga said.

A QUICK RECAP: The mother-in-law of Kanakadurga, one of two women who entered the Sabarimala temple in the first week of 2019, allegedly attacked her. But she was not seriously injured. The Supreme Court struck down the Lord Ayyappa shrine's entry ban on women aged between 10 and 50 last year.
