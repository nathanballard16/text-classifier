Trial Begins For 3 Suspected Accomplices In Fatal Officer Shooting

KAILUA-KONA, Hawaii — A Hawaii court has started a trial for three suspected accomplices prosecutors say helped a man evade authorities after fatally shooting a police officer.

West Hawaii Today reported Friday that defendants Krystle Ferreira, Jorge Pagan-Torres and Malia Lajala face multiple charges including hindering prosecution, attempted murder and place to keep pistol or revolver.

Authorities say 33-year-old Justin Waiki shot Hawaii Police officer Bronson Kaliloa on the side of U.S. Highway 11 in Puna during a July 2018 traffic stop.

Authorities say Waiki was killed in an exchange of bullets after police tracked him down three days later.

Defense attorneys say Ferreira and Pagan-Torres unknowingly got involved and Lajala was not trying to help Waiki.

Officials say the trial is expected to last five weeks following two weeks of jury selection.
