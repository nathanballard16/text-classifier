Ramesh Jarkiholi in line for Karnataka deputy CM?

Bengaluru: The Yediyurappa government may induct 13 more ministers in its next round of Cabinet expansion and reward disqualified MLA Ramesh Jarkiholi with the post of deputy chief minister if the Supreme Court verdict goes in his favour, sources said.

Some of the other disqualified MLAs, who also helped topple the last coalition government, could be inducted as well depending on which way their legal battle goes.

But the party may not fill all 33 seats in the cabinet, but could keep at least three seats vacant for political reasons, sources reveal.

“Right now, we have 17 Cabinet ministers and we could induct 13 more. Among the 13, at least five or six will be given to MLAs based on caste and regional calculations. One of them could be G.H. Thippa Reddy. Likewise, the party will weigh the pros and cons and select more legislators,” insiders said.

But this plan may change as a lot depends on the legal battle of the disqualified MLAs. If the court dismisses the former Speaker's ruling and their resignations are accepted, a few of them may be asked to join the cabinet.
