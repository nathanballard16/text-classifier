NGT directs SDMC to stop blood discharge of slaughtered pigs in drains

The National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Tuesday directed the South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC) to take steps towards ensuring that discharge of blood resulting from slaughter of pigs, is stopped.

The directions came following a plea which alleged that the discharge of blood in drains due to pig slaughter was causing water pollution.

A Bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel directed SDMC Commissioner to appear before the Tribunal and furnish an action taken report within two months. “Let the SDMC and the Delhi Pollution Control Committee (DPCC) look into the matter, take appropriate action in accordance with law and furnish a joint factual and action taken report in the matter within two months,” the Bench directed.

The directions came after the green panel took note of a report which said that there are no slaughter houses in the city for pigs and around 800-1,000 pigs are slaughtered daily in various residential areas in the Capital. “It is thus acknowledged that blood of the slaughtered pigs is being discharged in the sewer lines or drains causing water pollution... this situation has to be remedied,” the Bench stated.
