The Indian Air Force (IAF) successfully fired the BrahMos air version missile from its frontline Su-30 MKI fighter aircraft.

The launch from the aircraft was smooth and the missile followed the desired trajectory before directly hitting the land target, the IAF said.

The target was a remote island in the Bay of Bengal, sources said, adding that it adds a new capability. The BrahMos can be launched at land targets when launched from ground and also from sea. The launch from air is the third dimension.

The air launched BrahMos missile is a 2.5-ton supersonic air-to-surface cruise missile with ranges of close to 300 km, designed and developed by BrahMos.

Earlier in November 2017, the IAF became the first air force in the world to have successfully fired an air-launched 2.8 Mach speed surface attack missile of this category on a sea target.

Today’s was the second such live launch of the weapon. The integration of the weapon on the aircraft was a very complex process involving mechanical, electrical and software modifications on aircraft. The IAF has been involved in the activity from its inception. The software development of the aircraft was undertaken by the IAF engineers while HAL carried out mechanical and electrical modifications on the aircraft.

The dedicated and synergetic efforts of the IAF, DRDO, and Hindustan Aeronautics Limited have proven the capability of the nation to undertake such complex integrations, the IAF said.

The BrahMos missile provides Indian Air Force a much desired capability to strike from large stand-off ranges on any target at sea or on land with pinpoint accuracy by day or night and in all weather conditions.

The capability of the missile coupled with the superlative performance of the Su-30MKI aircraft gives the IAF the desired strategic reach, the IAF said.
