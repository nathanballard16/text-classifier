Don't touch Tagore, Nazrul and Vidyasagar or we will cross danger level: Mamata to BJP at 'Martyrs Day' Rally

Eyeing 2021 assembly elections, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will address Trinamool Congress's 'Martyrs Day' rally in Dharamtala later today.

This is the first major gathering of the TMC following the less-than-expected performance of the party in the Lok Sabha elections.

TMC observes July 21 as Martyrs' Day every year in remembrance of those who died in 1993 police firing, in Kolkata. This year's rally gains significance as it would be the first mega show by TMC after its poll debacle in Lok Sabha elections.

Live updates of Mamata's speech:

* 26-27th July we will observe 'Return Black Money' program

* 28th August we will celebrate TMCP’s Foundation day, we will observe it on Mayo Road.

* 15th August we will celebrate Rakhi among the Hindus and Muslims from block to block

* 9th August we will observe 'BJP Bangla choro Andolan'

* Referring to Bengali actress Anjana Devi’s joining into BJP, she says she has joined the party thrice. They should be ashamed of themselves

* From 23rd onwards we are going to start our public outreach program. We will reach out to the booth level. We are going to turn around the situation for TMC.

* Do not touch Bengal, Rabindranath Tagore, Nazrul and Vidyasagar, else we will cross dangerous levels.

* They vandalised the statue of Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar

* Call dropping these days. It is a scandal. You have to call thrice a single person and they are minting money.

* A nation like US, UK conduct elections in ballot. We demand the ballot to be returned and do away with the EVMs.

* They are imposing their gods on us

* Federal structure is being bulldozed.

* ED, CBI are now summoning our leaders and telling them to contact BJP

* We are not being told, bills are being passed in a jiffy (in Parliament). We have no idea of these bills.

* I know people are angry with TMC because this is farmers, poor man’s party.

* Goondaism will not be entered. We will not let you divide people based on Hindu and Islam religion. We sent our delegation to UP and Assam during NRC still they were not allowed to enter.

* Some leaders we have never heard of we saw them contesting MLA elections. Some RSS goondas and some people are running Ekal Schools in Jalpaiguri and other places.

* In Bihar, govt has ordered police to monitor these schools. Remember we have never asked them to do anything of that sort.

* First return 15 lacs Black Money then demand the Cut Money back

* We will start an agitation, demanding Black Money back

* BJP is going to areas and telling them to return the money. You are the biggest dacoit. Did Left return the money. TMC is a poor man’s party. They say Cut Money should be returned. I would say return Black Money. What is the source of income ? How did you spend so much during elections? How did you manage to get these flats in Delhi?

* In UP, you stopped Priyanka Gandhi and TMC delegation. In Bengal despite the 144 CrPC imposed in troubled zones, they forcibly enter there. See what happens when you vote for BJP. See what has happened in Bhatpara. Schools, shops all closed.

* I’m wondering what happened suddenly? Lok Sabha elections were held through cheating. But still they didn’t win majority of seats. They won 18 seats, we won 24 seats. If elections are held tomorrow, they will lose.

* After winning certain seats, they are trying to capture our party offices and attacking our party.

We are going to hold counter rallies in places where they have been attacked.



* In many places, BJP has stopped trains preventing our party men to arrive here.
