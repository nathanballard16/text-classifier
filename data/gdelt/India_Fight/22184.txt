New Delhi: A World Health Organisation (WHO) report has said that people who use mobiles phones while driving are four times more likely to be involved in accidents.

The World health body also said that these accidents become far worse if the drivers are texting from their phone as they often take their eyes off the roads while driving.

And not only the drivers, such negligent behaviour while driving also poses high risk to other road users, the WHO said.

The WHO reports also claims that there are no conclusive evidence that hands-free devices are safe than hand-held phones. It says the distraction while driving increases the risk of road mishap many times.

According to a report in Times of India, Multiple studies have suggested that drivers take their eyes of the road for at least 4.6 seconds out of every 6 seconds while they are texting on phone.

According to a report, at least 1.47 lakh people died in India in road accidents in 2017, while over 4 lakh were injured.

In 2015 India had signed Brasilia Declaration and committed to reduce road death by half.

The WHO in its report further states that using cell phone can affect many driving tasks which sometimes lead to longer reaction time in case of any driving related emergencies including lane correction and slower braking.

Notably, the recent death of a Delhi child who was runover by his uncle who was using his phone while driving has called for more stringent laws to curb such negligent behaviour.

The first world countries have already identified the use of mobile phones while driving as the major cause of road accidents.

According to India’s Road Transport Ministry data, at least 2,138 people were killed in accidents in 2016 due to use of mobile phones.
