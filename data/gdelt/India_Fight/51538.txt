QBiz: FM Mulls Help for Telcos; CBI Files Case Against Amnesty

The Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) on Friday, 15 November said that salaries are not subject to the Goods and Services Tax and that no tax demand has been made on CEOs or employees.

It termed as factually incorrect and a misrepresentation the media reports that the authorities want to tax salaries of CEOs and employees.

ET in its edition dated 14 November reported that the tax department has started questioning companies and banks if they were passing on some of the common costs like salaries of CEOs to their branch offices. The department wants companies to proportionately distribute common costs from head office to branch office and treat this as supply. Once this is treated as supply, 10% of it has to be added to the cost and 18% GST would be levied on it, the report said.
