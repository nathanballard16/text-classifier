IT raids at Maharshi producer Dil Raju’s office in Hyderabad

Dil Raju, one of the producers of the soon-to-release Telugu action drama Maharshi, has landed in legal trouble. Income Tax raids were conducted at his office in Hyderabad earlier on Wednesday, a day ahead of Maharshi’s worldwide release.

According to a report in Indian Express, the IT officials conducted the raids based on the news of film’s astounding pre-release business. The makers of the Mahesh Babu, Allari Naresh and Pooja Hegde-starrer, reports claim, has made nearly Rs 150 crore by selling off the film’s theatrical and non-theatrical rights. It has been made on a staggering budget of Rs 140 crore-Rs 150 crore. However, the sudden IT raids have put a question mark on its timely release. While rumours are afloat that the film’s release will be affected, no statement has been issued by the makers in this regard.

IT department conducting raids at leading production houses and offices of film producers right ahead of the release of big-budget films has become a common practice in the Film Nagar circles, says the Indian Express report. It is not the first time when Dil Raju is under the scanner of IT officials. During the release of his production ventures such as Yevadu and Seethamma Vakitlo Sirimalle Chettu, too, his office was raided.

One of the leading producers in the Telugu film industry, Dil Raju was also associated with the recently-released Nani-starrer Jersey. The film is among the biggest box-office hits of 2019 so far.

Meanwhile, the tickets of Maharshi are being sold at Rs 200. It is Rs 50 higher than the usual ticket price in the state. A social drama, the film addresses the struggles faced by farmers. Mahesh Babu will be seen playing a business tycoon in the film who gives up on the luxuries of his life to serve farmers.
