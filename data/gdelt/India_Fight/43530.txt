Intelligence service should be independent: Patali - Breaking News

The intelligence service in the country should be made independent so that the intelligence officers could operate effectively irrespective of any factors pertaining to caste, race and religion, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.

He expressed these views at the Batticaloa National Path Convention held in the Batticaloa Town Hall.

“Despite the fact that majority of those connected to terrorism have been either dead or arrested, the intelligence service should be made independent if such terrorist activities are to completely eradicate from the society,” the minister said.

“The Easter Sunday terrorist attack left people with palpitations. However, the government, political parties, religious leaders and especially the Muslim community have a responsibility to prevent such situations from happening in the country,” the minister stressed.

He said the terrorist organisation, which launched the Easter Sunday attack should not be compared with either the LTTE or JVP.

“We should reorganise the intelligence service and strengthen the military personnel with the latest technology if we are to deal with such terrorist organisations. We should also be mindful of the fact that such terrorist organisations maintain links with foreign regions like South India,” he said.

“Our intelligence officers should also be protected from political influence, which weakens and cripples them in carrying out their service effectively,” he added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
