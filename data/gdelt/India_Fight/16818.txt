Vaani Kapoor takes Kathak classes for Ranbir Kapoor starrer 'Shamshera'

Sanjay Dutt plays the merciless nemesis of Ranbir in the project.

Mumbai: After wrapping her Hrithik Roshan and Tiger Shroff starrer, Vaani Kapoor began shooting for Ranbir Kapoor starrer, Shamshera.

Vaani is known to be a great dancer but for this role, she is set to challenge her dancing skills and push her limits as an artist. She needs to be extremely proficient in several classical dancing styles to be able to pull off the intricate choreography that is being set for her. Vaani has been honing her dancing skills by learning Kathak for a few months now and she has been pulling in hours daily to perfect her dancing and body postures.

Vaani Kapoor says, “Since Shamshera is set in a particular time, the dance sequences require me to have a very Indian, very classical body language, which is why I started taking kathak classes to learn the nuances and the grace. Karan specifically wanted me to adapt to a more traditional Indian dance form and break from the western style to do justice to the choreography that is being set for me.”
