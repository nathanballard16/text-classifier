BJP councillor among three arrested for firing at professor’s house

RAJKOT: Three persons including a BJP councillor of Jamnagar Municipal Corporation (JMC) were arrested for allegedly opening fire at the house of Parshottam Rajani, a professor with Jamnagar Mahila College. Police said the arrested accused, identified as Iqbal Pathan and Dawoood Musani, had opened fire at Rajani’s house in Oswal Colony near Indian Airforce Station on Wednesday night.The police arrested Atul Bhanderi, the BJP councillor of ward number 16, as he was mentioned in the complaint as the key conspirator in the case. Pathan and Musani were nabbed from Ujala Circle in Ahmedabad with the help of Ahmedabad anti-terrorist squad on Sunday.Pathan and Musani, who were caught in the CCTV, had fled to Bhavnagar after the crime. “Pathan and Musani then changed their cellphones. We checked with the mobile phone shop from where they had purchased the phones and got new sim cards, and found their new numbers, which were traced to Ahmedabad,” said Sharad Singhal, Jamnagar superintendent of police.Singhal said they were three or four more accused in the case as they were seen seated in the car caught on the CCTV footage.In his complaint, Rajani has accused Jayesh Patel, the prime accused in the advocate Kirit Joshi murder case, of sending the assailants at his house. Rajani said as he had helped in the sale of five disputed plots which Patel had tried to usurp by forging bogus documents, Patel had decided to teach him a lesson.Ten days before the firing, Rajani was called for a meeting at the office of Bhagwanji Kanjharia, where Bhanderi was present. Bhanderi asked Rajani to either cancel the deals of the plots or cough up Rs 1 crore, and made him talk to Patel through WhatsApp calling.Thereafter, Patel gave several threat calls to Rajni, asking him to comply with him. However, when Rajani did not yield, Patel allegedly gave the supari to Pathan, instructing him not to kill Rajani but scare him by opening fire at his house.Rajani came to know about the firing when he saw the shattered rear wind screen of his car and found an empty case of a cartridge lying on the bonnet on Thursday morning.
