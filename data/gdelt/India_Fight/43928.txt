25-year-old woman raped by 2 men in Mumbai

A 25-year-old woman was gangraped by two men in Mumbai after they blackmailed her, police said on Tuesday. Police said the two accused-Amjad Ali Khan (30) and Noor Sheikh (42) have been arrested.

Police said the woman is a native of Satara. She has a daughter and had taken divorce from her husband last year.

The woman used to regularly travel to Mumbai to visit her sister. One of the accused, Amjad Ali Khan, was her sister's neighbour.

Police said the woman and Khan became friends after some visits and would talk to each other for long hours. Whenever she visited Mumbai, she would meet Khan and roam around, the cops claimed.

Taking advantage of this, Khan asked the woman to send her nude photos, which she agreed to. Once he had the photos, Khan allegedly started blackmailing her and demanded that she should meet him, else he would publish the photos online.

Scared with these threats, the woman visited Mumbai and met Khan in a taxi. Khan was accompanied by his friend and co-accused Noor Sheikh. Police say the duo took the woman to Trombay and took turns to rape her in a vacant room at the place where Khan used to work at.

They later dropped the woman alongside a road and fled away.

Following this, the woman informed her sister and the two went to Trombay police station to file an FIR. The next day both the accused were arrested.

Speaking to India Today TV, Senior Inspector Siddheshwar Gove of Trombay police station said, "The accused are charged for murder and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code. The accused currently are in judicial custody. The medical examination of the woman was conducted at the local government hospital."
