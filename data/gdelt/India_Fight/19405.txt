'Repetitions do not make truth of a lie': DG ISPR

RAWALPINDI: Responding to India's repeated claim of downing Pak F-16 aircraft, Director General of Inter-Services Public Relations (DG-ISPR) Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor has said, "repetitions don’t make truth of a lie," adding that India is yet to provide any concrete evidence.

DG ISPR has asked India not to ignore Pakistan’s silence over damages to them in February 27 battle. He reiterated the truth that Pakistan shot down two Indian aircraft and their wreckage on earth was also seen by all.

Earlier in the day, Indian Air Force (IAF) claimed that it was in possession of “irrefutable” evidence to prove that its vintage MiG-21 Bison shot down a Pakistan Air Force’s modern F-16 combat jet in the aerial engagement.



Rejecting the Indian claim, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) DG responded by saying, “Repetitions don’t make truth of a lie.”

Spokesperson of Pakistan armed forces late on Monday tweeted: "Despite claiming possession of evidence on shooting F16, IAF still short of presenting it. Don’t overlook Pakistan’s silence for not drum beating losses on Indian side. Fact is that PAF shot down two IAF jets, wreckage seen on ground by all."



Contradicting India's claim that one of its fighter jets shot down a Pakistani F-16 during an aerial dogfight on February 27, two senior US defense officials with direct knowledge of the situation have told the Foreign Policy magazine that American personnel recently counted Pakistan's F-16s and found none of the planes missing. It was reported on Thursday.



It is pertinent to not that Pakistan had shot 2 MiG-21 aircraft in the aerial skirmish and captured one of its pilot and later it released him in gesture of peace to cool one of the most serious military confrontations between the two nuclear countries.
