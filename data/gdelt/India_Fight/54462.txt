Injured hikers in Cradle Mountain, Tasmania will have to spend a second night in the cold

Injured hikers stuck on a mountain will have to endure another night in the freezing cold as rescuers are halted by bad weather.

Three walkers believed to be from India, aged 28, 37 and 45, were struck down with hypothermia in Kitchen Hut in Tasmania's Cradle Mountain on Friday.

A rescue helicopter was due to rescue them on Friday night but had to turn back due to winds of up to 100 kilometres per hour.

Poor weather conditions and heavy snow halted a second rescue mission on Saturday.

Ground rescue crews arrived at the hut at 9pm on Friday and provided medical assistance to the hikers overnight.

A rescue helicopter is waiting at Devonport Airport hoping to rescue the hikers on Sunday.

Temperatures are expected to reach as low as -7C on Saturday night.

The walkers are in a stable condition.
