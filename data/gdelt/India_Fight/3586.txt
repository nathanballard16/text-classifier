The wife of Prashant Natt, main accused in the December 3 murder of police Inspector Subodh Kumar Singh in Bulandshahr, has charged the police of planting the deceased police officer’s missing mobile phone in her home during a search operation on Republic Day.

Syana circle officer Raghvendra Kumar Mishra, during a court-ordered search at Chingrawathi village house of Prashant Natt on January 26, had claimed to have recovered six mobile phones, including Subodh’s closed user group (CUG) mobile phone.

Prashant Natt’s wife Sonam alleged the policemen had brought mobile phones with them and planted those in their house.

She told a news channel that her husband was being falsely implicated in the case. “Two policemen came with a search warrant. They asked for my husband’s room, entered it and placed the mobile phones on the dressing table. When I objected that the mobile phones were not ours, they asked me to keep quiet,” she alleged.

Bulandshahar SSP Prabhakar Chaudhary countered the allegations saying what else could be expected from the family of the accused. The search was carried out on court orders, he claimed.

According to the police, Natt, a taxi driver, allegedly shot Subodh Kumar Singh dead. Singh’s two mobile phones and a pistol were reported missing after his killing. The police are yet to recover the pistol.

The police had registered two cases in the matter – one against seven named persons for the alleged cow slaughter and another against 27 named and 60 unnamed persons for the murder of Subodh Kumar Singh and Sumit along with ransacking of the police post and damage to public property.

Interestingly, Natt had not been named in the FIR.
