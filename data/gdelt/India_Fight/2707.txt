Cyber expert's EVM hacking claim: Gopinath Munde's nephew seeks R&AW probe on his alleged 'murder'

He said those who loved Gopinath Munde had always raised questions over his death wondering "if it actually was an accident or sabotage". In another tweet in Marathi, Dhananjay Munde said, "Each of those who loved Munde Saheb had doubted that he died in the accident, but it was sabotage. "Hence, the startling claims made by cyber expert Syed Suja in a live press conference back the suspicion," he said. The cyber expert, identified as Syed Shuja who is seeking political asylum in the US, Monday claimed that the 2014 elections were "rigged" through the Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), which, he says, can be hacked. The Election Commission of India has denied the charge. Addressing a press conference in London via Skype, Shuja said he fled India in 2014 because he felt threatened in the country after the killing of some of his team members. The cyber expert also claimed that BJP leader Munde was "killed" because he was aware of EVM hacking in the elections. He provided no proof to back up his claim. Shuja also claimed that NIA officer Tanzil Ahmed, who was investigating Munde's death, was planning to file an FIR noting that the BJP leader had been murdered, but was also killed. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in October 2014 ruled out any foul play in the death of Gopinath Munde, claiming that the politician had died due to injuries sustained in a road accident.

As per the details revealed by the hacker, Union Minister Munde was murdered as he was aware that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) were hacked in 2014 General elections. Dhananjay Munde, who is the Leader of the Opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council, termed the claims made by the self-proclaimed US-based Indian cyber expert as "shocking".
