Special public prosecutor cites Mumbai terror attack mastermind’s example to oppose Mukerjea’s b ail application in court, calls him Sheena’s ‘silent killer’.Hyperboles had a field day in the Special CBI court on Thursday with the agency’s counsel drawing a parallel between the high-profilecase and the Mumbai terror attacks and invoking crossborder terrorist Hafiz Saeed’s example to oppose the bail application filed by former media baronPeter, who along with his wife Indrani, is an accused in his stepdaughter's murder was arrested in 2015. He had moved the court for bail in November last year. This is his fourth attempt.Opposing his bail plea, special public prosecutor Bharat Badami argued that the CBI has sufficient evidence to prove Peter Mukerjea’s role in the murder conspiracy and called him Sheena’s “silent killer” as he did not take any step to find her after she went missing, despite the fact that she was his son Rahul Mukerjea’s fiancé.“Peter was knowing everything... he was not a statue of the family. He took no step when Rahul was desperately asking about Sheena... Peter is the silent killer of Sheena,” the CBI lawyer told the court heatedly.Among the several grounds Peter cited for bail was the fact that he says was in London when Sheena was allegedly murdered by Indrani, their driver turned approver Shyamvar Rai and Indrani’s ex-husband, on April 24, 2012.While countering this argument, Badami, who has a knack for theatrics and often uses “Justice for Sheena” like a catchphrase during hearings, said that even Jamaat-ud-Dawah chief Hafiz Saeed remote-controlled thefrom Pakistan.So, even if Peter was in London at the time of the murder it doesn’t mean he was not part of the conspiracy, Badami argued, drawing a chuckle from Special Judge JC Jagdale.Badami had apparently confirmed Saeed’s full name with a journalist before the proceedings began.Peter, who did not emerge as an accused in the sensational murder until the CBI took over the investigations, has been accused of conspiring to kill Sheena as he was upset about her relationship with his son Rahul.Earlier Peter, represented by lawyers Shrikant Shivade and Amit Ghag, had argued that there is no evidence against him and that the conspiracy was hatched by Indrani and the others.Peter further told the court that that according to the CBI Rahul and Sheena got engaged in Dehradun in 2011 and he had no objection to it. In fact, it was Indrani who felt insecure as she was worried that Sheena would now get a stake in Peter’s property, he told the court.“Since the beginning, I was misled to believe that Sheena was Indrani’s sister,” his bail application states.Peter also said that the statement given by Rai, who was an accomplice but turned approver later, that Indrani spoke to Peter while they were on their way to finalise the location to dispose of Sheena’s body was only being used to implicate Peter. Rai had not mentioned Peter in his earlier statement given to the Khar police.Badami’s final argument for the day was that since Rahul is yet to be examined, Peter’s release could hamper his statement as he could influence his sin once out of jail. His arguments will continue on Monday.
