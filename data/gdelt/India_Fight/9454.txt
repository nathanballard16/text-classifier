Indian aircraft bomb its territory, Pakistan says

Pakistan’s military spokesman tweeted that Indian aircraft crossed into Pakistan and then "released payload in haste” but says there were casualties.

Major General Asif Ghafoor said the Indian "aircrafts” crossed early Tuesday into the Pakistan-controlled Muzafarabad sector of Kashmir. He said Pakistan scrambled fighter jets and before turning back, the Indian jets dropped their payloads near Balakot, on the edge of Pakistani-ruled Kashmir.

There has been no comment from India.

The incursion could have been in retaliation for a deadly February 14 suicide bombing in India’s half of Kashmir that killed at least 40 troops. The Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad claimed responsibility. The bomber who made a video before the attack was a resident of Indian Kashmir.
