Hyderabad: Two arrested in Nominath mutt murder case

Hyderabad Police have cracked the sensational murder case in which the victim was dragged outside a mutt in the city and hacked to death. Charminar police arrested two men who allegedly stabbed the victim more than 30 times.

42-year-old Ravi Peter was murdered by assailants on January 15. The man stayed alone in Nominath Baba Mutt within jurisdiction of Charminar Police Station. His murder was caught on cctv footage.

It has appeared that the murder took place over money matter. The police arrested S Rameshwar Gegde (19) and Bajrang Gegde (25) who are accused of murdering Ravi Peter.

Both of the accused did cleaning and decoration work at the mutt. Bajrang Gegde lent Rs 25,000 to Ravi Peter six months ago. The deceased told him that he needed money to arrange for an advocate to secure bail for one of his friends who was involved in a murder case.

However, Ravi Peter swindled the money and this led to dispute.

Both of the accused hatched a plan to eliminate Ravi Peter and bought knives from Nanded in Maharashtra. They assaulted Ravi Peter on the night of January 17. Ravi Peter succumbed on the spot.
