Srinagar jail brimming with detainees

ISLAMABAD: Srinagar’s Central Jail in Indian occupied Kashmir is brimming with thousands of young men who have been arrested and detained since August 5 — the day India repealed special status of Kashmir.

According to the Kashmir Media Service, family members of the detainees wade through endless check points before they reach Martyrs Park in Srinagar, which has become a makeshift waiting room. Family members wait in the park for their loved ones’ number to be called.

Showkat Ahmed along with his family travelled 68 kilometers from his village Damhal in the hope of meeting his brother Aamir Ahmed, a student who was arrested on August 21. According to the charge-sheet, Aamir has been charged with provoking other people to protest. But Showket says he’s sure that is not the case. “My brother is innocent. He is just a student.” A 22-year-old youth, Tajamul Islam, was also picked from his home on August 21. His father, mother and brother have to wait for hours in the hope of meeting him.

There is no official data to confirm the total number of people detained, arrested or released since August 5 but media reports suggest that more than 13,000 people have been detained so far. Many of the detainees are young men.

A policeman, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the media that young men were often targets of raids and arrests. Some of the detainees are lodged in Srinagar Central Jail and others have been taken to various jails across India.

Rounding up and detaining thousands of people is being used as a measure to avoid strikes and protests. The detainees booked under the draconian law, Public Safety Act, can be kept in detention for a maximum of two years without trial.
