Factory employee found murdered in SBS Nagar

Ludhiana: A 42-year-old man was found murdered on a roadside near City Centre in Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar early on Wednesday.

The police suspect Sunil Kumar, a resident of Sunet village, was strangulated as the body bears injury marks on neck.

Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-2) Jaskiranjit Singh said, “An ID card found on the body helped establish its identity. Sunil worked as a supervisor at a yarn factory in Focal Point. Besides injury marks on neck, there is one on his head too. It seems he was murdered somewhere else and his body dumped here, as his e-cycle is missing. If he was murdered here, then his e-cycle should have been near the spot.”

Every morning, Sunil would cycle to his employer’s house in Gurdev Nagar, from where he would take the latter’s bike to commute to the factory.

Around 8pm on Tuesday, Sunil took his cycle from his employer’s house. Around 8.15pm, he called up his wife, saying he will be home in half-an-hour. When he did not return, his wife called him up many a time, but found his number unreachable. Hours later, the police called her up, informing about the murder.

“A passerby informed us about the body around 12.30am. Sunil was not killed for robbery, as a cellphone and a wallet, besides an ID card, were found in his pocket. The murder seems to be the fallout of a personal rivalry, though we are probing the case from all angles,” the ADCP added.

Sunil, along with his wife and three children, lived in a joint family with his four brothers. A case has been registered under sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence) and 34 (act done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the IPC. The police are scrutinising the footage of CCTV cameras installed in the area and Sunil’s calls details.
