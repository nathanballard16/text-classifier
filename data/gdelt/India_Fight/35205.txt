Terrorists on Friday shot dead a personal security officer (PSO) of a PDP leader in Jammu and Kashmir's Anantnag district, police said.

The incident took place when Mufti Sajad, a PDP leader and a relative of former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti, had gone to a mosque in Bijbehara to offer congregational prayers, a police official said.

The mosque was around 50 metres from Sajad's residence, according to the police.

The terrorists killed the PDP leader's PSO Farooq Ahmad, who was standing outside the mosque, by opening fire on him from a close range, the official said, adding that Sajad is safe.

Police said according to eye witnesses, two terrorists tried to snatch the PSO's rifle.

The area has been cordoned off and a search launched to arrest the accused, the official said.

Further details are awaited.
