India offered all possible assistance to Sri Lanka following the multiple blasts that killed at least 160. The offer was made when Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Sri Lankan President Maithripala Srisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe to condole the blasts.

PM Modi pointed out that these cold-blooded and pre-planned “barbaric’’ acts were another grim reminder of the most serious challenge posed to the entire humanity by terrorism in our region and the entire world.

The PM renewed the offer of all possible help and assistance to Sri Lanka for ensuring its security against the challenges such as those posed by terrorism.

India has twice in the past stepped in to help restore stability in Sri Lanka. Indian troops first moved into Sri Lanka in the early 70s to quell a Buddhist-Marxist insurgency that sought to overthrow the legitimate Government. The second time, India troops were sent to Sri Lanka in the 80s to help Colombo strike a peace accord with Tamil militants.

Earlier, the Foreign Office extended its condolences to the families of the victims and wished a speedy recovery to those injured in the attacks.

It said India has always opposed and rejected terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, and has urged concerted action by the international community against terrorism, including cross-border terrorism. There can be no justification whatsoever for any act of terror.

“We call for perpetrators of such ghastly and heinous act and those who provide them support to be brought to justice expeditiously. We stand together with the people and Government of Sri Lanka in this hour of grief,’’ added the statement by the Ministry of External Affairs.
