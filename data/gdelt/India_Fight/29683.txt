KGF star Yash and his family get into a controversy; did the actor THREATEN his landlord's family member?

Kannada superstar Yash, who will soon kick start shooting of his next, KGF: Chapter 2, has hit the headlines over controversial reasons. Yash is currently in a happy phase but amidst everything, the actor is in the news for refusing to vacate the rented house in which his family resides at Bengaluru. According to reports, Yash and his mom did not vacate the house despite back to back reminders from the landlord. The owner of the house sought legal intervention to get the family to vacate the flat. Yash and his family were apparently not even ready to pay extra rent to the landlord.

According to reports, the KGF star Yash and his family was asked to shift from there in March; however, Yash’s mother Pushpa sought an extension until May 31. Finally, the family has vacated the flat, but Yash is yet to react on the same.

According to a report in Filmibeat, Yash apparently called the landlord's kin to a hotel and threatened him to issue a statement in favour of his family for damaging their reputation. However, there is yet no verification to these reports.

Yash is yet to react on the same. Meanwhile, Yash is gearing for his next, KGF: Chapter 2. Yash will be seen in a very different avatar in the film. Prashanth Neel, director of the magnum opus is leaving no stone unturned to bring the best of cinematic experience on the big screen.
