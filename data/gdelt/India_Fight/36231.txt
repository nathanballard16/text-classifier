We are not conspirators, say group of intellectuals

KOLKATA: Hours after eminent personalities across India sent a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi , condemning the July 23 letter of 49 intellectuals drawing the PM's attention to hate crimes and lynching, the group of intellectuals clarified that the letter was based on facts and cannot be construed as a conspiracy against the nation.In the July 26 letter 62 artists and intellectuals termed the group of 49 as "self-styled guardians and conscience keepers of the nation" attempting to foist a "false narrative". The letter claimed that "the selective outrage and amnesia of this particular group makes us believe that they are working to a certain agenda and are only playing into the hands of those forces who are out to Balkanise India and destabilise her."Reacting promptly to the criticism, the group of 49 on Friday afternoon issued a press statement saying that there is nothing in the letter (July 23) "that can even remotely be construed as a conspiracy against the nation." While they categorically maintained that they are not engaging in any "debate with anyone", the group said that they are not accountable to anyone "except the honourable Prime Minister himself".The Bengal BJP vice president Chandra Kumar Bose, who had earlier praised the letter of concern, on Friday tweeted that lynching tantamount to murder and strong punishment should be administered to the accused if proved guilty under the law. "Person involved in lynching is a criminal and must be taken to task irrespective of background," he wrote in the tweet.Thespian Kaushik Sen , a signatory to the July 23 letter, felt that there is no reason to react to a dissenting voice (July 26 letter). "We are not being dictated or motivated by any political party and anybody can speak against us. In fact, that is the democracy we are talking about," said Sen. "If anybody writes a letter against us we are okay with that. Those who are motivated have termed us conspirators," he added.
