Who is Priyanka Gandhi Vadra? Knowing ‘Indira of Today’ Priyanka Gandhi Through Her Speeches

“I am Rajiv Gandhi’s daughter,” was Priyanka Gandhi terse reply to purported comments by Narendra Modi – then Prime Ministerial candidate of BJP – that he considers her a daughter.

Priyanka, who was on the campaign trail in Amethi before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, was reacting to Modi’s interview to Doordarshan. Some portions of the interview, including Modi’s “daughter" comments on Priyanka, were reportedly not telecast.

Priyanka’s pride and love for her father has come to the fore time and again during her speeches. In 2014, Priyanka had hit out at Modi, saying he had insulted her “martyred" father Rajiv Gandhi during his speech in Amethi.

In another instance, after Priyanka had snubbed Smriti Irani with a “Who’s Smriti Irani?” when reporters had questioned her about a comment Irani had made, Modi came to her defence by mentioning Rajiv Gandhi. At the time, Irani was fighting against Rahul Gandhi in Amethi in 2014 the Lok Sabha elections. After the snub, Modi had accused Congress of practising politics of “arrogance” and brought in Rajiv Gandhi, saying that when he was Congress’ general secretary, Gandhi had publicly “abused" and “humiliated" the then Andhra Pradesh chief minister T Anjaiah at the airport.

In a stern response to the mention of her father, Priyanka had said, “They have insulted my martyred father on the soil of Amethi. People of Amethi will never forgive them for this act. Workers in Amethi will reply to their low-level politics. There will be a reply from each of the booths."
