Pakistani govt claims to have taken control of 2 seminaries linked to Jaish-e-Mohammad

Lahore (Pakistan), Feb 22 (ANI) Eight days after the Pulwama terror attack, Pakistan's Punjab government on Friday claimed to have taken control of a campus housing two seminaries linked to the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) outfit.

“The Government of Punjab has taken over the control of a campus comprising Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah in Bahawalpur,” the spokesman of the Ministry of Interior tweeted.

Madressatul Sabir and Jama-e-Masjid Subhanallah are said to be associated with JeM, the terror outfit which was responsible for the ghastly attack in Pulwama in which 40 CRPF personnel were killed on February 14.

JeM chief Masood Azhar, who has masterminded several terror attacks in India, is also based in Bahawalpur.

The Interior Ministry spokesman added that the action was taken “in line with the decision of the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting held yesterday under the Chairmanship of Prime Minister Imran Khan.”

Khan, at the NSC meeting yesterday, had ordered security agencies to “accelerate action” against extremist and terror groups operating in the country.

The government has appointed an administrator to manage its affairs, the ‘Samaa’ TV reported quoting the spokesperson.

The NSC yesterday also decided to ban Jamat-ud Dawa (JuD) and Falah-e-Insaniat Foundation (FIF), which are the front organisations of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist outfit which had masterminded the 2008 Mumbai attacks.

These groups are headed by Hafiz Saeed, a proscribed terrorist. (ANI)
