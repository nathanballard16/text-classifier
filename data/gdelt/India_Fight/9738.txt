Mirage-2000: Air Force's Go-To Fighter For Tough Jobs - 10 Things To Know

In today's airstrikes by the Mirage 2000 fighter planes, the Israel-manufactured Spice/Crystal Maze long-range bombs flattened the terror infrastructure at Balakot, which was used for "advanced terror training".

The Mirage 2000 jet has delta-shaped wings, similar to the French-made Rafale and even India's home-made Light Combat Aircraft (LCA) Tejas. One of the advantages of this design is that its wings have a large surface area, giving it better lift in low speed, and good manoeuvrability and stability in high speed.

In 2011-2012, India signed a Rs 17,547 crore deal (inclusive of new weapons) with France to transform the capabilities of the Mirage 2000.

Two Mirage 2000 were upgraded by Dassault Aviation SA, the French manufacturer of the fighter, in France while the remaining 47 fighters are being upgraded by Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL) in Bengaluru.

The IAF in 1999 had just a handful of laser-guided bombs, and it didn't have the kit to ensure that the bombs would hit high-altitude targets with pin-point precision. Using a combination of modified laser-guided bombs (and unguided 'dumb bombs') mated to Israeli Litening laser targeting pods, the IAF's Mirage 2000 became instruments of death.

The Mirage 2000 was inducted into the IAF in 1985. The 'new' Mirage 2000, redesignated the Mirage 2000 I, is almost incomparable with the original jet due to the host of new systems onboard and the upgrades it has received.

The new weapons the upgraded Mirage 2000 can carry include MICA air-to-air missile, which can engage targets at beyond visual ranges and also at close ranges - one missile for two jobs. In January 2012, the government had signed a $1.23 billion contract with the French firm MBDA for the supply of 450 MICA missiles.

For decades, the IAF has sworn by the capabilities of its Mirage 2000, the only real multi-role counter to the Pakistan Air Force's F-16s provided by the US. With the upgrades, the Mirage 2000 is good to go for another 30 years.

The upgraded Mirage 2000 has the Thales RDY 2 radar, which allows for very long-range engagement of targets in the air and the ability to track and engage targets which are moving on the ground, among other capabilities.
