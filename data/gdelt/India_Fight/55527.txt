After Bangladesh ministers, Japan PM scraps India visit

CAB protests: Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe may cancel India trip

NEW DELHI: The violent anti-CAB protests in Assam put paid to the India-Japan annual summit Friday with the government announcing that PM Narendra Modi’s meeting with his counterpart Shinzo Abe in Guwahati had been deferred to a “mutually convenient date in the near future’’.This is the second major fallout of developments in the past few days related to CAB, which was approved by Parliament earlier this week, after two senior Bangladesh ministers called off their visit to India Thursday. While the government continued to maintain that it had never announced the venue, preparations to hold the summit, which was scheduled for December 15-17, had been in full swing in Guwahati for the past couple of weeks.Also, while there was speculation that the summit could be shifted to Delhi, official sources said there was never any plan to shift the venue. “The simple reason for that is that it would have been impossible to work out the logistics for a summit of this nature at any other place, including Delhi, at such a short notice,’’ said a government source.A Japanese delegation had to call off its visit to Guwahati on Thursday and Indian government officials who had arrived in Guwahati early for the summit remained holed up in a hotel as protesters resorted to violence in the city.The government was left with no choice but to defer the summit after Japan conveyed to Indian authorities that it wouldn’t be possible for Abe to travel to Guwahati in these circumstances. The summit would have allowed Modi and Abe to take stock of bilateral ties and build upon the first India-Japan ministerial 2+2 dialogue last month here.While the summit, as officials said, had only been postponed, it’s not clear when it will happen. The 2020 summit, sources said, will take place late next year in Japan. If the two leaders do have another bilateral summit meeting before that, they would ideally want considerable gap between the two meetings.Abe and then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had in 2006 upgraded the relationship to a Global and Strategic Partnership with the provision of annual prime ministerial summits."With reference to the proposed visit of Japanese PM Abe to India, both sides have decided to defer the visit to a mutually convenient date in the near future," said MEA spokesperson Raveesh Kumar.The MEA last week announced the dates for Abe's visit but did not mention the venue.At least two persons were killed on Thursday after police opened fire on protesters in Guwahati. On Wednesday, protesters pulled down hoardings erected in central Guwahati to welcome Abe.
