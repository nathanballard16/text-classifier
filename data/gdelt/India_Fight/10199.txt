Pakistani civilians were reportedly killed in Kotli village in Pakistani-controlled Kashmir on Wednesday morning. After the reported attack, the India air force intercepted three Pakistani combat jets as they entered Kashmir airspace. It comes a day after an airstrike in Balakot, Pakistan on an alleged terrorist camp.

Tensions have erupted between the two nuclear powers after India attempted to destroy a terrorist camp. Pakistan began shelling using heavy calibre weapons in 12 to 15 places along the de facto border in Kashmir, known as the Line of Control (LoC), a spokesman for the Indian defence forces said on Wednesday. The spokesman said: "The Indian Army retaliated for effect and our focused fire resulted in severe destruction to five posts and number of casualties." Five Indian soldiers suffered minor wounds in the shelling that ended on Wednesday morning, he added.

Local officials on the Pakistani side said at least four people had been killed and seven wounded, though it was unclear if the casualties were civilian or military. Pakistan military reportedly shot down two Indian aircrafts inside its airspace and captured one pilot. One of the aircraft fell on India's side of Kashmir, while the second came down in Pakistani-held territory, and its pilot was captured, he added. The Taliban says India should not carry out any further violence in Pakistan.
