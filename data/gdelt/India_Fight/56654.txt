Convince PM to solve ongoing crisis: 12 BJP MLAs to Sonowal

GUWAHATI: Twelve Assam BJP legislators on Thursday met chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal on Thursday and urged him to convince Prime Minister Narendra Modi to resolve the crisis in the state following the passing of the amended Citizenship Act.The legislators also asked Sonowal to tell people how the state government planned to protect the language and culture of the Assamese people to allay fears and doubts arising out of the amended Act.“We have appealed to the chief minister to come forward with clarity on how he planned to safeguard the Assamese people,” BJP legislator from Sootea, Padma Hazarika, who led the group, said.“We have also urged him (CM) to meet the Prime Minister and resolve the crisis in the state immediately. People of Assam are in fear and so are we (BJP legislators). We could not come out of our homes for eight days since the beginning of the protests,” BJP legislator from Dibrugarh Prasanta Phukan, whose house was attacked by protesters earlier, said.The legislators said the CAA was the party’s policy and they cannot go against it, but there were other ways to protect the culture and language of the Assamese people. “I joined BJP knowing well that the CAA is on the party’s agenda and now I don’t have the moral right to reject it. If me leaving the party would lead to repealing of the Act, I am ready to quit,” Hazarika said.The legislators said they told the chief minister about immediate steps to grant tribal status to the six communities of the state. They urged him to get a resolution passed by the cabinet stating Assamese would remain as the state language forever.Hours later, the chief minister’s office said the state government will submit a recommendation of the group of ministers seeking Schedule Tribe (ST) status to Moran, Motok, Chutia, Koch-Rajbongshi, Tai-Ahom communities, along with the tea tribes of the state, within January.“Moreover, Rs 125 crore would be provided each to Ahom, Chutia, Moran and Motok, covering four districts in the state for generating self-employment opportunities, infrastructure development, preservation of monuments, and archaeological heritage, etc. An autonomous council would be constituted for the Koch Rajbongshi community in the undivided Goalpara district, along with autonomous councils for Moran and Motok communities in the state,” the CM’s office said.Further, an extra seat would also be allotted for the Moran community in a medical college of the state. Funds would be provided by the state government for making a documentary on the life and works of Raghab Morans.The MLAs also urged the chief minister to take strong steps regarding protection of the language, culture and the people of the state, and ensure strong constitutional safeguards in these matters, Hazarika said.
