Maneka Gandhi questions Hyderabad encounter

New Delhi, Dec 6 : Bharatiya Janata Party MP and former union minister Maneka Gandhi has raised questions on the encounter by the Hyderabad police in which four accused were shot dead.

Condemning the encounter, Maneka Gandhi said: "Jo bhi hua hai bohot bhayanak hua hai is desh ke liye (whatever happened is dangerous for the country), you cannot kill people because you want to. You cannot take law in your hands, they (accused) would have been hanged by Court anyhow." She added: "If the justice will be served through trigger then what is the need of courts and police in this country?"

A week after the brutal gang rape and murder of a young veterinarian in Hyderabad, police shot dead all the four accused in an alleged 'encounter'.
