AASU's Bhattacharya called it a failure of all political parties in Delhi or Dispur. He said the parties were unsuccessful in implementing the Assam Accord of 1985. “Detection, deletion, deportation or sealing of the border, nothing has been done by the successive governments,” said Bhattacharya.

In May 1997, Indrajit Gupta, then home minister, had reportedly said there were more than 10 million “illegal immigrants” living in India, of which 40 lakh were in Assam. In a 1998 report, the then Assam governor Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha wrote: “The influx of these illegal migrants is turning these districts into a Muslim majority region.”

In 2004, then minister of state for home Sriprakash Jaiswal told the Rajya Sabha that Assam had over 50 lakh “illegal Bangladeshi migrants”. Today’s NRC publication showed a much lower figure and that has upset the organisations. “We feel that there may be an error in the process and that the updating process is not complete,” Bhattacharya said. “For that, we have decided to go to the Supreme court for remedy. We have full faith in the Supreme Court.” BJP minister in Assam Himanta Biswa Sarma also trashed the NRC results and demanded a re-verification of all the districts in Assam.

I reiterate that as requested by Central and State governments at least 20% reverification (bordering districts) and 10% re-verification(remaining districts) should be allowed by Honble Apex court for a correct and fair NRC. 2/2 — Himanta Biswa Sarma (@himantabiswa) August 31, 2019
