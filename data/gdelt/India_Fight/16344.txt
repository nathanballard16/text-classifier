130 cr Indians wonâ€™t forgive Opposition for insulting forces: Modi blasts Pitroda over Balakot remark

New Delhi:

Prime Minister Narendra Modi slammed the Opposition leaders for demanding proofs of the Indian Air Force’s Balakot air strike. In a series of tweets, the Prim Minister launched a point-by-point rebuttal against those saying that the government must give details of the February 26 air strike. “Opposition insults our forces time and again. I appeal to my fellow Indians- question Opposition leaders on their statements. Tell them- 130 crore Indians will not forgive or forget the Opposition for their antics. India stands firmly with our forces,” Modi said in a stinging against Congress chief Rahul Gandhi’s close aide Sam Pitroda. The Congress overseas chief today sparked a fresh controvbesry after he said, “where’s the proof that 300 people were killed in the air strike in heart of Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The Prime Minister also categorically took on Samajwadi Party leader Ram Gopal Yadav for his Pulwama remark. “Opposition is the natural habitat of terror apologists and questioners of our armed forces. This reprehensible statement by a senior leader like Ram Gopal Ji insults all those who have given their lives in protecting Kashmir. It humiliates the families of our martyrs.”

“Loyal courtier of Congress’ royal dynasty admits what the nation already knew- Congress was unwilling to respond to forces of terror. This is a New India- we will answer terrorists in a language they understand and with interest,” the Prime Minister said on Pitroda saying, “don’t know much about attacks, it happens all the time, attack happened in Mumbai also, we could have then reacted and just sent our planes but that is not right approach. According to me that’s not how you deal with world.”

The Indian Air Force carried out pre-dawn airstrikes on February 26 and destroyed major launch pads of the terror outfit Jaish-e-Mohammed, which was behind the February 14 Pulwama terror attack. The initial reports suggested that the ‘Surgical Strike 2.0’ decimated Jaish-e-Mohammed’s Alpha 3 Control Rooms located in Balakot, Muzaffarabad and Chakothi in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir. More than 10 bombs were dropped by the multi-role fighter jet Mirage 2000 at around 3:30 am on February 26 morning. Understandably, Pakistan has downplayed the airstrike. The aerial attack came day after Union Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a high-level meeting with all three service chiefs.
