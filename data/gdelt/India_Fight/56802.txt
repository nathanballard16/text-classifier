On Friday evening, the judge walked into his office a little after 4 pm and began reading the judgment in eight cases lodged against the 13 accused. He sentenced the four to death.

Defence lawyer Packer Farrukh said he will file an appeal in the high court on Monday when the case goes there for confirmation of the death verdict. “We will challenge the sentence,” he said.

A fifth accused in this case who had sent out the email claiming responsibility for the blasts had been acquitted on Wednesday.

The Jaipur police had arrested five people; three are absconding, two were killed in Batla House encounter and three are in other jails.

The eight locations targeted in the nine blasts – Manak Chowk police station, Badi Chaupad, Kotwali police station, Tripoliya Bazar, Chandpole Hanuman temple, National Handloom in Jauhari Bazar, Chhoti Chaupad and Sanganeri Gate Hanuman temple – were within a 2-km radius.

The nine ammonium nitrate-based bombs that went off within a span of 20 minutes - between 7.20 pm and 7.45 pm - were strapped to bicycles. The explosives were packed with metal splinters or ball bearings to maximize damage in crowded areas. Apart from the 71 deaths, more than 170 people were injured in the blasts.
