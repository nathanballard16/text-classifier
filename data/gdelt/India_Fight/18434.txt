New Delhi: Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Wednesday, said that the Congress party's manifesto favours terrorists and separatists. In a press conference at the BJP HQ, Sitharaman said that diluting the AFSPA would jeopardise the national security set up. In its election manifesto, the Congress party, on Tuesday, announced that it would review the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) and initiate an unconditional dialogue with stakeholders in Jammu and Kashmir.

"Is this right? It is an effort to weaken the Armed forces. They are trying to dilute the immunity of our security forces," Sitharaman said during the press conference. She further said that the Congress manifesto 'undermines' the armed forces.

Congress leader and architect of the Congress manifesto P Chidambaram responded to Sitharaman saying it is the "BJP that has made India vulnerable to terrorist attacks by sitting on two vital initiatives for 5 years".

"Congress wants to dilute the AFSPA and demoralise the Armed forces, limit powers of a District Magistrate. Congress wants to remove Sedition law," Sitharaman said.

Sitharaman further added that the armed forces of the country are fighting with their lives and the mention of AFSPA in Congress manifesto is to 'sensationalise' its offer and 'demoralise' the armed forces.

The BJP has targetted the Congress party over various promises in its election manifesto and said that it is unimplementable. The BJP, on Tuesday, criticised the manifesto saying that the promise to transfer Rs 72,000 in accounts of 'poor' families under the 'Nyay' scheme was dangerous.

Congress leadership, including president Rahul Gandhi, have, however, maintained that the Congress manifesto is implementable by a Congress government.
