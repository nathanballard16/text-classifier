Piers Morgan in furious row with Scottish politician over tweet labelling Winston Churchill a 'white supremacist mass murderer'

P iers Morgan became embroiled in a furious TV bust-up with Scottish politician Ross Greer over his views on Winston Churchill.

The Good Morning Britain presenter invited Green Party MSP Mr Greer onto the show for a debate after he labelled Mr Churchill a “white supremacist mass murderer” in a tweet.

He was responding to a Conservative party tweet marking the anniversary of the wartime Prime Minister's death, labelling him "the greatest Briton to have ever lived."

His post sparked a backlash including from Mr Morgan who ended up calling Mr Greer a "ginger turd".

Today, the TV host accused him of offering “no balance, perspective or any sense that what Winston Churchill did for this country was good.”

He also said if it was not for Mr Churchill, the 24-year-old MSP would be “goose-stepping his way to Holyrood."

But the 24-year-old MSP said the presenter's version of events were “wildly ahistorical” and that it was time to consider different perspectives on the former PM.

Defending his controversial tweet, he added: “Churchill was a man who declared, in his view, the Aryan race would triumph, he described Indians as a beastly people with a beastly religion - and when a mass famine broke out in India, for which he was significantly to blame, the Bengal famine, he said it was their own fault because they bred like rabbits."

He also called Mr Morgan a “snowflake” – a term often used by the GMB host – and “honey glazed gammon.”

Mr Morgan had previously called Mr Greer a “thick ginger turd” and “grotesquely insulting” in their Twitter spat.

Susanna Reid sided with Mr Morgan in the debate, labelling Mr Greer’s comparisons of Churchill with Hitler “really offensive.”
