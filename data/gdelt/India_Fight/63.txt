Tragic end: Indian man returning home after 30 years, dies in accident

Abu Dhabi: South Indian expatriate’s trip to return home after 30 long years turned out to be the last unfortunate journey after he met with a tragic incident on his way to home from the Airport.

Rajan Pillai from the south Indian state of Kerala got killed in the car accident after his car collided with a tourist bus when he was returning home from the Trivandrum International Airport on Sunday.

Mr Pillai used to work at the Sharjah Police department and was returning back to India after working for 30 years in UAE.

Pillai met with the car accident only a few kilometres away from his home in the Kollam district in Kerala within hours after landing in Trivandrum International Airport.

He is survived by his wife Vijayasree. Pillai’s only son, Amal, who came to receive his father too sustained injuries and has been hospitalized.

“We are still in a state of shock. It is hard to believe that he is no more,” said the colleague who met him a week before he left UAE.

“He was happy and looking forward to beginning a new life,” he said.
