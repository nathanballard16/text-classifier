Sara Ali Khan is a mirror image of her mother Amrita Singh and there are no second thoughts about that. If you still think that she looks any different than her actress mom, you’ve got to see this picture shared by Simmba girl on her Instagram. On her Instagram, which she started using off-late, Sara Ali Khan shared a black and white picture with a black Bindi on her forehead. She’s wearing a nose ring and has hair tied into a ponytail. It reminds us of Amrita Singh from Betaab.

Sharing the picture, Sara Ali Khan wrote a quote from Aaron Rodgers, which says, “You have to wake up every day and look at the mirror, and you want to be proud of the person looking back at you. And you can only do that if you’re honest with yourself. Luckily you have an opportunity every single day to write that story of your life. “

The picture seems to be from her debut film Kedarnath, in which she played the role of Mandakini, daughter of a temple priest. As soon as she shared the photo, fans started striking resemblance between her and her mother Amrita Singh.

Designer Masaba Gupta and Alia Bhatt’s mother Soni Razdan were among those commented.
