Hyderabad: The Congress party in Telangana has alleged that Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao tried to 'lure' and 'buy' Congress MLAs even as it decided to boycott the MLC election scheduled for Tuesday. Gudur Narayan Reddy, TPCC spokesperson while speaking with ANI said: "Telangana Chief Minister KCR cannot murder democracy by buying out some MLAs, MLCs or other leaders. KCR doesn't believe in any ethics and he is trying to turn all others unethical."

"In a democracy, victory and defeat are common. It is also common for a party or candidate to win or lose elections," he added. The Congress alleged that the KCR won the last Assembly elections by indulging in various "irregularities" and "EVM manipulation".

"For the sake of a healthy democracy, Congress party accepted defeat and started working for the welfare of Telangana, but KCR remained focused on his way of politics and continued with his unethical practices," said Reddy.

"K Chandrashekar Rao does not want anyone to question his wrongdoings. He wants to rule like a dictator and therefore, he is trying to finish the entire opposition in a systematic manner," he added.

The Telangana Congress on Monday decided to boycott the MLC election scheduled for today, as it accused the ruling TRS and KCR of poaching four of its MLAs and a TDP legislator.
