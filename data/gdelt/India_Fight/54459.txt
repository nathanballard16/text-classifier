Mob attacks former rape accused in Kerala

Palakkad : Dec 7 (IANS) A former accused in the infamous Walayar rape and murder case was attacked by a mob here on Saturday. He was admitted to a hospital after he suffered injuries on his face, the police said.

M. Madhu was the third accused in the rape and murder of an 11-year-old girl at Walayar near here in January 2017, but in October this year he was let off by the court for want of evidence.

According to an eyewitness, Madhu got into a heated argument with a few people over the recent shooting incident in Hyderabad where four rape and murder accused were killed in a police encounter. The argument turned violent and he was beaten up badly which led to injuries on his face.

Madhu's mother alleged that the attackers were BJP activists. Police said they were yet to identify the attackers. An investigation is on.

The Walayar case surfaced in January 2017, when an 11-year-old girl's body was found by her nine-year-old sister in her house. Two months later, the younger girl was also found dead in her home in similar circumstances.

Though the police arrested five persons, the accused were, let off by the court for lack of evidence as the prosecution failed to prove the case against them.
