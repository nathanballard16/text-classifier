New Delhi: The results for Lok Sabha Elections have the entire country excited in anticipation and political bigwigs have kept their fingers crossed. As the Election Commission of India was set for the leviathan process of vote counting, big politicians took to social media to express their thoughts.

Senior Congress leader Shashi Tharoor, a two-time Member of Parliament, contesting from Thiruvananthapuram against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Kummanam Rajasekharan, tweeted that it was D-Day at last, and that the D he talked about was for ‘Deliverance’ for the country.

He went on to say that in the last five years, there had been misgovernance, bigotry and ineptitude. Tharoor also said that the ‘D’ also stood for ‘Disappointment & Despair’ for the countrymen who believed in the idea of an inclusive India.

D-Day at last! Will it be D for Deliverance for the nation from 5 years of misgovernance, ineptitude & bigotry, or D for Disappointment & Despair for all who who believe in #InclusiveIndia, responsible governance, liberal social values & economic justice? pic.twitter.com/DJ7zqCgbEp — Shashi Tharoor (@ShashiTharoor) May 23, 2019

Tharoor, who has always been vocal on social media about his displeasure of the current NDA government, also said that it was a big day for those who wanted to have governance which was responsible, sought social values that were liberal and also wanted economic justice.

The battle for the 17th Lok Sabha has been a bitterly fought one with political parties engaging in an acerbic mudslinging of allegations and counter-allegations.
