Customs agents in Malaysia have seized more than 5,000 turtles from luggage at Kuala Lumpur Airport, along with thousands of pounds worth of drugs.

Senior customs official Zulkurnain Mohamed Yusof said agents found 5,255 baby red-ear slider turtles kept in small baskets in the luggage of two Indian nationals who flew in from Guangzhou, China, on June 20.

He said the men had no permits for the turtles and told investigators that the terrapins, estimated to be worth about £10,000, were meant to be sold as pets in India.

One of them flew in from Hyderabad, India, on June 19 and another on June 20 from Bengaluru, he said.

The two men, believed to be drug mules, are expected to be charged and face the death penalty if convicted.

The red-ear slider is one of the world's most commonly traded turtles meant for the pet and meat markets.

Permits are required as young turtles are susceptible to carrying salmonella and pose health concerns.
