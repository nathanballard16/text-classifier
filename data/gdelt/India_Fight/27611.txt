Akash-1S surface to air missile defense system

India’s state-run Defense Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) tested the latest version of Akash surface to air missile defense system, Akash-1S, on Monday.

The Akash-1S is fitted with an indigenously-made seeker. The missile defense system has the capability to neutralise aerial targets such as fighter jets, cruise missiles and air-to-surface missiles as well as ballistic missiles from distance of 18 to 30 kilometres, ANI reported Monday.

Its advanced ECCM (Electronic Counter Counter Measures) features provide secure communication links with other Air Defence Command and Control networks to handle the counter electronic warfare scenario.

Akash missile system has already been deployed by IAF at its bases in Gwalior, Hashimara, Tejpur, Jorhat and Pune since 2013.

On Friday, DRDO test-fired a domestically-developed 500 kg class guided bomb from a Sukhoi combat jet at Pokhran in the western Indian state of Rajasthan.
