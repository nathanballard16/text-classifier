Fiesty & passionate, Shireen loved to live life on her terms

PANAJI: Not too long after the hippies found this piece of sunshine on India’s West Coast, a Parsi-born woman in her 20s arrived in Goa with dreams of an idyllic life in her eyes and a brush in her hand.By her own admission, Shireen Mody found her way to Goa after being ‘burned out’ in her high-flying job as a designer in an ad agency in London She had grown up watching the Arabian Sea from her ‘privileged’ Malabar Hill home, just the kind of view she would eventually settle for in Goa. By 19, she had dropped out of Elphinstone College and had done the unimaginable for an ‘unqualified’ youngster by working her way up the advertising industry in London, driven purely by ambition and passion.Mody was managing her own commercial studio in London by 1981, when she found herself shooting a rude word at a prized client of the ad agency. It was at this point that she decided to ‘uproot’ herself a second time and arrived in Goa in search of the artist in her, who had painted compulsively as a child, but had been ‘thwarted of an art school’.After over four decades of living in Goa, Mody’s hyper-realistic paintings were overwhelmingly a reflection of everything Goan—from shining palm fronds to the state’s rural women.“A life outside Goa may have been more lucrative for me, but that is far outweighed by the fact that I would probably have died young of stress-related complaints,” Mody had said in an interview in March this year.Recently, she had opened an art gallery Studio Arpora , near where she lived, with her artist daughter Saffron Wiehl. Wiehl was born from Mody’s marriage to her German-architect husband, who has passed away.From Studio Arpora, Mody sold her work privately, working her way around the burgeoning art market. Her mesmerising acrylic on canvas depictions of Goan themes perfectly reflected the calm of her adopted home and these striking works, fortunately, never seemed to be short of purchasers.In fact, her residence was like her own little art gallery, where art connoisseurs would walk in and take their pick.In her beautifully designed house in Arpora, its dominant open spaces literally appearing to pour out into the scenic verdant environs, Mody lived a seemingly enviable life for any fellow SoBo peer.She moved around in a jeep and with ‘cosmopolitan clientele and friends’, Mody never missed out on that side of life either in Goa.“I took my chances moving to Goa when it was an underdeveloped paradise. There was no luck involved. It was a major decision and involved major sacrifices. To anyone attempting the same today, it would be a completely different experience too, pig toilets for example,” Mody had said.In her early days here, she had to transport her art material to Goa all the way from Europe and being seen as an outsider had its challenges too.But nothing could discourage Mody from seeing herself and Goa as one.“My life as a painter was nurtured and contained in Goa. It is the inspiration and theme of all my work,” the artist had said in an interview.Fiesty, passionate and a no-nonsense person, Shireen always chose to live life on her own terms.
