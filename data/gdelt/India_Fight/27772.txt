Pakistan Extends Ban on India Using Its Airspace to 15 June

In February, the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) announced the closure of the country's airspace for commercial flights. The decision was taken after the Pakistani army downed an Indian military jet that had crossed the Line of Control in the disputed Kashmir region.

Relations between India and Pakistan have taken a turn for the worst earlier this year. Tensions soared after a deadly attack in Kashmir on February 14, when a suicide bomber blew up an Indian security convoy, killing over 40 personnel. The attack was later claimed by Pakistan-based terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammed.
