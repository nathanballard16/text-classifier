Mumbai ANC Raid on dance bar: Senior Inspector suspended for ‘failing to prevent illegal activity’

Senior officials said ever since Patil received strict instructions to ensure that there would be no more violations at Golden Goose. This is the first time that the Barve has suspended a police station in-charge for failing to act against illegal activities in his jurisdiction. THE IN-CHARGE of Gamdevi police station, Senior Inspector Gokulsingh Patil, was suspended on Sunday, less than two weeks after the anti-narcotics cell (ANC) raided a dance bar on Grant Road. AdvertisingOn April 27, 51 men were arrested and eight bar girls rescued when Deputy Commissioner of Police (ANC) Shivdeep Lande raided the bar. Previously, he had suspended beat constables after raids on dance bars in Tardeo and Andheri (East) in March.
