New Delhi: Jaish e Mohammad (JeM) terrorist Sajjad Khan, a close associate of Pulwama attack mastermind Mudassir Ahmad Khan, was arrested by Delhi Police Special Cell on Thursday evening. According to agency reports, 27-year-old Khan, a resident of Pulwama was arrested by Delhi Police near the Lajpat Rai market late on Thursday night. Mudassir had been eliminated earlier this month.

"Muddasir, the mastermind of Pulwama attack was killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir recently," Pramod Singh Kushwah, Deputy Commissioner of Police (Special Cell) told PTI. "Sajjad was tasked by Mudassir to establish a sleeper cell in Delhi," news agency PTI quoted an officer as saying.

Earlier, in a joint operation carried out by the Indian Army, CRPF and Jammu and Kashmir Police, Mudassir Ahmad Khan, a 23-year-old electrician, was killed on March 12. Mudassir was the main conspirator of the February 14 Pulwama terror attack which resulted in the death of 40 CRPF personnel on Jammu-Srinagar highway in Jammu and Kashmir.

The security forces have launched a massive anti-terror operation in Jammu and Kashmir following the Pulwama attack, in which a Jaish-e-Mohammed terrorist, one Adil Ahmad Dar rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into a 78-vehicle CRPF convoy. Following the attack, the Indian Air Force (IAF) carried out air strikes at JeM training camps in Balakot in Pakistan.

Pakistan Air Force (PAF) retaliated with an attack, targetting Indian military establishments in Jammu and Kashmir. In the skirmish that followed, IAF brought down a Pakistani F-16 fighter jet. IAF pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who ejected on the Pakistani side of the Line of Control, was handed over to India by Pakistan, two days after his capture.
