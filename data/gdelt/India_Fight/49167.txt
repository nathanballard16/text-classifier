Zakaria urges world to play role on Kashmir

Pakistan’s High Commissioner (HC) to UK Nafees Zakaria has called upon the international community to play their role to deliver justice to the Kashmiri victims and end sufferings of the Kashmiri people.

Reiterating Pakistan’s diplomatic, moral and political support to the Kashmiris at the Black Day function organised by the Pakistan High Commission London, HC Nafees Zakaria said Humanity continues to suffer as the Indian siege of the Occupied Kashmir enters 83rdday.

The High Commission has been regularly observing solidarity with Kashmiris since the siege started on 5th August 2019 with unilateral measures by India to change the status of Kashmir. Today’s expression of solidarity also marked Kashmir Black Day, which the Kashmiris observe on 27th October every year.

HC Zakaria said that 27th October marks the illegal landing of Indian troops in Jammu and Kashmir and the genocide and forcible expulsion of Kashmiri Muslims from Jammu. Maharaja Dogra’s forces with India occupation forces and RSS (Hindu terrorist outfit of India) slaughtered around half a million Kashmiri Muslims and expelled one million from Jammu in 07 days during October/November 1947. Kashmiris observe that genocide as Youm-e-Shuhada-e-Jammu every year on 6 November, he added.
