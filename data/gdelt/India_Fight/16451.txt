EMFA demands stringent action against culprits

Guwahati: Electronic Media Forum Assam (EMFA) expressed serious concern over the brutal attack on city based television journalist Chakrapani Parashar last evening by a group of vendors at Ganeshguri locality and demanded stringent actions against the culprits.

The forum also urged the State government in Dispur to ensure security to media persons with enacting a special protection law at the earliest. It may be mentioned that Chakrapani, who is working for satellite news channel News18/AssamNE, was stabbed by some workers of a restaurant, adjacent to his office, on Thursday (21 March 2019) evening while he was on duty.

Chakrapani got serious injuries in various parts of his body and was subsequently rushed to the hospital where he is recovering. The city police have already detained four accused individuals of the restaurant and they are presently under the Dispur police custody. EMFA maintains that more incidents of physical abuses on journalists are being reported from various localities of India and the Union government in New Delhi should take the matter seriously. Finally the forum appeals to all media persons across the country to get united over the issue of safety & security of media persons.
