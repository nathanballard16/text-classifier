Vicky Kaushal’s Uri has been making a lot of buzz with its release. The film has grossed over Rs 46.24 crore in less than a week and has emerged as the second hit delivered by RSVP after Kedarnath. Vicky essays the role of Vihaan Shergill in the film, and it is based on the Indian army’s Surgical Strike in Pakistan in 2016.

On the occasion of Army Day, Vicky Kaushal, Yami Gautam, and the director of Uri, Aditya Dhar attended the parade and other celebrations in Delhi today. Not only this, Ronnie Screwvala’s production house RSVP also decided to make a donation of Rs 1 crore towards the welfare fund of Army widows.

Recently, the team of Uri had also organised a special screening of the film's trailer for certain army officials to receive their feedback.



Even though the film clashed at the box office with Anupam Kher's The Accidental Prime Minister, it managed to create substantial buzz and had many takers. The reviews were encouraging and so was the reaction of the audience. In fact, the makers of the film received a message from a young fan, that said how she saw a woman in her 80s shouting Jai Hind throughout the film while watching it in the theatre.
