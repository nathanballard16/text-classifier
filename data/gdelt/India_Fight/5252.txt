Hyderabad: Poor sanitation in Old city; claimed MIM MLA

Hyderabad: On Saturday, Yakutpura MLA, Syed Ahmed Pasha Quadri claimed that people of his constituency were forced to live where even dogs cannot survive.

According to the Times Of India report, Mr Qadri, launching a scathing attack on the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC), said such terrible conditions continue to prevail in Yakutpura.

“If you tie a dog in my area, it will die within 24 hours because of the horrible conditions. Unfortunately, people are forced to live where even dogs cannot survive. It’s high time the GHMC improved the standard of living,” Quadri told STOI.

Akberbagh corporator, Syed Minhajuddin also raised the sanitation issue and said, door-to-door collection of garbage was taken up only once in three days.

Not only legislators and corporators from the Old City, even corporators from the other parts of the city expressed serious concern over poor sanitation in their wards.

K Padmavathi, TRS corporator from Bagh Amberpet, wanted to know if the GHMC has an action plan to tackle sanitation and other civic issues.

Ayesha Rubina, Ahmednagar corporator from MIM, said Balkapur nala continued to raise a foul smell, leaving the residents feel miserable.

Meanwhile, the GHMC officials tried to put up a brave front saying keeping the city clean lies with people too.

GHMC commissioner Dana Kishore said, “People dumping thrash in nalas including furniture and no contractors are willing to take up the desilting work.” He said they would invite tenders for desilting the nalas.
