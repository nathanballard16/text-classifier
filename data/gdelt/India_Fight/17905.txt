Indian troops continue firing at civilians

ISLAMABAD: A motorcyclist and his pillion rider suffered grave injuries after Indian troops fired upon them at a village in south Kashmir’s Pulwama district on Saturday.

According to Kashmir Media Service, a police official said that Shahid Farooq, a resident of Pirchoo village and Aqib Ahmad Dar of Ashmander were fired upon by the army personnel when they were crossing a check post in Bandzoo area.

They were immediately rushed to district hospital Pulwama where from they were referred to SMHS hospital in Srinagar for advanced treatment.

Meanwhile, the Acting Chairman of JKLF Abdul Hameed Butt said that curbs, arrests and bans on political organisations cannot suppress the Kashmiris ongoing freedom movement.

Abdul Hameed Butt was addressing the prayers session in connection with the martyrdom anniversaries of prominent martyred Kashmiri freedom leaders, Ashfaq Majeed Wani, Shabbir Siddiqi, Dr Abdul Ahad Guru, Advocate Jaleel Andrabi and Dargah Hazratbal martyrs, which was held at Mazar-e-Shuhada in Eidgah, Srinagar.

He said when curbs, arrests, ban, tyranny and oppression of Britain could not stop India from getting freedom how could Indian oppression stop freedom march of the people of Kashmir? He said JKLF is custodian of peoples struggle nourished by the sacred blood of great legend and shining star, Ashfaq Majeed Wani and great son of soil and scholar Shabbir Siddiqi.

The party’s march towards freedom and self-determination cannot be halted by putting illegal and dictatorial bans on it, he added.
