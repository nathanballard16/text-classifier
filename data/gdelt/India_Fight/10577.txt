Pakistani actress Mahira Khan REACTS to IAF's air strikes across LOC, check out her tweet

New Delhi:

India on Tuesday woke up to the news of Indian Air Force dropping around 1000 kg bombs on Jaishâ€™s terrorist camps in Pakistan in retaliation to the deadly suicide attack on a Central Reserve Police Force convoy in Pulwama on Feb 14. As soon as the news dropped in, Bollywood celebs and other eminent personalities lauded the IAF for giving a befitting reply to Pakistan.

In the wake of rising tensions between Pakistan and India, Pakistani actress Mahira Khan, who was last seen in Shah Rukh Khan starrer Raees, said that there is nothing more uglier than the war, and that she hopes better sense will prevail. Here's what she tweeted:Â

Nothing uglier. Nothing more ignorant than cheering for war. May sense prevail.. Pakistan zindabad. https://t.co/sH0VGGAERC â€” Mahira Khan (@TheMahiraKhan) February 26, 2019

Her tweet was a response to a thread on the Twitter wall of Fatima Bhutto, author and grand-daughter of former Pakistan Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto.

Mawra Hocane, who was seen in Indian film Sanam Teri Kasam, feels it is time to put humanity first. "It is time we understand this as humans. The media needs to take charge and stop being provocative. It's our duty to inculcate peace and use our words for better and not worse. Praying for peace always," she posted.

â€œThere can be NO winners in war if we value Human Life at all.â€œ
