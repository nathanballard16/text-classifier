JSW land issue will be reconsidered, says Kumaraswamy

Ahead of the Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party’s protest from Thursday against the sale of 3,600 acres of land in Sandur to JSW Steel, Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy has decided to reconsider the issue and bring it before the State Cabinet again for a detailed discussion.

He announced the decision on Twitter on Tuesday. “I have discussed the issue of selling land to JSW with Deputy Chief Minister G. Parameshwara and Industries Minister K.J. George today (Tuesday). I have directed them to reconsider the issue and bring it before the State Cabinet for discussion”.

According to sources, the Chief Minister is likely to favour an elaborate discussion by constituting a Cabinet sub-committee for re-examination. This would mean that the decision of the State Cabinet on land sale may be put on hold till a fresh decision is taken, sources in the government said.

The Cabinet is likely to meet on Thursday.

The Cabinet’s decision to sell the land to JSW had provided ammunition to the BJP to launch an attack on the government. The BJP had even suspected a kickback behind the decision and announced that its legislators and MPs would stage a day-and-night dharna in Bengaluru from Thursday.

The move had also embarrassed the coalition government as senior Congress leader H.K. Patil and JD(S) State president A.H. Vishwanath opposed it.

On its part, the government had made it clear that the decision to sell the land was part of an earlier move taken by the then BJP government.
