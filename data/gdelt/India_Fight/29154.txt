New Delhi: Home Minister Amit Shah has sought a 'ground report' from the West Bengal authorities on the incident of violence that reportedly left four people dead in North 24 Parganas on Saturday. According to reports, three BJP workers and one TMC worker lost their lives in the clash.

"Union Home Minister has asked for a report from the state government and I am sure Centre will take this up seriously. There is a lot of anger among the people over the incident," BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya was quoted by ANI as saying.

The confrontation between the two party workers broke out over the removal of party flags in the district. While the TMC has alleged that BJP was behind the firing that took place in the area, BJP has claimed that TMC was targeting their workers in "planned manner."

TMC leader and state food minister Jyotipriyo Mullick told Times of India that party worker Qayum Mollah was attacked when he was attending a meeting at Hatgachhi and was shot from point-blank range.

On the other hand, BJP Bengal general secretary Sayantan Basu identified three BJP workers who were allegedly shot dead by TMC workers. "Our supporters Pradip Mandal, Swapan Mandal, and Sukanta Mandal were killed after TMC workers fired at them," Basu told ANI.

BJP leader Mukul Roy also alleged that four BJP workers were shot dead while one TMC worker was reportedly killed in Saturday clashes.

Widespread violence involving the BJP and the TMC was witnessed during Lok Sabha elections in West Bengal, with both parties trading blame over the issue. The polls have come to an end, but the parties still remain at loggerheads.
