Twelve persons were killed and more than 40 trapped under the debris after a four-storey building collapsed in south Mumbai’s Dongri area today, Maharashtra Housing Minister Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said.

Fire officials said access to the Kesarbaug building at Dongri’s Tandel Street was difficult because of the narrow roads. A team of rescuers from the NDRF assisted by local residents helped remove debris with their bare hands to help pull out survivors as JCB machines were unable to make their way to the collapse structure.

Rescue efforts were going on till late in the evening. “Twelve persons died, while several families are still trapped in the debris,” Patil said. Around 20 persons were pulled out of debris and taken to hospital. Those who were rescued unhurt were taken to a temporary shelter set up at the Imamwada Municipal Secondary Girls’ School nearby. Even ambulances could not access the area and had to be parked 50 metres away.

Officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation said the Kesarbaug building had been declared a dangerous structure in 2012. “We had pasted notices outside the building this year stating that it was in imminent danger of collapse and the civic body would not be responsible if people did not vacate the premises,” a civic official said.

According to officials at the Repair Board of the Maharashtra Housing and Development Authority (MHADA), the building was to have been pulled down and reconstructed by a private developer. However, there was no progress in redeveloping the structure due to the slump in the real estate business in Mumbai. CM Devendra Fadnavis said a probe had been ordered into the building collapse.
