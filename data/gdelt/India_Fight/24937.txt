Opposition to meet President

All the opposition parties that held a dharna at Indira Park, demanding compensation to the families of students who committed suicide after declaration of Intermediate exam results, have decided to meet the President of India, seeking justice.

Telangana Jana Samiti (TJS) president M. Kodandaram said that if the government did not respond to their demands, they would meet the President.

Instead of consoling the families of students, Chief Minister K. Chandrasekar Rao was on a vacation with family, he alleged.

He said Education Minister Jagadish Reddy should immediately resign, taking responsibility for the faulty valuation and processing of results.

Unfortunately, he was busy with elections and not students, he said. Terming the suicides ‘Government murders’, CPI national secretary K. Narayana said only KCR was responsible for them. Mr Chandrasekhar Rao was guilty and that was why he was on a pilgrimage, seeking the blessings of the God. TDP president L. Ramana, CPI State secretary Chada Venkat Reddy and MRPS founder president Manda Krishna Madiga spoke.
