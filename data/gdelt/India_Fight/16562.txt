In Modiâ€™s Kashi, a challenger from Kashmir: Meet Sajad Noorabadi, who wants to defeat PM in LS polls

New Delhi:

Varanasi, the VIP constituency of Uttar Pradesh, will see an interesting battle in the upcoming Lok Sabha elections. Sajad Noorabadi, a political activist from Kashmir, is gearing up for a very special mission. If everything falls in place for the activist, the political rivals in the Varanasi battle will see a lesser known candidate from Kashmir. Noorabadi is out on a mission to defeat PM Modi’s ‘communal ideology’. The 30-year-old comes from Kulgam district of south Kashmir, the hotbed of terror in the Valley.



Talking to News Nation, he said, “I am in contact with some national, regional political parties to secure a ticket for contesting against PM Modi in Varanasi. Everything is in the final stage and everyone is united against Modi’s ideology of hate. I am all set for the campaigning and will be going there soon.”



Earlier, Noorabadi had filed nomination against then chief minister Mehbooba Mufti for the Anantnag bypoll. The Election Commission had cancelled the by-election to the Anantnag Lok Sabha constituency in Jammu and Kashmir, saying the situation is not conducive for conducting polls in the valley as the region is witnessing a spike in violence and protests.



“In case no party gives me a ticket, I will fight as an independent candidate,” he told News Nation. Noorabadi was arrested in 2014 for running election boycott campaign. He says that he couldn’t resist how Gandhi’s secular India was being hijacked. ‘Silence of good people makes the nation suffer’, Sajad says this quote inspired him to join the mainstream. Noorabadi has launched his own party ‘Tehreek-i-Insaaf’ with his friends which is yet to be registered by the Election Commission.



Kashmir is nuclear flash point between India and Pakistan which needs to be resolved immediately through dialogue. “I am out to make sure Kashmiris no more face the heat of this issue. I want the Central government to hear our voice and initiate constructive dialogue with all the relevant stakeholders,” he says.



"My intensions are pure, I am sure there are people of Varanasi will understand my message of peace,” he says. He is hopeful that right-minded people would accept and vote for him.



The polling will be held on April 11, April 18, April 23, April 29, May 6, May 12 and May 19 for 543 Lok Sabha seats across the country in which nearly 90 crore voters would be eligible to vote. Assembly elections will also be held in Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim, Arunachal Pradesh and Odisha simultaneously with the Lok Sabha polls. However, elections for Jammu and Kashmir assembly have been deferred, the EC said citing security reasons.
