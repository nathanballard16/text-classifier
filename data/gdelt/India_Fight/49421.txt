On Day 1 of Kashmir trip, EU MPs briefed by Army, mystery woman

27 European lawmakers to visit Jammu and Kashmir

SRINAGAR: A delegation of 23 EU MPs out of the 27 who were to visit spent an hour being briefed by the Indian Army in Srinagar on infiltration into India and Pakistani ceasefire violations before meeting several delegations, including one from an NGO led by a hitherto unknown woman named Madi Sharma, and local BJP leaders.The EU MPs arrived here on Tuesday — amid a complete shutdown of shops in the valley, massive stone-pelting and clashes with security forces in parts of Srinagar—on a two-day visit to assess the situation after the nullification of Articles 370 and 35A stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and the lockdown that followed. They are here at the invitation of the Indian government. Four EU MPs did not travel to Kashmir and have returned to their countries.The J&K government will discuss with the EU MPs at a dinner hosted by chief secretary B V R Subrahmanyam here Tuesday night “how normal” the situation was during the 86 days of lockdown after J&K’s special status was revoked, sources said, adding that the dinner was hosted at Taj Vivanta Srinagar.No mediaperson was allowed to meet the EU MPs and even state-run Doordarshan was kept away from the delegation, official sources said.Soon after checking in at the Taj Vivanta Srinagar on Kralsangri hilltop, near the Dal Lake , they straightaway went to the Srinagar Army headquarters where the GOC 15 Corps, Lt Gen Kanwal Jeet Singh Dhillion, apprised the EU delegation about terrorist infiltration from across the Line of Control and ceasefire violations by Pakistani troops from time to time. The delegation was also apprised of measures taken by Indian troops to repulse unprovoked Pakistani attacks on border villages, sources said.The delegation later had lunch with top Srinagar-based Army officers at the Badamibagh cantonment here and stayed with the Army for about one hour.The EU MPs then, according to sources, met several delegations, including an NGO named WESTT headed by Madi Sharma, as well as local BJP leaders, at the Lalit Suri Hotel on Gupkar Road here.Talking to reporters later outside the Lalit Suri Hotel, local BJP leader Altaf Thakur said the EU delegation was apprised of the situation in the valley after the nullification of Article 370. “We informed them that the situation is normal in the valley after the revocation of the articles,” Altaf said.Soon after meeting with local BJP delegations and the NGO WESTT, the EU delegation took a round of Dal Lake and after that headed off to the chief secretary’s dinner. The EU MPs were not allowed to go very far out on the lake due to security reasons, sources said.Sources said the police top brass also met the delegation and told them that the situation was normal after the revocation of Articles 370 and 35A compared to incidents in the past.There were reports, meanwhile, of massive stone-pelting in parts of Srinagar city .Youth pelted stones at private vehicles and imposed a complete shutdown of shops and business establishments in the Valley on Tuesday.The miscreants even set ablaze several private vehicles in downtown Srinagar areas to deter people from moving about, sources said. Six youth were injured in various Srinagar localities during clashes with security forces, sources said.Intense clashes were reported from Habba Kadal, Kani Kadal, Hawal, Chanapora and other parts of the city where security forces resorted to tear gas shells to disperse the miscreants.However, despite stone-pelting and clashes in several areas, 65,000 students wrote their Class X board exams on Tuesday.
