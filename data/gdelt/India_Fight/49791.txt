The conditions in which the people of Kashmir are living are unsustainable and must be improved, German Chancellor Angela Merkel told reporters accompanying her to New Delhi. She said she would raise the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. She said that she was aware of India’s position regarding Kashmir and she wanted to hear Modi’s plans for restoring normalcy there. “The situation for the people there is currently not sustainable and must improve,” Merkel said. – Reuters







NEW DELHI: India on Friday sought to add meat to its strategic partnership with Germany by wooing industries to invest in defence corridors of Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh.At their biennial summit in New Delhi, India and Germany also sought to give momentum to revive stalled negotiations for free-trade agreement with the European Union. Proposed in 2007, the negotiations hit a roadblock in 2013 when the two sides arrived at an impasse on tariffs and market access. Disagreements on standards and practices exacerbated the situation and negotiations were shelved for five years. Germany has been an advocate of the deal and welcomed the resumption of negotiations last year.The two sides on Friday, in an indirect message to Pakistan, asked it to root out terror havens and prevent the territory from being used for cross-border attacks.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called upon all countries to work towards uprooting terror infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels, and reining in movement of terrorists.They stressed on the need for stronger international partnership in fighting terrorism and preventing violent extremism through sharing of information and intelligence inputs and being in full compliance with the rule of law, including human rights law and international humanitarian law.The two leaders stressed on a combined effort to fight the global menace and send out a consistent message that terrorism in all forms and manifestations is not acceptable to the international community.Both New Delhi and Berlin acknowledged the need to deepen bilateral defence cooperation as strategic partners to address security challenges. Germany will work towards facilitating export of military equipment as well as technology sharing with India in line with international, European and national rules, said a joint statement issued after the summit. The two sides signed 22 pacts covering sectors spanning from artificial intelligence to energy and economy.Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel called upon all countries to work towards uprooting terror infrastructure, disrupting terrorist networks and financing channels, and reining in movement of terrorists.They stressed on the need for stronger international partnership in fighting terrorism and preventing violent extremism through sharing of information and intelligence inputs and being in full compliance with the rule of law, including human rights law and international humanitarian law.The two leaders stressed on a combined effort to fight the global menace and send out a consistent message that terrorism in all forms and manifestations is not acceptable to the international community.Both New Delhi and Berlin acknowledged the need to deepen bilateral defence cooperation as strategic partners to address security challenges.

The two sides signed 22 pacts covering sectors spanning from artificial intelligence to energy and economy.“We invite Germany to take advantage of the opportunities in defence production in Defence Corridors in Uttar Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. We are encouraging the private sector to give more momentum to our increasing participation in trade and investment. Chancellor Merkel and I will meet some of the leading business and industry leaders from both countries,” Modi said at a joint press meet with Merkel.A deeper cooperation in defence must encourage co-development and co-production under the Make-in-India initiative and take advantage of the defence corridors set up in Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh. Maritime projects between the Indian and German naval industries (e.g. submarines) are encouraged in view of the shared interest in the stability of the Indian Ocean region, the joint statement noted in a subtle message for China whose submarines have been active in the IOR.The two leaders underlined the importance of unimpeded commerce and freedom of navigation in accordance with international law, notably the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) 1982.“Both sides agreed to develop stronger cooperation in defence industry, testing and certification, especially for design certification of various systems and sub-systems and quality assurance. The two sides also agreed that major industries of both countries should endeavour to integrate the SME/MSMEs of the other country into their supply chains,” the statement said.The two leaders welcomed a decision to conduct regular dialogue between the defence ministers of the two countries, alternately in India and in Germany, at least once every two years.As the Indo-German strategic partnership turns 20 next year, the two sides on Friday decided to institutionalise the mechanism of the foreign office consultations to be held every year between the foreign secretary of India and the state secretary of the German Federal Foreign Office. They also established a Track 1.5 Strategic Dialogue that will enable key stakeholders to engage annually in an open exchange of views and ideas to enhance mutual understanding of national, regional and strategic interests and to work out recommendations for joint engagement and action on individual policy areas.“We will intensify bilateral and multilateral cooperation to deal with threats like terrorism and extremism. We are grateful to Germany for the strong support of India’s membership in the export control regimes and various international forums. The two countries will continue their cooperation and efforts to expedite other necessary reforms in the Security Council, United Nations and the international system,” Modi said.Merkel and Modi reiterated that the Indo-German strategic partnership was based on the common values and principles of democracy, free and fair trade, and rules-based international order, as well as on mutual trust and respect. Key issues in the discussions included jointly driving the digital transformation through innovation and frontier technologies, especially artificial intelligence, making economic growth sustainable by cooperating in climate change, creating space for people-to-people contacts through legal mobility for skilled labour, and contributing to a reliable international order by strengthening and updating multilateral institutions.
