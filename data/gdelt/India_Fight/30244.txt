US urges India to condemn acts of violence on basis of religion and hold extremists accountable

The United States has urged the newly re-elected Narendra Modi government to quickly condemn religious violence in India and hold extremists accountable.

Noting that India’s constitution provides strong protections for religious freedom, the US Diplomat for South Asia said: “We look to India’s democratically elected leaders and institutions to swiftly condemn acts of violence on the basis of religion and hold perpetrators accountable.”

Such measures “will help further India’s security and economic interests and strengthen our bilateral relationship,” The State Department’s acting assistant secretary for South and Central Asia Alice Wells was quoted as saying by Dawn.

In February, the US-based Human Rights Watch reported a spate of attacks on Muslim citizens by Hindu nationalist vigilante groups, whose actions were sometimes defended by members of the ruling BJP.

The US State Department’s 2019 country report on human rights practices also highlighted religion and caste based violence in India. It noted that “Muslims and lower-caste Dalit groups continued to be the most vulnerable.”
