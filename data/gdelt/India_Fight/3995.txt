SCOOPS: Kartik Aaryan denies being offered 'Saare Jahaan Se Accha', Jeetendra cancels shoot with Rekha

5/7

Everyone who comes to Mumbai is enchanted by some or the other aspect of the city. Since the time Delhi gal Sanya Malhotra moved to the city of dreams over six years ago to make a career in showbiz, she had been wanting to visit the Gateway of India. However, her khwaish remained unfulfilled for a long time due to her work and travel schedule. Until opportunity arose in the form of a shoot at the landmark venue for an upcoming movie.

We hear Sanya was so excited to finally realise her wish that she reached the venue a couple of hours before her reporting time. And made the most of it by visiting and spending time at the monument. When the feeling of visiting to the historic place had sunk in and she had shot some pictures of herself there, she headed to her film set.
