Vishwa Hindu Parishad Brands Tabrez Ansari Lynching as ‘Conspiracy’

New Delhi: A day after police in Jharkhand dropped murder charges against the accused in the mob lynching of Tabrez Ansari, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) called it a “conspiracy of secularists”. “Tabrez’s post-mortem report released after intensive investigation has not only clarified the reasons for his death but also exposed a major conspiracy of the secular gang,” said VHP Joint General Secretary Surendra Jain. He blamed it on “the Khan Market Mafia, which has repeatedly been maligning Hindu society, India and humanity”. Jain also called them “nourishers” of “jehadi terrorists”. He claimed that “More than 20 temples were demolished due to the campaign launched after Tabrez’s death and at 32 places jihadists made fierce demonstrations and attacked Hindus. (IANS)
