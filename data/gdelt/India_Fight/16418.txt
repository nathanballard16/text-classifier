KOLKATA: Two people were killed and several injured after the engine of the 15904 Chandigarh-Dibrugarh Express caught fire near Chathaat Station near Phansidewa, 18 km from major railhead New Jalpaiguri Junction (NJP) in West Bengal on Friday.

According to local sources, the victims died on the spot after jumping off the train during the melee after seeing smoke billowing from the engine rear and the adjoining first three compartments. The victims are yet to be identified.

The motorman saw the smoke and applied emergency brakes to halt the train, sources revealed. Oil leakage from the engine is stated to be the cause of the fire. Fire tenders from New Jalpaiguri Junction were rushed to the spot and brought the fire under control.

any habitations nearby.
