Around 4.25 am, a motorcycle with two people was seen coming from Nizamuddin railway station side. The motorcyclist was signaled to stop but he tried to flee.

Police chased the motorcycle and blocked the way from both sides. On finding themselves cornered, the two men on the motorcycle fired at police, to which the cops retaliated.

Anil, a resident of Harijan Basti in Khanpur, was hit on the right leg and right hand, while Arun from Maidan Garhi was hit on the right leg. Police recovered two pistols and four live cartridges from them. While the accused fired four rounds at police, the latter retaliated with eight.
