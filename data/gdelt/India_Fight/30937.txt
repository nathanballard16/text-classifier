Kevin P Joseph murder case: Call records doctored, say defence lawyers

KOTTAYAM: Defence lawyers questioned the authenticity of the telephonic conversations presented by the prosecution in the ongoing trial in the Kevin P Joseph murder case at the principal session court here on Wednesday.The lawyers tried to establish that reports from forensic labs were contradictory. But investigating officer denied the allegations.The defence lawyers also argued that the records of phone conversation between first accused Shyanu Chacko and ASI Biju were doctored. The prosecution has been alleging that Shyanu spoke about murdering Kevin during the calls. But all the phone calls between them were not examined, they said, adding that the prosecution has stated that Shyanu chatted with someone whose contact name was saved as ‘Pappa Kuwait’. That person’s phone has not been examined, the defence lawyers argued.The defence lawyers also questioned the authenticity of the CCTV visuals. The forensic lab officials initially said that they cannot examine the footage by separating each visual. Later, they said they can do it. The prosecution has submitted the CCTV visuals as proof of the presence of the accused persons in Mannanam. Forensic lab submitted the new report in the court only after the trial started, they said.The defence lawyers have been arguing that the prosecution could not prove beyond suspicion that Kevin was murdered. An accused can’t be punished based on assumptions, they said. However, the investigating officer told the court that the evidence submitted before court were correct and clear.
